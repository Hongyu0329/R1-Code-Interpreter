    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information given and understand the relationships between the individuals mentioned.\n\n1. **Identify the Key Individuals:**\n   - Jessica: She has 4 sisters and 6 brothers.\n   - Robert: We need to determine how many sisters Robert's brother has.\n\n2. **Understand the Relationships:**\n   - Jessica has 4 sisters. This means there are 5 girls in total (including Jessica herself).\n   - Jessica has 6 brothers. This means there are 6 boys in the family.\n\n3. **Determine the Total Number of Siblings:**\n   - Total siblings in Jessica's family = 5 girls (sisters) + 6 boys (brothers) = 11 siblings.\n\n4. **Identify Robert's Relationship:**\n   - The problem does not explicitly state Robert's relationship to Jessica, but it implies that Robert is one of Jessica's brothers. This is because the question asks about Robert's brother, and the only brothers mentioned are Jessica's brothers.\n\n5. **Determine the Number of Sisters Robert's Brother Has:**\n   - If Robert is one of Jessica's brothers, then Robert's brother is also one of Jessica's brothers.\n   - All of Jessica's brothers (including Robert) have the same number of sisters, which is the number of girls in the family.\n   - Since there are 5 girls in the family (including Jessica), each brother, including Robert's brother, has 5 sisters.\n\nTherefore, the number of sisters that Robert's brother has is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
