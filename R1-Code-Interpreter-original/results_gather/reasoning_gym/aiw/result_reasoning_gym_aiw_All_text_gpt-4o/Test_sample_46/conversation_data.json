    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and connections between Patricia's and William's circles of colleagues, especially focusing on Matilda's connections.\n\n1. **Understanding Patricia's Circle:**\n   - Patricia has 6 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, Patricia's circle consists of 13 people in total (including Patricia herself).\n\n2. **Understanding William's Circle:**\n   - William has 3 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, William's circle consists of 10 people in total (including William himself).\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Patricia and William.\n   - This means Matilda is part of both Patricia's and William's circles.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matilda's Colleagues:**\n   - Since Matilda is part of Patricia's circle, she has 6 male and 6 female colleagues there.\n   - Since Matilda is part of William's circle, she has 3 male and 6 female colleagues there.\n\n5. **Overlap Consideration:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Patricia and William.\n   - Therefore, when considering Matilda's colleagues, we must account for the overlap.\n\n6. **Calculating Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Patricia's circle, Matilda has 6 female colleagues.\n   - In William's circle, Matilda also has 6 female colleagues.\n   - However, since Matilda is the only overlap, the 6 female colleagues in William's circle are the same as those in Patricia's circle.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda has 6 female colleagues in total, as the female colleagues in both circles are the same due to the overlap.\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
