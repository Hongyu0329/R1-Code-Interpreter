    "To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the information given and understand the relationships between the individuals mentioned.\n\n1. **Identify the relationships:**\n   - Jennifer has 2 sisters and 4 brothers.\n   - We need to determine how many sisters Michael's brother has.\n\n2. **Understand the family structure:**\n   - Jennifer is part of a family with 2 sisters and 4 brothers.\n   - This means Jennifer herself is one of the sisters, and she has 2 additional sisters, making a total of 3 sisters in the family.\n   - The family also includes 4 brothers.\n\n3. **Determine Michael's relationship:**\n   - The problem does not explicitly state who Michael is, but it asks about Michael's brother.\n   - Since Jennifer has 4 brothers, Michael could be one of these brothers.\n\n4. **Analyze Michael's brother's situation:**\n   - If Michael is one of Jennifer's brothers, then Michael's brother would also be one of Jennifer's brothers.\n   - All of Jennifer's brothers, including Michael, share the same number of sisters.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of sisters:**\n   - Since Jennifer has 3 sisters (including herself), Michael's brother would also have the same number of sisters.\n   - Therefore, Michael's brother has 3 sisters.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude the answer to the question.\n\n<<<3>>>"
