All these mentioned persons around Patricia are colleagues of each other. Robert has 3 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Robert are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Robert do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Robert and she is also colleague of Patricia, being part of Patricia's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and connections between Patricia's and Robert's circles of colleagues, especially focusing on Matilda's connections.\n\n1. **Identify Patricia's Circle:**\n   - Patricia has 1 male colleague and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Patricia's circle = 1 male + 5 female = 6 colleagues.\n   - Including Patricia herself, the total number of people in Patricia's circle = 6 + 1 = 7 people.\n\n2. **Identify Robert's Circle:**\n   - Robert has 3 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Robert's circle = 3 male + 3 female = 6 colleagues.\n   - Including Robert himself, the total number of people in Robert's circle = 6 + 1 = 7 people.\n\n3. **Understand Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is a unique connection between Patricia's and Robert's circles.\n   - Matilda is a colleague of both Patricia and Robert, meaning she is part of both circles.\n\n4. **Determine Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Patricia's circle, there are 5 female colleagues.\n   - In Robert's circle, there are 3 female colleagues.\n   - Since Matilda is part of both circles, we need to consider the overlap.\n   - Matilda herself is counted in both circles, so we need to avoid double-counting her.\n\n5. **Calculate Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - From Patricia's circle, Matilda has 5 female colleagues (excluding herself).\n   - From Robert's circle, Matilda has 3 female colleagues (excluding herself).\n   - Since Matilda is counted in both circles, we need to ensure we don't double-count her as a colleague of herself.\n\n6. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Matilda's female colleagues from Patricia's circle = 5.\n   - Matilda's female colleagues from Robert's circle = 3.\n   - Matilda is counted in both circles, but she is not her own colleague.\n   - Therefore, the total number of unique female colleagues Matilda has is the sum of female colleagues from both circles, minus 1 to account for Matilda herself being counted twice.\n\nThus, the total number of female colleagues Matilda has is 5 (from Patricia's circle) + 3 (from Robert's circle) - 1 (to avoid double-counting Matilda herself) = 7.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<7>>>"
