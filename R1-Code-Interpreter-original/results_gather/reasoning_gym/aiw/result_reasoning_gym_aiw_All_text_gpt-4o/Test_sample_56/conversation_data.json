    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Number of Friends:**\n   - Linda has 2 male friends and 6 female friends.\n   - Therefore, the total number of friends Linda has is 2 (male) + 6 (female) = 8 friends.\n\n2. **Understand the Relationship:**\n   - All of Linda's friends are friends with each other.\n   - This means each of Linda's friends, including David, is friends with the other 7 people (since there are 8 friends in total).\n\n3. **Determine David's Female Friends:**\n   - David is one of the 2 male friends.\n   - Since all friends are friends with each other, David is friends with the remaining 7 people.\n   - Out of these 7 people, 6 are female (since Linda has 6 female friends).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, David, being one of the male friends, is friends with all 6 of Linda's female friends.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude that David has 6 female friends.\n\nFinal answer: <<<6>>>"
