    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and connections between Linda's and John's circles of colleagues, especially focusing on Matilda.\n\n1. **Identify Linda's Circle:**\n   - Linda has 5 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Linda's circle = 5 males + 1 female = 6 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is the only female colleague in Linda's circle.\n\n2. **Identify John's Circle:**\n   - John has 3 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in John's circle = 3 males + 5 females = 8 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is one of the female colleagues in John's circle.\n\n3. **Understand the Overlap:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Linda and John.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is counted in both Linda's and John's circles.\n\n4. **Determine Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Linda's circle, Matilda is the only female, so she has no female colleagues there.\n   - In John's circle, there are 5 female colleagues including Matilda herself.\n   - Therefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has in John's circle is 5 - 1 = 4 (excluding herself).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda has 4 female colleagues in total, all from John's circle.\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
