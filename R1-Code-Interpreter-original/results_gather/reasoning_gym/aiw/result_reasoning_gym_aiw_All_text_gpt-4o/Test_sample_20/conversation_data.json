    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and the circles of colleagues around Mary and Thomas, and then determine how many female colleagues Matilda has.\n\n1. **Mary's Circle:**\n   - Mary has 4 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues around Mary = 4 males + 3 females = 7 colleagues.\n   - All these colleagues are colleagues of each other.\n\n2. **Thomas's Circle:**\n   - Thomas has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues around Thomas = 4 males + 1 female = 5 colleagues.\n   - All these colleagues are colleagues of each other.\n\n3. **Matilda's Position:**\n   - Matilda is a special case because she is a colleague of both Mary and Thomas.\n   - Matilda is part of Mary's circle, which means she is one of the 3 female colleagues of Mary.\n   - Matilda is also part of Thomas's circle, which means she is the 1 female colleague of Thomas.\n\n4. **Determining Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Mary's circle, there are 3 female colleagues, including Matilda herself.\n   - Therefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has in Mary's circle is 3 - 1 = 2 (excluding herself).\n\n5. **Checking Thomas's Circle:**\n   - In Thomas's circle, there is only 1 female colleague, which is Matilda herself.\n   - Therefore, Matilda has 0 female colleagues in Thomas's circle (excluding herself).\n\n6. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Matilda's total number of female colleagues = Female colleagues in Mary's circle + Female colleagues in Thomas's circle.\n   - Matilda's total number of female colleagues = 2 (from Mary's circle) + 0 (from Thomas's circle) = 2.\n\nTherefore, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
