    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and connections between the colleagues of Mary and Thomas, especially focusing on Matilda.\n\n1. **Understanding Mary's Circle:**\n   - Mary has 3 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues.\n   - Therefore, the total number of colleagues in Mary's circle is 3 (male) + 6 (female) = 9 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is one of these colleagues, and since she is a female, she is part of the 6 female colleagues.\n\n2. **Understanding Thomas's Circle:**\n   - Thomas has 1 male colleague and 1 female colleague.\n   - Therefore, the total number of colleagues in Thomas's circle is 1 (male) + 1 (female) = 2 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is the female colleague in Thomas's circle.\n\n3. **Matilda's Unique Position:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Mary and Thomas.\n   - In Mary's circle, Matilda is one of the 6 female colleagues.\n   - In Thomas's circle, Matilda is the only female colleague.\n\n4. **Determining Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Mary's circle, Matilda has 5 other female colleagues (since she is one of the 6 female colleagues).\n   - In Thomas's circle, Matilda is the only female, so she has no other female colleagues there.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda has 5 female colleagues from Mary's circle and 0 female colleagues from Thomas's circle.\n   - Therefore, the total number of female colleagues Matilda has is 5.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<5>>>"
