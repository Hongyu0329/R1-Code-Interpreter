    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships and connections between Elizabeth's and Joseph's circles of colleagues, particularly focusing on Matilda's connections.\n\n1. **Identify Elizabeth's Circle:**\n   - Elizabeth has 4 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues.\n   - Total colleagues in Elizabeth's circle = 4 males + 2 females = 6 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is one of the female colleagues in Elizabeth's circle.\n\n2. **Identify Joseph's Circle:**\n   - Joseph has 3 male colleagues and 1 female colleague.\n   - Total colleagues in Joseph's circle = 3 males + 1 female = 4 colleagues.\n   - Matilda is the only female colleague in Joseph's circle.\n\n3. **Understand the Overlap:**\n   - Matilda is the only person who is a colleague of both Elizabeth and Joseph.\n   - Therefore, Matilda is counted in both circles.\n\n4. **Determine Matilda's Female Colleagues:**\n   - In Elizabeth's circle, there are 2 female colleagues (including Matilda herself).\n   - Therefore, the other female colleague in Elizabeth's circle is a female colleague of Matilda.\n   - In Joseph's circle, Matilda is the only female colleague, so there are no additional female colleagues for Matilda from Joseph's circle.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Matilda has 1 female colleague from Elizabeth's circle (excluding herself).\n\nThus, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 1.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1>>>"
