    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Characters:**\n   - Margaret has 2 male friends and 1 female friend.\n   - The male friends are James and another male friend.\n   - The female friend is not named, but we know she is a friend of Margaret.\n\n2. **Understand the Relationships:**\n   - All of Margaret's friends are friends with each other.\n   - This means James is friends with the other male friend and the female friend.\n\n3. **Determine James's Female Friends:**\n   - Since James is friends with all of Margaret's friends, and Margaret has 1 female friend, James must also be friends with this 1 female friend.\n\n4. **Consider the Constraints:**\n   - The problem states that they have no other friends aside from each other.\n   - Therefore, James cannot have any additional female friends outside of this group.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - James has exactly 1 female friend, who is the same female friend that Margaret has.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude the number of female friends James has.\n\n<<<1>>>"
