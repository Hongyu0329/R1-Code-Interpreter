    "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Key Information:**\n   - Susan has 3 sisters.\n   - Susan has 4 brothers.\n\n2. **Understand the Family Structure:**\n   - Since Susan has 3 sisters, this means there are 4 girls in total (Susan + 3 sisters).\n   - Susan has 4 brothers, which means there are 4 boys in the family.\n\n3. **Determine the Total Number of Siblings:**\n   - Total siblings = 4 girls (including Susan) + 4 boys = 8 siblings in total.\n\n4. **Identify Joseph's Position:**\n   - The problem asks about Joseph's brother. However, Joseph is not explicitly mentioned in the family structure provided. We need to assume Joseph is one of Susan's brothers.\n\n5. **Determine How Many Sisters Joseph's Brother Has:**\n   - If Joseph is one of Susan's brothers, then Joseph's brother would also be one of Susan's brothers.\n   - All of Susan's brothers have the same number of sisters, which is 4 (Susan + 3 sisters).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, Joseph's brother has 4 sisters.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
