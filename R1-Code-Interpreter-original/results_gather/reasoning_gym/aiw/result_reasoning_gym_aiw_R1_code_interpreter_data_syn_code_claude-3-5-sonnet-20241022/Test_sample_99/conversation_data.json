    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1. Let's understand what we know:\n   * Sarah has 4 brothers\n   * Sarah has 3 sisters\n   * We need to find how many sisters Sarah's brothers have\n\n2. Reasoning:\n   * Sarah's brothers and Sarah share the same sisters\n   * Sarah herself is also a sister to her brothers\n   * So, Sarah's brothers have:\n     * The 3 sisters that Sarah has\n     * Plus Sarah herself as their sister\n\n3. Let's write a simple code to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Sarah's sisters (excluding Sarah)\nsarahs_sisters = 3\n\n# Sarah's brothers sisters will include:\n# - All of Sarah's sisters\n# - Plus Sarah herself\nbrothers_sisters = sarahs_sisters + 1\n\nprint(f\"Sarah's brothers have {brothers_sisters} sisters\")\n```\n\nBased on the calculation, I can now provide the final answer:\n\n<<<4 sisters>>>\n\nThe answer is 4 because Sarah's brothers have Sarah's 3 sisters plus Sarah herself as their sister, making it a total of 4 sisters.",
    "The code execution confirms my reasoning. Let me explain why the answer is 4:\n\n1. From a brother's perspective:\n   * They have Sarah as their sister (1 sister)\n   * They also have Sarah's other 3 sisters as their sisters (3 more sisters)\n   * Total: 1 + 3 = 4 sisters\n\n2. This can be verified by thinking about the total family composition:\n   * 4 brothers\n   * Sarah\n   * 3 other sisters\n   * From any brother's point of view, they have 4 sisters in total\n\nThe code execution produced \"Sarah's brothers have 4 sisters\" which confirms our logical reasoning.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<4>>>"
