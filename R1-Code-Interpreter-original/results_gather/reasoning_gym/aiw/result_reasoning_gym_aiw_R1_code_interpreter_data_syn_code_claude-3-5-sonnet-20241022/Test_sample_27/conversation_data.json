    "Let me help you reason through this problem.\n\nThis is actually a trick question that cannot be solved because:\n1. We know information about Alice's siblings (2 sisters and 1 brother)\n2. But we are asked about Joseph's brother's sisters\n3. There is no connection or relationship established between Alice and Joseph in the question\n4. We cannot determine how many sisters Joseph's brother has because we have no information about Joseph's family\n\nTherefore, this question cannot be solved with the given information. There is no need for code computation in this case as it's a logical reasoning problem.\n\n<<<Cannot be determined - No information is provided about Joseph's family>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice has 2 sisters and she also has 1 brothers.
