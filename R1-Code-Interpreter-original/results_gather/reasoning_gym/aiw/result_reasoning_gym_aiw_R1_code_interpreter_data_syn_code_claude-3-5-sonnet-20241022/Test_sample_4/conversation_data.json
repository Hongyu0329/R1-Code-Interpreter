    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1. Let's understand what we know:\n   * Mary has 1 brother\n   * Mary has 1 sister\n   * We need to find how many sisters Mary's brother has\n\n2. Reasoning:\n   * Mary's brother is part of the same family\n   * Mary's brother's sisters would include:\n     - Mary herself (she is his sister)\n     - Mary's sister (who is also his sister)\n   * Therefore, Mary's brother has 2 sisters in total:\n     - Mary\n     - Mary's sister\n\nThis is a simple logical problem that doesn't require complex computation, but let's verify it with a simple code to make it clear:\n\n```python\n# Define family members\nmary = \"Mary\"\nmary_brothers = 1\nmary_sisters = 1\n\n# Calculate brother's sisters\nbrothers_sisters = 1 + mary_sisters  # Mary + her sister\n\nprint(f\"{mary}'s brother has {brothers_sisters} sisters\")\n```\n\nBased on the reasoning and code verification:\n\n<<<2 sisters>>>",
    "The code output confirms our logical reasoning. Let me explain why the answer is 2 sisters:\n\n1. When counting how many sisters Mary's brother has, we need to include:\n   * Mary herself (she is a sister to her brother)\n   * Mary's sister (who is also a sister to the brother)\n   * 1 + 1 = 2 sisters total\n\nThe code execution validated our answer by showing that Mary's brother has 2 sisters, which matches our logical deduction.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently maintain my answer:\n\n<<<2 sisters>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Mary has 1 brothers and she also has 1 sisters.
