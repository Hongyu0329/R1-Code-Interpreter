  "question": "Sarah has 5 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Sarah has. All these mentioned persons around Sarah are colleagues of each other. John has 2 male colleagues and 4 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around John are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around John do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of John and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Sarah has 10 colleagues in total (5 male + 5 female)\n   * John has 6 colleagues in total (2 male + 4 female)\n   * Matilda is in both circles (Sarah's and John's)\n   * All people in each circle are colleagues of each other\n   * People in John's circle don't have other colleagues except Matilda\n\n2) Let's write code to help us analyze this:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_colleagues():\n    # Sarah's circle (including Sarah)\n    sarah_males = 5\n    sarah_females = 5  # excluding Sarah herself\n    \n    # John's circle (including John)\n    john_males = 2     # excluding John himself\n    john_females = 4\n    \n    # We know Matilda is in both circles\n    # Let's count Matilda's female colleagues:\n    \n    # From Sarah's circle:\n    # All females in Sarah's circle (excluding Matilda herself)\n    females_from_sarah = sarah_females - 1  # -1 for Matilda\n    \n    # From John's circle:\n    # All females in John's circle (excluding Matilda herself)\n    females_from_john = john_females - 1    # -1 for Matilda\n    \n    # Since people in John's circle don't have other colleagues\n    # (except Matilda), the females in John's circle are a subset\n    # of the females in Sarah's circle\n    \n    # Total female colleagues of Matilda:\n    total_females = females_from_sarah\n    \n    print(f\"Matilda has {total_females} female colleagues\")\n\nanalyze_colleagues()\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output:\n* In Sarah's circle, there are 5 female colleagues (excluding Sarah)\n* Since Matilda is one of these females, there are 4 other females in Sarah's circle\n* The females in John's circle must be part of Sarah's circle (as they can't have other colleagues)\n* Therefore, Matilda has 4 female colleagues in total\n\n<<<4>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis. Let me verify that this answer is correct by double-checking the logic:\n\n1) From Sarah's circle:\n   * Sarah has 5 female colleagues (including Matilda)\n   * This means there are 4 other females besides Matilda\n\n2) From John's circle:\n   * John has 4 female colleagues (including Matilda)\n   * This means there are 3 other females besides Matilda\n   * These females must be part of Sarah's circle because John's circle people can't have outside colleagues (except Matilda)\n\n3) Therefore:\n   * All of Matilda's female colleagues must be in Sarah's circle\n   * There are 4 females in Sarah's circle (excluding Matilda herself)\n   * These are all of Matilda's female colleagues\n\nThe code output and our logical reasoning both confirm that Matilda has 4 female colleagues.\n\n<<<4>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Sarah has 5 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues.
