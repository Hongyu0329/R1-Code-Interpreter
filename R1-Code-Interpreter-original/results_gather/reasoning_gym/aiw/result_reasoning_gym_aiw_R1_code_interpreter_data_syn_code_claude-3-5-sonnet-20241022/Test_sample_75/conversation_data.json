    "Let me think about this problem:\n\n1. This is actually a logical reasoning question, not a computational one.\n2. We are given information about Margaret's siblings:\n   * Margaret has 4 sisters\n   * Margaret has 4 brothers\n3. However, we are asked about Bob's brother's sisters\n4. There is no connection given between Margaret and Bob\n5. Therefore, we cannot determine how many sisters Bob's brother has based on the information about Margaret's siblings\n6. This is a classic misdirection question where information about Margaret is irrelevant to answering the question about Bob's brother\n\nSince there is no relationship established between Margaret and Bob, and we have no information about Bob's family, it's impossible to determine how many sisters Bob's brother has.\n\n<<<Cannot be determined from the given information>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Margaret has 4 sisters and she also has 4 brothers.
