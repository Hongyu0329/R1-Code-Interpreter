  "question": "Susan has 2 male colleagues and she also has 4 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Susan has. All these mentioned persons around Susan are colleagues of each other. Charles has 4 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Charles and she is also colleague of Susan, being part of Susan's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Susan has 2 male and 4 female colleagues (total 6)\n   * Charles has 4 male and 6 female colleagues (total 10)\n   * Matilda is in both circles (connected to both Susan and Charles)\n   * All people in each circle are colleagues of each other\n   * No one has other colleagues outside their circle(s) except Matilda\n\n2) Let's write code to help us analyze this:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_colleagues():\n    # Known facts\n    susan_males = 2\n    susan_females = 4\n    charles_males = 4\n    charles_females = 6\n    \n    # Since Matilda is female and in both circles\n    # In Susan's circle:\n    # - Matilda is one of the 4 females\n    # - The other 3 females and 2 males are unique to Susan's circle\n    \n    # In Charles's circle:\n    # - Matilda is one of the 6 females\n    # - The other 5 females and 4 males are unique to Charles's circle\n    \n    # Matilda's colleagues:\n    # From Susan's circle: 2 males + 3 females (excluding herself)\n    # From Charles's circle: 4 males + 5 females (excluding herself)\n    # Total unique females = 3 (from Susan) + 5 (from Charles) = 8\n    \n    matilda_female_colleagues = 8\n    print(f\"Matilda has {matilda_female_colleagues} female colleagues\")\n    \nanalyze_colleagues()\n```\n\nLet's break down why this is correct:\n1) In Susan's circle, Matilda is one of the 4 females, so there are 3 other females\n2) In Charles's circle, Matilda is one of the 6 females, so there are 5 other females\n3) Since these circles are separate (except for Matilda), these females are different people\n4) Therefore, Matilda's total female colleagues = 3 (from Susan's circle) + 5 (from Charles's circle) = 8\n\n<<<8>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis. Let me verify that this is indeed the correct answer:\n\n1) The code correctly calculated that Matilda has 8 female colleagues by:\n   * Counting 3 females from Susan's circle (excluding Matilda herself)\n   * Counting 5 females from Charles's circle (excluding Matilda herself)\n   * Adding these numbers together (3 + 5 = 8)\n\n2) This makes sense because:\n   * The circles are separate except for Matilda\n   * No one has colleagues outside their circle(s) except Matilda\n   * We've accounted for Matilda being part of both circles\n   * We've made sure not to count Matilda herself as her own colleague\n\nTherefore, I can confidently confirm that the answer is correct.\n\n<<<8>>>"
