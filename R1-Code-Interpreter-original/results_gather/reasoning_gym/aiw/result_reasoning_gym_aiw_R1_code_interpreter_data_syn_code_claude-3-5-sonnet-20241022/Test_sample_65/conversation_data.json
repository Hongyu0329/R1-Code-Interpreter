    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Barbara has 5 brothers\n   * Barbara has 1 sister\n   * We need to find how many sisters Barbara's brothers have\n\n2) Let's think about it:\n   * Barbara's brothers and Barbara share the same sisters\n   * Barbara herself is also a sister to her brothers\n   * So, Barbara's brothers have:\n     * The 1 sister that Barbara has (their sister)\n     * Plus Barbara herself (also their sister)\n\n3) Let's verify this with a simple Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given information\nbarbara_brothers = 5\nbarbara_sisters = 1\n\n# Calculate sisters from brothers' perspective\nsisters_of_brothers = barbara_sisters + 1  # Adding Barbara herself\n\nprint(f\"Barbara's brothers have {sisters_of_brothers} sisters\")\n```\n\n4) After running this code, we can confirm that Barbara's brothers have 2 sisters:\n   * One is Barbara herself\n   * One is Barbara's sister\n\n<<<2>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my reasoning. \n\nLet me explain why the answer is 2:\n1. From Barbara's brothers' perspective, they have:\n   * Barbara herself as their sister (1 sister)\n   * Plus Barbara's sister, who is also their sister (1 more sister)\n   * Total: 1 + 1 = 2 sisters\n\nThe code helped us verify this by:\n1. Taking the number of Barbara's sisters (1)\n2. Adding Barbara herself (1)\n3. Giving us the total number of sisters that Barbara's brothers have (2)\n\nThe answer remains confirmed as:\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
