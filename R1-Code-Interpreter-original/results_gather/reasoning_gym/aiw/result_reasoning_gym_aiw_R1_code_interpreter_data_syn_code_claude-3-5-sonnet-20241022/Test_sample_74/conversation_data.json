  "question": "Jessica has 5 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Jessica has. All these mentioned persons around Jessica are colleagues of each other. James has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around James are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around James do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of James and she is also colleague of Jessica, being part of Jessica's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Jessica has 10 colleagues in total (5 male + 5 female)\n   * James has 5 colleagues in total (4 male + 1 female)\n   * Matilda is the connection between both circles\n   * Matilda is a female colleague of both James and Jessica\n   * All people in each circle are colleagues of each other\n\n2) Let's write code to help us analyze this:\n\n```python\n# Define sets for Jessica's and James' circles\njessica_males = 5\njessica_females = 5\njames_males = 4\njames_females = 1\n\n# We know Matilda is in both circles and is female\n# So in Jessica's circle:\n# - Matilda is one of the 5 females\n# In James' circle:\n# - Matilda is the 1 female\n\n# Calculate Matilda's female colleagues:\n# From Jessica's circle: all females except herself\nmatilda_females_from_jessica = jessica_females - 1\n\n# From James' circle: no additional females (as Matilda is the only female)\nmatilda_females_from_james = 0\n\n# Total female colleagues of Matilda\ntotal_female_colleagues = matilda_females_from_jessica + matilda_females_from_james\n\nprint(f\"Matilda has {total_female_colleagues} female colleagues\")\n```\n\nLet's analyze the result:\n* In Jessica's circle, Matilda has 4 female colleagues (5 females total - herself)\n* In James' circle, Matilda has no additional female colleagues (she is the only female)\n* Therefore, Matilda has 4 female colleagues in total\n\n<<<4>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my reasoning. Let me explain why 4 is the correct answer:\n\n1) In Jessica's circle:\n   * There are 5 female colleagues in total\n   * Matilda is one of these females\n   * Therefore, Matilda has 4 other female colleagues in Jessica's circle\n\n2) In James' circle:\n   * There is only 1 female colleague (which is Matilda herself)\n   * Therefore, Matilda has no additional female colleagues from James' circle\n\n3) Since we're asked about Matilda's total female colleagues:\n   * We add the female colleagues from both circles\n   * 4 (from Jessica's circle) + 0 (from James' circle) = 4 total female colleagues\n\nThe code execution verified this calculation, confirming that Matilda has 4 female colleagues in total.\n\n<<<4>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jessica has 5 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues.
