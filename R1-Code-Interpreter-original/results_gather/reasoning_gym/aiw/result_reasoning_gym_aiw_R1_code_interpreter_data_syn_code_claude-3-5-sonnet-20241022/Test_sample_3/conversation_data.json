    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Jennifer has 2 male friends\n   * Jennifer has 3 female friends\n   * All these friends are friends with each other\n   * David is one of Jennifer's male friends\n\n2) Since all friends are friends with each other:\n   * David, being a male friend of Jennifer, is friends with:\n     - Jennifer\n     - The other male friend\n     - All 3 female friends\n\n3) Therefore, among David's friends:\n   * Number of female friends = 3 (all of Jennifer's female friends)\n\nLet me verify this with a simple code that models the friendship network:\n\n```python\n# Create sets of friends\njennifer_male_friends = 2\njennifer_female_friends = 3\n\n# David is one of the male friends\ndavid_female_friends = jennifer_female_friends  # Since all are friends with each other\n\nprint(f\"David has {david_female_friends} female friends\")\n```\n\nBased on the code execution and our logical reasoning:\n\n<<<3>>>",
    "The code output confirms our logical reasoning. Let me explain why this answer is correct:\n\n1. The code modeled the simple fact that since all friends are connected to each other, David (being one of Jennifer's male friends) must be friends with all of Jennifer's female friends.\n\n2. We know this is correct because:\n   * Jennifer has 3 female friends\n   * All friends are friends with each other (complete friendship network)\n   * Therefore, David must be friends with all 3 of Jennifer's female friends\n\nThe code output matches our logical deduction that David has 3 female friends.\n\n<<<3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jennifer has 2 male friends and she also has 3 female friends.
