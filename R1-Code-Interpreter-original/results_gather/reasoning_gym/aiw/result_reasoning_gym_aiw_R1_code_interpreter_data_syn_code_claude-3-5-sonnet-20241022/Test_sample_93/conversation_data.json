Charles has 6 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda.

    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Linda has 3 male and 5 female colleagues (8 total)\n   * Charles has 6 male and 2 female colleagues (8 total)\n   * Matilda is in both circles (Linda's and Charles')\n   * All people in each circle are colleagues of each other\n   * Matilda is the only person who appears in both circles\n\n2) Let's write code to help us analyze this:\n\n```python\n# Linda's circle (including Linda)\nlinda_males = 3\nlinda_females = 5  # This includes Matilda\n\n# Charles's circle (including Charles)\ncharles_males = 6\ncharles_females = 2  # This includes Matilda\n\n# Since Matilda is in both circles and is female\n# Let's calculate Matilda's colleagues:\n\n# In Linda's circle:\n# - All males in Linda's circle (3)\n# - All females in Linda's circle except herself (5-1 = 4)\nmatilda_from_linda = linda_males + (linda_females - 1)\n\n# In Charles's circle:\n# - All males in Charles's circle (6)\n# - All females in Charles's circle except herself (2-1 = 1)\nmatilda_from_charles = charles_males + (charles_females - 1)\n\n# Total female colleagues of Matilda:\n# From Linda's circle: linda_females - 1 (excluding herself)\n# From Charles's circle: charles_females - 1 (excluding herself)\nmatilda_female_colleagues = (linda_females - 1) + (charles_females - 1)\n\nprint(f\"Matilda has {matilda_female_colleagues} female colleagues\")\n```\n\nNow, let's analyze the result:\n* In Linda's circle, Matilda has 4 female colleagues (5 females - herself)\n* In Charles's circle, Matilda has 1 female colleague (2 females - herself)\n* Since these are separate circles (except for Matilda), we add these numbers\n\nTherefore, Matilda has 5 female colleagues in total.\n\n<<<5>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis. Let me verify that this answer is correct by double-checking the logic:\n\n1) In Linda's circle:\n   * There are 5 female colleagues total (including Matilda)\n   * Therefore, Matilda has 4 female colleagues in this circle\n\n2) In Charles's circle:\n   * There are 2 female colleagues total (including Matilda)\n   * Therefore, Matilda has 1 female colleague in this circle\n\n3) Since these are separate circles (with Matilda being the only overlap):\n   * Total female colleagues = 4 (from Linda's circle) + 1 (from Charles's circle) = 5\n\nThe answer is confirmed to be correct.\n\n<<<5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
