  "question": "Margaret has 6 male colleagues and she also has 3 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Margaret has. All these mentioned persons around Margaret are colleagues of each other. Thomas has 1 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Thomas are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Thomas do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Thomas and she is also colleague of Margaret, being part of Margaret's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Margaret's circle: 6 males + 3 females (including Matilda) + Margaret herself\n   * Thomas's circle: 1 male + 6 females (including Matilda) + Thomas himself\n   * Matilda is in both circles\n   * All people in each circle are colleagues of each other\n   * No other colleagues exist except for Matilda's connection between circles\n\n2) To find Matilda's female colleagues:\n   * We need to count unique females from both circles\n   * In Margaret's circle: 2 females (excluding Matilda) + Margaret\n   * In Thomas's circle: 5 females (excluding Matilda)\n   * Total = unique count of (2 + 1 + 5)\n\nLet's write code to help us visualize and verify this:\n\n```python\n# Margaret's circle (excluding Matilda)\nmargaret_circle_females = 2  # 3 females - Matilda\nmargaret_herself = 1\n\n# Thomas's circle (excluding Matilda)\nthomas_circle_females = 5  # 6 females - Matilda\n\n# Total female colleagues of Matilda\ntotal_female_colleagues = margaret_circle_females + margaret_herself + thomas_circle_females\n\nprint(f\"Matilda's female colleagues: {total_female_colleagues}\")\n```\n\nBased on the calculation:\n* From Margaret's circle: 2 other females + Margaret = 3\n* From Thomas's circle: 5 other females\n* Total = 8 female colleagues\n\n<<<8>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my reasoning. Let me verify that this answer is correct by double-checking the logic:\n\n1) Matilda's female colleagues come from two circles:\n\n   In Margaret's circle:\n   * Total females = 3 (excluding Margaret)\n   * Minus Matilda herself = 2 females\n   * Plus Margaret = 3 female colleagues from this circle\n\n   In Thomas's circle:\n   * Total females = 6\n   * Minus Matilda herself = 5 female colleagues from this circle\n\n2) Since these are separate circles (except for Matilda), and we're told there are no other colleagues outside these circles, we can simply add:\n   * 3 (from Margaret's circle) + 5 (from Thomas's circle) = 8 total female colleagues\n\nThe code output confirms this calculation, and there's no overlap to consider since the circles are separate (except for Matilda herself, whom we've already accounted for by subtracting her from both counts).\n\n<<<8>>>"
