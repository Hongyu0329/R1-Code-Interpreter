    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Sarah has 3 male friends and 3 female friends\n   * All these friends are friends with each other\n   * Michael is one of Sarah's male friends\n   * We need to find how many female friends Michael has\n\n2) Let's analyze:\n   * Since all friends are friends with each other, Michael (being one of Sarah's male friends) is friends with:\n     - All of Sarah's female friends (3 female friends)\n     - All other male friends of Sarah (2 other male friends, excluding himself)\n\n3) Let's verify this with a simple code that creates a network of friends and counts connections:\n\n```python\n# Create sets of friends\nsarah_male_friends = {'Michael', 'Male2', 'Male3'}\nsarah_female_friends = {'Female1', 'Female2', 'Female3'}\n\n# For Michael, count his female friends\nmichael_female_friends = sarah_female_friends  # Michael is friends with all Sarah's female friends\n\nprint(f\"Michael has {len(michael_female_friends)} female friends\")\n```\n\n4) Based on the network structure and the code verification:\n   * Michael is friends with all of Sarah's female friends\n   * Therefore, Michael has 3 female friends\n\n<<<3>>>",
    "The code output confirms my reasoning. \n\nLet me explain why the answer is 3:\n1) Since all friends in the group are friends with each other, this creates a complete graph where everyone is connected to everyone else.\n2) Michael, being one of Sarah's male friends, is automatically connected to (friends with) all of Sarah's female friends.\n3) The code created two sets representing Sarah's male and female friends, and showed that Michael is connected to all 3 female friends.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently confirm my answer.\n\n<<<3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Sarah has 3 male friends and she also has 3 female friends.
