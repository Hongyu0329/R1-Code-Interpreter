    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Elizabeth has 4 male friends (including Bob)\n   * Elizabeth has 6 female friends\n   * All these friends are friends with each other\n   * They have no other friends outside this group\n\n2) Since Bob is one of Elizabeth's male friends, and all friends are friends with each other:\n   * Bob is friends with all of Elizabeth's female friends\n   * Therefore, Bob has 6 female friends (all of Elizabeth's female friends)\n\nThis is actually a simple problem that doesn't require complex computation, but let me verify this with a code that models the friendship network:\n\n```python\n# Create sets of friends\nmale_friends = set(range(4))  # 4 male friends (0 to 3)\nfemale_friends = set(range(4, 10))  # 6 female friends (4 to 9)\n\n# Let's say Bob is male friend #0\nbob_id = 0\n\n# Count Bob's female friends (which are all female friends)\nbobs_female_friends = len(female_friends)\n\nprint(f\"Bob has {bobs_female_friends} female friends\")\n```\n\nBased on the code verification and our logical reasoning:\n\n<<<6>>>",
    "The code output confirms our logical reasoning. The answer is correct.\n\nTo explain why this is 6:\n1) In the given friend network, everyone is friends with everyone else\n2) Bob, being one of Elizabeth's male friends, is automatically friends with all of Elizabeth's female friends\n3) Elizabeth has exactly 6 female friends\n4) Therefore, Bob must have exactly 6 female friends\n\nThe code helped us verify this by:\n1) Creating a set of male friends (including Bob)\n2) Creating a set of female friends\n3) Since we know all friends are connected to each other, Bob is connected to all female friends\n4) Counting Bob's female friends gives us 6\n\nThe answer remains:\n\n<<<6>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Elizabeth has 4 male friends and she also has 6 female friends.
