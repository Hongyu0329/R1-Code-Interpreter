    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Sarah has 1 male friend (William)\n   * Sarah has 6 female friends\n   * All of Sarah's friends are friends with each other\n   * They have no other friends outside this group\n\n2) Since William is Sarah's male friend, and all of Sarah's friends are friends with each other:\n   * William must be friends with all of Sarah's female friends\n   * Therefore, William has 6 female friends (all of Sarah's female friends)\n\nThis is a straightforward logical deduction, but let's verify it with a simple code that models the friendship network:\n\n```python\n# Create a class to represent the friendship network\nclass FriendshipNetwork:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.sarah_male_friends = 1  # William\n        self.sarah_female_friends = 6\n        \n    def get_william_female_friends(self):\n        # Since all Sarah's friends are friends with each other,\n        # William is friends with all Sarah's female friends\n        return self.sarah_female_friends\n\n# Create the network and calculate\nnetwork = FriendshipNetwork()\nwilliam_female_friends = network.get_william_female_friends()\nprint(f\"William has {william_female_friends} female friends\")\n```\n\nBased on both logical reasoning and code verification:\n\n<<<6>>>",
    "The code output confirms our logical reasoning. The answer is correct and matches our analysis.\n\nTo break down why this is the answer:\n1. Sarah has 6 female friends\n2. All of Sarah's friends are friends with each other\n3. William, being Sarah's male friend, must be friends with all of Sarah's female friends\n4. Therefore, William has exactly 6 female friends\n\nThe code helped us verify this by modeling the friendship network and showing that William's female friends count equals Sarah's female friends count (6).\n\n<<<6>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Sarah has 1 male friends and she also has 6 female friends.
