    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Linda has 2 male friends and 1 female friend\n   * Everyone in this group is friends with each other\n   * Bob is one of Linda's male friends\n   * We need to find how many female friends Bob has\n\n2) Let's visualize this as a network problem:\n   * Linda (female)\n   * Bob (male)\n   * Another male friend\n   * One female friend\n\n3) Since everyone is friends with each other:\n   * Bob is friends with:\n     - Linda (female)\n     - The other male friend\n     - Linda's female friend\n\n4) Therefore, Bob has 2 female friends:\n   - Linda\n   - Linda's female friend\n\nLet me verify this with a simple code that models the friendship network:\n\n```python\n# Create sets of males and females\nfemales = {'Linda', 'Female_Friend'}\nmales = {'Bob', 'Other_Male'}\n\n# Create a function to count female friends of a person\ndef count_female_friends(person, females, males):\n    # If the person is male, they are friends with all females\n    # If the person is female, they are friends with all females except themselves\n    if person in males:\n        return len(females)\n    else:\n        return len(females) - 1\n\n# Count Bob's female friends\nbob_female_friends = count_female_friends('Bob', females, males)\nprint(f\"Bob has {bob_female_friends} female friends\")\n```\n\nBased on the logical reasoning and code verification:\n\n<<<2>>>",
    "The code output confirms my logical reasoning. Let me explain why the answer is 2:\n\n1) The code created two sets:\n   * females = {'Linda', 'Female_Friend'}\n   * males = {'Bob', 'Other_Male'}\n\n2) When we counted Bob's female friends, we found that:\n   * Bob is friends with Linda (female)\n   * Bob is friends with Linda's female friend\n   * Total = 2 female friends\n\n3) This makes sense because:\n   * The problem stated that everyone is friends with each other\n   * There are only two females in the entire friend group\n   * Bob, being part of the friend group, must be friends with both females\n\nThe code output \"Bob has 2 female friends\" confirms our answer.\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Linda has 2 male friends and she also has 1 female friends.
