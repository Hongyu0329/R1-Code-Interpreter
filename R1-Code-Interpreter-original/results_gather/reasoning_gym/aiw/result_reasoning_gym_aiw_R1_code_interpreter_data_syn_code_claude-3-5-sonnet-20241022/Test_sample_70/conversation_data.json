    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1. Let's understand what we know:\n   * Margaret has 2 brothers\n   * Margaret has 5 sisters\n   * We need to find how many sisters Margaret's brothers have\n\n2. Reasoning:\n   * Margaret's brothers share the same siblings as Margaret\n   * Margaret's brothers would have all of Margaret's sisters as their sisters\n   * Margaret herself would also be a sister to her brothers\n   * So, Margaret's brothers have Margaret (1) plus Margaret's sisters (5) as their sisters\n\n3. Let's write a simple code to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Given information\nmargaret_brothers = 2\nmargaret_sisters = 5\n\n# Calculate sisters of Margaret's brothers\n# This includes Margaret herself plus her sisters\nsisters_of_brothers = 1 + margaret_sisters  # 1 represents Margaret herself\n\nprint(f\"Margaret's brothers have {sisters_of_brothers} sisters\")\n```\n\nBased on the calculation, I can now provide the final answer:\n\n<<<6 sisters>>>\n\nThe answer is 6 because Margaret's brothers have:\n* Margaret herself (1 sister)\n* Plus all of Margaret's sisters (5 sisters)\n* Total: 1 + 5 = 6 sisters",
    "The code execution confirms my reasoning. Let me verify the answer one final time:\n\n1. Each of Margaret's brothers has:\n   * Margaret as their sister (1)\n   * All of Margaret's sisters as their sisters (5)\n   * Total: 1 + 5 = 6 sisters\n\nThe code output matches our logical reasoning, confirming that Margaret's brothers have 6 sisters.\n\n<<<6>>>"
