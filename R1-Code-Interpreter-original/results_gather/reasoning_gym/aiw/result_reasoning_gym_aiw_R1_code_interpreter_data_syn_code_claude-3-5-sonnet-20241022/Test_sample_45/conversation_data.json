  "question": "Barbara has 2 male colleagues and she also has 2 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Barbara has. All these mentioned persons around Barbara are colleagues of each other. Michael has 1 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Michael are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Michael do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Michael and she is also colleague of Barbara, being part of Barbara's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Barbara has 2 male and 2 female colleagues (4 total)\n   * Michael has 1 male and 3 female colleagues (4 total)\n   * Matilda is in both circles (Barbara's and Michael's)\n   * All people in each circle are colleagues of each other\n   * Matilda is the only person who appears in both circles\n\n2) Let's write code to help us analyze this:\n\n```python\ndef find_matilda_female_colleagues():\n    # Barbara's circle (excluding Barbara)\n    barbara_males = 2\n    barbara_females = 2  # including Matilda\n    \n    # Michael's circle (excluding Michael)\n    michael_males = 1\n    michael_females = 3  # including Matilda\n    \n    # Since Matilda is in both circles, let's count her unique female colleagues\n    \n    # In Barbara's circle (excluding Matilda herself)\n    barbara_circle_females = barbara_females - 1  # one is Matilda\n    \n    # In Michael's circle (excluding Matilda herself)\n    michael_circle_females = michael_females - 1  # one is Matilda\n    \n    # Total unique female colleagues of Matilda\n    total_female_colleagues = barbara_circle_females + michael_circle_females\n    \n    print(f\"Matilda's female colleagues: {total_female_colleagues}\")\n\nfind_matilda_female_colleagues()\n```\n\n3) Let's analyze the result:\n   * In Barbara's circle, there are 2 female colleagues total, and one of them is Matilda\n   * So in Barbara's circle, Matilda has 1 female colleague\n   * In Michael's circle, there are 3 female colleagues total, and one of them is Matilda\n   * So in Michael's circle, Matilda has 2 female colleagues\n   * Since these circles are separate except for Matilda, these female colleagues are all different people\n   * Therefore, Matilda has 1 + 2 = 3 female colleagues in total\n\n<<<3>>>",
    "The code output confirms my reasoning. Let me verify why this answer is correct:\n\n1) From Barbara's circle:\n   * Barbara has 2 female colleagues in total\n   * One of them is Matilda\n   * Therefore, there is 1 other female colleague in Barbara's circle\n\n2) From Michael's circle:\n   * Michael has 3 female colleagues in total\n   * One of them is Matilda\n   * Therefore, there are 2 other female colleagues in Michael's circle\n\n3) Since Matilda is the only person who appears in both circles:\n   * The 1 female from Barbara's circle must be different from the 2 females in Michael's circle\n   * Therefore, these are 3 different female colleagues in total\n\nThe code output matches our logical reasoning, confirming that Matilda has 3 female colleagues in total.\n\n<<<3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Barbara has 2 male colleagues and she also has 2 female colleagues.
