  "question": "Jessica has 6 male colleagues and she also has 3 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Jessica has. All these mentioned persons around Jessica are colleagues of each other. Charles has 1 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda.

    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Jessica has 6 male and 3 female colleagues (total 9)\n   * Charles has 1 male and 1 female colleague (total 2)\n   * Matilda is a colleague of both Charles and Jessica\n   * Matilda is the only person who connects both circles\n   * All people in each circle are colleagues of each other\n\n2) Let's use Python to help us analyze this:\n\n```python\n# Define Jessica's circle (excluding Jessica herself)\njessica_males = 6\njessica_females = 3\n\n# Define Charles's circle (excluding Charles himself)\ncharles_males = 1\ncharles_females = 1\n\n# We know Matilda is female and is in both circles\n# So in Jessica's circle, out of 3 females, one is Matilda\n# And in Charles's circle, out of 1 female, it's Matilda\n\n# Matilda's female colleagues would be:\n# - All females in Jessica's circle (except herself)\n# - All females in Charles's circle (except herself)\n# - No duplicates as Matilda is the only connection\n\n# Calculate Matilda's female colleagues\nmatilda_female_colleagues = (jessica_females - 1) + (charles_females - 1)\n\nprint(f\"Matilda has {matilda_female_colleagues} female colleagues\")\n```\n\nLet's analyze the result:\n* In Jessica's circle, there are 3 females (including Matilda)\n* So there are 2 other females in Jessica's circle\n* In Charles's circle, there is 1 female (which is Matilda)\n* So there are 0 other females in Charles's circle\n* Therefore, Matilda has 2 female colleagues in total\n\n<<<2>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis. Let me verify that this is indeed the correct answer:\n\n1) In Jessica's circle:\n   * Total of 3 female colleagues\n   * One of them is Matilda herself\n   * Therefore, 2 other females are colleagues of Matilda\n\n2) In Charles's circle:\n   * Total of 1 female colleague (which is Matilda)\n   * No additional females in this circle\n   * Therefore, 0 additional female colleagues from Charles's circle\n\n3) Since Matilda is the only connection between the two circles, there's no overlap or additional female colleagues to consider.\n\nThe code output confirms that Matilda has exactly 2 female colleagues, which comes from:\n* 2 females from Jessica's circle (excluding Matilda herself)\n* 0 females from Charles's circle (excluding Matilda herself)\n* Total: 2 female colleagues\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jessica has 6 male colleagues and she also has 3 female colleagues.
