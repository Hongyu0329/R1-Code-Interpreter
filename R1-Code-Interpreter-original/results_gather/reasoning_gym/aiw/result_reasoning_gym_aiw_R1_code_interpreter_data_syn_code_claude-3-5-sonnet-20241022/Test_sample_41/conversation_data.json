    "Let me think about this problem:\n\n1. This is a logical reasoning question where we need to identify if there's enough information to answer the question.\n\n2. We are given:\n   * Sarah has 2 sisters\n   * Sarah has 5 brothers\n   * We are asked about Joseph's brother's sisters\n\n3. Analysis:\n   * We know information about Sarah's siblings\n   * We don't have any information about Joseph or his siblings\n   * There is no connection established between Sarah and Joseph\n   * Without any relationship between Sarah and Joseph, we cannot determine how many sisters Joseph's brother has\n\n4. This is a question about logical deduction, and we can conclude that:\n   * The information given about Sarah's family is irrelevant to answering the question about Joseph's brother\n   * There is insufficient information to determine the number of sisters that Joseph's brother has\n\nTherefore, based on the available information:\n\n<<<Cannot be determined - There is no information about Joseph or his family>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Sarah has 2 sisters and she also has 5 brothers.
