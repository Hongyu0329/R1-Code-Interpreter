    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1. First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Linda has 3 brothers\n   * Linda has 6 sisters\n   * We need to find how many sisters Linda's brothers have\n\n2. Let's think about the relationships:\n   * Linda's sisters are also her brothers' sisters\n   * Linda herself is also a sister to her brothers\n   * So, Linda's brothers have:\n     * All of Linda's sisters (6)\n     * Plus Linda herself (1)\n\n3. Let's verify this with a simple Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given information\nlinda_brothers = 3\nlinda_sisters = 6\n\n# Calculate sisters of Linda's brothers\n# This includes Linda's sisters plus Linda herself\nbrothers_sisters = linda_sisters + 1\n\nprint(f\"Linda's brothers have {brothers_sisters} sisters\")\n```\n\nBased on the calculation, I can now provide the final answer:\n\n<<<7 sisters>>>\n\nThe answer is 7 because Linda's brothers have all of Linda's 6 sisters plus Linda herself as their sister.",
    "The code output confirms my reasoning. Let me explain why the answer is 7:\n\n1. From Linda's brothers' perspective:\n   * They have all of Linda's sisters as their sisters (6 sisters)\n   * They also have Linda herself as their sister (+1 sister)\n   * Therefore, total sisters = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n2. We can verify this another way:\n   * Total girls in the family = Linda + her sisters = 1 + 6 = 7\n   * Each brother has the same number of sisters (all the girls in the family)\n   * So each of Linda's brothers has 7 sisters\n\nThe code output \"Linda's brothers have 7 sisters\" confirms our logical reasoning.\n\n<<<7>>>"
