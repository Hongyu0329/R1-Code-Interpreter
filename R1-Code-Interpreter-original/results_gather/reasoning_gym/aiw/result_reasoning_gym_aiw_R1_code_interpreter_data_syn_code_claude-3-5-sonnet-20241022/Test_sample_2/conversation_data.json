    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Margaret has 2 male friends and 1 female friend\n   * Everyone in this group is friends with each other\n   * James is one of Margaret's male friends\n   * We need to find how many female friends James has\n\n2) Let's visualize this as a network problem:\n   * Margaret (F) is connected to:\n     - 2 males (one of them is James)\n     - 1 female\n\n3) Since everyone is friends with each other:\n   * James (being one of the male friends) must be friends with:\n     - Margaret (F)\n     - The other male friend\n     - Margaret's female friend\n\n4) Let's verify this with a simple code:\n\n```python\n# Define the people\nmargaret = \"Margaret\"\njames = \"James\"\nother_male = \"Male2\"\nfemale_friend = \"Female1\"\n\n# Create a dictionary to store friendships\nfriends = {\n    margaret: [james, other_male, female_friend],\n    james: [margaret, other_male, female_friend],\n    other_male: [margaret, james, female_friend],\n    female_friend: [margaret, james, other_male]\n}\n\n# Count James's female friends\njames_female_friends = sum(1 for friend in friends[james] if friend in [margaret, female_friend])\nprint(f\"James has {james_female_friends} female friends\")\n```\n\n5) From the analysis and code verification:\n   * James is friends with Margaret (female) and Margaret's female friend\n   * Therefore, James has 2 female friends\n\n<<<2>>>",
    "The code output confirms my reasoning. Let me explain why the answer is 2:\n\n1) James's female friends consist of:\n   * Margaret (who is female)\n   * Margaret's female friend\n\nTherefore, the answer of 2 female friends is correct, as verified by both logical reasoning and the code execution.\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Margaret has 2 male friends and she also has 1 female friends.
