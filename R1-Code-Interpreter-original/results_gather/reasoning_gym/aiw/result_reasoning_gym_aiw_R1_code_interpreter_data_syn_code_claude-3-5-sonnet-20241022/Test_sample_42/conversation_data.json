John has 3 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around John are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around John do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of John and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Sarah has 3 male and 1 female colleagues (4 total)\n   * John has 3 male and 2 female colleagues (5 total)\n   * Matilda is in both circles (Sarah's and John's)\n   * All people in each circle are colleagues of each other\n   * People in John's circle don't have other colleagues except Matilda\n\n2) Let's write code to help us analyze this:\n\n```python\ndef find_matilda_female_colleagues():\n    # Sarah's circle (including Sarah)\n    sarah_males = 3\n    sarah_females = 1  # This includes Matilda\n    \n    # John's circle (including John)\n    john_males = 3\n    john_females = 2  # This includes Matilda\n    \n    # We know Matilda is in both circles\n    # Let's count her female colleagues:\n    \n    # In Sarah's circle:\n    # - Sarah herself is a female colleague\n    # - No other females (as the 1 female mentioned is Matilda)\n    females_from_sarah = 1  # Just Sarah\n    \n    # In John's circle:\n    # - The other female besides Matilda\n    females_from_john = 1  # The other female in John's circle\n    \n    total_female_colleagues = females_from_sarah + females_from_john\n    \n    print(f\"Matilda has {total_female_colleagues} female colleagues\")\n    return total_female_colleagues\n\nfind_matilda_female_colleagues()\n```\n\nLet's analyze the result:\n* In Sarah's circle: Matilda has Sarah as a female colleague (1)\n* In John's circle: Matilda has one other female colleague (besides herself) (1)\n* Total: 2 female colleagues\n\nThe logic is clear:\n1. In Sarah's circle, Matilda has Sarah as her only female colleague (as she is the only other female)\n2. In John's circle, there are 2 females including Matilda, so she has 1 female colleague there\n3. These are all her female colleagues as per the problem constraints\n\n<<<2>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis. Let me verify that this is indeed the correct answer:\n\n1. The code correctly identified that Matilda has exactly 2 female colleagues:\n   * Sarah (from Sarah's circle)\n   * One other female (from John's circle)\n\n2. We can be confident this is correct because:\n   * We know Matilda is in both circles\n   * In Sarah's circle, Sarah is her only female colleague (as the 1 female mentioned in Sarah's circle is Matilda herself)\n   * In John's circle, there are 2 females total (including Matilda), so there must be exactly one other female\n   * No other colleagues exist outside these circles (as specified in the problem)\n\nTherefore, I can confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<2>>>"
