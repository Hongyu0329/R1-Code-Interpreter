    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Margaret has 6 brothers\n   * Margaret has 2 sisters\n   * We need to find how many sisters each brother has\n\n2) Let's think about it:\n   * Margaret's brothers and Margaret share the same sisters\n   * Margaret herself is also a sister to her brothers\n   * So, each brother has:\n     * The 2 sisters that Margaret has\n     * Plus Margaret herself as a sister\n\n3) Let's verify this with a simple Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given information\nbrothers = 6\nmargarets_sisters = 2\n\n# Calculate sisters from brother's perspective\nsisters_per_brother = margarets_sisters + 1  # Adding Margaret herself\n\nprint(f\"Each brother has {sisters_per_brother} sisters\")\n```\n\nBased on the calculation, each of Margaret's brothers has 3 sisters (2 sisters that Margaret has plus Margaret herself).\n\n<<<3 sisters>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my reasoning. Let me explain why the answer is 3 sisters:\n\n1. From each brother's perspective:\n   * They have Margaret as a sister (1 sister)\n   * They also have Margaret's 2 sisters as their sisters (2 more sisters)\n   * Total: 1 + 2 = 3 sisters\n\nThe code output \"Each brother has 3 sisters\" verifies this logic, so I can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<3 sisters>>>"
