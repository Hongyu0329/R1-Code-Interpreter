    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1. Let's understand what we know:\n   * Sarah has 2 brothers\n   * Sarah has 2 sisters\n   * We need to find how many sisters Sarah's brother has\n\n2. Let's think about the relationships:\n   * Sarah's brothers and Sarah share the same sisters\n   * Sarah herself is also a sister to her brothers\n   * So, Sarah's brothers have:\n     * The 2 sisters that Sarah has\n     * Plus Sarah herself as their sister\n\n3. Let's verify this with a simple Python code to make it clear:\n\n```python\n# Sarah's siblings\nbrothers = 2\nsisters = 2\n\n# For any brother of Sarah:\nsisters_of_brother = sisters + 1  # Adding Sarah herself as a sister\n\nprint(f\"Each of Sarah's brothers has {sisters_of_brother} sisters\")\n```\n\n4. After running this code, we can confirm that each of Sarah's brothers has 3 sisters:\n   * The 2 sisters that Sarah also has\n   * Plus Sarah herself\n\n<<<3 sisters>>>",
    "The code output confirms our reasoning. Let me explain why the answer is 3 sisters:\n\n1. From the code execution, we can see that Sarah's brothers each have 3 sisters because:\n   * They have the same 2 sisters that Sarah has\n   * Plus Sarah herself is their sister (making it 3 total)\n\n2. The code helped us verify this by:\n   * Setting up the known number of brothers (2) and sisters (2)\n   * Adding 1 to account for Sarah herself being a sister to her brothers\n   * Calculating the total number of sisters from a brother's perspective\n\nThe output \"Each of Sarah's brothers has 3 sisters\" confirms our answer.\n\n<<<3>>>"
