    "Let me help you analyze this problem:\n\n1. The question provides information about Jennifer's siblings:\n   * Jennifer has 2 sisters\n   * Jennifer has 4 brothers\n\n2. However, the question asks about Michael's brother's sisters.\n   * We have no information about Michael or his family\n   * There is no connection established between Jennifer and Michael\n   * We cannot make any assumptions about Michael's family based on Jennifer's family\n\n3. This is a logical reasoning question:\n   * The information about Jennifer's family is irrelevant to answering the question about Michael's family\n   * This is an example of a question where given information serves as a distraction\n   * Without any information about Michael's family, we cannot determine how many sisters his brother has\n\n4. Therefore:\n   * There is insufficient information to answer how many sisters Michael's brother has\n   * We cannot provide a numerical answer based on the given information\n\n<<<Cannot be determined - insufficient information about Michael's family>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jennifer has 2 sisters and she also has 4 brothers.
