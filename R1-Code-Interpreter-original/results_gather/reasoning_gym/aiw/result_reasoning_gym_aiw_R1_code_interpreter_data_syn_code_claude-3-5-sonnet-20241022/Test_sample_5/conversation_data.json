All these mentioned persons around Patricia are colleagues of each other. Charles has 6 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Charles are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Charles do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Charles and she is also colleague of Patricia, being part of Patricia's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Patricia has 12 colleagues (6 male + 6 female)\n   * Charles has 11 colleagues (6 male + 5 female)\n   * Matilda is a colleague of both Patricia and Charles\n   * All colleagues of Patricia are colleagues of each other\n   * All colleagues of Charles are colleagues of each other\n   * Matilda's colleagues are only from these two circles\n\n2) Let's write code to help us analyze this:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_colleagues():\n    # Patricia's circle (excluding Patricia)\n    patricia_males = 6\n    patricia_females = 6\n    \n    # Charles's circle (excluding Charles)\n    charles_males = 6\n    charles_females = 5\n    \n    # We know Matilda is in both circles and is female\n    # So she's counted in both patricia_females and charles_females\n    \n    # In Patricia's circle, Matilda has:\n    matilda_colleagues_from_patricia = patricia_males + (patricia_females - 1)  # -1 because we don't count Matilda herself\n    \n    # In Charles's circle, Matilda has:\n    matilda_colleagues_from_charles = charles_males + (charles_females - 1)  # -1 because we don't count Matilda herself\n    \n    # Since Matilda is in both circles, we need to count unique female colleagues\n    # From Patricia's circle: patricia_females - 1 (excluding herself)\n    # From Charles's circle: charles_females - 1 (excluding herself)\n    total_female_colleagues = patricia_females - 1  # Start with Patricia's circle\n    \n    # Add any unique females from Charles's circle\n    # We know there's overlap of exactly 1 female (Matilda herself)\n    # So we add remaining females from Charles's circle\n    total_female_colleagues += (charles_females - 1)\n    \n    print(total_female_colleagues)\n\nanalyze_colleagues()\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output:\n* In Patricia's circle, there are 6 female colleagues (including Matilda)\n* In Charles's circle, there are 5 female colleagues (including Matilda)\n* Matilda is counted in both circles\n* So, from Patricia's circle, Matilda has 5 female colleagues (excluding herself)\n* From Charles's circle, Matilda has 4 female colleagues (excluding herself)\n* Since Matilda is the only person in both circles, these female colleagues are distinct\n\nTherefore, Matilda's total female colleagues = 5 (from Patricia's circle) + 4 (from Charles's circle) = 9\n\n<<<9>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my reasoning. Let me verify why 9 is indeed the correct answer:\n\n1) From Patricia's circle:\n   * Total females = 6 (including Matilda)\n   * Female colleagues for Matilda = 5 (excluding herself)\n\n2) From Charles's circle:\n   * Total females = 5 (including Matilda)\n   * Female colleagues for Matilda = 4 (excluding herself)\n\n3) Key points that confirm this is correct:\n   * Matilda is the only person who appears in both circles\n   * Therefore, all other females in Patricia's circle are different from the females in Charles's circle\n   * The total female colleagues for Matilda is the sum of both groups\n   * 5 (from Patricia's circle) + 4 (from Charles's circle) = 9\n\nThe code output matches our logical reasoning, so we can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<9>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Patricia has 6 male colleagues and she also has 6 female colleagues.
