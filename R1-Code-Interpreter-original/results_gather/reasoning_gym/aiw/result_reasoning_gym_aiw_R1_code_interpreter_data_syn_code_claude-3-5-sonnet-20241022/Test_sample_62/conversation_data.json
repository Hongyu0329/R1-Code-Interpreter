    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Patricia has 3 male friends\n   * Patricia has 4 female friends\n   * All these friends are friends with each other\n   * William is one of Patricia's male friends\n\n2) Since all friends are friends with each other:\n   * William, being a male friend of Patricia, is friends with:\n     - All of Patricia's female friends (4 females)\n     - All other male friends of Patricia (2 males, excluding himself)\n     - Patricia herself\n\n3) Therefore, William has 4 female friends (all of Patricia's female friends)\n\nLet's verify this with a simple code that models the friendship network:\n\n```python\n# Create sets of friends\nmale_friends = {'William', 'Male2', 'Male3'}  # 3 male friends\nfemale_friends = {'Female1', 'Female2', 'Female3', 'Female4'}  # 4 female friends\n\n# Count William's female friends\nwilliam_female_friends = len(female_friends)  # All females are friends with William\n\nprint(f\"William has {william_female_friends} female friends\")\n```\n\nBased on the code execution and our logical reasoning:\n\n<<<4>>>",
    "The code output confirms our logical reasoning. Let me explain why this answer is correct:\n\n1. The code created two sets representing the male and female friends of Patricia.\n2. Since all friends are friends with each other (as stated in the problem), William is automatically friends with all of Patricia's female friends.\n3. The code simply counted the number of female friends, which is 4.\n\nThis matches our initial logical deduction that William, being one of Patricia's male friends, would be friends with all of Patricia's female friends (4 females) because the problem states that \"they all are friends with each other.\"\n\nTherefore, I can confidently confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<4>>>"
