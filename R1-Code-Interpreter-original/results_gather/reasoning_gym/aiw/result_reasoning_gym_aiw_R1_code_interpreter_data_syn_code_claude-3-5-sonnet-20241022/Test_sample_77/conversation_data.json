    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're looking for:\n   * We need to find how many sisters Jessica's brothers have\n   * Jessica herself is a sister to her brothers\n   * Jessica's sister is also a sister to her brothers\n\n2) Let's break it down:\n   * Jessica has 5 brothers\n   * Jessica has 1 sister\n   * Each brother has:\n     * Jessica as a sister\n     * Jessica's sister as another sister\n   * So each brother has 2 sisters in total\n\n3) Let's verify this with a simple Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given information\nbrothers = 5\njessicas_sisters = 1\n\n# Calculate total sisters from a brother's perspective\nsisters_per_brother = 1 + jessicas_sisters  # Jessica + her sister\n\nprint(f\"Each of Jessica's brothers has {sisters_per_brother} sisters\")\n```\n\n4) After running this code, we can confirm that each of Jessica's brothers has 2 sisters.\n\n<<<2 sisters>>>",
    "Yes, the code output confirms our logical reasoning. Let me explain why the answer is 2 sisters:\n\n1) From any brother's perspective, they have:\n   * Jessica as one sister\n   * Jessica's other sister as another sister\n   * Total = 2 sisters\n\n2) This is true for all 5 brothers - each of them has the same 2 sisters.\n\nThe code helped us verify this by:\n* Adding Jessica (1 sister)\n* Adding Jessica's sister (1 more sister)\n* Showing that each brother has 2 sisters in total\n\nThe answer is confirmed to be:\n\n<<<2 sisters>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
