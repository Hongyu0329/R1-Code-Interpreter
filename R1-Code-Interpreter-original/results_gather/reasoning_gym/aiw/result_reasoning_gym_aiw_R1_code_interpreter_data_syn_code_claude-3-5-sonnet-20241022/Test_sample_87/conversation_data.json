  "question": "Jennifer has 6 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Jennifer has. All these mentioned persons around Jennifer are colleagues of each other. Thomas has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Thomas are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Thomas do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Thomas and she is also colleague of Jennifer, being part of Jennifer's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Jennifer has 11 colleagues in total (6 male + 5 female)\n   * Thomas has 5 colleagues in total (4 male + 1 female)\n   * Matilda is the connection between both circles\n   * Matilda is a female colleague of both Jennifer and Thomas\n   * All people in each circle are colleagues of each other\n\n2) Let's write code to help us analyze this:\n\n```python\n# Jennifer's circle (including Jennifer)\njennifer_males = 6\njennifer_females = 5  # This includes Matilda\ntotal_jennifer_circle = jennifer_males + jennifer_females + 1  # +1 for Jennifer herself\n\n# Thomas's circle (including Thomas)\nthomas_males = 4\nthomas_females = 1  # This is Matilda\ntotal_thomas_circle = thomas_males + thomas_females + 1  # +1 for Thomas himself\n\n# Since Matilda is in both circles, her female colleagues are:\n# From Jennifer's circle: Jennifer herself + all females except Matilda\nmatilda_females_jennifer = 1 + (jennifer_females - 1)\n\n# From Thomas's circle: No additional females (as she's the only female there)\nmatilda_females_thomas = 0\n\n# Total female colleagues of Matilda\ntotal_matilda_females = matilda_females_jennifer + matilda_females_thomas\n\nprint(f\"Matilda has {total_matilda_females} female colleagues\")\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output:\n* In Jennifer's circle, Matilda has Jennifer herself (1) plus all other females except herself (5-1 = 4), so 5 female colleagues from Jennifer's circle\n* In Thomas's circle, Matilda has no additional female colleagues as she's the only female there\n* Therefore, Matilda has 5 female colleagues in total\n\n<<<5>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis. Let me verify that this is indeed correct:\n\n1) From Jennifer's circle:\n   * Jennifer herself (1 female)\n   * The other female colleagues in Jennifer's circle (5 - 1 = 4 females, excluding Matilda)\n   * Total from Jennifer's circle = 5 females\n\n2) From Thomas's circle:\n   * No additional females, as Matilda is the only female in Thomas's circle\n\n3) The total number of female colleagues Matilda has:\n   * 5 from Jennifer's circle\n   * 0 additional from Thomas's circle\n   * Total = 5 female colleagues\n\nThe code output matches our logical reasoning, confirming that Matilda has 5 female colleagues in total.\n\n<<<5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jennifer has 6 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues.
