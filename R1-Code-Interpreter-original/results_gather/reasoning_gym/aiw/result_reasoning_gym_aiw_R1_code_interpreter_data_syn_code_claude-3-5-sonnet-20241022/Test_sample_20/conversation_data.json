  "question": "Mary has 4 male colleagues and she also has 3 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Mary has. All these mentioned persons around Mary are colleagues of each other. Thomas has 4 male colleagues and 1 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Thomas are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Thomas do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Thomas and she is also colleague of Mary, being part of Mary's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Mary has 7 colleagues in total (4 male + 3 female)\n   * Thomas has 5 colleagues in total (4 male + 1 female)\n   * Matilda is in both circles (Mary's and Thomas's)\n   * All people in each circle are colleagues of each other\n   * People in Thomas's circle don't have other colleagues except Matilda\n\n2) Let's write code to help us analyze this:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_colleagues():\n    # Mary's circle (including Mary)\n    mary_males = 4\n    mary_females = 3  # excluding Mary herself\n    \n    # Thomas's circle (including Thomas)\n    thomas_males = 4\n    thomas_females = 1  # excluding Thomas himself\n    \n    # We know Matilda is in both circles and is female\n    # Let's count Matilda's female colleagues:\n    \n    # In Mary's circle:\n    # - All other females in Mary's circle (excluding Matilda)\n    females_from_mary = mary_females - 1  # -1 because Matilda is counted in mary_females\n    \n    # In Thomas's circle:\n    # - No additional females because Thomas has only 1 female colleague (Matilda)\n    females_from_thomas = 0  # All females in Thomas's circle is just Matilda\n    \n    total_female_colleagues = females_from_mary + females_from_thomas\n    \n    print(f\"Matilda has {total_female_colleagues} female colleagues\")\n\nanalyze_colleagues()\n```\n\nLet's analyze the result:\n1) In Mary's circle, there are 3 females (including Matilda)\n2) So excluding Matilda herself, there are 2 other females in Mary's circle\n3) In Thomas's circle, the only female is Matilda herself\n4) Therefore, Matilda's only female colleagues are the 2 females from Mary's circle\n\n<<<2>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis. Let me explain why 2 is the correct answer:\n\n1) We know that Matilda is in both circles (Mary's and Thomas's)\n\n2) In Mary's circle:\n   * There are 3 female colleagues in total\n   * One of these is Matilda herself\n   * Therefore, Matilda has 2 female colleagues from Mary's circle\n\n3) In Thomas's circle:\n   * There is only 1 female colleague (which is Matilda herself)\n   * Therefore, Matilda has 0 female colleagues from Thomas's circle\n\n4) Since people in Thomas's circle don't have other colleagues (except for Matilda), we don't need to look for additional female colleagues elsewhere\n\n5) Total female colleagues of Matilda = 2 (from Mary's circle) + 0 (from Thomas's circle) = 2\n\nThe code execution confirmed this calculation, showing that Matilda has 2 female colleagues.\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
