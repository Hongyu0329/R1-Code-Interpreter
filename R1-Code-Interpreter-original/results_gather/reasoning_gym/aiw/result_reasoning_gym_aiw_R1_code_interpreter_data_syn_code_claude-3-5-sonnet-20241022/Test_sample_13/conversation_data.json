    "Let me think about this problem:\n\n1. The question provides information about Jessica's siblings:\n   * Jessica has 3 sisters\n   * Jessica has 1 brother\n\n2. However, the question asks about William's brother's sisters.\n   * There is no information given about William or his siblings\n   * There is no connection established between Jessica and William\n   * We cannot make any assumptions about William's family based on Jessica's family\n\n3. This is a logical reasoning question:\n   * The information about Jessica's family is irrelevant to answering the question about William's family\n   * Without any information about William's family, we cannot determine how many sisters his brother has\n   * This is an example of insufficient or irrelevant information\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot determine how many sisters William's brother has.\n\n<<<Cannot be determined>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jessica has 3 sisters and she also has 1 brothers.
