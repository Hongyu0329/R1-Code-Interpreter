    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1. Let's understand what we know:\n   * Patricia has 3 brothers\n   * Patricia has 1 sister\n   * We need to find how many sisters each brother has\n\n2. Reasoning:\n   * Each brother of Patricia would count both Patricia AND her sister as their sisters\n   * So, each brother has 2 sisters (Patricia + her 1 sister)\n   * All brothers have the same number of sisters\n   * We don't need complex computation for this, but let's verify with code\n\n```python\n# Define the family structure\npatricia_brothers = 3\npatricia_sisters = 1\n\n# Calculate sisters for each brother\nsisters_per_brother = patricia_sisters + 1  # Adding Patricia herself\n\nprint(f\"Each brother has {sisters_per_brother} sisters\")\n```\n\nBased on the code execution and our logical reasoning:\n<<<2>>>",
    "The code output confirms our logical reasoning. Let me explain why the answer is 2:\n\n1. From each brother's perspective:\n   * They count Patricia as their sister (1 sister)\n   * They also count Patricia's sister as their sister (1 more sister)\n   * Therefore, 1 + 1 = 2 sisters total\n\n2. This is true for all three brothers:\n   * Brother 1 has 2 sisters (Patricia + her sister)\n   * Brother 2 has 2 sisters (Patricia + her sister)\n   * Brother 3 has 2 sisters (Patricia + her sister)\n\nThe code execution validated our answer by showing that each brother has 2 sisters.\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
