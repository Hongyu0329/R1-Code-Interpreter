    "Let me help you reason through this problem:\n\n1. The question provides information about Susan's siblings but asks about Michael's brother's sisters.\n\n2. There is no connection or information given between Susan and Michael or their families.\n\n3. This is actually a logical reasoning question where we need to understand that:\n   - We have information about Susan's family\n   - We are asked about Michael's brother's family\n   - There is no relationship established between these families\n   - Therefore, we cannot determine Michael's brother's sisters from the given information\n\n4. This is a classic example of a logical trap where irrelevant information is provided (Susan's siblings) while the actual question is about a completely unrelated person (Michael's brother).\n\n5. Since there is no connection or information about Michael's brother's sisters, we cannot determine the answer.\n\n<<<Cannot be determined from the given information>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Susan has 3 sisters and she also has 4 brothers.
