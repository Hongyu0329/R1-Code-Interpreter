    "Let me think about this problem:\n\n1. This is actually a trick question. \n2. We are given information about Margaret's siblings:\n   * Margaret has 6 sisters\n   * Margaret has 3 brothers\n3. However, we are asked about Robert's brother's sisters\n4. There is no information connecting Margaret to Robert or his brother\n5. Therefore, we cannot determine how many sisters Robert's brother has based on the given information\n\nThis is a logical reasoning problem that demonstrates how we shouldn't make assumptions or try to connect unrelated information.\n\n<<<Cannot be determined from the given information>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Margaret has 6 sisters and she also has 3 brothers.
