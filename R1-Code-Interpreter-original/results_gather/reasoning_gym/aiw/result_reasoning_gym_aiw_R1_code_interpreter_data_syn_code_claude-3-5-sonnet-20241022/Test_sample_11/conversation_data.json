    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1. Let's understand what we know:\n   * Jennifer has 3 brothers\n   * Jennifer has 6 sisters\n   * We need to find how many sisters Jennifer's brothers have\n\n2. Reasoning:\n   * Jennifer's brothers share the same sisters as Jennifer\n   * Jennifer herself is also a sister to her brothers\n   * So Jennifer's brothers have:\n     * All of Jennifer's sisters (6)\n     * Plus Jennifer herself (1)\n\n3. Let's write a simple code to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Given information\njennifer_brothers = 3\njennifer_sisters = 6\n\n# Calculate sisters from brothers' perspective\nbrothers_sisters = jennifer_sisters + 1  # Adding Jennifer herself\n\nprint(f\"Jennifer's brothers have {brothers_sisters} sisters\")\n```\n\nBased on the calculation, Jennifer's brothers have 7 sisters (6 sisters plus Jennifer herself).\n\n<<<7 sisters>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my reasoning. Let me explain why the answer is 7 sisters:\n\n1. From Jennifer's brothers' perspective:\n   * They have all the same sisters that Jennifer has (6 sisters)\n   * They also count Jennifer herself as their sister\n   * Therefore: 6 + 1 = 7 sisters total\n\nThe code correctly calculated this by:\n1. Taking Jennifer's 6 sisters\n2. Adding 1 (Jennifer herself)\n3. Resulting in 7 sisters total that Jennifer's brothers have\n\nThe answer is confirmed to be:\n\n<<<7 sisters>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jennifer has 3 brothers and she also has 6 sisters.
