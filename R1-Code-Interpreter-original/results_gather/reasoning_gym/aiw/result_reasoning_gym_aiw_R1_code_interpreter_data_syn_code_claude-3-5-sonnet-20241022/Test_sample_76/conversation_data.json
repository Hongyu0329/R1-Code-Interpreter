    "Let me think about this problem:\n\n1. This is actually a trick question. The problem provides information about Patricia's siblings but asks about Bob's brother's sisters.\n\n2. From the given information:\n   * We know Patricia has 6 sisters and 4 brothers\n   * We don't have any information about Bob or Bob's brother\n   * There is no connection established between Patricia and Bob\n\n3. Since there is no information given about Bob or Bob's brother, we cannot determine how many sisters Bob's brother has.\n\n4. This is a logical reasoning problem rather than a computational one, as we lack the necessary information to make any conclusion about Bob's brother's sisters.\n\n<<<Cannot be determined from the given information>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Patricia has 6 sisters and she also has 4 brothers.
