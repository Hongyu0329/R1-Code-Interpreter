    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're looking for:\n   * We need to find how many sisters Patricia's brothers have\n   * Patricia herself is a sister to her brothers\n   * Patricia's other sisters are also sisters to her brothers\n\n2) Let's break it down:\n   * Patricia has 6 brothers\n   * Patricia has 2 sisters\n   * When counting sisters of Patricia's brothers:\n     * Include Patricia herself (1 sister)\n     * Include Patricia's other sisters (2 sisters)\n     * Total sisters = Patricia + her sisters = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nLet me verify this with a simple Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given information\npatricia_brothers = 6\npatricia_sisters = 2\n\n# Calculate total sisters from brothers' perspective\n# Include Patricia herself (1) plus her sisters (2)\ntotal_sisters = 1 + patricia_sisters\n\nprint(f\"Patricia's brothers have {total_sisters} sisters\")\n```\n\nBased on the calculation and code verification:\n<<<3 sisters>>>",
    "The code output confirms my reasoning. Let me explain why the answer is 3 sisters:\n\n1) From any of Patricia's brothers' perspective, their sisters include:\n   * Patricia herself (1 sister)\n   * Patricia's 2 sisters (2 more sisters)\n   * Therefore, each brother has the same number of sisters: 1 + 2 = 3 sisters\n\n2) The key insight is that:\n   * We're looking at this from the brothers' point of view\n   * Each brother has the same set of sisters\n   * Patricia counts as a sister to her brothers\n   * The 2 other sisters also count as sisters to the brothers\n\nThe code output \"Patricia's brothers have 3 sisters\" confirms our logical reasoning.\n\n<<<3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Patricia has 6 brothers and she also has 2 sisters.
