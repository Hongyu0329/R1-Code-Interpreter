Michael has 5 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Michael are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Michael do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda.

    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Jessica has 6 male and 1 female colleagues (total 7)\n   * Michael has 5 male and 6 female colleagues (total 11)\n   * Matilda is in both circles (colleague of both Jessica and Michael)\n   * Matilda is the only person who appears in both circles\n\n2) Let's think about Matilda's female colleagues:\n   * From Jessica's circle: She would know Jessica and the 1 female colleague\n   * From Michael's circle: She would know the 6 female colleagues (including herself)\n\n3) We need to:\n   * Count unique female colleagues Matilda has\n   * Consider that Matilda herself is counted in Michael's female colleagues\n   * Consider overlaps between the circles\n\nLet's write code to help us analyze this:\n\n```python\n# Jessica's circle (excluding Matilda)\njessica_males = 6\njessica_females = 1  # This includes Matilda\n\n# Michael's circle (excluding Matilda)\nmichael_males = 5\nmichael_females = 6  # This includes Matilda\n\n# Calculate Matilda's female colleagues\n# From Jessica's circle:\nmatilda_females = 1  # Jessica herself\n\nif jessica_females > 0:\n    matilda_females += (jessica_females - 1)  # The other female (if any) minus Matilda\n\n# From Michael's circle:\nmatilda_females += (michael_females - 1)  # All females minus Matilda herself\n\nprint(f\"Matilda has {matilda_females} female colleagues\")\n```\n\nFrom the code execution, we can analyze:\n* In Jessica's circle, Matilda knows Jessica (1) and no other females (as the 1 female colleague is Matilda herself)\n* In Michael's circle, Matilda knows 5 other females (6 total - herself)\n* Therefore, Matilda has 6 female colleagues in total (Jessica + 5 from Michael's circle)\n\n<<<6>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis. Let me verify the answer is correct by double-checking the logic:\n\n1) From Jessica's circle:\n   * Matilda knows Jessica herself (1 female)\n   * The other female colleague mentioned in Jessica's circle is actually Matilda herself, so no additional females from here\n\n2) From Michael's circle:\n   * There are 6 female colleagues total in Michael's circle\n   * One of these is Matilda herself\n   * So she knows 5 other females from this circle\n\n3) Total female colleagues of Matilda:\n   * Jessica (1) + Other females from Michael's circle (5) = 6 females\n\nThe code output matches our logical reasoning, confirming that Matilda has 6 female colleagues.\n\n<<<6>>>"
