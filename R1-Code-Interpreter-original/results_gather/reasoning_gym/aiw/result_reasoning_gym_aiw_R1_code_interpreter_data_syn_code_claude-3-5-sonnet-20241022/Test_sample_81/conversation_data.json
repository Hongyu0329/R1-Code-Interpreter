    "Let me think about this problem:\n\n1. This is actually a trick question. The problem provides information about Elizabeth's siblings but asks about James's brother's sisters.\n\n2. There is no connection established between Elizabeth and James in the question.\n\n3. We don't have any information about James or James's brother or their family.\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot determine how many sisters James's brother has based on the information given about Elizabeth's family.\n\n5. The information about Elizabeth having 5 sisters and 4 brothers is irrelevant to answering the question about James's brother's sisters.\n\n<<<Cannot be determined from the given information>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Elizabeth has 5 sisters and she also has 4 brothers.
