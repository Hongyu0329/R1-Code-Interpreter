    "Let me think about this problem:\n\n1. This is actually a logical reasoning question, not a computational one.\n2. The question provides information about Jennifer's siblings.\n3. However, the question asks about Bob's brother's sisters.\n4. There is no connection given between Jennifer and Bob or their families.\n5. Therefore, we cannot determine how many sisters Bob's brother has based on the information about Jennifer's siblings.\n6. This is a classic misdirection question where irrelevant information is provided.\n\nSince there is no mathematical computation needed and no relationship established between Jennifer and Bob's families, we cannot determine the answer.\n\n<<<Cannot be determined from the given information>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Jennifer has 2 sisters and she also has 6 brothers.
