Thomas has 1 male colleagues and 2 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around Thomas are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around Thomas do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of Thomas and she is also colleague of Sarah, being part of Sarah's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Sarah has 2 male and 4 female colleagues (6 total)\n   * Thomas has 1 male and 2 female colleagues (3 total)\n   * Matilda is in both circles (she's a colleague of both Sarah and Thomas)\n   * All people in each circle are colleagues of each other\n   * People in Thomas's circle don't have other colleagues except Matilda\n\n2) Let's write code to help us analyze this situation:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_colleagues():\n    # Sarah's circle (including Sarah)\n    sarah_males = 2\n    sarah_females = 4  # excluding Sarah herself\n    \n    # Thomas's circle (including Thomas)\n    thomas_males = 1\n    thomas_females = 2  # excluding Thomas himself\n    \n    # We know Matilda is in both circles and is female\n    # So she's one of Sarah's 4 female colleagues\n    # And one of Thomas's 2 female colleagues\n    \n    # Matilda's female colleagues would be:\n    # - All females in Sarah's circle (except herself) = sarah_females - 1\n    # - All females in Thomas's circle (except herself) = thomas_females - 1\n    # But we need to avoid double counting\n    \n    matilda_female_colleagues = (sarah_females - 1) + 0  # We don't add Thomas's females because they don't have outside connections except Matilda\n    \n    print(f\"Matilda has {matilda_female_colleagues} female colleagues\")\n\nanalyze_colleagues()\n```\n\n3) Let's analyze the result:\n   * In Sarah's circle, there are 4 female colleagues (including Matilda)\n   * So excluding Matilda herself, she has 3 female colleagues from Sarah's circle\n   * In Thomas's circle, there are 2 female colleagues (including Matilda)\n   * The other female in Thomas's circle cannot have connections outside Thomas's circle\n   * Therefore, we don't add any additional female colleagues from Thomas's circle\n\n<<<3>>>",
    "The code output confirms my reasoning. Let me verify that this is indeed correct:\n\n1) From Sarah's circle:\n   * There are 4 female colleagues in total\n   * One of them is Matilda herself\n   * The other 3 are female colleagues of Matilda\n\n2) From Thomas's circle:\n   * There are 2 female colleagues in total (including Matilda)\n   * So there's only 1 other female colleague\n   * But this person cannot have connections outside Thomas's circle\n   * Therefore, this person is already counted in Sarah's circle\n\n3) Therefore:\n   * Matilda has exactly 3 female colleagues\n   * These are all from Sarah's circle\n   * We don't need to add any additional colleagues from Thomas's circle\n\nThe answer is confirmed to be correct.\n\n<<<3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Sarah has 2 male colleagues and she also has 4 female colleagues.
