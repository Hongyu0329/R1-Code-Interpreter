  "question": "Linda has 5 male colleagues and she also has 1 female colleagues. These are all colleagues that Linda has. All these mentioned persons around Linda are colleagues of each other. John has 3 male colleagues and 5 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around John are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around John do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda. She is colleague of John and she is also colleague of Linda, being part of Linda's circle. How many female colleagues does Matilda have?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Linda has 5 male and 1 female colleagues (total 6)\n   * John has 3 male and 5 female colleagues (total 8)\n   * Matilda is in both circles (Linda's and John's)\n   * All people in each circle are colleagues of each other\n   * People in John's circle don't have other colleagues except Matilda\n\n2) Let's write code to help us analyze this:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_colleagues():\n    # Linda's circle (including Linda)\n    linda_males = 5\n    linda_females = 1  # This includes Matilda\n    linda_total = linda_males + linda_females + 1  # +1 for Linda herself\n    \n    # John's circle (including John)\n    john_males = 3\n    john_females = 5  # This includes Matilda\n    john_total = john_males + john_females + 1  # +1 for John himself\n    \n    # Since Matilda is in both circles, let's count her female colleagues\n    \n    # In Linda's circle:\n    # - Linda herself is a female colleague\n    matilda_females_from_linda = 1  # Just Linda\n    \n    # In John's circle:\n    # - All females except Matilda herself\n    matilda_females_from_john = john_females - 1\n    \n    # Total female colleagues of Matilda\n    total_matilda_females = matilda_females_from_linda + matilda_females_from_john\n    \n    print(f\"Matilda has {total_matilda_females} female colleagues\")\n    return total_matilda_females\n\nanalyze_colleagues()\n```\n\nLet's analyze the result:\n1) In Linda's circle, Matilda has only Linda as a female colleague\n2) In John's circle, Matilda has 4 female colleagues (5 females total - herself)\n3) Since there's no overlap between the circles except for Matilda herself, we add these numbers\n\nTherefore, Matilda has 5 female colleagues in total (1 from Linda's circle + 4 from John's circle)\n\n<<<5>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis. Let me verify the answer one final time:\n\n1) From Linda's circle:\n   * Linda herself is a female colleague of Matilda\n   * The other female colleague mentioned in Linda's circle is Matilda herself (so not counted)\n\n2) From John's circle:\n   * There are 5 females total in John's circle\n   * One of them is Matilda herself (not counted)\n   * Therefore, 4 other females are Matilda's colleagues\n\n3) Total female colleagues of Matilda:\n   * From Linda's circle: 1 (Linda)\n   * From John's circle: 4 (the other females)\n   * Total: 1 + 4 = 5\n\nThe code output matches our logical reasoning, confirming that Matilda has 5 female colleagues.\n\n<<<5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Linda has 5 male colleagues and she also has 1 female colleagues.
