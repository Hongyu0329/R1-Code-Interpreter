James has 2 male colleagues and 6 female colleagues in total. All these mentioned persons around James are colleagues of each other. The people in the circle around James do not have other colleagues aside - with the only exception of Matilda.

    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we know:\n   * Susan has 5 male and 5 female colleagues (10 total)\n   * James has 2 male and 6 female colleagues (8 total)\n   * Matilda is in both circles (connected to both Susan and James)\n   * All people in each circle are colleagues of each other\n   * Matilda is the only person who connects both circles\n\n2) Let's write code to help us analyze this:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_matilda_female_colleagues():\n    # Susan's circle (excluding Matilda)\n    susan_males = 5\n    susan_females = 4  # 5-1 because Matilda is one of them\n    \n    # James's circle (excluding Matilda)\n    james_males = 2\n    james_females = 5  # 6-1 because Matilda is one of them\n    \n    # Total female colleagues of Matilda:\n    # - All females in Susan's circle (except herself)\n    # - All females in James's circle (except herself)\n    # - But we need to avoid double counting if there are common people\n    # Since Matilda is the only connection between circles,\n    # there are no other common people\n    \n    total_female_colleagues = susan_females + james_females\n    \n    print(f\"Matilda's female colleagues: {total_female_colleagues}\")\n    return total_female_colleagues\n\ncalculate_matilda_female_colleagues()\n```\n\nLet's analyze the result:\n* In Susan's circle, there are 4 female colleagues (excluding Matilda)\n* In James's circle, there are 5 female colleagues (excluding Matilda)\n* Since Matilda is the only connection between the two circles, there are no other common colleagues\n* Therefore, Matilda's total female colleagues = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n<<<9>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis. Let me verify that this answer is correct by double-checking our reasoning:\n\n1) In Susan's circle:\n   * Total females = 5 (including Matilda)\n   * So females excluding Matilda = 4\n\n2) In James's circle:\n   * Total females = 6 (including Matilda)\n   * So females excluding Matilda = 5\n\n3) Since Matilda is the only person connecting both circles:\n   * There are no other overlapping colleagues\n   * We can simply add the female colleagues from both circles\n   * 4 (from Susan's circle) + 5 (from James's circle) = 9\n\nThe code output matches our logical reasoning, confirming that Matilda has 9 female colleagues in total.\n\n<<<9>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Susan has 5 male colleagues and she also has 5 female colleagues.
