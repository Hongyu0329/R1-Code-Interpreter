    "Let me help you reason through this problem.\n\nThis is actually a trick question that cannot be solved because:\n1. We know information about Linda's siblings (3 sisters and 1 brother)\n2. But we are asked about Thomas's brother's sisters\n3. There is no connection or relationship established between Linda and Thomas in the question\n4. Therefore, knowing Linda's family composition does not help us determine anything about Thomas's family\n\nSince there is no logical connection between the two parts of the question, and no information is provided about Thomas or his family, we cannot determine how many sisters Thomas's brother has.\n\n<<<Cannot be determined - there is no information about Thomas or his family>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Linda has 3 sisters and she also has 1 brothers.
