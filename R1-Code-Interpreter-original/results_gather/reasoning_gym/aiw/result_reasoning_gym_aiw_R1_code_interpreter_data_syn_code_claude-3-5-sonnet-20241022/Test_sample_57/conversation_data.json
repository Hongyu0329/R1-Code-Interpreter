    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1. Let's understand what we know:\n   * Margaret has 2 brothers\n   * Margaret has 3 sisters\n   * We need to find how many sisters Margaret's brothers have\n\n2. Reasoning:\n   * Margaret's brothers share the same siblings as Margaret\n   * Margaret's brothers would count all sisters including Margaret\n   * So, Margaret's brothers have all of Margaret's sisters PLUS Margaret herself\n\n3. Let's calculate:\n   * Number of sisters Margaret's brothers have = Margaret's sisters + Margaret herself\n   * = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nLet me verify this with a simple Python code:\n\n```python\n# Margaret's siblings\nbrothers = 2\nsisters = 3\n\n# Sisters from brother's perspective\n# All sisters plus Margaret herself\nsisters_from_brother_view = sisters + 1\n\nprint(f\"Margaret's brothers have {sisters_from_brother_view} sisters\")\n```\n\nBased on the calculation and code verification:\n\n<<<4 sisters>>>",
    "The code output confirms my reasoning. Let me explain why the answer is 4 sisters:\n\n1. From Margaret's perspective:\n   * She has 3 sisters\n   * She has 2 brothers\n\n2. From her brothers' perspective:\n   * They see the same 3 sisters that Margaret sees\n   * They also see Margaret as their sister\n   * Therefore, they have 4 sisters in total (3 + Margaret)\n\nThe code output \"Margaret's brothers have 4 sisters\" validates our answer.\n\n<<<4 sisters>>>"
