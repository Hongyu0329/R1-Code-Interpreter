    "Let me think about this problem:\n\n1. This is actually a trick question. The problem provides information about Patricia's siblings but asks about Joseph's brother's sisters.\n\n2. From the given information:\n   * We know Patricia has 5 sisters and 6 brothers\n   * We don't have any information about Joseph or Joseph's brother\n   * There is no connection established between Patricia and Joseph\n\n3. Since there is no information given about Joseph or Joseph's brother, we cannot determine how many sisters Joseph's brother has.\n\n4. This is a logical reasoning problem rather than a computational one, so no code is needed for solving it.\n\n5. The question cannot be answered with the given information as it's missing crucial details about Joseph's family.\n\n<<<Cannot be determined from the given information>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Patricia has 5 sisters and she also has 6 brothers.
