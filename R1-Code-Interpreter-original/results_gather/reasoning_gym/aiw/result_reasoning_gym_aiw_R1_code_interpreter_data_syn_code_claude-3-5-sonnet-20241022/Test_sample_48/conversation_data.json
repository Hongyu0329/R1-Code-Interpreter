    "Let me think about this problem:\n\n1. This is a logical reasoning question where we need to identify if we have enough information to answer.\n\n2. We are given:\n   * Sarah has 3 sisters\n   * Sarah has 3 brothers\n   * We are asked about Richard's brother's sisters\n\n3. Key observation:\n   * We don't know who Richard is\n   * We don't know if Richard is related to Sarah\n   * We don't have any information connecting Richard to Sarah or her family\n   * We don't even know if Richard has a brother\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   * There is insufficient information to determine how many sisters Richard's brother has\n   * The information about Sarah and her siblings is irrelevant to answering the question about Richard's brother's sisters\n   * This is a logical reasoning question that demonstrates how we cannot make assumptions or connections between unrelated pieces of information\n\n<<<Cannot be determined - There is no information about Richard or his family>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Sarah has 3 sisters and she also has 3 brothers.
