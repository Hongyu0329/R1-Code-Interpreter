  "question": "An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of a different word, using all the original letters exactly once.\n\nYour job is to group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.\n\nThe output is a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets, where each outer list contains a group of anagrams, e.g. <<<[[\"eat\", \"tea\"], [\"tan\", \"nat\"]]>>>.\n\nGroup the following list of words into anagrams:\n[\"ponerid\", \"poinder\", \"ionomers\", \"moonrise\", \"shipowner\", \"ownership\"]\n",

    "\nassistant > To group the given list of words into anagrams, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Create a dictionary to store groups of anagrams. The key will be a sorted tuple of the word's letters, and the value will be a list of words that are anagrams of each other.\n2. Iterate through each word in the list.\n3. Sort the letters of the word to create a key.\n4. Add the word to the list corresponding to the sorted key in the dictionary.\n5. Finally, extract the lists of anagrams from the dictionary and return them.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    anagrams = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for word in words:\n        # Sort the word to create a key\n        key = tuple(sorted(word))\n        # Add the word to the corresponding anagram group\n        anagrams[key].append(word)\n    \n    # Extract the lists of anagrams\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\n# List of words to group into anagrams\nwords = [\"ponerid\", \"poinder\", \"ionomers\", \"moonrise\", \"shipowner\", \"ownership\"]\n\n# Group the words into anagrams\ngrouped_anagrams = group_anagrams(words)\ngrouped_anagrams\nassistant > The words have been grouped into anagrams as follows:\n\n<<<[['ponerid', 'poinder'], ['ionomers', 'moonrise'], ['shipowner', 'ownership']]>>>"
