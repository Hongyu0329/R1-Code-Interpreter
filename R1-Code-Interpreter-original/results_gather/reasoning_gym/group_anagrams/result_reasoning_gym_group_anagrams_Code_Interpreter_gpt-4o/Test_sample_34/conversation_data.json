  "question": "An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of a different word, using all the original letters exactly once.\n\nYour job is to group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.\n\nThe output is a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets, where each outer list contains a group of anagrams, e.g. <<<[[\"eat\", \"tea\"], [\"tan\", \"nat\"]]>>>.\n\nGroup the following list of words into anagrams:\n[\"crouches\", \"couchers\", \"nonrebel\", \"ennobler\", \"resiance\", \"cerasein\", \"increase\"]\n",

    "\nassistant > To group the given list of words into anagrams, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Create a dictionary to store groups of anagrams. The key will be a tuple of sorted characters of the word, and the value will be a list of words that match that key.\n2. Iterate through each word in the list, sort the characters of the word, and use the sorted tuple as the key in the dictionary.\n3. Append the word to the list corresponding to the sorted tuple key.\n4. Finally, extract the lists of anagrams from the dictionary and return them.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    anagrams = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for word in words:\n        # Sort the word and use it as a key\n        sorted_word = tuple(sorted(word))\n        anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)\n    \n    # Extract the groups of anagrams\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\n# List of words to group into anagrams\nwords = [\"crouches\", \"couchers\", \"nonrebel\", \"ennobler\", \"resiance\", \"cerasein\", \"increase\"]\n\n# Group the words into anagrams\ngrouped_anagrams = group_anagrams(words)\ngrouped_anagrams\nassistant > The given list of words has been grouped into anagrams as follows:\n\n<<<\n[\n    [\"crouches\", \"couchers\"],\n    [\"nonrebel\", \"ennobler\"],\n    [\"resiance\", \"cerasein\", \"increase\"]\n]\n>>>"
