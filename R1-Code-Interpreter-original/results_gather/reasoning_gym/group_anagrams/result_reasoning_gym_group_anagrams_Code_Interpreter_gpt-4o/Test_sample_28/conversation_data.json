    "\nassistant > To group the given list of words into anagrams, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Create a dictionary to store groups of anagrams. The key will be a tuple of sorted characters of the word, and the value will be a list of words that match that key.\n2. Iterate through each word in the list, sort the characters in the word, and use the sorted tuple as the key in the dictionary.\n3. Append the word to the list corresponding to the sorted tuple key.\n4. Finally, extract the lists of anagrams from the dictionary and return them.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# List of words to group into anagrams\nwords = [\n    \"discouple\", \"clupeoids\", \"infarction\", \"infraction\", \"draba\", \"barad\",\n    \"chordal\", \"dorlach\", \"racers\", \"screar\", \"carers\", \"radiators\", \"sartoriad\"\n]\n\n# Dictionary to store groups of anagrams\nanagrams = defaultdict(list)\n\n# Group words into anagrams\nfor word in words:\n    # Sort the characters in the word and use it as a key\n    key = tuple(sorted(word))\n    anagrams[key].append(word)\n\n# Extract the lists of anagrams\ngrouped_anagrams = list(anagrams.values())\ngrouped_anagrams\nassistant > The words have been grouped into anagrams as follows:\n\n<<<\n[\n    [\"discouple\", \"clupeoids\"],\n    [\"infarction\", \"infraction\"],\n    [\"draba\", \"barad\"],\n    [\"chordal\", \"dorlach\"],\n    [\"racers\", \"screar\", \"carers\"],\n    [\"radiators\", \"sartoriad\"]\n]\n>>>\n\nEach inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other."
