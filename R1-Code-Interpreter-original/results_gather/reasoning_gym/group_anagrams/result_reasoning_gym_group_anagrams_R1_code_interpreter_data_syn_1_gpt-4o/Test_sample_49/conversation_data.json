    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that can be rearranged to form each other. The most efficient way to do this is to sort the characters in each word and use the sorted word as a key in a dictionary. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted character sequence and thus will be grouped together under the same key.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Create a dictionary to store lists of words, where the key is the sorted tuple of characters of the word.\n2. Iterate over each word in the list.\n3. Sort the characters of the word and convert it to a tuple (since lists can't be dictionary keys).\n4. Use the sorted tuple as a key in the dictionary and append the original word to the list corresponding to that key.\n5. Finally, extract the lists of anagrams from the dictionary and return them.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    \n    anagrams = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for word in words:\n        # Sort the word and use it as a key\n        sorted_word = tuple(sorted(word))\n        anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)\n    \n    # Return the grouped anagrams as a list of lists\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\nwords = [\"sturnine\", \"runniest\", \"set\", \"est\", \"neurad\", \"endura\", \"unread\", \n         \"hotches\", \"shochet\", \"rehallow\", \"hallower\", \"dismalities\", \n         \"dissimilate\", \"halfungs\", \"flashgun\", \"tirelessness\", \n         \"ritelessness\", \"dirca\", \"carid\", \"daric\", \"darci\", \"batiste\", \"bastite\"]\n\nresult = group_anagrams(words)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will group the words into anagrams and print the result. Let's execute it to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and grouped the words into anagrams as expected. The output is a list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n<<<[['sturnine', 'runniest'], ['set', 'est'], ['neurad', 'endura', 'unread'], ['hotches', 'shochet'], ['rehallow', 'hallower'], ['dismalities', 'dissimilate'], ['halfungs', 'flashgun'], ['tirelessness', 'ritelessness'], ['dirca', 'carid', 'daric', 'darci'], ['batiste', 'bastite']]>>>"
