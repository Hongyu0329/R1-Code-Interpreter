    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that are composed of the same letters. A common approach is to sort the letters of each word and use the sorted word as a key in a dictionary. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted key.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n2. Iterate over each word in the list.\n3. For each word, sort the letters alphabetically to form a key.\n4. Use this sorted key to group words in the dictionary.\n5. If the key is already in the dictionary, append the word to the list associated with that key.\n6. If the key is not in the dictionary, create a new entry with the key and start a new list with the current word.\n7. Finally, extract all the lists of anagrams from the dictionary and return them.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\nwords = [\"hor\", \"rho\", \"unremote\", \"routemen\"]\n\n# Dictionary to hold the groups of anagrams\nanagrams = {}\n\n# Group words by sorted tuple of characters\nfor word in words:\n    # Sort the word to form the key\n    key = tuple(sorted(word))\n    # Add the word to the corresponding anagram group\n    if key in anagrams:\n        anagrams[key].append(word)\n    else:\n        anagrams[key] = [word]\n\n# Extract the groups of anagrams\nresult = list(anagrams.values())\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will group the words into anagrams and print the result. Let's execute it to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and grouped the words into anagrams as expected. The output shows two groups of anagrams: `['hor', 'rho']` and `['unremote', 'routemen']`. \n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<[['hor', 'rho'], ['unremote', 'routemen']]>>>"
