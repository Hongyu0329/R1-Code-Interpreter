    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that can be rearranged to form each other. The most efficient way to do this is to sort the characters in each word and use the sorted word as a key in a dictionary. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted character sequence.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams. The keys will be the sorted character sequences, and the values will be lists of words that match those sequences.\n\n2. Iterate over each word in the input list.\n\n3. For each word, sort its characters to form the key.\n\n4. Check if the sorted key is already in the dictionary:\n   - If it is, append the word to the list associated with that key.\n   - If it is not, create a new entry in the dictionary with the sorted key and initialize it with a list containing the current word.\n\n5. After processing all words, the dictionary values will be the groups of anagrams.\n\n6. Convert the dictionary values to a list of lists and return it.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    anagrams = {}\n    for word in words:\n        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))\n        if sorted_word in anagrams:\n            anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)\n        else:\n            anagrams[sorted_word] = [word]\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\nwords = [\"verbatim\", \"ambivert\", \"redictation\", \"tinoceratid\", \"cerastes\", \"cateress\", \"tylosis\", \"tossily\"]\nresult = group_anagrams(words)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and grouped the words into anagrams as expected. The output is a list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nThe groups of anagrams are:\n- \"verbatim\" and \"ambivert\"\n- \"redictation\" and \"tinoceratid\"\n- \"cerastes\" and \"cateress\"\n- \"tylosis\" and \"tossily\"\n\nThe output matches the expected format. \n\n<<<[['verbatim', 'ambivert'], ['redictation', 'tinoceratid'], ['cerastes', 'cateress'], ['tylosis', 'tossily']>>>"
