    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that are anagrams of each other. An effective way to do this is by sorting the characters in each word. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted character sequence.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Create a dictionary to store groups of anagrams. The key will be the sorted tuple of characters, and the value will be a list of words that match this sorted character sequence.\n2. Iterate over each word in the list:\n   - Sort the characters in the word.\n   - Use the sorted tuple of characters as the key in the dictionary.\n   - Append the word to the list corresponding to this key.\n3. Extract the lists of anagrams from the dictionary and return them as the final result.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    \n    anagrams = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for word in words:\n        # Sort the word into a tuple of characters\n        sorted_word = tuple(sorted(word))\n        # Append the word to the corresponding anagram group\n        anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)\n    \n    # Return the list of anagram groups\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\nwords = [\"eldern\", \"lender\", \"fp\", \"pf\", \"cohere\", \"cheero\", \"anglican\", \"canaling\", \"converters\", \"reconverts\", \"wandy\", \"dawny\"]\nresult = group_anagrams(words)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and grouped the words into anagrams as expected. Each sublist in the output contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[['eldern', 'lender'], ['fp', 'pf'], ['cohere', 'cheero'], ['anglican', 'canaling'], ['converters', 'reconverts'], ['wandy', 'dawny']]>>>"
