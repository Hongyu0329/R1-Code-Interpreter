    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that can be rearranged to form each other. The most efficient way to do this is to sort the characters in each word and use the sorted word as a key in a dictionary. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted character sequence and thus will be grouped together under the same key.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n2. Iterate over each word in the list.\n3. For each word, sort the characters to form a key.\n4. Use this key to group words in the dictionary.\n5. Finally, extract the grouped anagrams from the dictionary and return them as a list of lists.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    anagrams = defaultdict(list)\n    for word in words:\n        # Sort the word to form the key\n        key = ''.join(sorted(word))\n        # Append the word to the corresponding anagram group\n        anagrams[key].append(word)\n    # Return the grouped anagrams as a list of lists\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\nwords = [\"binder\", \"rebind\", \"brined\", \"inbred\", \"saxonize\", \"oxazines\", \"snop\", \"pons\", \"wham\", \"hawm\", \"misacts\", \"mastics\", \"reparel\", \"pearler\"]\nresult = group_anagrams(words)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the grouped anagrams.",
    "The code executed successfully and grouped the words into anagrams. The output is a list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[['binder', 'rebind', 'brined', 'inbred'], ['saxonize', 'oxazines'], ['snop', 'pons'], ['wham', 'hawm'], ['misacts', 'mastics'], ['reparel', 'pearler']>>>"
