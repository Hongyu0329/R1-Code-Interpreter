    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that can be rearranged to form each other. The most efficient way to do this is to sort the characters in each word and use the sorted word as a key in a dictionary. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted character sequence and thus will be grouped together under the same key.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning and approach:\n\n1. **Initialize a dictionary**: This will store the sorted word as the key and a list of words (anagrams) as the value.\n\n2. **Iterate through each word** in the given list:\n   - Sort the characters of the word.\n   - Use the sorted word as a key in the dictionary.\n   - Append the original word to the list corresponding to the sorted key.\n\n3. **Extract the values** from the dictionary, which will be lists of anagrams.\n\n4. **Return the list of lists** of anagrams.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    anagrams = defaultdict(list)\n    for word in words:\n        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))\n        anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\nwords = [\"employers\", \"reemploys\", \"ciselure\", \"ciseleur\", \"crusilee\", \"poppel\", \"popple\", \"sepia\", \"paise\", \n         \"ropeman\", \"manrope\", \"proceeds\", \"procedes\", \"entrep\", \"repent\", \"terpen\", \"perten\", \"toodle\", \n         \"looted\", \"tooled\", \"evanid\", \"invade\", \"viande\", \"dread\", \"dared\"]\n\nresult = group_anagrams(words)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will group the words into lists of anagrams and print the result. Let's execute the code to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and grouped the words into lists of anagrams. The output is a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n<<<[['employers', 'reemploys'], ['ciselure', 'ciseleur', 'crusilee'], ['poppel', 'popple'], ['sepia', 'paise'], ['ropeman', 'manrope'], ['proceeds', 'procedes'], ['entrep', 'repent', 'terpen', 'perten'], ['toodle', 'looted', 'tooled'], ['evanid', 'invade', 'viande'], ['dread', 'dared']>>>"
