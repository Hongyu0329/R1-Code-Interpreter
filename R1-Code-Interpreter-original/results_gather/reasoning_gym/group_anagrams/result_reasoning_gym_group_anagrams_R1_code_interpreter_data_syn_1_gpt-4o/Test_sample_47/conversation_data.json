    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that can be rearranged to form each other. A common approach is to sort the characters in each word and use the sorted word as a key in a dictionary. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted key.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n2. Iterate over each word in the list.\n3. For each word, sort the characters to form a key.\n4. Use this sorted key to group words in the dictionary.\n5. If the key is already in the dictionary, append the word to the list associated with that key.\n6. If the key is not in the dictionary, create a new entry with the word in a list.\n7. Finally, extract all the lists of anagrams from the dictionary and return them.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    anagrams = {}\n    for word in words:\n        # Sort the word to form the key\n        key = ''.join(sorted(word))\n        # Group words by their sorted key\n        if key in anagrams:\n            anagrams[key].append(word)\n        else:\n            anagrams[key] = [word]\n    # Return the grouped anagrams\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\nwords = [\"ensuing\", \"gunnies\", \"delapse\", \"elapsed\", \"sepaled\", \"iridous\", \"isuroid\", \"beatille\", \"etabelli\"]\nresult = group_anagrams(words)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will group the words into anagrams and print the result. Let's execute it to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and grouped the words into anagrams as expected. The output is a list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<[['ensuing', 'gunnies'], ['delapse', 'elapsed', 'sepaled'], ['iridous', 'isuroid'], ['beatille', 'etabelli']]>>>"
