    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that are anagrams of each other. An effective way to do this is by sorting the characters in each word. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted character sequence.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Initialize a dictionary**: This will map the sorted character sequence to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n2. **Iterate through each word**: For each word, sort its characters to form a key.\n\n3. **Group words by their sorted character sequence**: Use the sorted sequence as a key in the dictionary and append the word to the corresponding list.\n\n4. **Extract the grouped anagrams**: The values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    \n    anagrams = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for word in words:\n        # Sort the word to get the key\n        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))\n        # Append the word to the corresponding list in the dictionary\n        anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)\n    \n    # Return the grouped anagrams as a list of lists\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\nwords = [\"encrinital\", \"tricennial\", \"sequan\", \"queans\", \"diasters\", \"disaster\", \"warranties\", \"warrantise\", \"siak\", \"saki\", \"sika\"]\nresult = group_anagrams(words)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will group the words into anagrams and print the result. Let's execute it to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors. The output is a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nThe final answer, with the anagrams grouped together, is:\n\n<<<[['encrinital', 'tricennial'], ['sequan', 'queans'], ['diasters', 'disaster'], ['warranties', 'warrantise'], ['siak', 'saki', 'sika']>>>"
