    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that are composed of the same letters. A common approach is to sort the letters of each word and use the sorted word as a key in a dictionary. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted key and can be grouped together.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n2. Iterate over each word in the list.\n3. For each word, sort its letters alphabetically to form a key.\n4. Use this sorted key to group words in the dictionary.\n5. If the key is already in the dictionary, append the word to the list associated with that key.\n6. If the key is not in the dictionary, create a new entry with the key and start a new list with the current word.\n7. After processing all words, extract the lists of anagrams from the dictionary.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    anagrams = defaultdict(list)\n    for word in words:\n        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))\n        anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\nwords = [\"taplash\", \"asphalt\", \"spathal\", \"melam\", \"lemma\", \"kirve\", \"kiver\", \"duali\", \"dulia\", \n         \"harpists\", \"tsarship\", \"starship\", \"wonnot\", \"wonton\", \"mowha\", \"mohwa\", \"caupo\", \n         \"acoup\", \"bucrnia\", \"rubican\", \"brucina\"]\n\nresult = group_anagrams(words)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will group the words into lists of anagrams and print the result. Let's execute it to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and grouped the words into lists of anagrams. The output is a list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<[['taplash', 'asphalt', 'spathal'], ['melam', 'lemma'], ['kirve', 'kiver'], ['duali', 'dulia'], ['harpists', 'tsarship', 'starship'], ['wonnot', 'wonton'], ['mowha', 'mohwa'], ['caupo', 'acoup'], ['bucrnia', 'rubican', 'brucina']]>>>"
