  "question": "An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of a different word, using all the original letters exactly once.\n\nYour job is to group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.\n\nThe output is a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets, where each outer list contains a group of anagrams, e.g. <<<[[\"eat\", \"tea\"], [\"tan\", \"nat\"]]>>>.\n\nGroup the following list of words into anagrams:\n[\"omnitenent\", \"intonement\", \"rightable\", \"bergalith\", \"missary\", \"syriasm\"]\n",

    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that are anagrams of each other. An effective way to do this is by sorting the characters in each word. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted character sequence.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Create a dictionary to store groups of anagrams. The key will be the sorted tuple of characters, and the value will be a list of words that match that sorted character sequence.\n2. Iterate over each word in the list.\n3. Sort the characters in the word to create a key.\n4. Add the word to the list corresponding to the sorted character sequence in the dictionary.\n5. Extract the lists of anagrams from the dictionary and return them.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nwords = [\"omnitenent\", \"intonement\", \"rightable\", \"bergalith\", \"missary\", \"syriasm\"]\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    anagrams = defaultdict(list)\n    for word in words:\n        # Sort the word to form the key\n        key = tuple(sorted(word))\n        # Append the word to the corresponding list in the dictionary\n        anagrams[key].append(word)\n    # Return the values of the dictionary as a list of lists\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\n# Group the anagrams\nresult = group_anagrams(words)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will group the words into lists of anagrams. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and grouped the words into anagrams as expected. Each list within the output contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<[['omnitenent', 'intonement'], ['rightable', 'bergalith'], ['missary', 'syriasm']>>>"
