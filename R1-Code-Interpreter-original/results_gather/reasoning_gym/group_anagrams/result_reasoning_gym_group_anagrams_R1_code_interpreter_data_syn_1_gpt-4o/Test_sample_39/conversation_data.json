    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that are anagrams of each other. An effective way to do this is by sorting the characters in each word. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted character sequence.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Initialize a dictionary**: This will map the sorted character sequence to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n2. **Iterate through each word**: For each word, sort the characters to form a key.\n\n3. **Group words by their sorted character sequence**: Use the sorted sequence as a key in the dictionary and append the word to the corresponding list.\n\n4. **Extract the grouped anagrams**: The values of the dictionary will be the grouped anagrams.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nwords = [\"sporogeny\", \"gynospore\", \"lamellae\", \"malellae\", \"reptatorial\", \"proletariat\", \"madecase\", \"academes\", \"chrome\", \"chomer\", \"barcoo\", \"baroco\", \"showering\", \"reshowing\"]\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    anagrams = defaultdict(list)\n    for word in words:\n        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))\n        anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\nresult = group_anagrams(words)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will group the words into lists of anagrams and print the result. Let's execute the code to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and it grouped the words into anagrams as expected. The output is a list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<[['sporogeny', 'gynospore'], ['lamellae', 'malellae'], ['reptatorial', 'proletariat'], ['madecase', 'academes'], ['chrome', 'chomer'], ['barcoo', 'baroco'], ['showering', 'reshowing']]>>>"
