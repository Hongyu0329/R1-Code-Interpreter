    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that are anagrams of each other. An effective way to do this is by sorting the characters in each word. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted character sequence.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Create a dictionary to store groups of anagrams. The key will be the sorted tuple of the word, and the value will be a list of words that match this sorted tuple.\n2. Iterate over each word in the list.\n3. Sort the characters in the word to create a key.\n4. Add the word to the list corresponding to the sorted key in the dictionary.\n5. Finally, extract the lists of anagrams from the dictionary and return them.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    \n    anagrams = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for word in words:\n        # Sort the word to form the key\n        sorted_word = tuple(sorted(word))\n        # Append the word to the corresponding list in the dictionary\n        anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)\n    \n    # Return the values of the dictionary as a list of lists\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\nwords = [\"sanes\", \"sensa\", \"sidewalk\", \"walkside\", \"evictors\", \"vortices\", \"ratan\", \"antar\", \"antra\", \"sata\", \"asta\", \"diopside\", \"dipodies\", \"ga\", \"ag\", \"lader\", \"daler\", \"readl\", \"solver\", \"lovers\"]\nresult = group_anagrams(words)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the grouped anagrams.",
    "The code executed successfully and grouped the anagrams as expected. The output is a list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n<<<[['sanes', 'sensa'], ['sidewalk', 'walkside'], ['evictors', 'vortices'], ['ratan', 'antar', 'antra'], ['sata', 'asta'], ['diopside', 'dipodies'], ['ga', 'ag'], ['lader', 'daler', 'readl'], ['solver', 'lovers']]>>>"
