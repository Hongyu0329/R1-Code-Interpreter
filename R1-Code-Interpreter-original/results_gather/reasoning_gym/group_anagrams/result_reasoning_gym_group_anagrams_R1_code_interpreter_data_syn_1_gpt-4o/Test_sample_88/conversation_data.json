    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that are composed of the same letters. A common approach is to sort the letters of each word alphabetically and use the sorted word as a key in a dictionary. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted key.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n2. Iterate over each word in the list.\n3. For each word, sort its letters alphabetically to form a key.\n4. Use this sorted key to group words in the dictionary.\n5. If the key is already in the dictionary, append the word to the list of anagrams for that key.\n6. If the key is not in the dictionary, create a new entry with the word in a list.\n7. Finally, extract all the lists of anagrams from the dictionary and return them.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    anagrams = {}\n    for word in words:\n        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))\n        if sorted_word in anagrams:\n            anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)\n        else:\n            anagrams[sorted_word] = [word]\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\nwords = [\"cerris\", \"criers\", \"ricers\", \"boarders\", \"reboards\", \"viatores\", \"travoise\", \"votaries\", \n         \"liberally\", \"libellary\", \"ovensman\", \"snemovna\", \"intertwin\", \"inwritten\", \"melonist\", \n         \"telonism\", \"xeronate\", \"exornate\", \"contadino\", \"anticodon\", \"cowardy\", \"cowyard\"]\n\nresult = group_anagrams(words)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will group the words into lists of anagrams and print the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and grouped the words into lists of anagrams. Each list contains words that are anagrams of each other. The output matches the expected format, and there are no errors.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n<<<[['cerris', 'criers', 'ricers'], ['boarders', 'reboards'], ['viatores', 'travoise', 'votaries'], ['liberally', 'libellary'], ['ovensman', 'snemovna'], ['intertwin', 'inwritten'], ['melonist', 'telonism'], ['xeronate', 'exornate'], ['contadino', 'anticodon'], ['cowardy', 'cowyard']]>>>"
