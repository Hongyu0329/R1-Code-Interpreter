    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that can be rearranged to form each other. The most efficient way to do this is to sort the characters in each word and use the sorted word as a key in a dictionary. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted character sequence.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n2. Iterate over each word in the list.\n3. For each word, sort its characters to form a key.\n4. Use this key to group words in the dictionary.\n5. Finally, extract the groups of anagrams from the dictionary and return them as a list of lists.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    anagrams = {}\n    for word in words:\n        # Sort the word to form the key\n        key = ''.join(sorted(word))\n        # Add the word to the corresponding anagram group\n        if key in anagrams:\n            anagrams[key].append(word)\n        else:\n            anagrams[key] = [word]\n    # Return the grouped anagrams as a list of lists\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\nwords = [\"bouffon\", \"buffoon\", \"balanites\", \"basaltine\", \"stainable\", \"pactolian\", \"placation\", \"pactional\"]\nresult = group_anagrams(words)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and grouped the words into anagrams. Based on the output, the words have been grouped as follows:\n\n- \"bouffon\" and \"buffoon\" are anagrams.\n- \"balanites\", \"basaltine\", and \"stainable\" are anagrams.\n- \"pactolian\", \"placation\", and \"pactional\" are anagrams.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[['bouffon', 'buffoon'], ['balanites', 'basaltine', 'stainable'], ['pactolian', 'placation', 'pactional']>>>"
