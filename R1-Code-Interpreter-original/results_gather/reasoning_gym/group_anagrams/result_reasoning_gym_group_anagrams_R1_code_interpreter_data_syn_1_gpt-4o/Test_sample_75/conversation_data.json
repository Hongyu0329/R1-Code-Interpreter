  "question": "An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of a different word, using all the original letters exactly once.\n\nYour job is to group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.\n\nThe output is a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets, where each outer list contains a group of anagrams, e.g. <<<[[\"eat\", \"tea\"], [\"tan\", \"nat\"]]>>>.\n\nGroup the following list of words into anagrams:\n[\"mal\", \"lam\", \"nonvisitation\", \"innovationist\", \"sept\", \"pest\", \"step\", \"pets\", \"osmophore\", \"sophomore\", \"malleted\", \"metalled\"]\n",

    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that are anagrams of each other. An effective way to do this is by sorting the characters in each word. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted character sequence.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Initialize a dictionary**: This will map the sorted character sequence to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n2. **Iterate through each word**: For each word, sort the characters to form a key.\n\n3. **Group words by sorted key**: Use the sorted key to group words in the dictionary.\n\n4. **Extract the groups**: The values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    anagrams = defaultdict(list)\n    for word in words:\n        # Sort the word to form the key\n        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))\n        # Append the word to the corresponding list in the dictionary\n        anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)\n    # Return the grouped anagrams as a list of lists\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\nwords = [\"mal\", \"lam\", \"nonvisitation\", \"innovationist\", \"sept\", \"pest\", \"step\", \"pets\", \"osmophore\", \"sophomore\", \"malleted\", \"metalled\"]\nresult = group_anagrams(words)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and it grouped the words into anagrams as expected. Now, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<[['mal', 'lam'], ['nonvisitation', 'innovationist'], ['sept', 'pest', 'step', 'pets'], ['osmophore', 'sophomore'], ['malleted', 'metalled']]>>>"
