    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to identify words that can be rearranged to form each other. The most efficient way to do this is to sort the characters in each word and use the sorted word as a key in a dictionary. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted character sequence.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams. The keys will be the sorted character sequences, and the values will be lists of words that match those sequences.\n\n2. Iterate over each word in the list:\n   - Sort the characters in the word to create a key.\n   - If the key is not in the dictionary, add it with the current word as the first element in the list.\n   - If the key is already in the dictionary, append the current word to the list associated with that key.\n\n3. Once all words have been processed, the dictionary values will be the groups of anagrams.\n\n4. Convert the dictionary values to a list of lists for the final output.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nwords = [\"asseour\", \"arouses\", \"prev\", \"perv\", \"wined\", \"dwine\", \"edwin\"]\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    anagrams = defaultdict(list)\n    for word in words:\n        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))\n        anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\nresult = group_anagrams(words)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will group the words into anagrams and print the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and grouped the words into anagrams as expected. The output is a list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<[['asseour', 'arouses'], ['prev', 'perv'], ['wined', 'dwine', 'edwin']>>>"
