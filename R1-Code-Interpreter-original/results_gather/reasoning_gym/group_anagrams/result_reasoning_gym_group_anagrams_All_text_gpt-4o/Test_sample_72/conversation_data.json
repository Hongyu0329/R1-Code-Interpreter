    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words `[\"tautest\", \"statute\", \"scrabe\", \"braces\"]`.\n\n3. **Sorting Method**: A common method to determine if two words are anagrams is to sort the letters of each word alphabetically. If two words are anagrams, their sorted versions will be identical.\n\n4. **Group Anagrams**:\n   - Create a dictionary to store groups of anagrams. The key will be the sorted version of the word, and the value will be a list of words that are anagrams.\n   - Iterate through each word in the list:\n     - Sort the word alphabetically.\n     - Use the sorted word as a key in the dictionary.\n     - Append the original word to the list corresponding to the sorted key.\n\n5. **Construct the Output**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams.\n   - Collect these lists into a final list of lists.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The final output should be enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- For the word \"tautest\", the sorted version is \"aestttu\".\n- For the word \"statute\", the sorted version is \"aestttu\".\n- For the word \"scrabe\", the sorted version is \"abcers\".\n- For the word \"braces\", the sorted version is \"abcers\".\n\nUsing the sorted words as keys, we can group the original words as follows:\n- \"aestttu\": [\"tautest\", \"statute\"]\n- \"abcers\": [\"scrabe\", \"braces\"]\n\nThus, the groups of anagrams are:\n- [\"tautest\", \"statute\"]\n- [\"scrabe\", \"braces\"]\n\nThe final output, formatted as specified, is:\n\n<<<[[\"tautest\", \"statute\"], [\"scrabe\", \"braces\"]>>>"
