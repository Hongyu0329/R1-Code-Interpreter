    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"radical\", \"cardial\", \"evened\", \"vendee\", \"reduit\", \"erudit\", \"when\", \"hewn\", \"allower\", \"reallow\", \"apostle\", \"pelotas\", \"aseptol\"]`.\n\n3. **Sorting for Anagram Detection**: A common method to detect anagrams is to sort the characters in each word. If two words are anagrams, their sorted character arrays will be identical.\n\n4. **Group Words**: We will group words that have the same sorted character array.\n\n5. **Iterate and Group**:\n   - For each word in the list, sort the characters.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted character array to a list of words (anagrams).\n   - Append the word to the list corresponding to its sorted character array.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The result should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- \"radical\" and \"cardial\" are anagrams because sorted(\"radical\") = \"aacdilr\" and sorted(\"cardial\") = \"aacdilr\".\n- \"evened\" and \"vendee\" are anagrams because sorted(\"evened\") = \"deeenv\" and sorted(\"vendee\") = \"deeenv\".\n- \"reduit\" and \"erudit\" are anagrams because sorted(\"reduit\") = \"deirtu\" and sorted(\"erudit\") = \"deirtu\".\n- \"when\" and \"hewn\" are anagrams because sorted(\"when\") = \"ehnw\" and sorted(\"hewn\") = \"ehnw\".\n- \"allower\" and \"reallow\" are anagrams because sorted(\"allower\") = \"aellorw\" and sorted(\"reallow\") = \"aellorw\".\n- \"apostle\", \"pelotas\", and \"aseptol\" are anagrams because sorted(\"apostle\") = \"aelopst\", sorted(\"pelotas\") = \"aelopst\", and sorted(\"aseptol\") = \"aelopst\".\n\nNow, we can group these words into lists of anagrams:\n\n- Group 1: [\"radical\", \"cardial\"]\n- Group 2: [\"evened\", \"vendee\"]\n- Group 3: [\"reduit\", \"erudit\"]\n- Group 4: [\"when\", \"hewn\"]\n- Group 5: [\"allower\", \"reallow\"]\n- Group 6: [\"apostle\", \"pelotas\", \"aseptol\"]\n\nThe final output, formatted as specified, is:\n\n<<<[[\"radical\", \"cardial\"], [\"evened\", \"vendee\"], [\"reduit\", \"erudit\"], [\"when\", \"hewn\"], [\"allower\", \"reallow\"], [\"apostle\", \"pelotas\", \"aseptol\"]>>>"
