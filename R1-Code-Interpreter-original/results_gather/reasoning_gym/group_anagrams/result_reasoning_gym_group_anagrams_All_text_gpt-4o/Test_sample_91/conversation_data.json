    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, using all the original letters exactly once. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Identify the Task**: We need to group words that are anagrams of each other from the given list.\n\n3. **Input List**: The list of words provided is `[\"dichromat\", \"chromatid\", \"lanose\", \"anoles\"]`.\n\n4. **Approach to Group Anagrams**:\n   - For each word, sort the letters in alphabetical order. This will help in identifying anagrams because anagrams will have the same sorted character sequence.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted character sequence to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sequence.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Take the first word \"dichromat\", sort its letters to get \"acdhimort\".\n   - Take the second word \"chromatid\", sort its letters to get \"acdhimort\". Since it matches the sorted sequence of \"dichromat\", they are anagrams.\n   - Take the third word \"lanose\", sort its letters to get \"aelnos\".\n   - Take the fourth word \"anoles\", sort its letters to get \"aelnos\". Since it matches the sorted sequence of \"lanose\", they are anagrams.\n\n6. **Group the Words**:\n   - Group 1: [\"dichromat\", \"chromatid\"] (both have the sorted sequence \"acdhimort\").\n   - Group 2: [\"lanose\", \"anoles\"] (both have the sorted sequence \"aelnos\").\n\n7. **Output the Result**: The final output should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n<<<[[\"dichromat\", \"chromatid\"], [\"lanose\", \"anoles\"]>>>"
