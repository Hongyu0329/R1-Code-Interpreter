    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have a list of words that need to be grouped into anagrams:\n   ```\n   [\"prepared\", \"dapperer\", \"upstare\", \"pasteur\", \"atiptoe\", \"atopite\", \"parlatory\", \"portrayal\", \"debriding\", \"rebidding\", \"sombreness\", \"somberness\", \"zabian\", \"banzai\", \"secondi\", \"codeins\", \"nofile\", \"enfoil\", \"chalmer\", \"charmel\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Sorting Method**: A common method to determine if two words are anagrams is to sort the characters of each word. If two words are anagrams, their sorted character arrays will be identical.\n\n4. **Grouping Process**:\n   - Create a dictionary to map the sorted tuple of characters to a list of words (anagrams).\n   - Iterate through each word in the list:\n     - Sort the word to get a tuple of characters.\n     - Use this tuple as a key in the dictionary.\n     - Append the word to the list corresponding to this key in the dictionary.\n\n5. **Extract Results**: The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams. These lists are the required groups.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given list of words:\n\n- \"prepared\" and \"dapperer\" are anagrams.\n- \"upstare\" and \"pasteur\" are anagrams.\n- \"atiptoe\" and \"atopite\" are anagrams.\n- \"parlatory\" and \"portrayal\" are anagrams.\n- \"debriding\" and \"rebidding\" are anagrams.\n- \"sombreness\" and \"somberness\" are anagrams.\n- \"zabian\" and \"banzai\" are anagrams.\n- \"secondi\" and \"codeins\" are anagrams.\n- \"nofile\" and \"enfoil\" are anagrams.\n- \"chalmer\" and \"charmel\" are anagrams.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"prepared\", \"dapperer\"], [\"upstare\", \"pasteur\"], [\"atiptoe\", \"atopite\"], [\"parlatory\", \"portrayal\"], [\"debriding\", \"rebidding\"], [\"sombreness\", \"somberness\"], [\"zabian\", \"banzai\"], [\"secondi\", \"codeins\"], [\"nofile\", \"enfoil\"], [\"chalmer\", \"charmel\"]>>>"
