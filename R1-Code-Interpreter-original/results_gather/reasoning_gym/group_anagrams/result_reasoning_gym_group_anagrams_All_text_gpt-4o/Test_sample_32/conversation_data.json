    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Identify Unique Key for Anagrams**: A common method to identify anagrams is to sort the characters in the word. If two words are anagrams, their sorted character arrays will be identical.\n\n3. **Group Words by Anagram Key**: We will use a dictionary to group words. The key will be the sorted tuple of characters, and the value will be a list of words that match this key.\n\n4. **Iterate Over the List of Words**: For each word in the list, sort the characters to form the key, and then append the word to the list corresponding to this key in the dictionary.\n\n5. **Extract the Groups**: Once all words are processed, the values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final output should be a list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list of words:\n\n- **Words**: [\"taplash\", \"asphalt\", \"spathal\", \"melam\", \"lemma\", \"kirve\", \"kiver\", \"duali\", \"dulia\", \"harpists\", \"tsarship\", \"starship\", \"wonnot\", \"wonton\", \"mowha\", \"mohwa\", \"caupo\", \"acoup\", \"bucrnia\", \"rubican\", \"brucina\"]\n\n- **Step-by-Step Grouping**:\n  - \"taplash\", \"asphalt\", \"spathal\" are anagrams (sorted as \"aahlpst\").\n  - \"melam\", \"lemma\" are anagrams (sorted as \"aelmm\").\n  - \"kirve\", \"kiver\" are anagrams (sorted as \"eikrv\").\n  - \"duali\", \"dulia\" are anagrams (sorted as \"adil\").\n  - \"harpists\", \"tsarship\", \"starship\" are anagrams (sorted as \"ahiprsst\").\n  - \"wonnot\", \"wonton\" are anagrams (sorted as \"nnootw\").\n  - \"mowha\", \"mohwa\" are anagrams (sorted as \"ahmow\").\n  - \"caupo\", \"acoup\" are anagrams (sorted as \"acopu\").\n  - \"bucrnia\", \"rubican\", \"brucina\" are anagrams (sorted as \"abcinru\").\n\n- **Final Grouping**:\n  - Group 1: [\"taplash\", \"asphalt\", \"spathal\"]\n  - Group 2: [\"melam\", \"lemma\"]\n  - Group 3: [\"kirve\", \"kiver\"]\n  - Group 4: [\"duali\", \"dulia\"]\n  - Group 5: [\"harpists\", \"tsarship\", \"starship\"]\n  - Group 6: [\"wonnot\", \"wonton\"]\n  - Group 7: [\"mowha\", \"mohwa\"]\n  - Group 8: [\"caupo\", \"acoup\"]\n  - Group 9: [\"bucrnia\", \"rubican\", \"brucina\"]\n\nThe final answer, formatted as required, is:\n\n<<<[[\"taplash\", \"asphalt\", \"spathal\"], [\"melam\", \"lemma\"], [\"kirve\", \"kiver\"], [\"duali\", \"dulia\"], [\"harpists\", \"tsarship\", \"starship\"], [\"wonnot\", \"wonton\"], [\"mowha\", \"mohwa\"], [\"caupo\", \"acoup\"], [\"bucrnia\", \"rubican\", \"brucina\"]>>>"
