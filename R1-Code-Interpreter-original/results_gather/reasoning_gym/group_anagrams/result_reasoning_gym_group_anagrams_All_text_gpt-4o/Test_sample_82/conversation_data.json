    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the following list of words: \n   - [\"yardland\", \"landyard\", \"peorian\", \"apeiron\", \"darns\", \"nards\", \"maternities\", \"semitertian\", \"seicento\", \"cenosite\"]\n\n3. **Identify Anagrams**: To identify anagrams, we can sort the letters of each word. Words that are anagrams of each other will have the same sorted letter sequence.\n\n4. **Group Anagrams**: We will group words that have the same sorted letter sequence.\n\n5. **Output Format**: The output should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nLet's analyze the given list:\n\n- \"yardland\" and \"landyard\" are anagrams because sorting their letters gives the same sequence: \"aadlnrdy\".\n- \"peorian\" and \"apeiron\" are anagrams because sorting their letters gives: \"aeinopr\".\n- \"darns\" and \"nards\" are anagrams because sorting their letters gives: \"adnrs\".\n- \"maternities\" and \"semitertian\" are anagrams because sorting their letters gives: \"aeeiimnrstt\".\n- \"seicento\" and \"cenosite\" are anagrams because sorting their letters gives: \"ceeinost\".\n\nNow, we can group the words into anagrams:\n\n- Group 1: [\"yardland\", \"landyard\"]\n- Group 2: [\"peorian\", \"apeiron\"]\n- Group 3: [\"darns\", \"nards\"]\n- Group 4: [\"maternities\", \"semitertian\"]\n- Group 5: [\"seicento\", \"cenosite\"]\n\nFinally, we present the output in the required format:\n\n<<<[[\"yardland\", \"landyard\"], [\"peorian\", \"apeiron\"], [\"darns\", \"nards\"], [\"maternities\", \"semitertian\"], [\"seicento\", \"cenosite\"]>>>"
