    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the following list of words:\n   - [\"unmail\", \"lumina\", \"alumin\", \"alumni\", \"endothecia\", \"theodicean\", \"shipholder\", \"holdership\", \"mestees\", \"esteems\", \"semiprivate\", \"imperatives\", \"deduces\", \"seduced\", \"depeche\", \"cheeped\"]\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, sort the characters in the word. This sorted version of the word will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted version.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - \"unmail\", \"lumina\", \"alumin\", \"alumni\": Sorting each gives \"ailmnu\". These are anagrams.\n   - \"endothecia\", \"theodicean\": Sorting each gives \"acdeehinot\". These are anagrams.\n   - \"shipholder\", \"holdership\": Sorting each gives \"dehhiloprs\". These are anagrams.\n   - \"mestees\", \"esteems\": Sorting each gives \"eeemsst\". These are anagrams.\n   - \"semiprivate\", \"imperatives\": Sorting each gives \"aeeiimprstv\". These are anagrams.\n   - \"deduces\", \"seduced\": Sorting each gives \"cddeesu\". These are anagrams.\n   - \"depeche\", \"cheeped\": Sorting each gives \"cdeeehp\". These are anagrams.\n\n5. **Output Format**: The output should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\n6. **Final Grouping**:\n   - Group 1: [\"unmail\", \"lumina\", \"alumin\", \"alumni\"]\n   - Group 2: [\"endothecia\", \"theodicean\"]\n   - Group 3: [\"shipholder\", \"holdership\"]\n   - Group 4: [\"mestees\", \"esteems\"]\n   - Group 5: [\"semiprivate\", \"imperatives\"]\n   - Group 6: [\"deduces\", \"seduced\"]\n   - Group 7: [\"depeche\", \"cheeped\"]\n\nThe final answer, formatted as specified, is:\n\n<<<[[\"unmail\", \"lumina\", \"alumin\", \"alumni\"], [\"endothecia\", \"theodicean\"], [\"shipholder\", \"holdership\"], [\"mestees\", \"esteems\"], [\"semiprivate\", \"imperatives\"], [\"deduces\", \"seduced\"], [\"depeche\", \"cheeped\"]>>>"
