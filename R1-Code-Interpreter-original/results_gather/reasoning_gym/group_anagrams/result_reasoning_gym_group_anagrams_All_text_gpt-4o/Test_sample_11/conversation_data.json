    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, using all the original letters exactly once. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Identify the Words to Group**: We are given a list of words: `[\"escrod\", \"decors\", \"scored\", \"semitaur\", \"muriates\"]`.\n\n3. **Sort the Letters of Each Word**: To determine if two words are anagrams, we can sort the letters of each word alphabetically. If two words are anagrams, their sorted versions will be identical.\n\n4. **Group Words by Their Sorted Version**:\n   - Sort the letters of \"escrod\" to get \"cdeors\".\n   - Sort the letters of \"decors\" to get \"cdeors\".\n   - Sort the letters of \"scored\" to get \"cdeors\".\n   - Sort the letters of \"semitaur\" to get \"aeimrstu\".\n   - Sort the letters of \"muriates\" to get \"aeimrstu\".\n\n5. **Create Groups Based on Sorted Words**:\n   - The words \"escrod\", \"decors\", and \"scored\" all have the sorted version \"cdeors\", so they form one group of anagrams.\n   - The words \"semitaur\" and \"muriates\" both have the sorted version \"aeimrstu\", so they form another group of anagrams.\n\n6. **Output the Groups**: We need to output the groups of anagrams as a list of lists of strings, enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nFollowing these steps, we can group the anagrams as follows:\n\n<<<[[\"escrod\", \"decors\", \"scored\"], [\"semitaur\", \"muriates\"]]>>>"
