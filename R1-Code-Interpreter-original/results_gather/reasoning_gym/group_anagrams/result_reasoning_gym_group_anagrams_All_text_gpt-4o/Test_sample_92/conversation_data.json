    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the following list of words:\n   - [\"hydronephrosis\", \"nephrohydrosis\", \"boarts\", \"tabors\", \"aborts\", \"bonaci\", \"bianco\", \"alnico\", \"oilcan\", \"nonskier\", \"einkorns\", \"cliftonia\", \"fictional\"]\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, we can sort the letters alphabetically. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted representation.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted representation to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - For each word, sort the letters to get the sorted representation.\n   - Use the sorted representation as a key in the dictionary.\n   - Append the original word to the list corresponding to the sorted key.\n   - If the key does not exist in the dictionary, create a new entry with the sorted key and initialize it with a list containing the current word.\n\n5. **Construct the Output**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams.\n   - Collect these lists into a final list of lists.\n\n6. **Output Format**:\n   - The output should be enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given list of words:\n\n- \"hydronephrosis\" and \"nephrohydrosis\" are anagrams.\n- \"boarts\", \"tabors\", and \"aborts\" are anagrams.\n- \"bonaci\" and \"bianco\" are anagrams.\n- \"alnico\" and \"oilcan\" are anagrams.\n- \"nonskier\" and \"einkorns\" are anagrams.\n- \"cliftonia\" and \"fictional\" are anagrams.\n\nBased on this analysis, the grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"hydronephrosis\", \"nephrohydrosis\"], [\"boarts\", \"tabors\", \"aborts\"], [\"bonaci\", \"bianco\"], [\"alnico\", \"oilcan\"], [\"nonskier\", \"einkorns\"], [\"cliftonia\", \"fictional\"]>>>"
