  "question": "An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of a different word, using all the original letters exactly once.\n\nYour job is to group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.\n\nThe output is a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets, where each outer list contains a group of anagrams, e.g. <<<[[\"eat\", \"tea\"], [\"tan\", \"nat\"]]>>>.\n\nGroup the following list of words into anagrams:\n[\"leveraged\", \"everglade\", \"rifest\", \"estrif\", \"telephotograph\", \"phototelegraph\", \"besot\", \"betso\"]\n",

    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"leveraged\", \"everglade\", \"rifest\", \"estrif\", \"telephotograph\", \"phototelegraph\", \"besot\", \"betso\"]`.\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, we can sort the characters in the word. This sorted version will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - **\"leveraged\"**: Sorted as \"adeeeglrv\". \n   - **\"everglade\"**: Sorted as \"adeeeglrv\". \n     - Both \"leveraged\" and \"everglade\" have the same sorted version, so they are anagrams.\n   - **\"rifest\"**: Sorted as \"efirst\".\n   - **\"estrif\"**: Sorted as \"efirst\".\n     - Both \"rifest\" and \"estrif\" have the same sorted version, so they are anagrams.\n   - **\"telephotograph\"**: Sorted as \"aeeghhloopprtt\".\n   - **\"phototelegraph\"**: Sorted as \"aeeghhloopprtt\".\n     - Both \"telephotograph\" and \"phototelegraph\" have the same sorted version, so they are anagrams.\n   - **\"besot\"**: Sorted as \"beost\".\n   - **\"betso\"**: Sorted as \"beost\".\n     - Both \"besot\" and \"betso\" have the same sorted version, so they are anagrams.\n\n5. **Group the Anagrams**:\n   - Group 1: [\"leveraged\", \"everglade\"]\n   - Group 2: [\"rifest\", \"estrif\"]\n   - Group 3: [\"telephotograph\", \"phototelegraph\"]\n   - Group 4: [\"besot\", \"betso\"]\n\n6. **Output Format**: The output should be a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<[[\"leveraged\", \"everglade\"], [\"rifest\", \"estrif\"], [\"telephotograph\", \"phototelegraph\"], [\"besot\", \"betso\"]>>>"
