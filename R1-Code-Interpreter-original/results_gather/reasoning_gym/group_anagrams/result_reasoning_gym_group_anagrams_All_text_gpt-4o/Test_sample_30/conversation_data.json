    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"verbatim\", \"ambivert\", \"redictation\", \"tinoceratid\", \"cerastes\", \"cateress\", \"tylosis\", \"tossily\"]`.\n\n3. **Sorting for Anagram Detection**: A common method to detect anagrams is to sort the characters in each word. If two words are anagrams, their sorted character arrays will be identical.\n\n4. **Group Words**: We will group words by their sorted character arrays. This means:\n   - Convert each word into a sorted tuple of characters.\n   - Use a dictionary to map each sorted tuple to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n5. **Iterate and Group**:\n   - For each word in the list, sort the characters.\n   - Use the sorted tuple as a key in a dictionary.\n   - Append the word to the list corresponding to this key.\n\n6. **Extract Groups**: Once all words are processed, extract the lists of anagrams from the dictionary.\n\n7. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- \"verbatim\" and \"ambivert\" are anagrams because their sorted characters are the same: \"abeimrtv\".\n- \"redictation\" and \"tinoceratid\" are anagrams because their sorted characters are the same: \"acdeiinoortt\".\n- \"cerastes\" and \"cateress\" are anagrams because their sorted characters are the same: \"aceersst\".\n- \"tylosis\" and \"tossily\" are anagrams because their sorted characters are the same: \"ilossyt\".\n\nNow, we can group them:\n\n- Group 1: [\"verbatim\", \"ambivert\"]\n- Group 2: [\"redictation\", \"tinoceratid\"]\n- Group 3: [\"cerastes\", \"cateress\"]\n- Group 4: [\"tylosis\", \"tossily\"]\n\nThe final output, formatted as specified, is:\n\n<<<[[\"verbatim\", \"ambivert\"], [\"redictation\", \"tinoceratid\"], [\"cerastes\", \"cateress\"], [\"tylosis\", \"tossily\"]>>>"
