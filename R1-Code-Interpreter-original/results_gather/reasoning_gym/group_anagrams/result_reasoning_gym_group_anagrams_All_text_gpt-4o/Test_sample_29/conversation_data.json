    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: \n   ```\n   [\"brontides\", \"stonebird\", \"horotelic\", \"ochrolite\", \"lackers\", \"calkers\", \"slacker\", \"rarely\", \"rearly\", \"unhearsed\", \"unsheared\", \"criey\", \"ricey\", \"scomfit\", \"comfits\", \"pergamic\", \"crimpage\", \"unrip\", \"purin\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, sort the characters in the word. This sorted version of the word will be the key to identify anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted word to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - Sort the characters of the word to form the key.\n   - If the key is already in the dictionary, append the word to the list associated with that key.\n   - If the key is not in the dictionary, create a new entry with this key and start a new list with the current word.\n   - Continue this process for all words in the list.\n\n5. **Extract Results**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams.\n   - Convert these values into a list of lists format.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given list of words:\n\n- \"brontides\" and \"stonebird\" are anagrams.\n- \"horotelic\" and \"ochrolite\" are anagrams.\n- \"lackers\", \"calkers\", and \"slacker\" are anagrams.\n- \"rarely\" and \"rearly\" are anagrams.\n- \"unhearsed\" and \"unsheared\" are anagrams.\n- \"criey\" and \"ricey\" are anagrams.\n- \"scomfit\" and \"comfits\" are anagrams.\n- \"pergamic\" and \"crimpage\" are anagrams.\n- \"unrip\" and \"purin\" are anagrams.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[\n  [\"brontides\", \"stonebird\"],\n  [\"horotelic\", \"ochrolite\"],\n  [\"lackers\", \"calkers\", \"slacker\"],\n  [\"rarely\", \"rearly\"],\n  [\"unhearsed\", \"unsheared\"],\n  [\"criey\", \"ricey\"],\n  [\"scomfit\", \"comfits\"],\n  [\"pergamic\", \"crimpage\"],\n  [\"unrip\", \"purin\"]\n]>>>"
