    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have a list of words that need to be grouped into anagrams:\n   ```\n   [\"glowered\", \"reglowed\", \"overs\", \"servo\", \"verso\", \"needham\", \"headmen\", \"trollopian\", \"pollinator\", \"soir\", \"sori\", \"astatizer\", \"zaratites\", \"gallian\", \"lingala\", \"triangulated\", \"adulterating\", \"autoradiographic\", \"radioautographic\", \"requitals\", \"quartiles\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Sorting for Anagram Detection**: To determine if two words are anagrams, sort the letters of each word alphabetically. If two words have the same sorted letter sequence, they are anagrams.\n\n4. **Group Anagrams**: Use a dictionary to group words by their sorted letter sequence. The key will be the sorted sequence, and the value will be a list of words (anagrams) that match this sequence.\n\n5. **Iterate Through the List**: For each word in the list, sort the letters, use the sorted sequence as a key in the dictionary, and append the word to the corresponding list.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: The values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams. Convert these values into a list of lists format.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- \"glowered\" and \"reglowed\" are anagrams.\n- \"overs\", \"servo\", and \"verso\" are anagrams.\n- \"needham\" and \"headmen\" are anagrams.\n- \"trollopian\" and \"pollinator\" are anagrams.\n- \"soir\" and \"sori\" are anagrams.\n- \"astatizer\" and \"zaratites\" are anagrams.\n- \"gallian\" and \"lingala\" are anagrams.\n- \"triangulated\" and \"adulterating\" are anagrams.\n- \"autoradiographic\" and \"radioautographic\" are anagrams.\n- \"requitals\" and \"quartiles\" are anagrams.\n\nNow, we can group them:\n\n<<<[[\"glowered\", \"reglowed\"], [\"overs\", \"servo\", \"verso\"], [\"needham\", \"headmen\"], [\"trollopian\", \"pollinator\"], [\"soir\", \"sori\"], [\"astatizer\", \"zaratites\"], [\"gallian\", \"lingala\"], [\"triangulated\", \"adulterating\"], [\"autoradiographic\", \"radioautographic\"], [\"requitals\", \"quartiles\"]>>>"
