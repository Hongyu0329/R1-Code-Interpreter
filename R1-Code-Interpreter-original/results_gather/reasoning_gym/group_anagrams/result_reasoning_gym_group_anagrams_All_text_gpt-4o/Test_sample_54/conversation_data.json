    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, using all the original letters exactly once. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Identify the Input and Output**: \n   - Input: A list of words `[\"hor\", \"rho\", \"unremote\", \"routemen\"]`.\n   - Output: A list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\n3. **Approach to Group Anagrams**:\n   - For each word in the list, sort the letters of the word alphabetically. This sorted version of the word will serve as a key to identify anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map each sorted word to a list of its anagrams.\n   - Iterate through the list of words, sort each word, and add it to the corresponding list in the dictionary.\n   - The keys of the dictionary will be the sorted words, and the values will be lists of words that are anagrams of each other.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Execution**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the groups of anagrams.\n   - For each word in the list:\n     - Sort the word alphabetically to get the key.\n     - Check if the key exists in the dictionary:\n       - If it exists, append the word to the list corresponding to that key.\n       - If it does not exist, create a new entry in the dictionary with the key and initialize it with a list containing the word.\n   - After processing all words, the dictionary will contain lists of anagrams.\n\n5. **Extract the Result**:\n   - The values of the dictionary are the groups of anagrams.\n   - Convert these values into a list of lists format.\n\n6. **Apply the Approach to the Given List**:\n   - \"hor\" and \"rho\" are anagrams because sorting both gives \"hor\".\n   - \"unremote\" and \"routemen\" are anagrams because sorting both gives \"eemnortu\".\n\n7. **Final Grouping**:\n   - Group 1: [\"hor\", \"rho\"]\n   - Group 2: [\"unremote\", \"routemen\"]\n\n8. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the result as specified: a list of lists enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[[\"hor\", \"rho\"], [\"unremote\", \"routemen\"]]>>>"
