    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have a list of words that need to be grouped into anagrams:\n   ```\n   [\"catso\", \"tacos\", \"houston\", \"nothous\", \"hontous\", \"kyung\", \"gunky\", \"reseaus\", \"ureases\", \"finials\", \"sailfin\", \"finalis\", \"scillain\", \"allicins\", \"queriers\", \"requires\", \"chesoun\", \"cohunes\", \"upsring\", \"pursing\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Sorting Method**: A common method to determine if two words are anagrams is to sort the letters of each word alphabetically. If two words are anagrams, their sorted forms will be identical.\n\n4. **Grouping Anagrams**:\n   - Create a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams).\n   - Iterate through each word in the list:\n     - Sort the word to get the key.\n     - Add the word to the list corresponding to the sorted key in the dictionary.\n   - The values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams.\n\n5. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nLet's apply this method to the given list:\n\n- **Step 1**: Initialize an empty dictionary to store the groups of anagrams.\n- **Step 2**: For each word in the list, sort the word to get the key.\n- **Step 3**: Add the word to the list in the dictionary corresponding to the sorted key.\n- **Step 4**: Extract the values from the dictionary, which are the groups of anagrams.\n\nNow, let's group the given words:\n\n- \"catso\" and \"tacos\" are anagrams.\n- \"houston\", \"nothous\", and \"hontous\" are anagrams.\n- \"kyung\" and \"gunky\" are anagrams.\n- \"reseaus\" and \"ureases\" are anagrams.\n- \"finials\", \"sailfin\", and \"finalis\" are anagrams.\n- \"scillain\" and \"allicins\" are anagrams.\n- \"queriers\" and \"requires\" are anagrams.\n- \"chesoun\" and \"cohunes\" are anagrams.\n- \"upsring\" and \"pursing\" are anagrams.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"catso\", \"tacos\"], [\"houston\", \"nothous\", \"hontous\"], [\"kyung\", \"gunky\"], [\"reseaus\", \"ureases\"], [\"finials\", \"sailfin\", \"finalis\"], [\"scillain\", \"allicins\"], [\"queriers\", \"requires\"], [\"chesoun\", \"cohunes\"], [\"upsring\", \"pursing\"]>>>"
