    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Approach**: \n   - For each word, we can sort the characters in the word. This sorted version of the word will be the same for all its anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to group words by their sorted character sequence. The key will be the sorted word, and the value will be a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted sequence.\n\n3. **Steps**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to hold the groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - Sort the characters of the word to form the key.\n   - If the key is not in the dictionary, add it with an empty list as its value.\n   - Append the original word to the list corresponding to the sorted key.\n   - After processing all words, the dictionary values will be the groups of anagrams.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - For each word, sort the word to get the key.\n   - Use the dictionary to group words by their sorted key.\n   - Extract the values from the dictionary to get the list of anagram groups.\n\n5. **Example**:\n   - For the word \"woolf\", the sorted key is \"floow\".\n   - For the word \"wolof\", the sorted key is \"floow\".\n   - Both \"woolf\" and \"wolof\" will be grouped together.\n\n6. **Final Grouping**:\n   - After processing all words, extract the groups from the dictionary.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given list of words:\n\n- \"woolf\" and \"wolof\" are anagrams.\n- \"sye\", \"yes\", and \"sey\" are anagrams.\n- \"poetaster\" and \"operettas\" are anagrams.\n- \"demisolde\" and \"melodised\" are anagrams.\n- \"swarth\", \"thraws\", and \"wraths\" are anagrams.\n- \"ark\" and \"kra\" are anagrams.\n- \"antiextreme\" and \"exterminate\" are anagrams.\n- \"denis\", \"snide\", and \"nides\" are anagrams.\n- \"bago\" and \"boga\" are anagrams.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"woolf\", \"wolof\"], [\"sye\", \"yes\", \"sey\"], [\"poetaster\", \"operettas\"], [\"demisolde\", \"melodised\"], [\"swarth\", \"thraws\", \"wraths\"], [\"ark\", \"kra\"], [\"antiextreme\", \"exterminate\"], [\"denis\", \"snide\", \"nides\"], [\"bago\", \"boga\"]>>>"
