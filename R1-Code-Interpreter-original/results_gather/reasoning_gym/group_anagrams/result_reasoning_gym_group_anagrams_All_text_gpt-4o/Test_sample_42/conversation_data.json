    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have a list of words: \n   ```\n   [\"spignel\", \"spingel\", \"kra\", \"ark\", \"romance\", \"cremona\", \"ascebc\", \"ebcasc\", \"spoored\", \"prosode\", \"corrida\", \"ricardo\", \"brisk\", \"birks\", \"stract\", \"tracts\", \"tusseh\", \"tushes\", \"shutes\", \"calipers\", \"spiracle\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, sort the letters alphabetically. This sorted version will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - Sort the letters of the word to create a key.\n   - If the key is already in the dictionary, append the word to the list associated with that key.\n   - If the key is not in the dictionary, create a new entry with this key and start a new list with the current word.\n   - Continue this process for all words.\n\n5. **Extract Results**: \n   - The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams. These lists are the groups we need.\n\n6. **Output Format**: \n   - The final output should be a list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given list of words:\n\n- \"spignel\" and \"spingel\" are anagrams.\n- \"kra\" and \"ark\" are anagrams.\n- \"romance\" and \"cremona\" are anagrams.\n- \"ascebc\" and \"ebcasc\" are anagrams.\n- \"spoored\" and \"prosode\" are anagrams.\n- \"corrida\" and \"ricardo\" are anagrams.\n- \"brisk\" and \"birks\" are anagrams.\n- \"stract\" and \"tracts\" are anagrams.\n- \"tusseh\", \"tushes\", and \"shutes\" are anagrams.\n- \"calipers\" and \"spiracle\" are anagrams.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"spignel\", \"spingel\"], [\"kra\", \"ark\"], [\"romance\", \"cremona\"], [\"ascebc\", \"ebcasc\"], [\"spoored\", \"prosode\"], [\"corrida\", \"ricardo\"], [\"brisk\", \"birks\"], [\"stract\", \"tracts\"], [\"tusseh\", \"tushes\", \"shutes\"], [\"calipers\", \"spiracle\"]>>>"
