    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"coulisse\", \"leucosis\", \"ossicule\", \"phasianid\", \"aphidians\", \"neglecter\", \"reneglect\", \"marled\", \"medlar\", \"dermal\"]`.\n\n3. **Identify Anagram Groups**:\n   - For each word, sort the characters alphabetically. This sorted version will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n4. **Process Each Word**:\n   - \"coulisse\" -> sorted: \"ceilosu\" -> group: [\"coulisse\"]\n   - \"leucosis\" -> sorted: \"ceilosu\" -> group: [\"coulisse\", \"leucosis\"]\n   - \"ossicule\" -> sorted: \"ceilosu\" -> group: [\"coulisse\", \"leucosis\", \"ossicule\"]\n   - \"phasianid\" -> sorted: \"aadhiinps\" -> group: [\"phasianid\"]\n   - \"aphidians\" -> sorted: \"aadhiinps\" -> group: [\"phasianid\", \"aphidians\"]\n   - \"neglecter\" -> sorted: \"ceeglnt\" -> group: [\"neglecter\"]\n   - \"reneglect\" -> sorted: \"ceeglnt\" -> group: [\"neglecter\", \"reneglect\"]\n   - \"marled\" -> sorted: \"adelmr\" -> group: [\"marled\"]\n   - \"medlar\" -> sorted: \"adelmr\" -> group: [\"marled\", \"medlar\"]\n   - \"dermal\" -> sorted: \"adelmr\" -> group: [\"marled\", \"medlar\", \"dermal\"]\n\n5. **Collect the Groups**:\n   - After processing all words, collect the lists of anagrams from the dictionary.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - The result should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"coulisse\", \"leucosis\", \"ossicule\"], [\"phasianid\", \"aphidians\"], [\"neglecter\", \"reneglect\"], [\"marled\", \"medlar\", \"dermal\"]>>>"
