    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Approach**: \n   - For each word, sort the characters in the word alphabetically. This sorted version of the word will be the same for all its anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to group words by their sorted character sequence. The key will be the sorted word, and the value will be a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted sequence.\n\n3. **Steps**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to hold the groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - For each word, sort the characters to form the key.\n   - Check if this sorted key is already in the dictionary:\n     - If yes, append the word to the list corresponding to this key.\n     - If no, create a new entry in the dictionary with this key and start a new list with the current word.\n   - After processing all words, the dictionary will contain lists of anagrams.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - Extract the lists of anagrams from the dictionary and format them as a list of lists enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the given list of words:\n\n- **Words**: [\"drisk\", \"dirks\", \"weatherbreak\", \"breakweather\", \"torsion\", \"isotron\", \"nitroso\", \"bikram\", \"imbark\", \"carisa\", \"sciara\", \"certifying\", \"rectifying\", \"tapir\", \"atrip\", \"pairt\", \"parti\", \"perchloric\", \"prechloric\"]\n\n- **Grouping**:\n  - \"drisk\" and \"dirks\" are anagrams.\n  - \"weatherbreak\" and \"breakweather\" are anagrams.\n  - \"torsion\", \"isotron\", and \"nitroso\" are anagrams.\n  - \"bikram\" and \"imbark\" are anagrams.\n  - \"carisa\" and \"sciara\" are anagrams.\n  - \"certifying\" and \"rectifying\" are anagrams.\n  - \"tapir\", \"atrip\", \"pairt\", and \"parti\" are anagrams.\n  - \"perchloric\" and \"prechloric\" are anagrams.\n\n- **Final Grouping**:\n  - <<<[[\"drisk\", \"dirks\"], [\"weatherbreak\", \"breakweather\"], [\"torsion\", \"isotron\", \"nitroso\"], [\"bikram\", \"imbark\"], [\"carisa\", \"sciara\"], [\"certifying\", \"rectifying\"], [\"tapir\", \"atrip\", \"pairt\", \"parti\"], [\"perchloric\", \"prechloric\"]]>>>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[[\"drisk\", \"dirks\"], [\"weatherbreak\", \"breakweather\"], [\"torsion\", \"isotron\", \"nitroso\"], [\"bikram\", \"imbark\"], [\"carisa\", \"sciara\"], [\"certifying\", \"rectifying\"], [\"tapir\", \"atrip\", \"pairt\", \"parti\"], [\"perchloric\", \"prechloric\"]]>>>"
