    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"oliveness\", \"novelises\", \"reeler\", \"rereel\", \"anjan\", \"jnana\", \"suitings\", \"tissuing\"]`.\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, we can sort the characters in the word. This sorted version of the word will be the same for all its anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted version.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Process**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - Sort the characters of the word to get the key.\n   - If the key is not in the dictionary, add it with an empty list as its value.\n   - Append the original word to the list corresponding to the sorted key in the dictionary.\n\n5. **Construct the Output**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams.\n   - Collect these lists into a final list of lists.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The final output should be enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given list of words:\n\n- \"oliveness\" and \"novelises\" are anagrams because sorting both gives \"eeilnossv\".\n- \"reeler\" and \"rereel\" are anagrams because sorting both gives \"eeelrr\".\n- \"anjan\" and \"jnana\" are anagrams because sorting both gives \"aajnn\".\n- \"suitings\" and \"tissuing\" are anagrams because sorting both gives \"giinsstu\".\n\nThus, the groups of anagrams are:\n\n- Group 1: [\"oliveness\", \"novelises\"]\n- Group 2: [\"reeler\", \"rereel\"]\n- Group 3: [\"anjan\", \"jnana\"]\n- Group 4: [\"suitings\", \"tissuing\"]\n\nThe final output, formatted as required, is:\n\n<<<[[\"oliveness\", \"novelises\"], [\"reeler\", \"rereel\"], [\"anjan\", \"jnana\"], [\"suitings\", \"tissuing\"]>>>"
