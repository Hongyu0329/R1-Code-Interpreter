    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have a list of words that we need to group into anagrams:\n   ```\n   [\"unsober\", \"unrobes\", \"bournes\", \"pitsaw\", \"sawpit\", \"aristotle\", \"literatos\", \"striolate\", \"thaness\", \"hastens\", \"snathes\", \"arid\", \"raid\", \"dari\", \"dangering\", \"gandering\", \"gardening\", \"deranging\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Sorting for Anagram Detection**: A common method to detect anagrams is to sort the characters in each word. If two words are anagrams, their sorted character arrays will be identical.\n\n4. **Group Words**: We will use a dictionary to group words. The key will be the sorted tuple of characters, and the value will be a list of words that match this sorted character tuple.\n\n5. **Iterate and Group**: For each word in the list:\n   - Sort the word to get the character tuple.\n   - Use this tuple as a key in the dictionary.\n   - Append the word to the list corresponding to this key.\n\n6. **Extract Groups**: Once all words are processed, the values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams.\n\n7. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- **Group 1**: [\"unsober\", \"unrobes\", \"bournes\"] - All these words can be rearranged to form each other.\n- **Group 2**: [\"pitsaw\", \"sawpit\"] - These two words are anagrams.\n- **Group 3**: [\"aristotle\", \"literatos\", \"striolate\"] - These words are anagrams.\n- **Group 4**: [\"thaness\", \"hastens\", \"snathes\"] - These words are anagrams.\n- **Group 5**: [\"arid\", \"raid\", \"dari\"] - These words are anagrams.\n- **Group 6**: [\"dangering\", \"gandering\", \"gardening\", \"deranging\"] - These words are anagrams.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"unsober\", \"unrobes\", \"bournes\"], [\"pitsaw\", \"sawpit\"], [\"aristotle\", \"literatos\", \"striolate\"], [\"thaness\", \"hastens\", \"snathes\"], [\"arid\", \"raid\", \"dari\"], [\"dangering\", \"gandering\", \"gardening\", \"deranging\"]>>>"
