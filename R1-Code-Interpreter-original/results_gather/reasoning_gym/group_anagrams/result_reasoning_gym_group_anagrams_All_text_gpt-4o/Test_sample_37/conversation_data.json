    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words `[\"antlike\", \"atinkle\", \"salpoid\", \"psaloid\"]`.\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, we can sort the letters alphabetically. This sorted version will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to group words by their sorted version. The key will be the sorted word, and the value will be a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted key.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Take the first word \"antlike\", sort its letters to get \"aeiklnt\".\n   - Take the second word \"atinkle\", sort its letters to get \"aeiklnt\".\n   - Since \"antlike\" and \"atinkle\" have the same sorted letters, they are anagrams and should be grouped together.\n   - Take the third word \"salpoid\", sort its letters to get \"adilops\".\n   - Take the fourth word \"psaloid\", sort its letters to get \"adilops\".\n   - Since \"salpoid\" and \"psaloid\" have the same sorted letters, they are anagrams and should be grouped together.\n\n5. **Forming the Output**:\n   - We have two groups of anagrams: [\"antlike\", \"atinkle\"] and [\"salpoid\", \"psaloid\"].\n   - These groups can be represented as a list of lists.\n\n6. **Final Output**:\n   - The final output should be a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[[\"antlike\", \"atinkle\"], [\"salpoid\", \"psaloid\"]>>>"
