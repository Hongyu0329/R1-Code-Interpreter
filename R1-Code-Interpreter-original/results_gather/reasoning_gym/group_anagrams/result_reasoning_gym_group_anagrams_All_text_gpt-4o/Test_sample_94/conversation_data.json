    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, using all the original letters exactly once. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List of Words**: We have the list `[\"inferable\", \"refinable\", \"lindera\", \"ireland\"]`.\n\n3. **Identify Anagrams**:\n   - To determine if two words are anagrams, we can sort the letters of each word alphabetically and compare the results. If two words have the same sorted letter sequence, they are anagrams.\n   - Alternatively, we can count the frequency of each letter in the words and compare these counts.\n\n4. **Process Each Word**:\n   - Sort the letters of each word:\n     - \"inferable\" -> \"abeeefilnr\"\n     - \"refinable\" -> \"abeeefilnr\"\n     - \"lindera\" -> \"adeilnr\"\n     - \"ireland\" -> \"adeilnr\"\n   - From the sorted results, we can see:\n     - \"inferable\" and \"refinable\" have the same sorted letters, so they are anagrams.\n     - \"lindera\" and \"ireland\" have the same sorted letters, so they are anagrams.\n\n5. **Group the Anagrams**:\n   - Group words with the same sorted letter sequence together:\n     - Group 1: [\"inferable\", \"refinable\"]\n     - Group 2: [\"lindera\", \"ireland\"]\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - The final output should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nBy following these steps, we can group the given words into anagrams.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<[[\"inferable\", \"refinable\"], [\"lindera\", \"ireland\"]]>>>"
