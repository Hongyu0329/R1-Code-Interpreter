    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the following list of words to group into anagrams:\n   - [\"tex\", \"ext\", \"godding\", \"dodging\", \"upbreak\", \"breakup\", \"unmemoried\", \"unmemoired\", \"connected\", \"condecent\", \"logarithms\", \"algorithms\", \"electric\", \"lectrice\"]\n\n3. **Sorting Method**: A common method to determine if two words are anagrams is to sort the characters of each word. If two words are anagrams, their sorted character arrays will be identical.\n\n4. **Group Anagrams**: We will iterate through each word, sort its characters, and use the sorted word as a key to group words in a dictionary. Words that are anagrams will share the same key.\n\n5. **Construct the Output**: Once we have grouped the words, we will convert the dictionary values to a list of lists format.\n\nLet's go through the list and group the anagrams:\n\n- \"tex\" and \"ext\" are anagrams because sorted(\"tex\") = \"etx\" and sorted(\"ext\") = \"etx\".\n- \"godding\" and \"dodging\" are anagrams because sorted(\"godding\") = \"dgginod\" and sorted(\"dodging\") = \"dgginod\".\n- \"upbreak\" and \"breakup\" are anagrams because sorted(\"upbreak\") = \"abekpru\" and sorted(\"breakup\") = \"abekpru\".\n- \"unmemoried\" and \"unmemoired\" are anagrams because sorted(\"unmemoried\") = \"deeimmnoru\" and sorted(\"unmemoired\") = \"deeimmnoru\".\n- \"connected\" and \"condecent\" are anagrams because sorted(\"connected\") = \"ccdeennot\" and sorted(\"condecent\") = \"ccdeennot\".\n- \"logarithms\" and \"algorithms\" are anagrams because sorted(\"logarithms\") = \"aghilmorst\" and sorted(\"algorithms\") = \"aghilmorst\".\n- \"electric\" and \"lectrice\" are anagrams because sorted(\"electric\") = \"cceeilrt\" and sorted(\"lectrice\") = \"cceeilrt\".\n\nNow, we can group these words into lists of anagrams:\n\n- Group 1: [\"tex\", \"ext\"]\n- Group 2: [\"godding\", \"dodging\"]\n- Group 3: [\"upbreak\", \"breakup\"]\n- Group 4: [\"unmemoried\", \"unmemoired\"]\n- Group 5: [\"connected\", \"condecent\"]\n- Group 6: [\"logarithms\", \"algorithms\"]\n- Group 7: [\"electric\", \"lectrice\"]\n\nThe final output, formatted as a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<[[\"tex\", \"ext\"], [\"godding\", \"dodging\"], [\"upbreak\", \"breakup\"], [\"unmemoried\", \"unmemoired\"], [\"connected\", \"condecent\"], [\"logarithms\", \"algorithms\"], [\"electric\", \"lectrice\"]>>>"
