    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have a list of words: \n   ```\n   [\"coverall\", \"vocaller\", \"overcall\", \"unsensitive\", \"unitiveness\", \"osperm\", \"mopers\", \"proems\", \"merops\", \"toed\", \"tode\", \"rebuy\", \"buyer\", \"entozoan\", \"antozone\", \"relaundered\", \"underdealer\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, sort the characters in the word. This sorted version of the word will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted word.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Process**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - Sort the characters of the word to create a key.\n   - If the key is already in the dictionary, append the word to the list associated with that key.\n   - If the key is not in the dictionary, create a new entry with this key and start a new list with the current word.\n   - Continue this process for all words in the list.\n\n5. **Extract Results**: \n   - The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams. These lists are the groups we need.\n\n6. **Output Format**: \n   - The final output should be a list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given list of words:\n\n- \"coverall\", \"vocaller\", \"overcall\" are anagrams.\n- \"unsensitive\", \"unitiveness\" are anagrams.\n- \"osperm\", \"mopers\", \"proems\", \"merops\" are anagrams.\n- \"toed\", \"tode\" are anagrams.\n- \"rebuy\", \"buyer\" are anagrams.\n- \"entozoan\", \"antozone\" are anagrams.\n- \"relaundered\", \"underdealer\" are anagrams.\n\nThus, the grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"coverall\", \"vocaller\", \"overcall\"], [\"unsensitive\", \"unitiveness\"], [\"osperm\", \"mopers\", \"proems\", \"merops\"], [\"toed\", \"tode\"], [\"rebuy\", \"buyer\"], [\"entozoan\", \"antozone\"], [\"relaundered\", \"underdealer\"]>>>"
