    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, using all the original letters exactly once. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Identify the Input and Output**: We are given a list of words and need to group them into lists of anagrams. The output should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\n3. **Approach to Group Anagrams**:\n   - For each word, we can sort the letters in the word. Anagrams will have the same sorted representation.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted representation to a list of words (anagrams).\n   - Iterate through each word, sort it, and add it to the corresponding list in the dictionary.\n\n4. **Iterate Over the Given List**:\n   - For the word \"lute\", sorting the letters gives \"eltu\".\n   - For the word \"tule\", sorting the letters also gives \"eltu\".\n   - For the word \"spirant\", sorting the letters gives \"ainprst\".\n   - For the word \"spraint\", sorting the letters also gives \"ainprst\".\n\n5. **Group the Words**:\n   - Words with the same sorted representation are grouped together.\n   - \"lute\" and \"tule\" both have the sorted representation \"eltu\", so they form one group.\n   - \"spirant\" and \"spraint\" both have the sorted representation \"ainprst\", so they form another group.\n\n6. **Construct the Output**:\n   - The groups of anagrams are [[\"lute\", \"tule\"], [\"spirant\", \"spraint\"]].\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - The final output should be enclosed in triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[[\"lute\", \"tule\"], [\"spirant\", \"spraint\"]]>>>"
