    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, using all the original letters exactly once. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Identify the Input**: We are given a list of words: `[\"detruss\", \"dusters\", \"inwritten\", \"intertwin\"]`.\n\n3. **Determine the Method to Group Anagrams**:\n   - A common method to determine if two words are anagrams is to sort the letters of each word alphabetically. If two words are anagrams, their sorted forms will be identical.\n   - Alternatively, we can count the frequency of each letter in the words and compare these counts.\n\n4. **Apply the Method**:\n   - For each word in the list, sort the letters alphabetically.\n   - Use a dictionary to group words by their sorted letter sequence. The key in the dictionary will be the sorted sequence, and the value will be a list of words that match this sequence.\n\n5. **Group the Words**:\n   - \"detruss\" and \"dusters\" both sort to \"dersstu\", so they are anagrams and should be grouped together.\n   - \"inwritten\" and \"intertwin\" both sort to \"eiinnrttw\", so they are anagrams and should be grouped together.\n\n6. **Construct the Output**:\n   - The output should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - The final output should be enclosed in triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nBy following these steps, we can group the given words into anagrams:\n\n<<<[[\"detruss\", \"dusters\"], [\"inwritten\", \"intertwin\"]>>>"
