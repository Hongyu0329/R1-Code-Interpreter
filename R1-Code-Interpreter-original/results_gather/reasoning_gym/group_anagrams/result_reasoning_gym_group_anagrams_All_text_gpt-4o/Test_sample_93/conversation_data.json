    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words or phrases made by rearranging the letters of another, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"cansful\", \"canfuls\", \"retracts\", \"scratter\", \"teleradiophone\", \"radiotelephone\", \"ostiolar\", \"isolator\", \"pounces\", \"conspue\"]`.\n\n3. **Identify Anagrams**: To identify anagrams, we can sort the letters of each word. Words that are anagrams of each other will have the same sorted letter sequence.\n\n4. **Group Anagrams**: We will group words that have the same sorted letter sequence.\n\n5. **Output Format**: The output should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nLet's analyze each word:\n\n- \"cansful\" and \"canfuls\": Sorting both gives \"acflnsu\". They are anagrams.\n- \"retracts\" and \"scratter\": Sorting both gives \"acerrstt\". They are anagrams.\n- \"teleradiophone\" and \"radiotelephone\": Sorting both gives \"adeeehilnooprt\". They are anagrams.\n- \"ostiolar\" and \"isolator\": Sorting both gives \"ailoorst\". They are anagrams.\n- \"pounces\" and \"conspue\": Sorting both gives \"cenopsu\". They are anagrams.\n\nNow, we can group them:\n\n- Group 1: [\"cansful\", \"canfuls\"]\n- Group 2: [\"retracts\", \"scratter\"]\n- Group 3: [\"teleradiophone\", \"radiotelephone\"]\n- Group 4: [\"ostiolar\", \"isolator\"]\n- Group 5: [\"pounces\", \"conspue\"]\n\nThe final output, formatted as specified, is:\n\n<<<[[\"cansful\", \"canfuls\"], [\"retracts\", \"scratter\"], [\"teleradiophone\", \"radiotelephone\"], [\"ostiolar\", \"isolator\"], [\"pounces\", \"conspue\"]>>>"
