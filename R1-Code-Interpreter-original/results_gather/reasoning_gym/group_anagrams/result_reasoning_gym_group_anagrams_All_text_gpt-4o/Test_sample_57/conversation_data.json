    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"pettles\", \"spettle\", \"knars\", \"narks\", \"oenologist\", \"ontologise\", \"ontologies\", \"neoologist\"]`.\n\n3. **Sorting for Anagram Detection**: A common method to detect anagrams is to sort the letters of each word. If two words are anagrams, their sorted letter sequences will be identical.\n\n4. **Group Words by Sorted Sequence**:\n   - Sort each word in the list.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted sequence to a list of words (anagrams).\n   - For each word, sort it and use the sorted word as a key in the dictionary. Append the original word to the list corresponding to this key.\n\n5. **Iterate Over the List**:\n   - \"pettles\" sorted is \"eelppst\"\n   - \"spettle\" sorted is \"eelppst\"\n   - \"knars\" sorted is \"aknrs\"\n   - \"narks\" sorted is \"aknrs\"\n   - \"oenologist\" sorted is \"egilnooost\"\n   - \"ontologise\" sorted is \"egilnooost\"\n   - \"ontologies\" sorted is \"egilnooost\"\n   - \"neoologist\" sorted is \"egilnooost\"\n\n6. **Group the Words**:\n   - Words with the sorted key \"eelppst\": [\"pettles\", \"spettle\"]\n   - Words with the sorted key \"aknrs\": [\"knars\", \"narks\"]\n   - Words with the sorted key \"egilnooost\": [\"oenologist\", \"ontologise\", \"ontologies\", \"neoologist\"]\n\n7. **Output the Groups**: The final step is to output the groups of anagrams as a list of lists.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n<<<[[\"pettles\", \"spettle\"], [\"knars\", \"narks\"], [\"oenologist\", \"ontologise\", \"ontologies\", \"neoologist\"]>>>"
