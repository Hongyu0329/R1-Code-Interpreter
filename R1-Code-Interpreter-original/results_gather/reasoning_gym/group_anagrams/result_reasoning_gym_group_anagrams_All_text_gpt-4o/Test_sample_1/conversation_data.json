    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"prosely\", \"leprosy\", \"copras\", \"carpos\", \"siren\", \"reins\", \"rinse\", \"resin\", \"subarration\", \"saburration\"]`.\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, sort the characters in the word alphabetically. This sorted version of the word will be the same for all its anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted version.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Process**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - For each word, sort the characters to get the sorted version.\n   - Use the sorted version as a key in the dictionary. Append the original word to the list of words for this key.\n   - If the key does not exist in the dictionary, create a new entry with the sorted version as the key and the original word in a new list as the value.\n\n5. **Construct the Output**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams.\n   - Collect these lists into a final list of lists.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The final output should be enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given list of words:\n\n- \"prosely\" and \"leprosy\" are anagrams.\n- \"copras\" and \"carpos\" are anagrams.\n- \"siren\", \"reins\", \"rinse\", and \"resin\" are anagrams.\n- \"subarration\" and \"saburration\" are anagrams.\n\nThus, the grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"prosely\", \"leprosy\"], [\"copras\", \"carpos\"], [\"siren\", \"reins\", \"rinse\", \"resin\"], [\"subarration\", \"saburration\"]>>>"
