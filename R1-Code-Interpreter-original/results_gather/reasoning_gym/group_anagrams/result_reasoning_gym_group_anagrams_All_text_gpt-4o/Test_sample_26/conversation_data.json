    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"housebug\", \"bughouse\", \"rowens\", \"resown\", \"worsen\", \"owners\", \"listwork\", \"slitwork\", \"bridelace\", \"calibered\", \"kai\", \"aik\"]`.\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, sort the letters in alphabetical order. This sorted version will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted version.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Process**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - Sort the letters of the word to create a key.\n   - If the key is already in the dictionary, append the word to the list associated with that key.\n   - If the key is not in the dictionary, create a new entry with this key and start a new list with the current word.\n   - Continue this process for all words in the list.\n\n5. **Extract Results**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams.\n   - Collect these lists into a final list of lists.\n\n6. **Output Format**:\n   - The final output should be a list of lists enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given list of words:\n\n- \"housebug\" and \"bughouse\" are anagrams.\n- \"rowens\", \"resown\", \"worsen\", and \"owners\" are anagrams.\n- \"listwork\" and \"slitwork\" are anagrams.\n- \"bridelace\" and \"calibered\" are anagrams.\n- \"kai\" and \"aik\" are anagrams.\n\nThus, the grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"housebug\", \"bughouse\"], [\"rowens\", \"resown\", \"worsen\", \"owners\"], [\"listwork\", \"slitwork\"], [\"bridelace\", \"calibered\"], [\"kai\", \"aik\"]>>>"
