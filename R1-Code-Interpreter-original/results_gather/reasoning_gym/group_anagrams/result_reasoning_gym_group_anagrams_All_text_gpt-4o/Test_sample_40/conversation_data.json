    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"ponerid\", \"poinder\", \"ionomers\", \"moonrise\", \"shipowner\", \"ownership\"]`.\n\n3. **Identify Anagrams**: To identify anagrams, we can sort the letters of each word. Words that are anagrams of each other will have the same sorted letter sequence.\n\n4. **Group Anagrams**:\n   - Create a dictionary to map the sorted letter sequence to a list of words (anagrams).\n   - Iterate through each word in the list:\n     - Sort the letters of the word.\n     - Use the sorted letters as a key in the dictionary.\n     - Append the original word to the list corresponding to the sorted key.\n   - This will group all anagrams together under the same key.\n\n5. **Extract Groups**: Once all words are processed, extract the lists of anagrams from the dictionary.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists of strings, enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- \"ponerid\" and \"poinder\" are anagrams because sorting their letters gives \"deinopr\".\n- \"ionomers\" and \"moonrise\" are anagrams because sorting their letters gives \"eimnoors\".\n- \"shipowner\" and \"ownership\" are anagrams because sorting their letters gives \"ehinoprsw\".\n\nThus, the groups of anagrams are:\n\n- Group 1: [\"ponerid\", \"poinder\"]\n- Group 2: [\"ionomers\", \"moonrise\"]\n- Group 3: [\"shipowner\", \"ownership\"]\n\nThe final output, formatted as specified, is:\n\n<<<[[\"ponerid\", \"poinder\"], [\"ionomers\", \"moonrise\"], [\"shipowner\", \"ownership\"]>>>"
