    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have a list of words that need to be grouped into anagrams:\n   ```\n   [\"epistatic\", \"pistacite\", \"commissioned\", \"decommission\", \"unportrayed\", \"unpredatory\", \"chandelle\", \"chanelled\", \"footpad\", \"padfoot\", \"noma\", \"oman\", \"noam\", \"innodate\", \"antinode\", \"anointed\", \"distater\", \"tardiest\", \"striated\", \"shapka\", \"pashka\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Sorting for Anagram Detection**: To determine if two words are anagrams, sort the letters of each word alphabetically. If two words are anagrams, their sorted forms will be identical.\n\n4. **Group Words**: Use a dictionary to group words by their sorted letter forms. The key will be the sorted form, and the value will be a list of words that match this form.\n\n5. **Iterate and Group**: Go through each word in the list, sort its letters, and add it to the corresponding group in the dictionary.\n\n6. **Extract Groups**: Once all words are processed, extract the groups from the dictionary. Each group will be a list of anagrams.\n\n7. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- \"epistatic\" and \"pistacite\" are anagrams.\n- \"commissioned\" and \"decommission\" are anagrams.\n- \"unportrayed\" and \"unpredatory\" are anagrams.\n- \"chandelle\" and \"chanelled\" are anagrams.\n- \"footpad\" and \"padfoot\" are anagrams.\n- \"noma\", \"oman\", and \"noam\" are anagrams.\n- \"innodate\", \"antinode\", and \"anointed\" are anagrams.\n- \"distater\", \"tardiest\", and \"striated\" are anagrams.\n- \"shapka\" and \"pashka\" are anagrams.\n\nNow, let's list the groups of anagrams:\n\n<<<\n[\n  [\"epistatic\", \"pistacite\"],\n  [\"commissioned\", \"decommission\"],\n  [\"unportrayed\", \"unpredatory\"],\n  [\"chandelle\", \"chanelled\"],\n  [\"footpad\", \"padfoot\"],\n  [\"noma\", \"oman\", \"noam\"],\n  [\"innodate\", \"antinode\", \"anointed\"],\n  [\"distater\", \"tardiest\", \"striated\"],\n  [\"shapka\", \"pashka\"]\n]\n>>>"
