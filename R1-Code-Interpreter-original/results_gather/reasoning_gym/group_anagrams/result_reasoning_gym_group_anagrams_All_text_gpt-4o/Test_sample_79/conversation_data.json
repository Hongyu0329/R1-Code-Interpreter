    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"crags\", \"scrag\", \"galli\", \"glali\", \"glial\", \"bourder\", \"bordure\", \"townside\", \"downiest\", \"enlace\", \"elance\"]`.\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, we can sort the characters in the word. This sorted version will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Process**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - Sort the characters of the word to get the key.\n   - If the key is not in the dictionary, add it with an empty list.\n   - Append the original word to the list corresponding to the sorted key in the dictionary.\n\n5. **Construct the Output**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams.\n   - Collect these lists into a final list of lists.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The output should be enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given list of words:\n\n- \"crags\" and \"scrag\" are anagrams (sorted: \"acgrs\").\n- \"galli\", \"glali\", and \"glial\" are anagrams (sorted: \"agill\").\n- \"bourder\" and \"bordure\" are anagrams (sorted: \"bdeorru\").\n- \"townside\" and \"downiest\" are anagrams (sorted: \"deinostw\").\n- \"enlace\" and \"elance\" are anagrams (sorted: \"aceeln\").\n\nThus, the groups of anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"crags\", \"scrag\"], [\"galli\", \"glali\", \"glial\"], [\"bourder\", \"bordure\"], [\"townside\", \"downiest\"], [\"enlace\", \"elance\"]]>>>"
