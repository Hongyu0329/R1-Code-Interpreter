    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"volutae\", \"ovulate\", \"bobac\", \"cabob\", \"tylotus\", \"stoutly\", \"urinous\", \"ruinous\"]`.\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, we can sort the characters in the word. This sorted version will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Process**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - Sort the characters of the word to get the key.\n   - If the key is already in the dictionary, append the word to the list associated with that key.\n   - If the key is not in the dictionary, create a new entry with the key and start a new list with the current word.\n   - Continue this process for all words.\n\n5. **Extract Results**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams.\n   - Collect these lists into a final list of lists.\n\n6. **Output Format**:\n   - The final output should be a list of lists enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given list of words:\n\n- \"volutae\" and \"ovulate\" are anagrams (sorted as \"aelotuv\").\n- \"bobac\" and \"cabob\" are anagrams (sorted as \"abbco\").\n- \"tylotus\" and \"stoutly\" are anagrams (sorted as \"losttuy\").\n- \"urinous\" and \"ruinous\" are anagrams (sorted as \"inorsu\").\n\nThus, the groups of anagrams are:\n\n- Group 1: [\"volutae\", \"ovulate\"]\n- Group 2: [\"bobac\", \"cabob\"]\n- Group 3: [\"tylotus\", \"stoutly\"]\n- Group 4: [\"urinous\", \"ruinous\"]\n\nThe final output, formatted as required, is:\n\n<<<[[\"volutae\", \"ovulate\"], [\"bobac\", \"cabob\"], [\"tylotus\", \"stoutly\"], [\"urinous\", \"ruinous\"]>>>"
