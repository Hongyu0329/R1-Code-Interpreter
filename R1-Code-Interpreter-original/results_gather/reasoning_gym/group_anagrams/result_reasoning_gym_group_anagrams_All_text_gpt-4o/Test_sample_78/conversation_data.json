    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have a list of words that need to be grouped into anagrams:\n   ```\n   [\"preversing\", \"preserving\", \"reservist\", \"reversist\", \"sative\", \"itaves\", \"stevia\", \"crinose\", \"sericon\", \"recoins\", \"unrebated\", \"eburnated\", \"underbeat\", \"reflowers\", \"flowerers\", \"sermonical\", \"normalcies\", \"cisted\", \"edicts\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Sorting Method**: A common method to determine if two words are anagrams is to sort the characters of each word. If two words are anagrams, their sorted character arrays will be identical.\n\n4. **Group Anagrams**: We will use a dictionary to group words by their sorted character arrays. The key will be the sorted tuple of characters, and the value will be a list of words that match that key.\n\n5. **Iterate and Group**: For each word in the list, sort the characters, use the sorted tuple as a key, and append the word to the corresponding list in the dictionary.\n\n6. **Extract Results**: The values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams.\n\n7. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists, enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- **Step 1**: Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n- **Step 2**: For each word, sort the characters and use the sorted tuple as a key.\n- **Step 3**: Append the word to the list corresponding to the sorted key in the dictionary.\n- **Step 4**: Extract the lists from the dictionary and format them as required.\n\nNow, let's group the given words:\n\n- \"preversing\" and \"preserving\" are anagrams.\n- \"reservist\" and \"reversist\" are anagrams.\n- \"sative\", \"itaves\", and \"stevia\" are anagrams.\n- \"crinose\", \"sericon\", and \"recoins\" are anagrams.\n- \"unrebated\", \"eburnated\", and \"underbeat\" are anagrams.\n- \"reflowers\" and \"flowerers\" are anagrams.\n- \"sermonical\" and \"normalcies\" are anagrams.\n- \"cisted\" and \"edicts\" are anagrams.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"preversing\", \"preserving\"], [\"reservist\", \"reversist\"], [\"sative\", \"itaves\", \"stevia\"], [\"crinose\", \"sericon\", \"recoins\"], [\"unrebated\", \"eburnated\", \"underbeat\"], [\"reflowers\", \"flowerers\"], [\"sermonical\", \"normalcies\"], [\"cisted\", \"edicts\"]>>>"
