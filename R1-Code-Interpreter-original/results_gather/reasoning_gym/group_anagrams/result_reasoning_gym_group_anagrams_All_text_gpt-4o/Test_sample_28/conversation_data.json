    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: \n   - [\"discouple\", \"clupeoids\", \"infarction\", \"infraction\", \"draba\", \"barad\", \"chordal\", \"dorlach\", \"racers\", \"screar\", \"carers\", \"radiators\", \"sartoriad\"]\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, sort the letters alphabetically. This sorted version will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted version.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - \"discouple\" and \"clupeoids\": Sort both to get \"cdeilopsu\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"infarction\" and \"infraction\": Sort both to get \"acfiinnort\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"draba\" and \"barad\": Sort both to get \"aabdr\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"chordal\" and \"dorlach\": Sort both to get \"acdhlor\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"racers\", \"screar\", and \"carers\": Sort all to get \"acerrs\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"radiators\" and \"sartoriad\": Sort both to get \"aadiorrst\". They are anagrams.\n\n5. **Form Groups**:\n   - Group 1: [\"discouple\", \"clupeoids\"]\n   - Group 2: [\"infarction\", \"infraction\"]\n   - Group 3: [\"draba\", \"barad\"]\n   - Group 4: [\"chordal\", \"dorlach\"]\n   - Group 5: [\"racers\", \"screar\", \"carers\"]\n   - Group 6: [\"radiators\", \"sartoriad\"]\n\n6. **Output Format**: The output should be a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<[[\"discouple\", \"clupeoids\"], [\"infarction\", \"infraction\"], [\"draba\", \"barad\"], [\"chordal\", \"dorlach\"], [\"racers\", \"screar\", \"carers\"], [\"radiators\", \"sartoriad\"]>>>"
