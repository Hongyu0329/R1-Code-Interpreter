    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\n2. **Identify the Task**: We need to group words that are anagrams of each other from the given list.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - For each word, sort the letters alphabetically. This sorted version will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted version.\n   - Iterate through each word in the list, sort it, and add it to the corresponding list in the dictionary.\n   - The values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams.\n\n4. **Process the Given List**:\n   - Start with the list: `[\"dunces\", \"secund\", \"signals\", \"glassin\", \"desertrice\", \"discreeter\", \"attainor\", \"nattoria\", \"fucoses\", \"focuses\"]`.\n   - For each word, sort the characters and use this sorted string as a key in a dictionary.\n   - Group words with the same sorted string together.\n\n5. **Detailed Steps**:\n   - \"dunces\" and \"secund\" both sort to \"cdenus\", so they are anagrams.\n   - \"signals\" and \"glassin\" both sort to \"agilnss\", so they are anagrams.\n   - \"desertrice\" and \"discreeter\" both sort to \"cdeeeirrst\", so they are anagrams.\n   - \"attainor\" and \"nattoria\" both sort to \"aainortt\", so they are anagrams.\n   - \"fucoses\" and \"focuses\" both sort to \"cefossu\", so they are anagrams.\n\n6. **Compile the Results**:\n   - Group the words based on the sorted keys.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - The final grouped anagrams are: <<<[[\"dunces\", \"secund\"], [\"signals\", \"glassin\"], [\"desertrice\", \"discreeter\"], [\"attainor\", \"nattoria\"], [\"fucoses\", \"focuses\"]]>>>\n\nAnswer: <<<[[\"dunces\", \"secund\"], [\"signals\", \"glassin\"], [\"desertrice\", \"discreeter\"], [\"attainor\", \"nattoria\"], [\"fucoses\", \"focuses\"]]>>>"
