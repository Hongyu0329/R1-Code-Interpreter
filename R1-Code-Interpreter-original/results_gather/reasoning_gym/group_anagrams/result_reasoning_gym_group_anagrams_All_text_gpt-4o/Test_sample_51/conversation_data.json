    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Identify Key for Grouping**: A common method to identify anagrams is to sort the letters of each word alphabetically. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted representation.\n\n3. **Group Words**: We will group words that have the same sorted representation together.\n\n4. **Iterate Through the List**: For each word in the list, sort the word to get the key, and then add the word to the group corresponding to that key.\n\n5. **Output the Groups**: Once all words are processed, the groups of anagrams can be output as a list of lists.\n\nLet's apply this step-by-step to the given list of words:\n\n- **Words**: [\"sanes\", \"sensa\", \"sidewalk\", \"walkside\", \"evictors\", \"vortices\", \"ratan\", \"antar\", \"antra\", \"sata\", \"asta\", \"diopside\", \"dipodies\", \"ga\", \"ag\", \"lader\", \"daler\", \"readl\", \"solver\", \"lovers\"]\n\n- **Process Each Word**:\n  - \"sanes\" and \"sensa\" both sort to \"aenss\".\n  - \"sidewalk\" and \"walkside\" both sort to \"adeiklsw\".\n  - \"evictors\" and \"vortices\" both sort to \"ceiorstv\".\n  - \"ratan\", \"antar\", and \"antra\" all sort to \"aanrt\".\n  - \"sata\" and \"asta\" both sort to \"aast\".\n  - \"diopside\" and \"dipodies\" both sort to \"ddeiopss\".\n  - \"ga\" and \"ag\" both sort to \"ag\".\n  - \"lader\", \"daler\", and \"readl\" all sort to \"adelr\".\n  - \"solver\" and \"lovers\" both sort to \"elorsv\".\n\n- **Group the Anagrams**:\n  - Group 1: [\"sanes\", \"sensa\"]\n  - Group 2: [\"sidewalk\", \"walkside\"]\n  - Group 3: [\"evictors\", \"vortices\"]\n  - Group 4: [\"ratan\", \"antar\", \"antra\"]\n  - Group 5: [\"sata\", \"asta\"]\n  - Group 6: [\"diopside\", \"dipodies\"]\n  - Group 7: [\"ga\", \"ag\"]\n  - Group 8: [\"lader\", \"daler\", \"readl\"]\n  - Group 9: [\"solver\", \"lovers\"]\n\n- **Final Output**: The groups can be output in any order, as the problem statement allows for any order of the groups.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[[\"sanes\", \"sensa\"], [\"sidewalk\", \"walkside\"], [\"evictors\", \"vortices\"], [\"ratan\", \"antar\", \"antra\"], [\"sata\", \"asta\"], [\"diopside\", \"dipodies\"], [\"ga\", \"ag\"], [\"lader\", \"daler\", \"readl\"], [\"solver\", \"lovers\"]>>>"
