    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the following list of words to group into anagrams:\n   - [\"sporogeny\", \"gynospore\", \"lamellae\", \"malellae\", \"reptatorial\", \"proletariat\", \"madecase\", \"academes\", \"chrome\", \"chomer\", \"barcoo\", \"baroco\", \"showering\", \"reshowing\"]\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**:\n   - For each word, sort the characters in the word alphabetically. This sorted version of the word will serve as a key.\n   - Words that are anagrams of each other will have the same sorted key.\n   - Use a dictionary to map each sorted key to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list:\n     - Sort the characters of the word to form the key.\n     - If the key is not in the dictionary, add it with the current word as the first element in the list.\n     - If the key is already in the dictionary, append the current word to the list associated with that key.\n   - After processing all words, the dictionary will contain lists of anagrams.\n\n5. **Extract the Result**:\n   - The values of the dictionary are the groups of anagrams.\n   - Convert these values into a list of lists format.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - The final output should be a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nFollowing these steps, we can group the given list of words into anagrams:\n\n- \"sporogeny\" and \"gynospore\" are anagrams.\n- \"lamellae\" and \"malellae\" are anagrams.\n- \"reptatorial\" and \"proletariat\" are anagrams.\n- \"madecase\" and \"academes\" are anagrams.\n- \"chrome\" and \"chomer\" are anagrams.\n- \"barcoo\" and \"baroco\" are anagrams.\n- \"showering\" and \"reshowing\" are anagrams.\n\nThus, the grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"sporogeny\", \"gynospore\"], [\"lamellae\", \"malellae\"], [\"reptatorial\", \"proletariat\"], [\"madecase\", \"academes\"], [\"chrome\", \"chomer\"], [\"barcoo\", \"baroco\"], [\"showering\", \"reshowing\"]>>>"
