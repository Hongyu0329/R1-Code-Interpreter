    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the following list of words:\n   - [\"dittanies\", \"daintiest\", \"carols\", \"claros\", \"bunged\", \"bedung\", \"unshaded\", \"undashed\", \"veeps\", \"vepse\", \"providers\", \"disprover\", \"infarcted\", \"infracted\", \"tumbester\", \"umbrettes\"]\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, sort the characters in the word alphabetically. This sorted version of the word will be the key to identify anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted key.\n\n4. **Process Each Word**:\n   - \"dittanies\" and \"daintiest\" both sort to \"adeiinistt\".\n   - \"carols\" and \"claros\" both sort to \"aclors\".\n   - \"bunged\" and \"bedung\" both sort to \"bdegnu\".\n   - \"unshaded\" and \"undashed\" both sort to \"addehnsu\".\n   - \"veeps\" and \"vepse\" both sort to \"eepsv\".\n   - \"providers\" and \"disprover\" both sort to \"deioprrsv\".\n   - \"infarcted\" and \"infracted\" both sort to \"acdefinrt\".\n   - \"tumbester\" and \"umbrettes\" both sort to \"beemrsttu\".\n\n5. **Group Anagrams**:\n   - Create a dictionary where the key is the sorted word and the value is a list of words that are anagrams.\n   - Populate this dictionary by iterating over each word in the list, sorting it, and adding it to the appropriate list in the dictionary.\n\n6. **Extract Results**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams.\n   - Convert these values into a list of lists format.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - The final output should be a list of lists of strings, where each list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nFollowing these steps, the grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"dittanies\", \"daintiest\"], [\"carols\", \"claros\"], [\"bunged\", \"bedung\"], [\"unshaded\", \"undashed\"], [\"veeps\", \"vepse\"], [\"providers\", \"disprover\"], [\"infarcted\", \"infracted\"], [\"tumbester\", \"umbrettes\"]>>>"
