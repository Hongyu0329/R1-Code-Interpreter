    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if, when sorted, they have the same sequence of letters.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"calorist\", \"coralist\", \"unsoiling\", \"insouling\", \"sticklers\", \"strickles\", \"trickless\"]`.\n\n3. **Sorting Words**: For each word in the list, sort the letters alphabetically. This will help us identify which words are anagrams of each other. For example, the word \"calorist\" when sorted becomes \"acilorst\".\n\n4. **Grouping Anagrams**: Use a dictionary to group words by their sorted letter sequence. The key will be the sorted sequence, and the value will be a list of words that match this sequence.\n\n5. **Iterate Through the List**:\n   - For \"calorist\", the sorted sequence is \"acilorst\".\n   - For \"coralist\", the sorted sequence is also \"acilorst\".\n   - For \"unsoiling\", the sorted sequence is \"giilnnosu\".\n   - For \"insouling\", the sorted sequence is \"giilnnosu\".\n   - For \"sticklers\", the sorted sequence is \"ceiklsrst\".\n   - For \"strickles\", the sorted sequence is \"ceiklsrst\".\n   - For \"trickless\", the sorted sequence is \"ceiklsrst\".\n\n6. **Form Groups**: Based on the sorted sequences, group the words:\n   - \"acilorst\": [\"calorist\", \"coralist\"]\n   - \"giilnnosu\": [\"unsoiling\", \"insouling\"]\n   - \"ceiklsrst\": [\"sticklers\", \"strickles\", \"trickless\"]\n\n7. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nBy following these steps, we can group the anagrams as required.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<[[\"calorist\", \"coralist\"], [\"unsoiling\", \"insouling\"], [\"sticklers\", \"strickles\", \"trickless\"]>>>"
