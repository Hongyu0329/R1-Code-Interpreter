    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"care\" and \"crea\" are anagrams because they contain the same letters.\n\n2. **Identify the Input**: We have a list of words: \n   ```\n   [\"care\", \"crea\", \"sulfamide\", \"feudalism\", \"lurries\", \"surlier\", \"sprig\", \"grips\", \"constrainers\", \"contrariness\", \"petrolist\", \"portliest\", \"hematolin\", \"maholtine\", \"elogy\", \"goyle\", \"nexus\", \"unsex\", \"carminette\", \"remittance\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Group Anagrams**: To group anagrams, we can use the following approach:\n   - Sort the letters of each word to create a key. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted key.\n   - Use a dictionary to map each sorted key to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n4. **Process Each Word**:\n   - For \"care\" and \"crea\", the sorted key is \"acer\". They are anagrams and should be grouped together.\n   - For \"sulfamide\" and \"feudalism\", the sorted key is \"adefilsum\". They are anagrams and should be grouped together.\n   - For \"lurries\" and \"surlier\", the sorted key is \"eilrrsu\". They are anagrams and should be grouped together.\n   - For \"sprig\" and \"grips\", the sorted key is \"giprs\". They are anagrams and should be grouped together.\n   - For \"constrainers\" and \"contrariness\", the sorted key is \"aceinnorrsst\". They are anagrams and should be grouped together.\n   - For \"petrolist\" and \"portliest\", the sorted key is \"eiloprstt\". They are anagrams and should be grouped together.\n   - For \"hematolin\" and \"maholtine\", the sorted key is \"aehilmnot\". They are anagrams and should be grouped together.\n   - For \"elogy\" and \"goyle\", the sorted key is \"egloy\". They are anagrams and should be grouped together.\n   - For \"nexus\" and \"unsex\", the sorted key is \"ensux\". They are anagrams and should be grouped together.\n   - \"carminette\" and \"remittance\" are not anagrams of any other words in the list.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: The final output should be a list of lists, where each list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n<<<[[\"care\", \"crea\"], [\"sulfamide\", \"feudalism\"], [\"lurries\", \"surlier\"], [\"sprig\", \"grips\"], [\"constrainers\", \"contrariness\"], [\"petrolist\", \"portliest\"], [\"hematolin\", \"maholtine\"], [\"elogy\", \"goyle\"], [\"nexus\", \"unsex\"], [\"carminette\"], [\"remittance\"]>>>"
