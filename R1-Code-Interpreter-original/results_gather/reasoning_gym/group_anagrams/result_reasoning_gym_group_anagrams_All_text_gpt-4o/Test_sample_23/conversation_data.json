  "question": "An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of a different word, using all the original letters exactly once.\n\nYour job is to group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.\n\nThe output is a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets, where each outer list contains a group of anagrams, e.g. <<<[[\"eat\", \"tea\"], [\"tan\", \"nat\"]]>>>.\n\nGroup the following list of words into anagrams:\n[\"bouffon\", \"buffoon\", \"balanites\", \"basaltine\", \"stainable\", \"pactolian\", \"placation\", \"pactional\"]\n",

    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that have the same characters in the same frequency but in a different order. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"bouffon\", \"buffoon\", \"balanites\", \"basaltine\", \"stainable\", \"pactolian\", \"placation\", \"pactional\"]`.\n\n3. **Sorting for Anagram Detection**: A common method to detect anagrams is to sort the characters in each word. If two words are anagrams, their sorted character arrays will be identical.\n\n4. **Group Words**: We will group words by their sorted character arrays. Words with the same sorted character array are anagrams and should be grouped together.\n\n5. **Iterate and Group**:\n   - Sort each word in the list.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted character array to a list of words (anagrams).\n   - Append each word to the list corresponding to its sorted character array.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- \"bouffon\" and \"buffoon\":\n  - Sorted: \"bffnoou\"\n  - Group: [\"bouffon\", \"buffoon\"]\n\n- \"balanites\", \"basaltine\", \"stainable\":\n  - Sorted: \"aabeilnst\"\n  - Group: [\"balanites\", \"basaltine\", \"stainable\"]\n\n- \"pactolian\", \"placation\", \"pactional\":\n  - Sorted: \"aacilnopt\"\n  - Group: [\"pactolian\", \"placation\", \"pactional\"]\n\nNow, we can compile the groups into the final output format:\n\n<<<[[\"bouffon\", \"buffoon\"], [\"balanites\", \"basaltine\", \"stainable\"], [\"pactolian\", \"placation\", \"pactional\"]>>>"
