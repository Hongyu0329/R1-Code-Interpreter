    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Identify Unique Key for Anagrams**: A common method to identify anagrams is to sort the characters in the word. If two words are anagrams, their sorted character arrays will be identical.\n\n3. **Group Words by Anagram Key**:\n   - Create a dictionary to map the sorted character tuple to a list of words (anagrams).\n   - Iterate through each word in the list.\n   - Sort the word to get the anagram key.\n   - Use this key to group words in the dictionary.\n\n4. **Extract Groups of Anagrams**: Once all words are processed, extract the values from the dictionary, which are lists of anagrams.\n\n5. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists of strings, enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list of words:\n\n- **Words**: [\"merino\", \"inmore\", \"monier\", \"preacher\", \"repreach\", \"caurale\", \"arcuale\", \"diable\", \"deblai\", \"bailed\", \"baldie\", \"abdiel\", \"licorous\", \"couloirs\", \"sorgos\", \"grosso\", \"pharm\", \"prahm\"]\n\n- **Step-by-Step Grouping**:\n  - \"merino\", \"inmore\", \"monier\" are anagrams (sorted as \"eimnor\").\n  - \"preacher\", \"repreach\" are anagrams (sorted as \"aceehprr\").\n  - \"caurale\", \"arcuale\" are anagrams (sorted as \"aacelru\").\n  - \"diable\", \"deblai\", \"bailed\", \"baldie\", \"abdiel\" are anagrams (sorted as \"abdeil\").\n  - \"licorous\", \"couloirs\" are anagrams (sorted as \"ciloorsu\").\n  - \"sorgos\", \"grosso\" are anagrams (sorted as \"goorss\").\n  - \"pharm\", \"prahm\" are anagrams (sorted as \"ahmpr\").\n\n- **Final Grouping**:\n  - Group 1: [\"merino\", \"inmore\", \"monier\"]\n  - Group 2: [\"preacher\", \"repreach\"]\n  - Group 3: [\"caurale\", \"arcuale\"]\n  - Group 4: [\"diable\", \"deblai\", \"bailed\", \"baldie\", \"abdiel\"]\n  - Group 5: [\"licorous\", \"couloirs\"]\n  - Group 6: [\"sorgos\", \"grosso\"]\n  - Group 7: [\"pharm\", \"prahm\"]\n\n- **Output**: The final output should be formatted as specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[[\"merino\", \"inmore\", \"monier\"], [\"preacher\", \"repreach\"], [\"caurale\", \"arcuale\"], [\"diable\", \"deblai\", \"bailed\", \"baldie\", \"abdiel\"], [\"licorous\", \"couloirs\"], [\"sorgos\", \"grosso\"], [\"pharm\", \"prahm\"]>>>"
