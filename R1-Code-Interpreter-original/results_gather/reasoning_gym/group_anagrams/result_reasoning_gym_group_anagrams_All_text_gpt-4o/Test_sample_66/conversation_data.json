    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have a list of words: \n   ```\n   [\"incomputably\", \"uncompatibly\", \"wakeners\", \"rewakens\", \"airplot\", \"toprail\", \"portail\", \"seedman\", \"demeans\", \"electromagnetic\", \"magnetoelectric\", \"monial\", \"nomial\", \"almoin\", \"oilman\", \"fetichry\", \"fitchery\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Group Anagrams**: To group the words into anagrams, we can use the following approach:\n   - Sort the characters in each word. This will help us identify words that are anagrams of each other because they will have the same sorted character sequence.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted character sequence to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - For each word in the list, sort the characters of the word.\n   - Use the sorted word as a key in a dictionary. Append the original word to the list of words associated with this key.\n   - Continue this process for all words in the list.\n\n5. **Construct the Output**: The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams. These lists are the groups of anagrams we need.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply this process to the given list:\n\n- \"incomputably\" and \"uncompatibly\" are anagrams.\n- \"wakeners\" and \"rewakens\" are anagrams.\n- \"airplot\", \"toprail\", and \"portail\" are anagrams.\n- \"seedman\" and \"demeans\" are anagrams.\n- \"electromagnetic\" and \"magnetoelectric\" are anagrams.\n- \"monial\", \"nomial\", \"almoin\", and \"oilman\" are anagrams.\n- \"fetichry\" and \"fitchery\" are anagrams.\n\nBased on this analysis, the grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"incomputably\", \"uncompatibly\"], [\"wakeners\", \"rewakens\"], [\"airplot\", \"toprail\", \"portail\"], [\"seedman\", \"demeans\"], [\"electromagnetic\", \"magnetoelectric\"], [\"monial\", \"nomial\", \"almoin\", \"oilman\"], [\"fetichry\", \"fitchery\"]>>>"
