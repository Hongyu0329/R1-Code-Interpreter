    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"binder\", \"rebind\", \"brined\", \"inbred\", \"saxonize\", \"oxazines\", \"snop\", \"pons\", \"wham\", \"hawm\", \"misacts\", \"mastics\", \"reparel\", \"pearler\"]`.\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, sort the letters in alphabetical order. This sorted version will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted version.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Process**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - For each word, sort the letters to get the canonical form.\n   - Use this sorted word as a key in the dictionary. Append the original word to the list of words for this key.\n   - If the key does not exist in the dictionary, create a new entry with this key and start a new list with the current word.\n\n5. **Construct the Output**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams.\n   - Collect these lists into a final list of lists.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The output should be enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given list of words:\n\n- \"binder\", \"rebind\", \"brined\", \"inbred\" are anagrams because they all sort to \"bdeinr\".\n- \"saxonize\", \"oxazines\" are anagrams because they both sort to \"aeinosxz\".\n- \"snop\", \"pons\" are anagrams because they both sort to \"nops\".\n- \"wham\", \"hawm\" are anagrams because they both sort to \"ahmw\".\n- \"misacts\", \"mastics\" are anagrams because they both sort to \"acimsst\".\n- \"reparel\", \"pearler\" are anagrams because they both sort to \"aeelprr\".\n\nTherefore, the grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"binder\", \"rebind\", \"brined\", \"inbred\"], [\"saxonize\", \"oxazines\"], [\"snop\", \"pons\"], [\"wham\", \"hawm\"], [\"misacts\", \"mastics\"], [\"reparel\", \"pearler\"]>>>"
