    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, using all the original letters exactly once. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Identify the Input and Output**: We are given a list of words and need to group them into lists of anagrams. The output should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\n3. **Approach to Group Anagrams**:\n   - For each word in the list, sort the characters of the word. This sorted version of the word will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams).\n   - Iterate through each word, sort it, and add it to the corresponding list in the dictionary.\n   - The keys of the dictionary will be the sorted character strings, and the values will be lists of words that are anagrams.\n\n4. **Process the Given List**:\n   - Start with the list: `[\"drapers\", \"sparred\", \"ahmet\", \"mathe\", \"interplead\", \"peridental\"]`.\n   - Sort each word:\n     - \"drapers\" -> \"adeprrs\"\n     - \"sparred\" -> \"adeprrs\"\n     - \"ahmet\" -> \"aehmt\"\n     - \"mathe\" -> \"aehmt\"\n     - \"interplead\" -> \"adeeilnprt\"\n     - \"peridental\" -> \"adeeilnprt\"\n   - Group words by their sorted version:\n     - \"adeprrs\": [\"drapers\", \"sparred\"]\n     - \"aehmt\": [\"ahmet\", \"mathe\"]\n     - \"adeeilnprt\": [\"interplead\", \"peridental\"]\n\n5. **Construct the Output**:\n   - The dictionary values are the groups of anagrams.\n   - Convert these values into a list of lists.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - The final output should be a list of lists of anagrams.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n<<<[[\"drapers\", \"sparred\"], [\"ahmet\", \"mathe\"], [\"interplead\", \"peridental\"]>>>"
