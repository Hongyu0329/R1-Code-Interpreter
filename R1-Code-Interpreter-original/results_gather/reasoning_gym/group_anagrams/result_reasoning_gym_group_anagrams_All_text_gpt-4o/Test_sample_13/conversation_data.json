    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"eldern\", \"lender\", \"fp\", \"pf\", \"cohere\", \"cheero\", \"anglican\", \"canaling\", \"converters\", \"reconverts\", \"wandy\", \"dawny\"]`.\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, sort the characters in the word. This sorted version will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted version.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - \"eldern\" and \"lender\": Sort both to get \"deelnr\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"fp\" and \"pf\": Sort both to get \"fp\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"cohere\" and \"cheero\": Sort both to get \"ceehor\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"anglican\" and \"canaling\": Sort both to get \"aacgilnn\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"converters\" and \"reconverts\": Sort both to get \"ceenorrstv\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"wandy\" and \"dawny\": Sort both to get \"adnwy\". They are anagrams.\n\n5. **Construct the Output**:\n   - Create a list of lists where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\n6. **Final Grouping**:\n   - Group 1: [\"eldern\", \"lender\"]\n   - Group 2: [\"fp\", \"pf\"]\n   - Group 3: [\"cohere\", \"cheero\"]\n   - Group 4: [\"anglican\", \"canaling\"]\n   - Group 5: [\"converters\", \"reconverts\"]\n   - Group 6: [\"wandy\", \"dawny\"]\n\n7. **Output the Result**: The final output should be a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[[\"eldern\", \"lender\"], [\"fp\", \"pf\"], [\"cohere\", \"cheero\"], [\"anglican\", \"canaling\"], [\"converters\", \"reconverts\"], [\"wandy\", \"dawny\"]>>>"
