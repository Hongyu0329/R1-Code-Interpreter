    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Approach**: \n   - For each word, sort the characters in the word alphabetically. This sorted version of the word will be the same for all its anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted version.\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - For each word, sort the characters to get the key.\n   - If the key is not in the dictionary, add it with an empty list.\n   - Append the original word to the list corresponding to the sorted key.\n   - After processing all words, the dictionary will contain lists of anagrams.\n\n4. **Output**: Convert the dictionary values to a list of lists, which will be the groups of anagrams.\n\n5. **Careful Points**:\n   - Ensure that all characters are considered, including duplicates.\n   - The order of words in the output does not matter, but they must be grouped correctly.\n   - The order of groups in the output does not matter.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given list of words:\n\n- Words: [\"peacoat\", \"opacate\", \"congaed\", \"decagon\", \"acephalan\", \"acalephan\", \"patte\", \"tapet\", \"longimanous\", \"longanimous\", \"haars\", \"raash\", \"haras\", \"asarh\", \"overturn\", \"turnover\", \"geomantic\", \"atmogenic\", \"fole\", \"floe\", \"fonder\", \"fronde\"]\n\n- Grouping:\n  - \"peacoat\" and \"opacate\" are anagrams.\n  - \"congaed\" and \"decagon\" are anagrams.\n  - \"acephalan\" and \"acalephan\" are anagrams.\n  - \"patte\" and \"tapet\" are anagrams.\n  - \"longimanous\" and \"longanimous\" are anagrams.\n  - \"haars\", \"raash\", \"haras\", and \"asarh\" are anagrams.\n  - \"overturn\" and \"turnover\" are anagrams.\n  - \"geomantic\" and \"atmogenic\" are anagrams.\n  - \"fole\" and \"floe\" are anagrams.\n  - \"fonder\" and \"fronde\" are anagrams.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"peacoat\", \"opacate\"], [\"congaed\", \"decagon\"], [\"acephalan\", \"acalephan\"], [\"patte\", \"tapet\"], [\"longimanous\", \"longanimous\"], [\"haars\", \"raash\", \"haras\", \"asarh\"], [\"overturn\", \"turnover\"], [\"geomantic\", \"atmogenic\"], [\"fole\", \"floe\"], [\"fonder\", \"fronde\"]>>>"
