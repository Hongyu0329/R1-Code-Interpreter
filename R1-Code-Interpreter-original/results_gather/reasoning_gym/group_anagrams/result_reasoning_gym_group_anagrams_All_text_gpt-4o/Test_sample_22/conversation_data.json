    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words or phrases made by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"eternities\", \"entireties\", \"ophis\", \"hopis\", \"conformer\", \"reconform\", \"mf\", \"fm\"]`.\n\n3. **Identify Anagrams**: To determine if two words are anagrams, we can sort the letters of each word alphabetically. If two words have the same sorted letter sequence, they are anagrams.\n\n4. **Group Anagrams**:\n   - Create a dictionary to map the sorted letter sequence to a list of words (anagrams).\n   - Iterate through each word in the list:\n     - Sort the word's letters alphabetically.\n     - Use the sorted sequence as a key in the dictionary.\n     - Append the original word to the list corresponding to the sorted sequence key.\n\n5. **Construct the Output**: The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams. These lists are the groups of anagrams we need.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The output should be a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- **\"eternities\"** and **\"entireties\"**: \n  - Sorted: \"eeeiiinrstt\"\n  - They are anagrams and form one group.\n\n- **\"ophis\"** and **\"hopis\"**:\n  - Sorted: \"hiops\"\n  - They are anagrams and form another group.\n\n- **\"conformer\"** and **\"reconform\"**:\n  - Sorted: \"cefmnoorr\"\n  - They are anagrams and form another group.\n\n- **\"mf\"** and **\"fm\"**:\n  - Sorted: \"fm\"\n  - They are anagrams and form another group.\n\nNow, we can construct the final output:\n\n<<<[[\"eternities\", \"entireties\"], [\"ophis\", \"hopis\"], [\"conformer\", \"reconform\"], [\"mf\", \"fm\"]]>>>"
