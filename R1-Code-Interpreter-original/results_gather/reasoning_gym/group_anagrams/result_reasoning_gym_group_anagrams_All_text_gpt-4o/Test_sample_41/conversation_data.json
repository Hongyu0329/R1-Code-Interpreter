    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they can be rearranged to form each other.\n\n2. **Identify Key for Grouping**: The key to grouping anagrams is to sort the letters of each word. If two words are anagrams, sorting their letters will result in the same string.\n\n3. **Process Each Word**: For each word in the list, sort its letters to create a key. Use this key to group words together.\n\n4. **Use a Data Structure for Grouping**: A dictionary can be used where the key is the sorted string of letters, and the value is a list of words that match this key.\n\n5. **Iterate Over the List**: Go through each word, sort it, and add it to the appropriate list in the dictionary.\n\n6. **Extract the Groups**: Once all words are processed, extract the lists of anagrams from the dictionary.\n\n7. **Format the Output**: The final output should be a list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list of words:\n\n- **Words**: [\"ashery\", \"hayers\", \"generation\", \"renegation\", \"flyover\", \"overfly\", \"ideist\", \"teiids\", \"tidies\", \"obiter\", \"orbite\", \"bitore\", \"excreta\", \"exacter\"]\n\n- **Process**:\n  - \"ashery\" and \"hayers\" both sort to \"aehrys\".\n  - \"generation\" and \"renegation\" both sort to \"aeeginnort\".\n  - \"flyover\" and \"overfly\" both sort to \"eflorvy\".\n  - \"ideist\", \"teiids\", and \"tidies\" all sort to \"deiist\".\n  - \"obiter\", \"orbite\", and \"bitore\" all sort to \"beiort\".\n  - \"excreta\" and \"exacter\" both sort to \"acceertx\".\n\n- **Group Anagrams**:\n  - Group 1: [\"ashery\", \"hayers\"]\n  - Group 2: [\"generation\", \"renegation\"]\n  - Group 3: [\"flyover\", \"overfly\"]\n  - Group 4: [\"ideist\", \"teiids\", \"tidies\"]\n  - Group 5: [\"obiter\", \"orbite\", \"bitore\"]\n  - Group 6: [\"excreta\", \"exacter\"]\n\n- **Output**: Format the groups into the required output format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[[\"ashery\", \"hayers\"], [\"generation\", \"renegation\"], [\"flyover\", \"overfly\"], [\"ideist\", \"teiids\", \"tidies\"], [\"obiter\", \"orbite\", \"bitore\"], [\"excreta\", \"exacter\"]>>>"
