    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"placode\", \"pedocal\", \"mastomenia\", \"seminomata\", \"taise\", \"saite\"]`.\n\n3. **Sorting for Anagram Detection**: A common method to detect anagrams is to sort the letters of each word. If two words are anagrams, their sorted letter sequences will be identical.\n\n4. **Group Words by Sorted Sequence**:\n   - Sort each word in the list.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted sequence to a list of words (anagrams).\n   - For each word, sort it and use the sorted word as a key in the dictionary. Append the original word to the list corresponding to this key.\n\n5. **Iterate Over the List**:\n   - \"placode\" sorted is \"acdelop\".\n   - \"pedocal\" sorted is \"acdelop\".\n   - \"mastomenia\" sorted is \"aaeiimmnost\".\n   - \"seminomata\" sorted is \"aaeiimmnost\".\n   - \"taise\" sorted is \"aeist\".\n   - \"saite\" sorted is \"aeist\".\n\n6. **Group the Words**:\n   - Words with the sorted key \"acdelop\": [\"placode\", \"pedocal\"].\n   - Words with the sorted key \"aaeiimmnost\": [\"mastomenia\", \"seminomata\"].\n   - Words with the sorted key \"aeist\": [\"taise\", \"saite\"].\n\n7. **Output the Groups**: The final step is to output the groups of anagrams as a list of lists.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n<<<[[\"placode\", \"pedocal\"], [\"mastomenia\", \"seminomata\"], [\"taise\", \"saite\"]>>>"
