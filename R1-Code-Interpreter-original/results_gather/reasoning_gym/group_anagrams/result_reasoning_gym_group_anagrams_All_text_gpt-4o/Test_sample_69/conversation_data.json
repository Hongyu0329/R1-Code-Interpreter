    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"unmantle\", \"unmental\", \"headmen\", \"needham\", \"depit\", \"tepid\", \"farcilite\", \"telfairic\", \"laticifer\", \"alchitran\", \"clathrina\"]`.\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, sort the characters in the word alphabetically. This sorted version of the word will be the key to identify anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted key.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list:\n     - Sort the characters of the word to form the key.\n     - Check if this sorted key is already in the dictionary:\n       - If yes, append the word to the list corresponding to this key.\n       - If no, create a new entry in the dictionary with this key and start a new list with the current word.\n   - After processing all words, the dictionary will contain lists of anagrams.\n\n5. **Extract the Result**:\n   - The values of the dictionary are the groups of anagrams.\n   - Convert these values into a list of lists format.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the result as specified, using triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given list of words:\n\n- \"unmantle\" and \"unmental\" are anagrams.\n- \"headmen\" and \"needham\" are anagrams.\n- \"depit\" and \"tepid\" are anagrams.\n- \"farcilite\", \"telfairic\", and \"laticifer\" are anagrams.\n- \"alchitran\" and \"clathrina\" are anagrams.\n\nThus, the grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"unmantle\", \"unmental\"], [\"headmen\", \"needham\"], [\"depit\", \"tepid\"], [\"farcilite\", \"telfairic\", \"laticifer\"], [\"alchitran\", \"clathrina\"]>>>"
