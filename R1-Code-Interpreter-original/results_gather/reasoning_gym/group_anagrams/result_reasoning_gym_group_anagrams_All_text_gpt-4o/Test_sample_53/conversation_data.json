    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have a list of words: `[\"navet\", \"nevat\", \"venta\", \"runkly\", \"knurly\", \"roqueting\", \"requoting\", \"archine\", \"chainer\", \"scrime\", \"crimes\"]`.\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, sort the letters alphabetically. This sorted version will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted version.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Process**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - Sort the letters of the word to create a key.\n   - If the key is not in the dictionary, add it with the word in a new list.\n   - If the key is already in the dictionary, append the word to the existing list.\n   - After processing all words, the dictionary will contain lists of anagrams.\n\n5. **Output Format**: Convert the dictionary values (which are lists of anagrams) into a list of lists, as required by the problem statement.\n\n6. **Example Execution**:\n   - For the word \"navet\", the sorted key is \"aentv\".\n   - For the word \"nevat\", the sorted key is also \"aentv\".\n   - Both \"navet\" and \"nevat\" will be grouped together.\n   - Continue this process for all words.\n\n7. **Final Grouping**:\n   - \"navet\", \"nevat\", \"venta\" are anagrams.\n   - \"runkly\", \"knurly\" are anagrams.\n   - \"roqueting\", \"requoting\" are anagrams.\n   - \"archine\", \"chainer\" are anagrams.\n   - \"scrime\", \"crimes\" are anagrams.\n\n8. **Result**: The final list of lists of anagrams is:\n\n<<<[[\"navet\", \"nevat\", \"venta\"], [\"runkly\", \"knurly\"], [\"roqueting\", \"requoting\"], [\"archine\", \"chainer\"], [\"scrime\", \"crimes\"]>>>"
