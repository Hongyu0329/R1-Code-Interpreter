    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"mume\", \"meum\", \"kosha\", \"shako\", \"pendanted\", \"dependant\", \"belluine\", \"blueline\"]`.\n\n3. **Sorting for Anagram Detection**: A common method to detect anagrams is to sort the characters in each word. If two words are anagrams, their sorted character arrays will be identical.\n\n4. **Group Words**: We will group words that have the same sorted character array.\n\n5. **Iterate and Group**:\n   - For each word in the list, sort the characters of the word.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted character array to a list of words (anagrams).\n   - If the sorted character array is already a key in the dictionary, append the word to the list associated with that key.\n   - If not, create a new entry in the dictionary with the sorted character array as the key and the word as the first element in the list.\n\n6. **Extract Groups**: Once all words are processed, the values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams.\n\n7. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists, where each inner list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- \"mume\" and \"meum\" are anagrams because sorting both gives \"emmu\".\n- \"kosha\" and \"shako\" are anagrams because sorting both gives \"ahkos\".\n- \"pendanted\" and \"dependant\" are anagrams because sorting both gives \"addeennpt\".\n- \"belluine\" and \"blueline\" are anagrams because sorting both gives \"beellinu\".\n\nThus, the groups of anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"mume\", \"meum\"], [\"kosha\", \"shako\"], [\"pendanted\", \"dependant\"], [\"belluine\", \"blueline\"]>>>"
