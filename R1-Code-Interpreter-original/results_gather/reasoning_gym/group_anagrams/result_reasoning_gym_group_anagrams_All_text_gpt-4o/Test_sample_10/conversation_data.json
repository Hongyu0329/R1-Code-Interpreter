    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"ditas\", \"adits\", \"staid\", \"plastinoid\", \"palinodist\", \"cytomere\", \"merocyte\"]`.\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, we can sort the letters alphabetically. Anagrams will have the same sorted representation.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted representation to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Process**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - Sort the letters of the word to get the sorted representation.\n   - Use the sorted representation as a key in the dictionary.\n   - Append the original word to the list corresponding to this key in the dictionary.\n\n5. **Example Execution**:\n   - For the word \"ditas\", the sorted representation is \"adist\".\n   - For the word \"adits\", the sorted representation is also \"adist\".\n   - For the word \"staid\", the sorted representation is \"adist\".\n   - For the word \"plastinoid\", the sorted representation is \"adiilnopst\".\n   - For the word \"palinodist\", the sorted representation is \"adiilnopst\".\n   - For the word \"cytomere\", the sorted representation is \"ceemorty\".\n   - For the word \"merocyte\", the sorted representation is \"ceemorty\".\n\n6. **Forming Groups**:\n   - Words with the same sorted representation are grouped together.\n   - \"ditas\", \"adits\", and \"staid\" form one group.\n   - \"plastinoid\" and \"palinodist\" form another group.\n   - \"cytomere\" and \"merocyte\" form another group.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - Convert the dictionary values to a list of lists.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"ditas\", \"adits\", \"staid\"], [\"plastinoid\", \"palinodist\"], [\"cytomere\", \"merocyte\"]>>>"
