    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"crouches\", \"couchers\", \"nonrebel\", \"ennobler\", \"resiance\", \"cerasein\", \"increase\"]`.\n\n3. **Sorting for Anagram Detection**: A common method to detect anagrams is to sort the characters in each word. If two words are anagrams, their sorted character sequences will be identical.\n\n4. **Grouping Anagrams**:\n   - Create a dictionary to map the sorted character sequence to a list of words (anagrams).\n   - Iterate through each word in the list:\n     - Sort the word to get the character sequence.\n     - Use this sorted sequence as a key in the dictionary.\n     - Append the original word to the list corresponding to this key.\n\n5. **Construct the Output**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams.\n   - Collect these lists to form the final output.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The output should be a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- For \"crouches\" and \"couchers\", the sorted sequence is \"ccehorsu\".\n- For \"nonrebel\" and \"ennobler\", the sorted sequence is \"beelnnor\".\n- For \"resiance\", \"cerasein\", and \"increase\", the sorted sequence is \"aceeinrs\".\n\nNow, we can group the words based on these sorted sequences:\n\n- Group 1: [\"crouches\", \"couchers\"]\n- Group 2: [\"nonrebel\", \"ennobler\"]\n- Group 3: [\"resiance\", \"cerasein\", \"increase\"]\n\nThe final output, formatted as specified, is:\n\n<<<[[\"crouches\", \"couchers\"], [\"nonrebel\", \"ennobler\"], [\"resiance\", \"cerasein\", \"increase\"]>>>"
