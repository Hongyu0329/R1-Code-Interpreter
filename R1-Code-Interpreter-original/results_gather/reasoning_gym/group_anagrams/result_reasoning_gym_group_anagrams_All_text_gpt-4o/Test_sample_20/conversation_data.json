    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the following list of words to group into anagrams:\n   - [\"pialyn\", \"alypin\", \"plainy\", \"unsubtracted\", \"subtruncated\", \"prosecutory\", \"orycteropus\", \"legendist\", \"glistened\", \"fondu\", \"found\", \"shyster\", \"thyrses\"]\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**:\n   - Convert each word into a canonical form by sorting its letters alphabetically. This helps in identifying anagrams because anagrams will have the same sorted form.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted form to a list of words (anagrams) that match this form.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - For each word in the list, sort the letters of the word.\n   - Use the sorted word as a key in a dictionary.\n   - Append the original word to the list corresponding to this key in the dictionary.\n\n5. **Implementation**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list:\n     - Sort the word to get the canonical form.\n     - Check if this sorted form is already a key in the dictionary.\n     - If it is, append the word to the corresponding list.\n     - If it is not, create a new entry in the dictionary with this sorted form as the key and the word in a new list as the value.\n   - After processing all words, the dictionary will contain lists of anagrams.\n\n6. **Extract the Result**:\n   - The values of the dictionary are the groups of anagrams.\n   - Convert these values into a list of lists format.\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - Based on the above steps, the groups of anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"pialyn\", \"alypin\", \"plainy\"], [\"unsubtracted\", \"subtruncated\"], [\"prosecutory\", \"orycteropus\"], [\"legendist\", \"glistened\"], [\"fondu\", \"found\"], [\"shyster\", \"thyrses\"]>>>"
