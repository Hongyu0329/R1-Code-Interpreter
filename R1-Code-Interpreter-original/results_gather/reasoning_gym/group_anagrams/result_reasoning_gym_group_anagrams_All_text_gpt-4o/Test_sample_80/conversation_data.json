    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have a list of words: \n   ```\n   [\"snicher\", \"richens\", \"mathetic\", \"thematic\", \"leanish\", \"inhales\", \"miasmal\", \"lamaism\", \"sencion\", \"conines\", \"connies\", \"romancist\", \"romantics\", \"narcotism\", \"faired\", \"frieda\", \"unlighted\", \"undelight\", \"elong\", \"longe\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, sort the characters in the word alphabetically. This sorted version of the word will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted version.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Grouping**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to hold the groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - Sort the characters of the word to get the key.\n   - If the key is already in the dictionary, append the word to the list associated with that key.\n   - If the key is not in the dictionary, create a new entry with this key and start a new list with the current word.\n   - Continue this process for all words.\n\n5. **Extract the Groups**: Once all words have been processed, the dictionary will contain lists of anagrams. Extract these lists to form the final output.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The output should be a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given list of words:\n\n- \"snicher\" and \"richens\" are anagrams.\n- \"mathetic\" and \"thematic\" are anagrams.\n- \"leanish\" and \"inhales\" are anagrams.\n- \"miasmal\" and \"lamaism\" are anagrams.\n- \"sencion\", \"conines\", and \"connies\" are anagrams.\n- \"romancist\", \"romantics\", and \"narcotism\" are anagrams.\n- \"faired\" and \"frieda\" are anagrams.\n- \"unlighted\" and \"undelight\" are anagrams.\n- \"elong\" and \"longe\" are anagrams.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"snicher\", \"richens\"], [\"mathetic\", \"thematic\"], [\"leanish\", \"inhales\"], [\"miasmal\", \"lamaism\"], [\"sencion\", \"conines\", \"connies\"], [\"romancist\", \"romantics\", \"narcotism\"], [\"faired\", \"frieda\"], [\"unlighted\", \"undelight\"], [\"elong\", \"longe\"]>>>"
