    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have a list of words that need to be grouped into anagrams:\n   ```\n   [\"sturnine\", \"runniest\", \"set\", \"est\", \"neurad\", \"endura\", \"unread\", \"hotches\", \"shochet\", \"rehallow\", \"hallower\", \"dismalities\", \"dissimilate\", \"halfungs\", \"flashgun\", \"tirelessness\", \"ritelessness\", \"dirca\", \"carid\", \"daric\", \"darci\", \"batiste\", \"bastite\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**:\n   - For each word, sort the characters alphabetically. This sorted version will be the key to identify anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted version.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list:\n     - Sort the characters of the word to form a key.\n     - If the key is not in the dictionary, add it with the current word as the first element in the list.\n     - If the key is already in the dictionary, append the current word to the list associated with that key.\n   - After processing all words, the dictionary will contain lists of anagrams.\n\n5. **Extract Results**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams.\n   - Convert these values into a list of lists format.\n\n6. **Output**:\n   - The final output should be a list of lists of strings, enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given list of words:\n\n- \"sturnine\" and \"runniest\" are anagrams.\n- \"set\" and \"est\" are anagrams.\n- \"neurad\", \"endura\", and \"unread\" are anagrams.\n- \"hotches\" and \"shochet\" are anagrams.\n- \"rehallow\" and \"hallower\" are anagrams.\n- \"dismalities\" and \"dissimilate\" are anagrams.\n- \"halfungs\" and \"flashgun\" are anagrams.\n- \"tirelessness\" and \"ritelessness\" are anagrams.\n- \"dirca\", \"carid\", \"daric\", and \"darci\" are anagrams.\n- \"batiste\" and \"bastite\" are anagrams.\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"sturnine\", \"runniest\"], [\"set\", \"est\"], [\"neurad\", \"endura\", \"unread\"], [\"hotches\", \"shochet\"], [\"rehallow\", \"hallower\"], [\"dismalities\", \"dissimilate\"], [\"halfungs\", \"flashgun\"], [\"tirelessness\", \"ritelessness\"], [\"dirca\", \"carid\", \"daric\", \"darci\"], [\"batiste\", \"bastite\"]>>>"
