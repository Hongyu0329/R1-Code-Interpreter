    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the following list of words to group into anagrams:\n   - [\"rondelles\", \"norselled\", \"criminate\", \"carminite\", \"metrician\", \"antimeric\", \"flook\", \"kloof\", \"stamnoi\", \"manitos\", \"incisure\", \"sciurine\"]\n\n3. **Sorting for Anagram Detection**: To determine if two words are anagrams, we can sort the letters of each word alphabetically. If two words are anagrams, their sorted forms will be identical.\n\n4. **Group Words**: We will group words that have the same sorted form.\n\n5. **Iterate and Group**:\n   - Create a dictionary to map sorted word forms to lists of words (anagram groups).\n   - For each word in the list, sort the word to get the sorted form.\n   - Use the sorted form as a key in the dictionary. Append the original word to the list corresponding to this key.\n\n6. **Extract Groups**: The values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams.\n\n7. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given list of words:\n\n- \"rondelles\" and \"norselled\" are anagrams because their sorted form is \"deellnors\".\n- \"criminate\", \"carminite\", \"metrician\", and \"antimeric\" are anagrams because their sorted form is \"aceiimnrt\".\n- \"flook\" and \"kloof\" are anagrams because their sorted form is \"fkloo\".\n- \"stamnoi\" and \"manitos\" are anagrams because their sorted form is \"aimnost\".\n- \"incisure\" and \"sciurine\" are anagrams because their sorted form is \"ceiirsnu\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the groups of anagrams are:\n\n<<<[\n  [\"rondelles\", \"norselled\"],\n  [\"criminate\", \"carminite\", \"metrician\", \"antimeric\"],\n  [\"flook\", \"kloof\"],\n  [\"stamnoi\", \"manitos\"],\n  [\"incisure\", \"sciurine\"]\n]>>>"
