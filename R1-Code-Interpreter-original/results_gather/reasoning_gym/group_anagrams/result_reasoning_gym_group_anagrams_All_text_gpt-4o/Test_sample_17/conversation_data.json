    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Identify the Input and Output**: We are given a list of words and need to group them into lists of anagrams. The output should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\n3. **Approach to Group Anagrams**:\n   - For each word in the list, sort the letters of the word alphabetically. This sorted version of the word will serve as a key to identify anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map each sorted word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted key.\n   - Iterate through the list of words, sort each word, and add it to the corresponding list in the dictionary.\n   - The values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Execution**:\n   - Start with an empty dictionary to store the groups of anagrams.\n   - For each word in the list:\n     - Sort the word alphabetically.\n     - Use the sorted word as a key in the dictionary.\n     - Append the original word to the list corresponding to this key.\n   - After processing all words, the dictionary values will be the required groups of anagrams.\n\n5. **Apply the Approach to the Given List**:\n   - Given list: `[\"dees\", \"seed\", \"eductions\", \"seduction\", \"argentine\", \"tangerine\"]`\n   - Process each word:\n     - \"dees\" and \"seed\" both sort to \"dees\", so they form one group.\n     - \"eductions\" and \"seduction\" both sort to \"cdeinostu\", so they form another group.\n     - \"argentine\" and \"tangerine\" both sort to \"aeeginnrt\", so they form another group.\n\n6. **Compile the Results**:\n   - The dictionary will have keys with lists of anagrams as values.\n   - Extract these lists to form the final output.\n\n7. **Final Output**:\n   - The groups of anagrams are: [[\"dees\", \"seed\"], [\"eductions\", \"seduction\"], [\"argentine\", \"tangerine\"]]\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[[\"dees\", \"seed\"], [\"eductions\", \"seduction\"], [\"argentine\", \"tangerine\"]>>>"
