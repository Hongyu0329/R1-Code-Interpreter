    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if, when sorted, they have the same sequence of letters.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have a list of words that need to be grouped into anagrams:\n   ```\n   [\"shouted\", \"southed\", \"chorions\", \"isochron\", \"desex\", \"dexes\", \"sexed\", \"lilts\", \"tills\", \"still\", \"thein\", \"thine\", \"velicate\", \"celative\", \"muratorian\", \"mortuarian\", \"fester\", \"freest\", \"tapery\", \"tepary\", \"pratey\", \"petary\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Sorting Words**: For each word in the list, sort the letters alphabetically. This will help in identifying anagrams because anagrams will have the same sorted sequence.\n\n4. **Grouping Anagrams**: Use a dictionary to group words. The key will be the sorted sequence of letters, and the value will be a list of words that match this sequence.\n\n5. **Iterate and Group**: Go through each word, sort it, and add it to the corresponding list in the dictionary.\n\n6. **Extract Groups**: Once all words are processed, extract the lists of anagrams from the dictionary.\n\n7. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- **\"shouted\"** and **\"southed\"**: Both sort to \"dehostu\".\n- **\"chorions\"** and **\"isochron\"**: Both sort to \"chinoors\".\n- **\"desex\"**, **\"dexes\"**, and **\"sexed\"**: All sort to \"deesx\".\n- **\"lilts\"**, **\"tills\"**, and **\"still\"**: All sort to \"illst\".\n- **\"thein\"** and **\"thine\"**: Both sort to \"ehint\".\n- **\"velicate\"** and **\"celative\"**: Both sort to \"aceeiltv\".\n- **\"muratorian\"** and **\"mortuarian\"**: Both sort to \"aaimnorrtu\".\n- **\"fester\"** and **\"freest\"**: Both sort to \"eefrst\".\n- **\"tapery\"**, **\"tepary\"**, **\"pratey\"**, and **\"petary\"**: All sort to \"aeprty\".\n\nNow, we can group these words into lists of anagrams:\n\n<<<[[\"shouted\", \"southed\"], [\"chorions\", \"isochron\"], [\"desex\", \"dexes\", \"sexed\"], [\"lilts\", \"tills\", \"still\"], [\"thein\", \"thine\"], [\"velicate\", \"celative\"], [\"muratorian\", \"mortuarian\"], [\"fester\", \"freest\"], [\"tapery\", \"tepary\", \"pratey\", \"petary\"]>>>"
