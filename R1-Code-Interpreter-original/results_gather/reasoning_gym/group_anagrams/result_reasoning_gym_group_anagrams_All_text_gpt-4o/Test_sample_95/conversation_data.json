    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, using all the original letters exactly once. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Identify the Input**: We are given a list of words: `[\"upwork\", \"workup\", \"laron\", \"loran\"]`.\n\n3. **Determine the Method to Group Anagrams**:\n   - A common method to determine if two words are anagrams is to sort the letters of each word alphabetically. If two words are anagrams, their sorted versions will be identical.\n   - Alternatively, we could count the frequency of each letter in the words and compare these counts, but sorting is simpler and more intuitive for this problem.\n\n4. **Process Each Word**:\n   - Sort the letters of each word.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted version.\n\n5. **Group the Words**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the groups of anagrams.\n   - For each word in the list:\n     - Sort the word to get the key.\n     - If the key is not in the dictionary, add it with an empty list.\n     - Append the original word to the list corresponding to the sorted key.\n\n6. **Prepare the Output**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams.\n   - Convert these values into a list of lists format as required.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - The final output should be a list of lists of strings, enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list of words:\n\n- For \"upwork\" and \"workup\":\n  - Sorted: \"kopruw\"\n  - Both words have the same sorted version, so they are anagrams.\n\n- For \"laron\" and \"loran\":\n  - Sorted: \"alnor\"\n  - Both words have the same sorted version, so they are anagrams.\n\nThus, we have two groups of anagrams: [\"upwork\", \"workup\"] and [\"laron\", \"loran\"].\n\nThe final output, formatted as specified, is:\n\n<<<[[\"upwork\", \"workup\"], [\"laron\", \"loran\"]>>>"
