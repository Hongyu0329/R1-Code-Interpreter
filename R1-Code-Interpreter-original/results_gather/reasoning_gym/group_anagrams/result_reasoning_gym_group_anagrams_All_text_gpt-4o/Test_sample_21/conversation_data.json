    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"theine\", \"ethine\", \"generated\", \"greatened\", \"unoffensiveness\", \"noneffusiveness\", \"fluorated\", \"outflared\", \"ramona\", \"oarman\", \"romana\"]`.\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**:\n   - For each word, we can sort the letters alphabetically. This sorted version will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Process**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - Sort the letters of the word to create a key.\n   - If the key is already in the dictionary, append the word to the list associated with that key.\n   - If the key is not in the dictionary, create a new entry with the key and start a new list with the current word.\n   - Continue this process for all words.\n\n5. **Construct the Output**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams.\n   - Collect these lists into a final list of lists.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The final output should be enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given list of words:\n\n- \"theine\" and \"ethine\" are anagrams.\n- \"generated\" and \"greatened\" are anagrams.\n- \"unoffensiveness\" and \"noneffusiveness\" are anagrams.\n- \"fluorated\" and \"outflared\" are anagrams.\n- \"ramona\", \"oarman\", and \"romana\" are anagrams.\n\nThus, the grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"theine\", \"ethine\"], [\"generated\", \"greatened\"], [\"unoffensiveness\", \"noneffusiveness\"], [\"fluorated\", \"outflared\"], [\"ramona\", \"oarman\", \"romana\"]>>>"
