    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Approach**: \n   - For each word, sort the characters in the word alphabetically. This sorted version of the word will serve as a key.\n   - Words that are anagrams of each other will have the same sorted key.\n   - Use a dictionary to group words by their sorted key.\n\n3. **Steps**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - For each word, sort the characters to form the key.\n   - Check if this key exists in the dictionary:\n     - If it exists, append the word to the list corresponding to this key.\n     - If it does not exist, create a new entry in the dictionary with this key and start a new list with the current word.\n   - After processing all words, the dictionary will contain lists of anagrams.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - Extract the lists of anagrams from the dictionary.\n   - Format the output as a list of lists enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Example**:\n   - Consider the word \"encrusted\". Its sorted key is \"cdeenrstu\".\n   - \"undersect\" and \"uncrested\" will also have the same sorted key \"cdeenrstu\", so they will be grouped together.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given list of words:\n\n- \"encrusted\", \"undersect\", \"uncrested\" all have the sorted key \"cdeenrstu\".\n- \"pretaste\", \"tapester\", \"prestate\", \"peartest\" all have the sorted key \"aeeprstt\".\n- \"topological\", \"optological\" have the sorted key \"acgillooot\".\n- \"chapote\", \"apothec\" have the sorted key \"acehopt\".\n- \"amelcorn\", \"cornmeal\" have the sorted key \"acelmnor\".\n- \"ted\", \"det\" have the sorted key \"det\".\n- \"umlauts\", \"mutuals\" have the sorted key \"almstuu\".\n- \"extirpates\", \"sexpartite\" have the sorted key \"aeeiprsstx\".\n\nThe final grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[\n    [\"encrusted\", \"undersect\", \"uncrested\"],\n    [\"pretaste\", \"tapester\", \"prestate\", \"peartest\"],\n    [\"topological\", \"optological\"],\n    [\"chapote\", \"apothec\"],\n    [\"amelcorn\", \"cornmeal\"],\n    [\"ted\", \"det\"],\n    [\"umlauts\", \"mutuals\"],\n    [\"extirpates\", \"sexpartite\"]\n]>>>"
