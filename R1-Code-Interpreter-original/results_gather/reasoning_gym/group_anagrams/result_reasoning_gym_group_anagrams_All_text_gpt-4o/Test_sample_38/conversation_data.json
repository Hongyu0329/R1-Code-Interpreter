  "question": "An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of a different word, using all the original letters exactly once.\n\nYour job is to group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.\n\nThe output is a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets, where each outer list contains a group of anagrams, e.g. <<<[[\"eat\", \"tea\"], [\"tan\", \"nat\"]]>>>.\n\nGroup the following list of words into anagrams:\n[\"commissioned\", \"decommission\", \"neogenesis\", \"noegenesis\", \"queeve\", \"eveque\"]\n",

    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that have the same characters in the same frequency but in a different order. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"commissioned\", \"decommission\", \"neogenesis\", \"noegenesis\", \"queeve\", \"eveque\"]`.\n\n3. **Group Anagrams**:\n   - We need to group words that are anagrams of each other.\n   - A common method to identify anagrams is to sort the characters in each word. If two words are anagrams, their sorted character arrays will be identical.\n\n4. **Process Each Word**:\n   - Sort the characters of each word.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted character string to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n5. **Iterate Over the List**:\n   - For each word in the list, sort the word.\n   - Check if the sorted word is already a key in the dictionary.\n   - If it is, append the original word to the list corresponding to that key.\n   - If it is not, create a new entry in the dictionary with the sorted word as the key and the original word in a new list as the value.\n\n6. **Collect Results**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams.\n   - These lists are the groups of anagrams we need.\n\n7. **Output Format**:\n   - The output should be a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- \"commissioned\" and \"decommission\" are anagrams because sorting their characters gives the same result.\n- \"neogenesis\" and \"noegenesis\" are anagrams for the same reason.\n- \"queeve\" and \"eveque\" are anagrams as well.\n\nThus, the groups of anagrams are:\n\n- Group 1: [\"commissioned\", \"decommission\"]\n- Group 2: [\"neogenesis\", \"noegenesis\"]\n- Group 3: [\"queeve\", \"eveque\"]\n\nThe final output, formatted as specified, is:\n\n<<<[[\"commissioned\", \"decommission\"], [\"neogenesis\", \"noegenesis\"], [\"queeve\", \"eveque\"]>>>"
