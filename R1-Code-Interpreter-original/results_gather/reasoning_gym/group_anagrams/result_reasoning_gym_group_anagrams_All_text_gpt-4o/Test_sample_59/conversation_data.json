    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that have the same characters in the same frequency but in a different order. For example, \"eat\" and \"tea\" are anagrams because they both consist of the letters 'e', 'a', and 't'.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"omnitenent\", \"intonement\", \"rightable\", \"bergalith\", \"missary\", \"syriasm\"]`.\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, we can sort the characters in the word. Anagrams will result in the same sorted string.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted string to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Process**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - Sort the characters of the word to form a key.\n   - If the key is already in the dictionary, append the word to the list associated with that key.\n   - If the key is not in the dictionary, create a new entry with the key and start a new list with the current word.\n   - Continue this process for all words.\n\n5. **Construct the Output**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be lists of anagrams.\n   - Collect these lists into a final list of lists.\n\n6. **Example Execution**:\n   - For \"omnitenent\" and \"intonement\", sorting the characters results in the same key: \"eeimnnnott\".\n   - For \"rightable\" and \"bergalith\", sorting the characters results in the same key: \"abeghilrt\".\n   - For \"missary\" and \"syriasm\", sorting the characters results in the same key: \"aimrssy\".\n\n7. **Final Grouping**:\n   - Group 1: [\"omnitenent\", \"intonement\"]\n   - Group 2: [\"rightable\", \"bergalith\"]\n   - Group 3: [\"missary\", \"syriasm\"]\n\n8. **Output Format**:\n   - The final output should be a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[[\"omnitenent\", \"intonement\"], [\"rightable\", \"bergalith\"], [\"missary\", \"syriasm\"]>>>"
