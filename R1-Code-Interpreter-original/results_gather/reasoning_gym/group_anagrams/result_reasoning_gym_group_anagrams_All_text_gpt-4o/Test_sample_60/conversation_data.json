    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have a list of words: \n   - [\"lodger\", \"golder\", \"tolderia\", \"tailored\", \"hipline\", \"philine\", \"hotpresses\", \"prostheses\", \"replanted\", \"predental\", \"interposure\", \"neuropteris\", \"ochidore\", \"choreoid\", \"protreaty\", \"reptatory\"]\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**:\n   - For each word, sort the characters in the word. This will help in identifying anagrams because anagrams will have the same sorted character sequence.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted character sequence to a list of words (anagrams).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Process**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list.\n   - For each word, sort the characters to form a key.\n   - Check if this sorted key is already in the dictionary:\n     - If yes, append the word to the list corresponding to this key.\n     - If no, create a new entry in the dictionary with this key and start a new list with the current word.\n   - After processing all words, the dictionary will contain lists of anagrams.\n\n5. **Extract Results**:\n   - The values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams.\n   - Convert these values into a list of lists format.\n\n6. **Output**:\n   - The final output should be a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given list of words:\n\n- \"lodger\" and \"golder\" are anagrams.\n- \"tolderia\" and \"tailored\" are anagrams.\n- \"hipline\" and \"philine\" are anagrams.\n- \"hotpresses\" and \"prostheses\" are anagrams.\n- \"replanted\" and \"predental\" are anagrams.\n- \"interposure\" and \"neuropteris\" are anagrams.\n- \"ochidore\" and \"choreoid\" are anagrams.\n- \"protreaty\" and \"reptatory\" are anagrams.\n\nThus, the groups of anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"lodger\", \"golder\"], [\"tolderia\", \"tailored\"], [\"hipline\", \"philine\"], [\"hotpresses\", \"prostheses\"], [\"replanted\", \"predental\"], [\"interposure\", \"neuropteris\"], [\"ochidore\", \"choreoid\"], [\"protreaty\", \"reptatory\"]>>>"
