    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the following list of words:\n   - [\"granitite\", \"iterating\", \"helium\", \"humlie\", \"nizam\", \"nazim\", \"striplings\", \"slipstring\", \"rearrest\", \"arrester\", \"bf\", \"fb\", \"tadpolism\", \"diplomats\", \"cunan\", \"canun\"]\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, sort the letters alphabetically. This sorted version will be the same for all anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted version.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - \"granitite\" and \"iterating\": Sort both to get \"aegiinnrt\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"helium\" and \"humlie\": Sort both to get \"ehilmu\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"nizam\" and \"nazim\": Sort both to get \"aimnz\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"striplings\" and \"slipstring\": Sort both to get \"giilnprsst\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"rearrest\" and \"arrester\": Sort both to get \"aeerrrst\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"bf\" and \"fb\": Sort both to get \"bf\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"tadpolism\" and \"diplomats\": Sort both to get \"adilmostp\". They are anagrams.\n   - \"cunan\" and \"canun\": Sort both to get \"acnnu\". They are anagrams.\n\n5. **Group the Anagrams**:\n   - Group 1: [\"granitite\", \"iterating\"]\n   - Group 2: [\"helium\", \"humlie\"]\n   - Group 3: [\"nizam\", \"nazim\"]\n   - Group 4: [\"striplings\", \"slipstring\"]\n   - Group 5: [\"rearrest\", \"arrester\"]\n   - Group 6: [\"bf\", \"fb\"]\n   - Group 7: [\"tadpolism\", \"diplomats\"]\n   - Group 8: [\"cunan\", \"canun\"]\n\n6. **Output the Result**: The final output should be a list of lists, where each list contains words that are anagrams of each other.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<[[\"granitite\", \"iterating\"], [\"helium\", \"humlie\"], [\"nizam\", \"nazim\"], [\"striplings\", \"slipstring\"], [\"rearrest\", \"arrester\"], [\"bf\", \"fb\"], [\"tadpolism\", \"diplomats\"], [\"cunan\", \"canun\"]>>>"
