    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequency.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the list of words: `[\"encrinital\", \"tricennial\", \"sequan\", \"queans\", \"diasters\", \"disaster\", \"warranties\", \"warrantise\", \"siak\", \"saki\", \"sika\"]`.\n\n3. **Grouping Strategy**: \n   - For each word, sort the characters in the word alphabetically. This sorted version of the word will be the same for all its anagrams.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of the word to a list of words (anagrams) that match this sorted version.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Grouping**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the groups of anagrams.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list:\n     - Sort the word to get the key.\n     - If the key is not in the dictionary, add it with an empty list.\n     - Append the original word to the list corresponding to the sorted key.\n   - After processing all words, the dictionary will contain lists of anagrams.\n\n5. **Extract the Result**:\n   - The values of the dictionary are the groups of anagrams.\n   - Convert these values into a list of lists format.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The result should be enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given list of words:\n\n- \"encrinital\" and \"tricennial\" are anagrams.\n- \"sequan\" and \"queans\" are anagrams.\n- \"diasters\" and \"disaster\" are anagrams.\n- \"warranties\" and \"warrantise\" are anagrams.\n- \"siak\", \"saki\", and \"sika\" are anagrams.\n\nThus, the grouped anagrams are:\n\n<<<[[\"encrinital\", \"tricennial\"], [\"sequan\", \"queans\"], [\"diasters\", \"disaster\"], [\"warranties\", \"warrantise\"], [\"siak\", \"saki\", \"sika\"]>>>"
