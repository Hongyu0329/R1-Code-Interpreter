    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n\n2. **Input List**: We have the following list of words: \n   - [\"surbases\", \"rubasses\", \"seeings\", \"genesis\", \"trichinosis\", \"histrionics\", \"beagle\", \"glebae\", \"ceps\", \"psec\", \"spec\"]\n\n3. **Identify Anagrams**: To identify anagrams, we can sort the letters of each word. Words that are anagrams of each other will have the same sorted letter sequence.\n\n4. **Group Anagrams**: We will group words that have the same sorted letter sequence.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Sort the letters of each word.\n   - Use a dictionary to map the sorted letter sequence to the list of words (anagrams) that match that sequence.\n   - Iterate through each word in the list, sort its letters, and add it to the corresponding list in the dictionary.\n   - The values of the dictionary will be the groups of anagrams.\n\n6. **Example**:\n   - \"surbases\" and \"rubasses\" both sort to \"abersssu\".\n   - \"seeings\" and \"genesis\" both sort to \"eegins\".\n   - \"beagle\" and \"glebae\" both sort to \"abeegl\".\n   - \"ceps\", \"psec\", and \"spec\" all sort to \"ceps\".\n\n7. **Final Grouping**:\n   - Group 1: [\"surbases\", \"rubasses\"]\n   - Group 2: [\"seeings\", \"genesis\"]\n   - Group 3: [\"trichinosis\"]\n   - Group 4: [\"histrionics\"]\n   - Group 5: [\"beagle\", \"glebae\"]\n   - Group 6: [\"ceps\", \"psec\", \"spec\"]\n\n8. **Output Format**: The output should be a list of lists of strings enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<[[\"surbases\", \"rubasses\"], [\"seeings\", \"genesis\"], [\"trichinosis\"], [\"histrionics\"], [\"beagle\", \"glebae\"], [\"ceps\", \"psec\", \"spec\"]>>>"
