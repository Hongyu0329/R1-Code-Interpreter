    "To solve the problem of grouping anagrams, we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand Anagrams**: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. This means that two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in the same frequency.\n\n2. **Identify Key for Grouping**: To group words into anagrams, we can use a key that represents the composition of the word. A common method is to sort the letters of the word alphabetically. Words that are anagrams will have the same sorted key.\n\n3. **Iterate Through the List**: We will iterate through the list of words, compute the sorted key for each word, and use this key to group words together.\n\n4. **Use a Data Structure for Grouping**: A dictionary can be used where the key is the sorted word, and the value is a list of words (anagrams) that match this key.\n\n5. **Construct the Output**: Once all words are processed, the values of the dictionary will represent groups of anagrams. These can be collected into a list of lists.\n\nLet's apply this step-by-step analysis to the given list of words:\n\n- **Words**: [\"nomological\", \"monological\", \"predelay\", \"replayed\", \"parleyed\", \"restretch\", \"stretcher\", \"unpooled\", \"unlooped\", \"gein\", \"gien\", \"arginine\", \"nigerian\", \"makars\", \"karmas\", \"inhales\", \"leanish\", \"cenchrus\", \"crunches\"]\n\n- **Grouping Process**:\n  - \"nomological\" and \"monological\" are anagrams (sorted key: \"acgillmnooo\").\n  - \"predelay\", \"replayed\", and \"parleyed\" are anagrams (sorted key: \"adeelpry\").\n  - \"restretch\" and \"stretcher\" are anagrams (sorted key: \"ceehrrstt\").\n  - \"unpooled\" and \"unlooped\" are anagrams (sorted key: \"delnoopu\").\n  - \"gein\" and \"gien\" are anagrams (sorted key: \"egin\").\n  - \"arginine\" and \"nigerian\" are anagrams (sorted key: \"aegiinnr\").\n  - \"makars\" and \"karmas\" are anagrams (sorted key: \"aakmrs\").\n  - \"inhales\" and \"leanish\" are anagrams (sorted key: \"aehilns\").\n  - \"cenchrus\" and \"crunches\" are anagrams (sorted key: \"ccehnrsu\").\n\n- **Final Grouping**:\n  - Group 1: [\"nomological\", \"monological\"]\n  - Group 2: [\"predelay\", \"replayed\", \"parleyed\"]\n  - Group 3: [\"restretch\", \"stretcher\"]\n  - Group 4: [\"unpooled\", \"unlooped\"]\n  - Group 5: [\"gein\", \"gien\"]\n  - Group 6: [\"arginine\", \"nigerian\"]\n  - Group 7: [\"makars\", \"karmas\"]\n  - Group 8: [\"inhales\", \"leanish\"]\n  - Group 9: [\"cenchrus\", \"crunches\"]\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<[[\"nomological\", \"monological\"], [\"predelay\", \"replayed\", \"parleyed\"], [\"restretch\", \"stretcher\"], [\"unpooled\", \"unlooped\"], [\"gein\", \"gien\"], [\"arginine\", \"nigerian\"], [\"makars\", \"karmas\"], [\"inhales\", \"leanish\"], [\"cenchrus\", \"crunches\"]>>>"
