    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be logically inferred from them.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. \\((P ∧ S) ∨ (R → P)\\)\n2. \\(Q ∧ Q\\) (which simplifies to \\(Q\\))\n3. \\((Q ∧ P) ∧ (R ∨ Q)\\)\n\nLet's analyze these premises:\n\n- Premise 2 simplifies to \\(Q\\).\n- Premise 3 can be broken down into two parts: \\(Q ∧ P\\) and \\(R ∨ Q\\). Since \\(Q\\) is true (from premise 2), both parts of premise 3 are satisfied, meaning \\(P\\) is also true.\n\nNow, let's consider premise 1: \\((P ∧ S) ∨ (R → P)\\).\n\n- We know \\(P\\) is true from premise 3.\n- The expression \\(R → P\\) is equivalent to \\(\\neg R ∨ P\\). Since \\(P\\) is true, \\(R → P\\) is true regardless of the truth value of \\(R\\).\n\nTherefore, the entire expression \\((P ∧ S) ∨ (R → P)\\) is true because \\(R → P\\) is true.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are true. However, we cannot definitively conclude the truth value of \\(S\\) or \\(R\\) from the given premises.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw is:\n\n\\[\nP ∧ Q\n\\]\n\nSo, the conclusion logic statement is:\n\n<<<P ∧ Q>>>"
