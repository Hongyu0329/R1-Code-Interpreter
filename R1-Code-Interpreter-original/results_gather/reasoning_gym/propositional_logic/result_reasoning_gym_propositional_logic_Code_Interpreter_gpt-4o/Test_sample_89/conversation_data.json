    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\n1. The first premise is \\((P ∨ Q) → ¬P\\). This means that if \\(P\\) or \\(Q\\) is true, then \\(P\\) must be false.\n\n2. The second premise is \\((Q ∧ P) → (Q ∧ Q)\\). This is a tautology because \\((Q ∧ Q)\\) is equivalent to \\(Q\\). Therefore, this premise is always true when \\(Q ∧ P\\) is true.\n\nLet's analyze these premises:\n\n- From the first premise, if \\(P\\) is true, then \\((P ∨ Q)\\) is true, which implies ¬P. This is a contradiction, so \\(P\\) must be false.\n- If \\(P\\) is false, then \\((Q ∧ P)\\) is false, making the second premise trivially true.\n\nGiven that \\(P\\) must be false, we can conclude:\n\n- Since \\(P\\) is false, the first premise \\((P ∨ Q) → ¬P\\) simplifies to \\(Q → ¬P\\), which is trivially true because ¬P is already true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw is that \\(P\\) is false.\n\nThe conclusion logic statement is:\n\n<<<¬P>>>"
