    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to analyze the given premises:\n\n1. \\( Q \\leftrightarrow R \\) means \\( Q \\) is true if and only if \\( R \\) is true. This can be expressed as \\( (Q \\rightarrow R) \\land (R \\rightarrow Q) \\).\n\n2. \\( \\neg R \\) means \\( R \\) is false.\n\nFrom premise 1, we have:\n- \\( Q \\rightarrow R \\): If \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( R \\) must be true.\n- \\( R \\rightarrow Q \\): If \\( R \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg R \\) (premise 2), \\( R \\) is false. Therefore, from \\( R \\rightarrow Q \\), since \\( R \\) is false, \\( Q \\) must also be false to satisfy the biconditional \\( Q \\leftrightarrow R \\).\n\nThus, the conclusion is \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe conclusion logic statement is:\n\n<<<¬Q>>>"
