However, there are no logical connectives or additional premises that allow us to infer a new conclusion beyond the given statements. Therefore, the conclusion is simply the conjunction of the true premises.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n\\[\nP \\land R\n\\]\n\nThus, the conclusion logic statement is:\n\n<<<P ∧ R>>>"
