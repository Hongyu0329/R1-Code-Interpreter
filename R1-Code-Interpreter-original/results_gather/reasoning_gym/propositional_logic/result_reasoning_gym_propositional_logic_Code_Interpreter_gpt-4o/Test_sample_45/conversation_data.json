    "\nassistant > From the given premises, we can make the following observations:\n\n1. The first two premises are both \"P\", which means that P is true.\n2. The third premise is \"(R → R)\", which is a tautology. In propositional logic, a statement of the form \"R → R\" is always true, regardless of the truth value of R.\n\nSince the premises do not provide any additional information beyond the truth of P and the tautology, the only conclusion we can draw is that P is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<P>>>"
