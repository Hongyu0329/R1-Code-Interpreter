    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be logically inferred from them.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. \\((P → Q) → (P ∧ P)\\)\n2. \\((P → Q) → (Q ∧ Q)\\)\n3. \\(P → P\\)\n\nLet's analyze each premise:\n\n1. The first premise \\((P → Q) → (P ∧ P)\\) suggests that if \\(P → Q\\) is true, then \\(P ∧ P\\) is true. Since \\(P ∧ P\\) is logically equivalent to \\(P\\), this premise simplifies to \\((P → Q) → P\\).\n\n2. The second premise \\((P → Q) → (Q ∧ Q)\\) suggests that if \\(P → Q\\) is true, then \\(Q ∧ Q\\) is true. Since \\(Q ∧ Q\\) is logically equivalent to \\(Q\\), this premise simplifies to \\((P → Q) → Q\\).\n\n3. The third premise \\(P → P\\) is a tautology, meaning it is always true.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of the simplified premises:\n\n- From \\((P → Q) → P\\), we can infer that if \\(P → Q\\) is true, then \\(P\\) must be true.\n- From \\((P → Q) → Q\\), we can infer that if \\(P → Q\\) is true, then \\(Q\\) must be true.\n\nIf both \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) must be true when \\(P → Q\\) is true, then \\(P → Q\\) must be true. This is because the only way for both \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) to be true is if \\(P → Q\\) holds.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the premises is that \\(P → Q\\) is true.\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<P → Q>>>"
