    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's analyze the given premises:\n\n1. \\( R \\lor Q \\) - This means either \\( R \\) is true, \\( Q \\) is true, or both are true.\n2. \\( R \\land Q \\) - This means both \\( R \\) and \\( Q \\) are true.\n3. \\( R \\) - This means \\( R \\) is true.\n\nFrom premise 2, \\( R \\land Q \\), we know both \\( R \\) and \\( Q \\) are true. This directly implies that \\( Q \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from these premises is that \\( Q \\) is true.\n\nThe conclusion logic statement is:\n\n<<<Q>>>"
