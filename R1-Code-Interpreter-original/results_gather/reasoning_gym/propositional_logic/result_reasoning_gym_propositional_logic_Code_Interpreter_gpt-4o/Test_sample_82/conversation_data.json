    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, let's analyze the given premises:\n\n1. \\( Q \\)\n2. \\((P \\leftrightarrow P) \\lor (Q \\leftrightarrow P)\\)\n3. \\(\\neg \\neg P\\)\n4. \\( Q \\)\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n- Premise 1 and 4 are the same, stating \\( Q \\) is true.\n- Premise 3, \\(\\neg \\neg P\\), simplifies to \\( P \\) (since double negation cancels out).\n- Premise 2, \\((P \\leftrightarrow P) \\lor (Q \\leftrightarrow P)\\), can be simplified:\n  - \\( P \\leftrightarrow P \\) is always true because any statement is equivalent to itself.\n  - Therefore, \\((P \\leftrightarrow P) \\lor (Q \\leftrightarrow P)\\) simplifies to \\( \\text{True} \\lor (Q \\leftrightarrow P) \\), which is always true regardless of the truth value of \\( Q \\leftrightarrow P \\).\n\nGiven that \\( P \\) is true (from premise 3) and \\( Q \\) is true (from premises 1 and 4), we can conclude that:\n\n- \\( Q \\leftrightarrow P \\) is true because both \\( Q \\) and \\( P \\) are true.\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n\n\\[\nQ \\leftrightarrow P\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logic statement is:\n\n<<<Q ↔ P>>>"
