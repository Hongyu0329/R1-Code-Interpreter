    "\nassistant > From the given premises:\n\n1. \\( P \\)\n2. \\( Q \\lor P \\)\n\nWe can conclude that \\( P \\) is true. Since \\( P \\) is true, the disjunction \\( Q \\lor P \\) is also true regardless of the truth value of \\( Q \\). Therefore, the conclusion that can be directly inferred from these premises is \\( P \\).\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<P>>>"
