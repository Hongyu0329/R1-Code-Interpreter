    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be logically inferred from them.\n\n1. \\( P \\leftrightarrow Q \\) means \\( P \\) is true if and only if \\( Q \\) is true. This implies \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\).\n\n2. \\( Q \\leftrightarrow R \\) means \\( Q \\) is true if and only if \\( R \\) is true. This implies \\( Q \\rightarrow R \\) and \\( R \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n3. \\( P \\rightarrow P \\) is a tautology, meaning it is always true regardless of the truth value of \\( P \\).\n\nFrom the first two premises, we can deduce a transitive relationship:\n\n- Since \\( P \\leftrightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\leftrightarrow R \\), we can conclude \\( P \\leftrightarrow R \\).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that can be drawn from the given premises is:\n\n\\[\nP \\leftrightarrow R\n\\]\n\nThus, the conclusion logic statement is:\n\n<<<P ↔ R>>>"
