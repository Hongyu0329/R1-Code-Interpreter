    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be logically inferred from them.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. \\( \\neg Q \\lor \\neg P \\) - This means either \\( Q \\) is false or \\( P \\) is false (or both).\n2. \\( \\neg(Q \\lor P) \\) - This means neither \\( Q \\) nor \\( P \\) is true.\n3. \\( (Q \\lor P) \\land (P \\rightarrow Q) \\) - This means either \\( Q \\) or \\( P \\) is true, and if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n4. \\( Q \\) - This means \\( Q \\) is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze these premises:\n\n- From premise 4, we know \\( Q \\) is true.\n- Premise 2, \\( \\neg(Q \\lor P) \\), implies both \\( Q \\) and \\( P \\) are false, which contradicts premise 4. Therefore, premise 2 cannot be true if \\( Q \\) is true.\n- Premise 1, \\( \\neg Q \\lor \\neg P \\), is consistent with \\( Q \\) being true only if \\( P \\) is false.\n- Premise 3, \\( (Q \\lor P) \\land (P \\rightarrow Q) \\), is consistent with \\( Q \\) being true, but it requires that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. Since \\( Q \\) is already true, this does not provide additional information.\n\nGiven the contradiction between premise 2 and the fact that \\( Q \\) is true, we can conclude that \\( P \\) must be false to satisfy the other premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n\n\\[\n\\neg P\n\\]\n\nSo, the conclusion logic statement is:\n\n<<<¬P>>>"
