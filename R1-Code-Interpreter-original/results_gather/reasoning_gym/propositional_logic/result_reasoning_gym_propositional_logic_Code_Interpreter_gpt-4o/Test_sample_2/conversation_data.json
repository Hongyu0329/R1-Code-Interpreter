    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's analyze the given premises:\n\n1. \\(((P ∨ S) ∧ ¬P)\\): This means that either \\(P\\) or \\(S\\) is true, but \\(P\\) is not true. Therefore, \\(S\\) must be true.\n\n2. \\(\\neg R\\): This means \\(R\\) is false.\n\n3. \\(Q\\): This means \\(Q\\) is true.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude:\n\n- From premise 1, since \\(P\\) is false and \\(P \\lor S\\) is true, \\(S\\) must be true.\n- Premise 2 directly tells us that \\(R\\) is false.\n- Premise 3 directly tells us that \\(Q\\) is true.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw from these premises is that \\(S\\) is true, \\(R\\) is false, and \\(Q\\) is true.\n\nThe conclusion logic statement is:\n\n\\[\nS \\land \\neg R \\land Q\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<S ∧ ¬R ∧ Q>>>"
