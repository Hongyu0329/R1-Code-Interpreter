    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be logically inferred.\n\n1. The first premise is \\((R ∧ R) ∧ ¬Q\\), which simplifies to \\(R ∧ ¬Q\\) because \\(R ∧ R\\) is equivalent to \\(R\\).\n\n2. The second premise is \\(Q ∨ P\\).\n\n3. The third premise is \\(¬Q → (S → S)\\). The expression \\(S → S\\) is a tautology, meaning it is always true regardless of the truth value of \\(S\\). Therefore, \\(¬Q → (S → S)\\) simplifies to \\(¬Q → \\text{True}\\), which is always true because any statement implies a true statement.\n\nNow, let's analyze these premises:\n\n- From the first premise \\(R ∧ ¬Q\\), we know that \\(R\\) is true and \\(Q\\) is false.\n- From the second premise \\(Q ∨ P\\), since \\(Q\\) is false, \\(P\\) must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from these premises is that both \\(R\\) and \\(P\\) are true.\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n\n\\[\nR ∧ P\n\\]\n\nSo, the final conclusion is:\n\n<<<R ∧ P>>>"
