    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be logically inferred from them.\n\n1. \\( S \\leftrightarrow R \\) means that \\( S \\) is true if and only if \\( R \\) is true. This implies that \\( S \\) and \\( R \\) have the same truth value.\n\n2. \\( (P \\land Q) \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) means that if both \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are true, then \\( Q \\) must be false. This is a contradiction because \\( Q \\) cannot be both true and false at the same time. Therefore, the premise \\( (P \\land Q) \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) implies that \\( P \\land Q \\) must be false. This means either \\( P \\) is false, \\( Q \\) is false, or both are false.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that:\n\n- Since \\( (P \\land Q) \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) leads to a contradiction if both \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are true, we can conclude that \\( P \\land Q \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n\n\\[\n\\neg (P \\land Q)\n\\]\n\nExpressing this in the required format:\n\n\\[\n\\neg P \\lor \\neg Q\n\\]\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<¬P ∨ ¬Q>>>"
