    "\nassistant > Given the premises:\n\n1. \\( Q \\)\n2. \\( \\neg R \\)\n\nThere is no direct logical connection between \\( Q \\) and \\( \\neg R \\) that allows us to infer a new conclusion involving both. Each statement stands independently, and without additional premises or a logical connective between them, we cannot derive a new conclusion that combines them.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is simply the conjunction of the two premises:\n\n\\[\nQ \\land \\neg R\n\\]\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<Q ∧ ¬R>>>"
