    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, let's analyze the given premises:\n\n1. \\( P \\) is true.\n2. \\( R \\leftrightarrow Q \\) means \\( R \\) is true if and only if \\( Q \\) is true. This implies that \\( R \\) and \\( Q \\) have the same truth value.\n3. \\( \\neg(R \\rightarrow R) \\) is a contradiction because \\( R \\rightarrow R \\) is always true (a statement implies itself). Therefore, \\( \\neg(R \\rightarrow R) \\) is always false.\n\nGiven that the third premise is a contradiction, the entire set of premises is inconsistent. In classical logic, from a contradiction, any conclusion can be derived (principle of explosion).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude any statement, including \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n<<<¬P>>>"
