    "\nassistant > Given the premises:\n\n1. ¬Q (Not Q)\n2. P\n\nThere is no direct logical connection between P and Q in the given premises. Therefore, we cannot infer a conclusion that involves both P and Q together. The premises only provide information about P and Q individually.\n\nSince there is no additional information or logical operators connecting P and Q, the conclusion is simply the conjunction of the given premises:\n\n<<<P ∧ ¬Q>>>"
