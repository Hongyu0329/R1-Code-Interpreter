    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's analyze the given premises:\n\n1. \\( (Q \\lor Q) \\) simplifies to \\( Q \\).\n2. \\( ((Q \\lor P) \\lor (Q \\lor Q)) \\) simplifies to \\( (Q \\lor P) \\lor Q \\), which further simplifies to \\( Q \\lor P \\).\n3. \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that \\( Q \\) is false. Therefore, in premise 2, \\( Q \\lor P \\) simplifies to \\( P \\) because \\( Q \\) is false.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw is that \\( P \\) must be true.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n<<<P>>>"
