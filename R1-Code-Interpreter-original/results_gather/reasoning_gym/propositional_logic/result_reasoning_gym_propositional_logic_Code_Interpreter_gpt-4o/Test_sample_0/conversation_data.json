    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's analyze the given premises:\n\n1. \\( Q \\) is a premise, which means \\( Q \\) is true.\n2. \\( (P \\rightarrow P) \\vee (Q \\wedge Q) \\) is a tautology because:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow P \\) is always true (a tautology) because any statement implies itself.\n   - \\( Q \\wedge Q \\) is equivalent to \\( Q \\), which is true as given in premise 1.\n\nSince the second premise is a tautology, it doesn't provide any new information beyond what is already known from the first premise. Therefore, the only conclusion we can draw from the premises is \\( Q \\).\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<Q>>>"
