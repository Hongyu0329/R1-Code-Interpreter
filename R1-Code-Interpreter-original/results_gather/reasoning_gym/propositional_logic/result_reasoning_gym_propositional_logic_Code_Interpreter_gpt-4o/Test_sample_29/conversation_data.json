    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to analyze the given premises:\n\n1. \\( \\neg Q \\lor \\neg R \\)\n2. \\( Q \\)\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that \\( Q \\) is true. \n\nNow, let's substitute \\( Q \\) being true into premise 1:\n\n- If \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\) is false.\n- Therefore, for the disjunction \\( \\neg Q \\lor \\neg R \\) to be true, \\( \\neg R \\) must be true (since one of the disjuncts must be true for the entire disjunction to be true).\n\nIf \\( \\neg R \\) is true, then \\( R \\) must be false.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw is:\n\n\\[\n\\neg R\n\\]\n\nSo, the conclusion logic statement is:\n\n<<<¬R>>>"
