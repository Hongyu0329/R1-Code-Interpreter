    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and deduce a conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. ¬(R ∧ Q): This means that R and Q cannot both be true at the same time. At least one of them must be false.\n2. (Q ↔ P): This means Q is true if and only if P is true. In other words, Q and P have the same truth value.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- From premise 1, ¬(R ∧ Q), we know that either R is false, Q is false, or both are false.\n- From premise 2, (Q ↔ P), we know that Q and P must have the same truth value. This means if Q is true, P is true, and if Q is false, P is false.\n\nLet's consider the possible truth values for R, Q, and P:\n\n1. If Q is true, then P must also be true (from premise 2). However, if Q is true, then R must be false (from premise 1) because both R and Q cannot be true simultaneously.\n2. If Q is false, then P must also be false (from premise 2). In this case, R can be either true or false, but it doesn't affect the truth of Q and P.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that if R is true, then Q must be false, and consequently, P must also be false. This gives us a potential conclusion: R → ¬Q.\n\nLet's verify this conclusion using a truth table approach to ensure consistency with the premises.\n\n```python\n# Define the truth values for R, Q, and P\ntruth_values = [(False, False, False), (False, False, True), (False, True, False), (False, True, True),\n                (True, False, False), (True, False, True), (True, True, False), (True, True, True)]\n\n# Check which combinations satisfy the premises\nvalid_combinations = []\nfor R, Q, P in truth_values:\n    premise1 = not (R and Q)\n    premise2 = (Q == P)\n    if premise1 and premise2:\n        valid_combinations.append((R, Q, P))\n\n# Determine the conclusion\nconclusion = all(R == False or Q == False for R, Q, P in valid_combinations)\n\nprint(conclusion)\n```\n\nThe code will check all possible truth values for R, Q, and P, and verify which combinations satisfy both premises. Then, it will check if the conclusion R → ¬Q holds for all valid combinations. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code output indicates that the conclusion R → ¬Q is true for all valid combinations of truth values that satisfy the given premises. This means that whenever R is true, Q must be false, which aligns with our reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion from the given premises is:\n\n<<<R → ¬Q>>>"
