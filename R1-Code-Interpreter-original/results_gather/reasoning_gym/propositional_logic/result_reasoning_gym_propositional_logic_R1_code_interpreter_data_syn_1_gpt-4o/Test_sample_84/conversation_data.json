    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and deduce a conclusion. Let's break down each premise and see what we can infer:\n\n1. ¬(P ∧ Q): This means that P and Q cannot both be true at the same time. At least one of them must be false.\n\n2. (Q → R): This implies that if Q is true, then R must also be true.\n\n3. (S ↔ P): This means S is true if and only if P is true. So, S and P have the same truth value.\n\n4. (R ∧ R): This simplifies to R, meaning R is true.\n\nNow, let's use these premises to deduce a conclusion:\n\n- From premise 4, we know R is true.\n- From premise 2, since R is true, Q could be true or false. However, if Q were true, then P would have to be false due to premise 1 (¬(P ∧ Q)).\n- From premise 3, since S ↔ P, if P is false, then S must also be false.\n\nLet's summarize the deductions:\n- R is true.\n- If Q is true, then P is false, and consequently, S is false.\n- If Q is false, then P can be true or false, but S will have the same truth value as P.\n\nGiven that R is true, and considering the implications of Q being true or false, we can conclude that S must be false because if S were true, P would also be true, which would contradict the fact that R is true and Q could be true (leading to a contradiction with ¬(P ∧ Q)).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that S is false.\n\n<<<¬S>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
