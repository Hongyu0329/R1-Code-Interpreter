    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be logically inferred from them.\n\nThe premises provided are:\n1. S\n2. R\n3. S\n\nIn propositional logic, each statement is considered a proposition. Here, we have two distinct propositions: S and R. The repetition of S in the premises does not add any new information, as it is already stated in premise 1.\n\nGiven these premises, we can conclude that both S and R are true. Therefore, the logical conclusion that can be drawn from these premises is the conjunction of S and R, which is represented as S ∧ R.\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<S ∧ R>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
