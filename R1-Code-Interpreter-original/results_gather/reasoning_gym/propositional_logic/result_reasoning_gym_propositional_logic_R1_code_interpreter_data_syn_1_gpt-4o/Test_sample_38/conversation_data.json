    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. \\((P → Q) → (P ∧ P)\\): This premise states that if \\(P\\) implies \\(Q\\), then \\(P\\) is true. However, \\(P ∧ P\\) is logically equivalent to \\(P\\), so this premise essentially states that if \\(P → Q\\), then \\(P\\).\n\n2. \\((P → Q) → (Q ∧ Q)\\): This premise states that if \\(P\\) implies \\(Q\\), then \\(Q\\) is true. Similarly, \\(Q ∧ Q\\) is logically equivalent to \\(Q\\), so this premise essentially states that if \\(P → Q\\), then \\(Q\\).\n\n3. \\(P → P\\): This is a tautology, meaning it is always true. It states that \\(P\\) implies \\(P\\), which is trivially true.\n\nNow, let's analyze these premises:\n\n- From premise 1, we have that if \\(P → Q\\), then \\(P\\) must be true.\n- From premise 2, we have that if \\(P → Q\\), then \\(Q\\) must be true.\n- Premise 3 is always true and doesn't provide additional information.\n\nGiven that both premises 1 and 2 are conditional statements with the same antecedent \\(P → Q\\), we can infer that if \\(P → Q\\) is true, then both \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) must be true. This means that \\(P ∧ Q\\) must be true if \\(P → Q\\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from these premises is:\n\n\\[\n(P → Q) → (P ∧ Q)\n\\]\n\nThis conclusion states that if \\(P\\) implies \\(Q\\), then both \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are true.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(P → Q) → (P ∧ Q)>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
