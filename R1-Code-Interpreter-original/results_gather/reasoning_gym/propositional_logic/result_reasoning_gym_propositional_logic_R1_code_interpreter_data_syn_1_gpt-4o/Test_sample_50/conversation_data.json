    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. ¬(P ∨ Q): This means that neither P nor Q is true. In other words, both P and Q must be false.\n\n2. P: This states that P is true.\n\n3. (P → P): This is a tautology, meaning it is always true regardless of the truth value of P. It doesn't provide any new information.\n\nNow, let's analyze the premises:\n\n- From premise 1, ¬(P ∨ Q), we conclude that both P and Q are false.\n- However, premise 2 states that P is true, which contradicts the conclusion from premise 1.\n\nThis contradiction indicates that the premises are inconsistent. In propositional logic, if a set of premises is inconsistent, any conclusion can be logically inferred from them. This is known as the principle of explosion or \"ex falso quodlibet,\" which states that from a contradiction, anything follows.\n\nTherefore, given the inconsistency in the premises, we can conclude any statement. For the sake of this exercise, let's conclude a simple statement, such as R.\n\n<<<R>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
