    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. \\((P \\leftrightarrow Q) \\rightarrow \\neg R\\)\n2. \\(Q\\)\n\n**Objective:**\nDetermine a conclusion based on these premises.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Premise 2: \\(Q\\)** - This tells us that \\(Q\\) is true.\n\n2. **Premise 1: \\((P \\leftrightarrow Q) \\rightarrow \\neg R\\)** - This is a conditional statement. For this to be false, the antecedent \\((P \\leftrightarrow Q)\\) must be true and the consequent \\(\\neg R\\) must be false. However, since we are given this as a premise, we assume it is true.\n\n3. **Analyzing \\((P \\leftrightarrow Q)\\):** \n   - The biconditional \\(P \\leftrightarrow Q\\) means \\(P\\) is true if and only if \\(Q\\) is true. Since \\(Q\\) is true (from premise 2), \\(P\\) must also be true for the biconditional to hold.\n\n4. **Conclusion from \\((P \\leftrightarrow Q) \\rightarrow \\neg R\\):**\n   - If \\((P \\leftrightarrow Q)\\) is true, then \\(\\neg R\\) must be true for the implication to hold. Since we have established that \\(P \\leftrightarrow Q\\) is true, \\(\\neg R\\) must be true.\n\n5. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - From the above reasoning, we can conclude that \\(\\neg R\\) is true.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is:\n\n<<<¬R>>>"
