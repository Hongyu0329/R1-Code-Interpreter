    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and deduce a conclusion. Let's break down each premise:\n\n1. ¬(P ∨ Q): This means that neither P nor Q is true. In other words, both P and Q are false.\n\n2. (Q ↔ P): This is a biconditional statement meaning Q is true if and only if P is true. Given that both P and Q are false from the first premise, this statement holds true because both sides are false.\n\n3. ((P ↔ Q) ↔ (P → P)): This is a more complex statement. The inner part (P ↔ Q) is true as established in the second premise. The part (P → P) is always true because any statement implies itself. Therefore, this entire statement is true because it is a biconditional between two true statements.\n\n4. P: This states that P is true, which contradicts the first premise ¬(P ∨ Q) that states P is false.\n\nGiven the contradiction between premises 1 and 4, we can conclude that the premises are inconsistent. In classical logic, from a contradiction, any statement can be inferred (principle of explosion).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion can be any statement, but typically, we conclude with a simple contradiction or a tautology.\n\nLet's conclude with a tautology, which is always true:\n\n<<<P ∨ ¬P>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
