    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn.\n\n### Premises:\n1. \\((Q \\to Q) \\leftrightarrow (S \\to Q)\\)\n2. \\(Q\\)\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Premise 1: \\((Q \\to Q) \\leftrightarrow (S \\to Q)\\)**\n   - The expression \\(Q \\to Q\\) is a tautology because any statement implies itself. Therefore, \\(Q \\to Q\\) is always true.\n   - The biconditional \\((Q \\to Q) \\leftrightarrow (S \\to Q)\\) means that \\(S \\to Q\\) must also be true for the biconditional to hold, since \\(Q \\to Q\\) is true.\n\n2. **Premise 2: \\(Q\\)**\n   - This premise states that \\(Q\\) is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the analysis of the premises, we can conclude that since \\(Q \\to Q\\) is always true, and the biconditional \\((Q \\to Q) \\leftrightarrow (S \\to Q)\\) holds, \\(S \\to Q\\) must also be true. Given that \\(Q\\) is true, \\(S\\) can be any value (true or false) because the implication \\(S \\to Q\\) will always be true if \\(Q\\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw is that \\(S \\to Q\\) is true.\n\n<<<S → Q>>>"
