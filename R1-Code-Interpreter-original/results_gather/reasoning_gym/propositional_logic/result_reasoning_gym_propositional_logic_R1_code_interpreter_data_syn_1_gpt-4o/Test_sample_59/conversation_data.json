    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine if there is a logical conclusion that can be drawn from them.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. \\( P \\)\n2. \\( Q \\rightarrow Q \\) (This is a tautology, as any statement implies itself)\n3. \\( \\neg P \\)\n4. \\( Q \\)\n\nFrom the premises, we have:\n\n- Premise 1 states \\( P \\) is true.\n- Premise 3 states \\( \\neg P \\) is true, which directly contradicts Premise 1. This means we have a contradiction.\n\nIn propositional logic, if we have a contradiction (both a statement and its negation are true), we can infer any statement as a conclusion. This is known as the principle of explosion or \"ex falso quodlibet,\" which states that from a contradiction, anything follows.\n\nTherefore, given the contradiction between Premise 1 and Premise 3, we can conclude any proposition. For simplicity, we can conclude \\( Q \\), which is already given as true in Premise 4.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw from the premises is:\n\n<<<Q>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
