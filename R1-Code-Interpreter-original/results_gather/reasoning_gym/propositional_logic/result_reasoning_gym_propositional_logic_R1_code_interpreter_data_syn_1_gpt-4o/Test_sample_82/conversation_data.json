    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them. Let's break down the premises:\n\n1. Q\n2. ((P ↔ P) ∨ (Q ↔ P))\n3. ¬¬P\n4. Q\n\nLet's analyze each premise:\n\n- Premise 1 and 4 are the same, stating Q is true.\n- Premise 2 is a disjunction: ((P ↔ P) ∨ (Q ↔ P)). The first part (P ↔ P) is a tautology, meaning it is always true. Therefore, the entire disjunction is true regardless of the truth value of (Q ↔ P).\n- Premise 3 is ¬¬P, which simplifies to P by the law of double negation.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude:\n\n- Since ¬¬P simplifies to P, we know P is true.\n- Since Q is given as true in premises 1 and 4, we know Q is true.\n\nNow, let's consider what conclusion can be drawn:\n\n- We have both P and Q as true.\n- The disjunction in premise 2 is true because (P ↔ P) is a tautology.\n\nGiven that both P and Q are true, we can conclude P ∧ Q.\n\nLet's write the conclusion:\n\n<<<P ∧ Q>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
