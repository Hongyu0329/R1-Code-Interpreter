    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. (Q ∨ Q): This is a tautology because any statement ORed with itself is always true. Therefore, this premise doesn't provide any new information beyond the fact that Q is true.\n\n2. (P ↔ P): This is also a tautology because any statement is always equivalent to itself. This premise doesn't provide any new information about P or any other variable.\n\n3. Q: This premise states that Q is true.\n\nGiven these premises, the only new information we have is from premise 3, which directly states that Q is true. The other premises are tautologies and do not contribute additional information.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from these premises is simply that Q is true.\n\n<<<Q>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
