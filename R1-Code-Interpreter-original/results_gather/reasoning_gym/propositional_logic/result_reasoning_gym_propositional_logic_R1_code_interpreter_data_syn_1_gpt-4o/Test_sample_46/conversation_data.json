    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be logically inferred from them.\n\nThe premises provided are:\n1. ¬Q (Not Q)\n2. P\n\nIn propositional logic, a conclusion is typically derived by applying logical rules such as Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Disjunctive Syllogism, etc. However, in this case, we are given two independent premises: one is a negation of Q, and the other is a statement P.\n\nSince there is no direct logical connection (like an implication or a conjunction) between P and Q in the premises, we cannot derive a new statement that combines P and Q. Each premise stands alone, and without additional information or a connecting premise, we cannot infer a new conclusion that involves both P and Q.\n\nTherefore, the only conclusions we can draw are the premises themselves, as they are already in their simplest form.\n\nThus, the conclusions we can state are:\n- ¬Q\n- P\n\nSince the task is to infer a correct conclusion from the premises, and we cannot combine them into a new statement, the conclusion is simply the restatement of the premises.\n\n<<<¬Q ∧ P>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
