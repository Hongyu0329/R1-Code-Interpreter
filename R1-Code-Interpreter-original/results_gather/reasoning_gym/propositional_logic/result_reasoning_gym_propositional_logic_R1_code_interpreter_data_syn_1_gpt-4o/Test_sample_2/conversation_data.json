    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be logically inferred from them.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. ((P ∨ S) ∧ ¬P): This means that either P or S is true, but P is not true. Therefore, S must be true because P is false.\n\n2. ¬R: This means R is false.\n\n3. Q: This means Q is true.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce the following:\n\n- From premise 1, since P is false and (P ∨ S) is true, S must be true.\n- Premise 2 directly tells us that R is false.\n- Premise 3 directly tells us that Q is true.\n\nNow, let's summarize what we have:\n\n- S is true.\n- R is false.\n- Q is true.\n\nThe conclusion that can be drawn from these premises is that S is true, Q is true, and R is false. However, the problem asks for a single conclusion. Since we have S and Q as true statements, we can conclude S ∧ Q.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion from the given premises is:\n\n<<<S ∧ Q>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
