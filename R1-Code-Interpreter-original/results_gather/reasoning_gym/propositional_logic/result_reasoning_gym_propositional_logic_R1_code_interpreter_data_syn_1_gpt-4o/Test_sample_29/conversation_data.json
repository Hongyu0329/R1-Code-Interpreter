    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn.\n\nThe premises are:\n1. \\( \\neg Q \\lor \\neg R \\)\n2. \\( Q \\)\n\nLet's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise \\( \\neg Q \\lor \\neg R \\) is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of \\( \\neg Q \\) or \\( \\neg R \\) must be true.\n2. The second premise \\( Q \\) tells us that \\( Q \\) is true.\n\nGiven that \\( Q \\) is true, \\( \\neg Q \\) must be false. Therefore, for the disjunction \\( \\neg Q \\lor \\neg R \\) to hold true, \\( \\neg R \\) must be true. This is because in a disjunction, if one part is false, the other must be true for the whole statement to be true.\n\nIf \\( \\neg R \\) is true, then \\( R \\) must be false.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw from the premises is that \\( R \\) is false.\n\nThe conclusion in logical notation is:\n\n<<<¬R>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
