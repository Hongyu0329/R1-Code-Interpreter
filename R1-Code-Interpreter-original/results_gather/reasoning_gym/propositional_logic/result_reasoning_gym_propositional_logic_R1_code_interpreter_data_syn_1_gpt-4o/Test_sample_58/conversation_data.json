    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them. Let's break down the premises:\n\n1. \\( Q \\)\n2. \\( (Q \\leftrightarrow Q) \\leftrightarrow (Q \\rightarrow Q) \\)\n3. \\( \\neg Q \\)\n4. \\( P \\)\n\nLet's analyze these premises:\n\n- Premise 1 states that \\( Q \\) is true.\n- Premise 2 is a tautology because \\( Q \\leftrightarrow Q \\) is always true, and \\( Q \\rightarrow Q \\) is also always true. Therefore, this premise doesn't provide new information.\n- Premise 3 states that \\( Q \\) is false, which directly contradicts Premise 1.\n- Premise 4 states that \\( P \\) is true.\n\nThe contradiction between Premises 1 and 3 (i.e., \\( Q \\) is both true and false) indicates that the premises are inconsistent. In classical logic, if a set of premises is inconsistent, any conclusion can be derived from them (principle of explosion).\n\nTherefore, given the inconsistency, we can conclude any statement. For simplicity, we can conclude \\( P \\), which is already given as true in Premise 4.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw is:\n\n<<<P>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
