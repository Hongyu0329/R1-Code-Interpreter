    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to determine what conclusion can be drawn from the given premises. The premises provided are:\n\n1. S\n2. R\n3. Q\n\nThese premises are simple propositions, and there are no logical connectives (like AND, OR, IMPLIES) provided between them. In propositional logic, if we have a set of premises that are all true, we can conclude that the conjunction (AND) of all these premises is also true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that can be drawn from these premises is the conjunction of all the given propositions.\n\nLet's express this conclusion using the notation provided:\n\n- S ∧ R ∧ Q\n\nThis means that if S, R, and Q are all true, then the statement \"S AND R AND Q\" is also true.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is:\n\n<<<S ∧ R ∧ Q>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
