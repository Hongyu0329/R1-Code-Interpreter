    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\nThe premises provided are:\n1. \\( Q \\)\n2. \\( \\neg R \\)\n\nIn propositional logic, a conclusion is typically drawn by combining the premises using logical operators. However, with the given premises, there is no direct logical operator that connects \\( Q \\) and \\( \\neg R \\) to form a new conclusion. \n\nThe premises are independent statements:\n- \\( Q \\) is a statement that is true.\n- \\( \\neg R \\) is a statement that is true, meaning \\( R \\) is false.\n\nSince there is no additional information or logical connection provided between \\( Q \\) and \\( \\neg R \\), we cannot infer a new conclusion that combines these two statements. Each statement stands on its own.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is simply the restatement of the premises, as no new information can be derived from them.\n\nThe conclusion logic statement is:\n<<<Q ∧ ¬R>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
