    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and deduce a conclusion.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. \\((Q ∧ S) ↔ (R → R)\\): The right side, \\(R → R\\), is a tautology because any statement implies itself. Therefore, this premise simplifies to \\(Q ∧ S\\) being true.\n\n2. \\(R ↔ Q\\): This means \\(R\\) is true if and only if \\(Q\\) is true. This establishes a direct equivalence between \\(R\\) and \\(Q\\).\n\n3. \\((S ∧ P) ∧ ¬P\\): This premise states that both \\(S ∧ P\\) is true and \\(¬P\\) is true. However, \\(P\\) and \\(¬P\\) cannot both be true simultaneously, which makes this premise a contradiction. Therefore, the entire premise is false.\n\nGiven the contradiction in premise 3, we can infer that the set of premises is inconsistent. In classical logic, from a contradiction, any conclusion can be derived (principle of explosion).\n\nHowever, to find a specific conclusion, let's analyze the implications of the other premises:\n\n- From premise 1, since \\(R → R\\) is always true, \\(Q ∧ S\\) must be true.\n- From premise 2, since \\(R ↔ Q\\), if \\(Q\\) is true, then \\(R\\) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the contradiction in premise 3. Since \\(P\\) and \\(¬P\\) cannot both be true, this contradiction implies that the assumption of \\(S ∧ P\\) being true is false. Therefore, \\(S\\) must be false to resolve the contradiction.\n\nGiven that \\(S\\) is false, and from premise 1, \\(Q ∧ S\\) must be true, it follows that \\(Q\\) must be false (since \\(S\\) is false).\n\nIf \\(Q\\) is false, then from premise 2, \\(R\\) must also be false.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw from the premises is that both \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are false.\n\nLet's summarize the conclusion:\n\n- \\(Q\\) is false.\n- \\(R\\) is false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<¬Q ∧ ¬R>>>"
