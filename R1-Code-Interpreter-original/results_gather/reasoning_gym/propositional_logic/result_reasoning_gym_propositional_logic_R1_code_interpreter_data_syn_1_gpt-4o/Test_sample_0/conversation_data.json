    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\nThe premises are:\n1. \\( Q \\)\n2. \\((P \\rightarrow P) \\lor (Q \\land Q)\\)\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. The first premise \\( Q \\) is straightforward; it states that \\( Q \\) is true.\n\n2. The second premise \\((P \\rightarrow P) \\lor (Q \\land Q)\\) can be analyzed as follows:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow P \\) is a tautology because any statement implies itself. Therefore, \\( P \\rightarrow P \\) is always true.\n   - \\( Q \\land Q \\) simplifies to \\( Q \\) because \\( Q \\land Q \\) is equivalent to \\( Q \\).\n\nSince \\( P \\rightarrow P \\) is always true, the expression \\((P \\rightarrow P) \\lor (Q \\land Q)\\) simplifies to true because a tautology or any other statement is always true.\n\nGiven that both premises are true, we need to determine what conclusion can be drawn. Since \\( Q \\) is explicitly stated as true in the first premise, and the second premise is a tautology, the conclusion that can be directly drawn from these premises is simply \\( Q \\).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<Q>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
