    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and deduce a conclusion.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. \\( (P \\land R) \\): This means both \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are true.\n2. \\( (\\neg P \\rightarrow (Q \\leftrightarrow R)) \\): This means if \\( P \\) is false, then \\( Q \\) is equivalent to \\( R \\).\n3. \\( \\neg R \\): This means \\( R \\) is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze these premises:\n\n- From premise 3, \\( \\neg R \\), we know that \\( R \\) is false.\n- Premise 1, \\( (P \\land R) \\), states that both \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are true. However, this contradicts premise 3, which states \\( R \\) is false. Therefore, \\( P \\land R \\) cannot be true, and thus \\( P \\) must be false because \\( R \\) is already false.\n- Given that \\( P \\) is false, we can use premise 2: \\( (\\neg P \\rightarrow (Q \\leftrightarrow R)) \\). Since \\( P \\) is false, \\( \\neg P \\) is true, and thus \\( Q \\leftrightarrow R \\) must be true.\n- Since \\( R \\) is false, \\( Q \\) must also be false for \\( Q \\leftrightarrow R \\) to hold true.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw from these premises is that \\( Q \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<¬Q>>>"
