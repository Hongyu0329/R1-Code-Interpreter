    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them. Let's break down each premise:\n\n1. **P**: This is a simple assertion that P is true.\n\n2. **¬(P → S)**: The implication \\(P \\rightarrow S\\) is equivalent to \\(\\neg P \\lor S\\). Therefore, \\(\\neg(P \\rightarrow S)\\) is equivalent to \\(\\neg(\\neg P \\lor S)\\), which simplifies to \\(P \\land \\neg S\\). This means P is true and S is false.\n\n3. **¬(S → S)**: The implication \\(S \\rightarrow S\\) is always true because any statement implies itself. Therefore, \\(\\neg(S \\rightarrow S)\\) is a contradiction, as it implies that S does not imply S, which is logically impossible. This premise is inherently false.\n\n4. **P**: This is a repetition of the first premise, confirming that P is true.\n\nGiven these premises, let's analyze:\n\n- From premise 2, we have \\(P \\land \\neg S\\), which means P is true and S is false.\n- Premise 3 is a contradiction, so it doesn't provide any additional information that can be used to derive a new conclusion.\n- Premise 4 is redundant as it repeats premise 1.\n\nThe only new information we can derive from these premises is that S is false, as indicated by premise 2. Therefore, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is:\n\n<<<¬S>>>"
