    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be logically inferred from them.\n\n1. **Premise 1: (P ↔ Q)**\n   - This means P if and only if Q. In other words, P is true if Q is true and vice versa.\n\n2. **Premise 2: (Q ↔ R)**\n   - This means Q if and only if R. In other words, Q is true if R is true and vice versa.\n\n3. **Premise 3: (P → P)**\n   - This is a tautology, meaning P implies P, which is always true regardless of the truth value of P.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications of these premises:\n\n- From Premise 1 and Premise 2, we can deduce a transitive relationship:\n  - Since P ↔ Q and Q ↔ R, we can infer that P ↔ R. This is because if P is equivalent to Q, and Q is equivalent to R, then P must be equivalent to R.\n\n- Premise 3 does not provide any new information as it is a tautology and does not affect the logical relationship between P, Q, and R.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that can be drawn from the given premises is that P is equivalent to R.\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<P ↔ R>>>"
