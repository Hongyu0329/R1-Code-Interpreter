    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be logically inferred.\n\nThe premises are:\n1. ¬P\n2. ¬P (This is a repetition of the first premise and doesn't add any new information.)\n3. Q\n\nFrom these premises, we can observe the following:\n- Premise 1 and 2 both state ¬P, which means P is false.\n- Premise 3 states Q, which means Q is true.\n\nGiven these premises, we need to determine if there is any logical conclusion that can be drawn. Since ¬P is repeated, it doesn't provide any additional information beyond the first instance. The presence of Q as a true statement is independent of ¬P, and there is no direct logical connection between ¬P and Q in the premises provided.\n\nTherefore, the only conclusion we can draw from these premises is that Q is true, as it is explicitly stated in the premises.\n\nThus, the conclusion is simply Q.\n\n<<<Q>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
