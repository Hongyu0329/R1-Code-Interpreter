    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. ¬(P ∧ Q)\n2. P\n3. (P ∧ R)\n4. R\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n- Premise 1: ¬(P ∧ Q) means that P and Q cannot both be true at the same time. If P is true, then Q must be false.\n- Premise 2: P is true.\n- Premise 3: (P ∧ R) means both P and R are true.\n- Premise 4: R is true.\n\nFrom Premise 2, we know P is true. From Premise 3, since P is true, R must also be true, which is consistent with Premise 4.\n\nNow, using Premise 1, since P is true, Q must be false because ¬(P ∧ Q) implies that both P and Q cannot be true simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from these premises is that Q is false.\n\nThus, the conclusion is ¬Q.\n\n<<<¬Q>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
