    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and deduce a conclusion.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow R \\): If \\( P \\) is true, then \\( R \\) is true.\n2. \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg P \\): This is a tautology, as it is always true regardless of the truth value of \\( P \\).\n3. \\( \\neg Q \\): \\( Q \\) is false.\n4. \\( \\neg (R \\leftrightarrow Q) \\): \\( R \\) and \\( Q \\) do not have the same truth value. This means either \\( R \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false, or \\( R \\) is false and \\( Q \\) is true.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg Q \\) (from premise 3), we know \\( Q \\) is false. From premise 4, \\( \\neg (R \\leftrightarrow Q) \\), since \\( Q \\) is false, \\( R \\) must be true to satisfy the condition that \\( R \\) and \\( Q \\) do not have the same truth value.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of \\( R \\) being true:\n\n- From premise 1, \\( P \\rightarrow R \\), if \\( R \\) is true, \\( P \\) could be true or false. However, if \\( P \\) were false, \\( R \\) could still be true because the implication \\( P \\rightarrow R \\) does not require \\( P \\) to be true for \\( R \\) to be true.\n\nThus, the key conclusion we can draw from these premises is that \\( R \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<R>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
