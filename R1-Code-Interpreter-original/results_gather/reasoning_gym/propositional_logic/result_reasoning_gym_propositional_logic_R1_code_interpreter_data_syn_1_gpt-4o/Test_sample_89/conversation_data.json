    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\n### Premises:\n1. \\((P ∨ Q) → ¬P\\)\n2. \\((Q ∧ P) → (Q ∧ Q)\\)\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Premise 1: \\((P ∨ Q) → ¬P\\)**\n   - This implies that if either \\(P\\) or \\(Q\\) is true, then \\(P\\) must be false. \n   - This can be rewritten using logical equivalence: \\(\\neg(P \\lor Q) \\lor \\neg P\\).\n\n2. **Premise 2: \\((Q ∧ P) → (Q ∧ Q)\\)**\n   - This is a tautology because \\((Q ∧ Q)\\) is equivalent to \\(Q\\). Therefore, this premise simplifies to \\((Q ∧ P) → Q\\).\n   - This is always true because if \\(Q\\) and \\(P\\) are both true, then \\(Q\\) is definitely true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- From Premise 1, if \\(P\\) is true, then \\(P ∨ Q\\) is true, which implies ¬P, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, \\(P\\) must be false.\n- From Premise 2, since it is a tautology, it doesn't provide additional information beyond confirming that if both \\(Q\\) and \\(P\\) are true, then \\(Q\\) is true.\n\nGiven that \\(P\\) must be false from Premise 1, we can conclude that:\n\n- If \\(P\\) is false, then \\(P ∨ Q\\) simplifies to \\(Q\\).\n- Therefore, the only consistent scenario is when \\(P\\) is false, and \\(Q\\) can be either true or false.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw is that \\(P\\) is false.\n\nThe conclusion logic statement is:\n<<<¬P>>>"
