    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and deduce a conclusion.\n\nGiven:\n1. \\( Q \\leftrightarrow R \\) (Q if and only if R)\n2. \\( \\neg R \\) (Not R)\n\nLet's break down the first premise:\n- \\( Q \\leftrightarrow R \\) means that Q is true if and only if R is true. This can be expressed as:\n  - \\( (Q \\rightarrow R) \\land (R \\rightarrow Q) \\)\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise:\n- \\( \\neg R \\) means R is false.\n\nUsing the second premise \\( \\neg R \\), we can substitute into the expression for \\( Q \\leftrightarrow R \\):\n- Since \\( R \\) is false, the implication \\( R \\rightarrow Q \\) becomes true regardless of the truth value of Q (because a false antecedent makes the implication true).\n- However, for \\( Q \\rightarrow R \\) to be true, since \\( R \\) is false, \\( Q \\) must also be false (because a true antecedent with a false consequent makes the implication false).\n\nThus, from the premises, we can conclude that \\( Q \\) must be false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n<<<¬Q>>>"
