    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. ¬(Q ∧ Q): This statement is a negation of a conjunction. However, since Q ∧ Q is logically equivalent to Q, this statement simplifies to ¬Q. This is a contradiction if Q is true.\n\n2. Q: This statement asserts that Q is true.\n\n3. P: This statement asserts that P is true.\n\n4. (Q ∨ Q): This statement is a disjunction. Since Q ∨ Q is logically equivalent to Q, this statement simplifies to Q.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n- Premise 1 (¬(Q ∧ Q) or ¬Q) contradicts Premise 2 (Q). This means there is an inconsistency in the premises, as they cannot all be true simultaneously.\n\n- Premise 3 (P) is independent of the contradiction between Premises 1 and 2.\n\n- Premise 4 (Q ∨ Q or Q) is consistent with Premise 2 (Q).\n\nGiven the contradiction between Premises 1 and 2, we can conclude that the premises are inconsistent. In classical logic, from a contradiction, any statement can be inferred (principle of explosion). Therefore, we can conclude any proposition, including P.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw from the premises is P.\n\n<<<P>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following question is a propositional logic reasoning question.\n\nIn the question we provide a list of premises.
