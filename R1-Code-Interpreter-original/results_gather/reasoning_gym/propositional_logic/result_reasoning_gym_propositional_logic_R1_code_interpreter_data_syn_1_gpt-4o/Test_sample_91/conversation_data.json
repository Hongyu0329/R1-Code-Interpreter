    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. **Q**: This is a simple statement asserting that Q is true.\n\n2. **(P ∧ Q)**: This statement asserts that both P and Q are true. Since we already know Q is true from premise 1, this implies that P must also be true.\n\n3. **(¬Q ↔ (P ∧ P))**: This is a biconditional statement, which means that ¬Q is true if and only if (P ∧ P) is true. However, (P ∧ P) is logically equivalent to P, so this can be rewritten as (¬Q ↔ P).\n\nNow, let's analyze these premises:\n\n- From premise 1, we know Q is true.\n- From premise 2, since Q is true, P must also be true.\n- Premise 3 states (¬Q ↔ P). Since Q is true, ¬Q is false. For the biconditional to hold, P must also be false. However, this contradicts our finding from premise 2 that P is true.\n\nThe contradiction in premise 3 suggests that the biconditional (¬Q ↔ P) cannot hold if Q is true. Therefore, the only consistent conclusion we can draw from these premises is that the biconditional in premise 3 is false.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that the biconditional statement (¬Q ↔ P) is false.\n\nLet's express this conclusion in the required format:\n\n<<<¬(¬Q ↔ P)>>>"
