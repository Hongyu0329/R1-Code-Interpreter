    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be logically inferred from them.\n\n### Premises:\n1. \\( S \\leftrightarrow R \\) (S if and only if R)\n2. \\( (P \\land Q) \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) (If P and Q are true, then Q is false)\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Premise 1: \\( S \\leftrightarrow R \\)**\n   - This means that S is true if and only if R is true. In other words, S and R have the same truth value.\n\n2. **Premise 2: \\( (P \\land Q) \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)**\n   - This is a conditional statement that says if both P and Q are true, then Q must be false. This is a contradiction because Q cannot be both true and false at the same time. Therefore, the only way this statement can be true is if \\( P \\land Q \\) is false. This implies that either P is false, Q is false, or both are false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the second premise, we can conclude that \\( P \\land Q \\) must be false. This is the only logical conclusion that can be directly inferred from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n<<<¬(P ∧ Q)>>>"
