    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\n### Premises:\n1. \\( \\neg S \\lor (Q \\leftrightarrow R) \\)\n2. \\( (S \\rightarrow R) \\leftrightarrow (R \\land S) \\)\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Premise 1: \\( \\neg S \\lor (Q \\leftrightarrow R) \\)**\n   - This premise states that either \\( S \\) is false, or \\( Q \\) is equivalent to \\( R \\).\n\n2. **Premise 2: \\( (S \\rightarrow R) \\leftrightarrow (R \\land S) \\)**\n   - The implication \\( S \\rightarrow R \\) is equivalent to the conjunction \\( R \\land S \\).\n   - The implication \\( S \\rightarrow R \\) can be rewritten as \\( \\neg S \\lor R \\).\n   - Therefore, the equivalence can be expanded to: \\( (\\neg S \\lor R) \\leftrightarrow (R \\land S) \\).\n\n### Simplification:\n\nLet's simplify the second premise to see if we can derive any further information:\n\n- \\( (\\neg S \\lor R) \\leftrightarrow (R \\land S) \\) implies that both sides must have the same truth value.\n- If \\( R \\land S \\) is true, then both \\( R \\) and \\( S \\) must be true.\n- If \\( \\neg S \\lor R \\) is true, then either \\( S \\) is false or \\( R \\) is true.\n\nGiven that \\( R \\land S \\) is true, \\( R \\) and \\( S \\) are both true. Therefore, \\( \\neg S \\lor R \\) must also be true, which is consistent because \\( R \\) is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFrom the second premise, we can conclude that if \\( S \\) is true, then \\( R \\) must also be true. This is consistent with the first premise, which allows for \\( S \\) to be false or \\( Q \\leftrightarrow R \\) to be true.\n\nSince \\( R \\land S \\) is true, and \\( S \\rightarrow R \\) is equivalent to \\( R \\land S \\), we can conclude that \\( S \\) and \\( R \\) are both true.\n\nThus, the conclusion that can be drawn from the premises is:\n\n<<<R ∧ S>>>"
