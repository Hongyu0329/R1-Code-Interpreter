    "To analyze the given premises and infer a conclusion, let's break down each premise and see what they imply:\n\n1. **Premise 1: ((P ∧ Q) → (P ∧ Q))**\n\n   - This is a tautology. It states that if (P ∧ Q) is true, then (P ∧ Q) is true. This is always true and doesn't provide any new information about P or Q individually.\n\n2. **Premise 2: (Q → P)**\n\n   - This premise states that if Q is true, then P must also be true. This is a conditional statement that provides a direct relationship between Q and P.\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these premises:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that Q implies P. This means that whenever Q is true, P must also be true.\n\n- Premise 1 is a tautology and doesn't add any new information or constraints.\n\nGiven these observations, the only actionable information we have is from Premise 2, which is the direct implication from Q to P.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is simply the implication provided in Premise 2.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n<<<Q → P>>>"
