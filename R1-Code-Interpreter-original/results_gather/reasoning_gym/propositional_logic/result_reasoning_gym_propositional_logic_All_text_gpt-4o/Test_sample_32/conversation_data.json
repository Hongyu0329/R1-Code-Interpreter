    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\n**Premise 1:** ((R → R) ↔ (P ∧ Q))\n\n- The expression (R → R) is a tautology because any statement implies itself. Therefore, (R → R) is always true.\n- Since (R → R) is always true, the expression ((R → R) ↔ (P ∧ Q)) simplifies to (True ↔ (P ∧ Q)).\n- A biconditional statement (True ↔ (P ∧ Q)) means that (P ∧ Q) must also be true for the entire expression to be true. Therefore, we can conclude that (P ∧ Q) is true.\n\n**Premise 2:** ((P ∨ Q) ∨ (P → R))\n\n- We know from Premise 1 that (P ∧ Q) is true, which means both P and Q are true.\n- If P is true, then (P ∨ Q) is true because at least one of the disjuncts (P or Q) is true.\n- The expression (P → R) is true if either P is false or R is true. However, since P is true, for (P → R) to be true, R must also be true.\n- Therefore, the expression ((P ∨ Q) ∨ (P → R)) is true because (P ∨ Q) is already true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- From Premise 1, we concluded that (P ∧ Q) is true, meaning both P and Q are true.\n- From Premise 2, we concluded that R must be true for (P → R) to be true, given that P is true.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw from the premises is that P, Q, and R are all true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logic statement is:\n\n<<<P ∧ Q ∧ R>>>"
