    "To analyze the given premises and infer a conclusion, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Premises:**\n   - We have three premises given:\n     1. S\n     2. R\n     3. S\n\n2. **Understand the Premises:**\n   - The premises are simple propositional statements. \n   - Premise 1 and Premise 3 are the same, both stating \"S\".\n   - Premise 2 states \"R\".\n\n3. **Analyze the Redundancy:**\n   - Since Premise 1 and Premise 3 are identical, we can consider them as a single premise \"S\" for the purpose of logical inference.\n\n4. **Logical Inference:**\n   - From the premises \"S\" and \"R\", we can infer a conjunction of these two statements.\n   - The conjunction of \"S\" and \"R\" is represented as \"S ∧ R\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The logical conclusion that can be drawn from the given premises is the conjunction of the two distinct premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion from the given premises is:\n\n<<<S ∧ R>>>"
