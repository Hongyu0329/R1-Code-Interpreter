    "To solve this propositional logic reasoning question, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. ((Q → P) ∨ (P ∨ P))\n2. P\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Simplify Premise 1:**\n   - The expression (P ∨ P) is equivalent to P because the disjunction of a proposition with itself is the proposition itself.\n   - Therefore, Premise 1 simplifies to ((Q → P) ∨ P).\n\n2. **Evaluate Premise 2:**\n   - Premise 2 states that P is true.\n\n3. **Analyze the Disjunction in Premise 1:**\n   - The simplified Premise 1 is ((Q → P) ∨ P).\n   - A disjunction (A ∨ B) is true if at least one of A or B is true.\n   - Since Premise 2 tells us that P is true, the disjunction ((Q → P) ∨ P) is true regardless of the truth value of (Q → P).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since P is true, and the disjunction in Premise 1 is true due to P being true, we can conclude that P is a valid conclusion from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the premises is:\n\n<<<P>>>"
