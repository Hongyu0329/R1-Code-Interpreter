    "To analyze the given premises and infer a conclusion, let's examine each premise step by step:\n\n1. **Premise 1: (Q ∨ P)**\n   - This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of Q or P must be true. If Q is true, the statement is true regardless of P. If P is true, the statement is true regardless of Q.\n\n2. **Premise 2: (Q ∨ Q)**\n   - This simplifies to Q, because a disjunction of the same statement with itself is equivalent to the statement itself. Therefore, this premise asserts that Q is true.\n\n3. **Premise 3: (P → P)**\n   - This is a tautology, meaning it is always true. In propositional logic, any statement of the form (A → A) is always true, regardless of the truth value of A. Therefore, this premise does not provide new information about P.\n\nNow, let's analyze what we can conclude from these premises:\n\n- From Premise 2, we have established that Q is true.\n- Given that Q is true, Premise 1 (Q ∨ P) is also true, regardless of the truth value of P.\n- Premise 3 is always true, so it does not affect the truth of any other statements.\n\nSince Q is true, and Premise 1 is satisfied with Q being true, the overall conclusion we can draw from these premises is that Q is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can infer from the given premises is:\n\n<<<Q>>>"
