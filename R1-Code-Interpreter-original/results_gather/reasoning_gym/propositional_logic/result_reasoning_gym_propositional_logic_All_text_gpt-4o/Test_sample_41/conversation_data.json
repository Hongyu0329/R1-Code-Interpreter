    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises step by step and determine what conclusion can be drawn.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. ((P ↔ Q) → ¬R)\n2. Q\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Understand the Premises:**\n   - Premise 1: ((P ↔ Q) → ¬R) means if P is equivalent to Q, then R is false.\n   - Premise 2: Q is true.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Implications of Premise 2:**\n   - Since Q is true, we need to consider the possible truth values of P to evaluate P ↔ Q.\n   - P ↔ Q is true if both P and Q are true or both are false.\n\n3. **Consider the Case for P:**\n   - If Q is true, for P ↔ Q to be true, P must also be true.\n   - Therefore, P is true.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Implication of Premise 1:**\n   - Since P ↔ Q is true (both P and Q are true), the implication ((P ↔ Q) → ¬R) must be evaluated.\n   - If (P ↔ Q) is true, then ¬R must be true for the implication to hold.\n\n5. **Determine the Conclusion:**\n   - Since ¬R is true, R must be false.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is that R is false.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe conclusion logic statement is: <<<¬R>>>."
