    "To solve this propositional logic reasoning question, we need to analyze the given premises step by step and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. ((P ∨ S) ∧ ¬P)\n2. ¬R\n3. Q\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Premise 1: ((P ∨ S) ∧ ¬P)**\n   - This premise is a conjunction of two parts: (P ∨ S) and ¬P.\n   - The conjunction (P ∨ S) ∧ ¬P implies that P cannot be true because ¬P is true.\n   - Therefore, for (P ∨ S) to be true, S must be true since P is false.\n\n2. **Premise 2: ¬R**\n   - This premise states that R is false.\n\n3. **Premise 3: Q**\n   - This premise states that Q is true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFrom the analysis of the premises, we have determined:\n- S is true (from Premise 1).\n- R is false (from Premise 2).\n- Q is true (from Premise 3).\n\nThe premises do not provide any direct logical connection between S, R, and Q that would allow us to infer a more complex conclusion involving all three. However, we can conclude the truth values of individual propositions based on the premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is that S is true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<S>>>"
