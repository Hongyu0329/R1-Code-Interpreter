    "To solve this propositional logic reasoning question, we need to analyze each given premise and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\n**Premise 1:** \\((P ∧ Q) ↔ (Q → Q)\\)\n\n- The expression \\(Q → Q\\) is a tautology because any statement implies itself. Therefore, \\(Q → Q\\) is always true.\n- Since \\(Q → Q\\) is always true, the equivalence \\((P ∧ Q) ↔ (Q → Q)\\) simplifies to \\((P ∧ Q) ↔ \\text{True}\\).\n- This means that \\(P ∧ Q\\) must also be true for the equivalence to hold. Therefore, \\(P ∧ Q\\) is true.\n\n**Premise 2:** \\((P ∧ Q) → (Q → P)\\)\n\n- From Premise 1, we have established that \\(P ∧ Q\\) is true.\n- If \\(P ∧ Q\\) is true, then the implication \\((P ∧ Q) → (Q → P)\\) depends on the truth of \\(Q → P\\).\n- Since \\(P ∧ Q\\) is true, \\(Q\\) is true and \\(P\\) is true. Therefore, \\(Q → P\\) is true because \\(P\\) is true whenever \\(Q\\) is true.\n\n**Premise 3:** \\((Q → P) ↔ (P ↔ P)\\)\n\n- The expression \\(P ↔ P\\) is a tautology because any statement is equivalent to itself. Therefore, \\(P ↔ P\\) is always true.\n- Since \\(P ↔ P\\) is always true, the equivalence \\((Q → P) ↔ (P ↔ P)\\) simplifies to \\((Q → P) ↔ \\text{True}\\).\n- This means that \\(Q → P\\) must also be true for the equivalence to hold. We have already established that \\(Q → P\\) is true from Premise 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- From the analysis of all premises, we have established that \\(P ∧ Q\\) is true, and \\(Q → P\\) is true.\n- Since \\(P ∧ Q\\) is true, both \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are individually true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is that both \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are true.\n\nThe final conclusion is:\n\n<<<P ∧ Q>>>"
