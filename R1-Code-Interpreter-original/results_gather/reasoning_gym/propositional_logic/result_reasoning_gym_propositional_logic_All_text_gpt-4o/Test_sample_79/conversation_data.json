    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises step by step and determine what conclusion can be drawn.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. \\( (Q \\lor Q) \\)\n2. \\( ((Q \\lor P) \\lor (Q \\lor Q)) \\)\n3. \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Simplify Premise 1:**\n   - The expression \\( (Q \\lor Q) \\) simplifies to \\( Q \\) because a disjunction with the same element is equivalent to the element itself.\n\n2. **Simplify Premise 2:**\n   - The expression \\( ((Q \\lor P) \\lor (Q \\lor Q)) \\) can be simplified by first simplifying \\( (Q \\lor Q) \\) to \\( Q \\), as done in Premise 1.\n   - This gives us \\( ((Q \\lor P) \\lor Q) \\).\n   - Further simplification using the associative property of disjunction gives us \\( (Q \\lor P \\lor Q) \\).\n   - Since \\( Q \\lor Q \\) is equivalent to \\( Q \\), the expression simplifies to \\( (Q \\lor P) \\).\n\n3. **Consider Premise 3:**\n   - Premise 3 is \\( \\neg Q \\), which states that \\( Q \\) is false.\n\n4. **Analyze the Simplified Premises with Premise 3:**\n   - From Premise 1, we have \\( Q \\).\n   - From Premise 2, we have \\( (Q \\lor P) \\).\n   - Premise 3 states \\( \\neg Q \\), meaning \\( Q \\) is false.\n   - If \\( Q \\) is false, then \\( (Q \\lor P) \\) simplifies to \\( P \\) because the disjunction \\( (Q \\lor P) \\) is true if at least one of the components is true, and since \\( Q \\) is false, \\( P \\) must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given that \\( Q \\) is false, and the simplified form of Premise 2 is \\( (Q \\lor P) \\), we can conclude that \\( P \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the premises is:\n\n<<<P>>>"
