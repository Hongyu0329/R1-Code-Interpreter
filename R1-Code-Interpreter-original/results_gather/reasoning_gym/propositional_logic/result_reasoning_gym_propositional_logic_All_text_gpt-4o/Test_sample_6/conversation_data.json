    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises step by step and determine what conclusion can be drawn.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. \\( (P \\land R) \\)\n2. \\( (\\neg P \\rightarrow (Q \\leftrightarrow R)) \\)\n3. \\( \\neg R \\)\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Premise 3: \\( \\neg R \\)**\n   - This tells us that \\( R \\) is false.\n\n2. **Premise 1: \\( (P \\land R) \\)**\n   - Since \\( R \\) is false (from Premise 3), the conjunction \\( (P \\land R) \\) can only be true if both \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are true. However, since \\( R \\) is false, \\( (P \\land R) \\) is false. Therefore, \\( P \\) must also be false to satisfy this premise.\n\n3. **Premise 2: \\( (\\neg P \\rightarrow (Q \\leftrightarrow R)) \\)**\n   - We have determined that \\( P \\) is false, so \\( \\neg P \\) is true.\n   - Since \\( \\neg P \\) is true, the implication \\( (\\neg P \\rightarrow (Q \\leftrightarrow R)) \\) requires that \\( (Q \\leftrightarrow R) \\) must also be true.\n   - We know \\( R \\) is false, so for \\( (Q \\leftrightarrow R) \\) to be true, \\( Q \\) must also be false (since both sides of the biconditional must have the same truth value).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- From the analysis, we have determined that \\( P \\) is false and \\( Q \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the premises is:\n\n\\[\n\\neg P \\land \\neg Q\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<¬P ∧ ¬Q>>>"
