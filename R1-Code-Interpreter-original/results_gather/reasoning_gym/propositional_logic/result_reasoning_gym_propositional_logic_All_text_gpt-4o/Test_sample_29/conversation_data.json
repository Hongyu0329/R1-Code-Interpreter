    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. (¬Q ∨ ¬R)\n2. Q\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Understanding Premise 1: (¬Q ∨ ¬R)**\n   - This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the statements ¬Q or ¬R must be true.\n   - If Q is true, then ¬Q is false, which implies that ¬R must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\n2. **Understanding Premise 2: Q**\n   - This premise states that Q is true.\n\n3. **Combining the Premises:**\n   - From Premise 2, we know Q is true.\n   - Substituting Q = true into Premise 1 (¬Q ∨ ¬R), we get (false ∨ ¬R).\n   - For the disjunction (false ∨ ¬R) to be true, ¬R must be true.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since ¬R must be true for the disjunction to hold, we can conclude that R is false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is that R is false.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<¬R>>>"
