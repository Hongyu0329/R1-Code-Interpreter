    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\n**Premise 1: ¬(P → Q)**\n- The implication \\(P → Q\\) is logically equivalent to \\(¬P ∨ Q\\).\n- Therefore, ¬(P → Q) is equivalent to ¬(¬P ∨ Q).\n- By De Morgan's laws, ¬(¬P ∨ Q) is equivalent to \\(P ∧ ¬Q\\).\n\n**Premise 2: (¬S ∨ (R ∨ S))**\n- The expression \\(R ∨ S\\) is a disjunction, and when combined with ¬S, it forms a larger disjunction.\n- The expression simplifies as follows:\n  - \\(¬S ∨ (R ∨ S)\\) can be rewritten as \\((¬S ∨ R) ∨ S\\).\n  - By the absorption law, \\((¬S ∨ R) ∨ S\\) simplifies to \\(R ∨ S\\).\n\nNow, let's consider what can be concluded from these simplified premises:\n\n1. From Premise 1, we have \\(P ∧ ¬Q\\).\n2. From Premise 2, we have \\(R ∨ S\\).\n\nTo find a conclusion, we need to see if there is a logical connection or implication that can be derived from these premises. However, the premises do not directly relate \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) in a way that allows us to derive a new statement involving all of them. \n\nThe premises are independent in terms of their variables, so the conclusion must be based on the simplifications we have made:\n\n- From \\(P ∧ ¬Q\\), we know that \\(P\\) is true and \\(Q\\) is false.\n- From \\(R ∨ S\\), we know that at least one of \\(R\\) or \\(S\\) is true.\n\nSince there is no direct logical connection between these two simplified premises, the conclusion must be a statement that reflects the independent truths of these premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is the conjunction of the simplified premises:\n\n<<<(P ∧ ¬Q) ∧ (R ∨ S)>>>"
