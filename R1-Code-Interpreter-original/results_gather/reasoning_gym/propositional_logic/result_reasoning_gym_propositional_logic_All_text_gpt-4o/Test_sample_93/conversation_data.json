    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. ¬(P ↔ Q)\n2. Q\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Biconditional (↔):**\n   - The biconditional statement \\( P ↔ Q \\) means that \\( P \\) is true if and only if \\( Q \\) is true. This can be expressed as \\( (P → Q) ∧ (Q → P) \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( ¬(P ↔ Q) \\) means that it is not the case that \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) have the same truth value. In other words, \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) must have different truth values.\n\n2. **Analyzing Premise 1: ¬(P ↔ Q):**\n   - Since \\( ¬(P ↔ Q) \\) is true, \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) must differ in truth value. This means one is true and the other is false.\n\n3. **Analyzing Premise 2: Q:**\n   - We are given that \\( Q \\) is true.\n\n4. **Combining the Information:**\n   - Since \\( Q \\) is true and \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) must have different truth values (from premise 1), it follows that \\( P \\) must be false.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - From the above analysis, we can conclude that \\( P \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is:\n\n<<<¬P>>>"
