    "To solve this propositional logic reasoning question, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them. Let's break down each premise and see how they relate to each other.\n\n1. **Premise 1: ((P → Q) → (P ∧ P))**\n\n   - This premise states that if \"P implies Q\" is true, then \"P and P\" is true. \n   - Since \"P and P\" is logically equivalent to \"P\", this premise essentially states that if \"P implies Q\" is true, then \"P\" is true.\n\n2. **Premise 2: ((P → Q) → (Q ∧ Q))**\n\n   - This premise states that if \"P implies Q\" is true, then \"Q and Q\" is true.\n   - Since \"Q and Q\" is logically equivalent to \"Q\", this premise essentially states that if \"P implies Q\" is true, then \"Q\" is true.\n\n3. **Premise 3: (P → P)**\n\n   - This is a tautology, meaning it is always true. It states that \"P implies P\", which is a basic logical truth.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications of these premises:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if \"P → Q\" is true, then \"P\" must be true.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if \"P → Q\" is true, then \"Q\" must be true.\n- Premise 3 is always true and doesn't provide additional information beyond the tautology.\n\nGiven that both Premise 1 and Premise 2 require \"P → Q\" to be true for their conclusions, and both lead to \"P\" and \"Q\" being true respectively, we can infer that if \"P → Q\" is true, then both \"P\" and \"Q\" are true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that can be drawn from these premises is that if \"P → Q\" is true, then both \"P\" and \"Q\" are true, which can be expressed as \"P ∧ Q\".\n\nThus, the conclusion logic statement is:\n\n<<<(P → Q) → (P ∧ Q)>>>"
