    "To solve this propositional logic reasoning question, we need to analyze the given premises step by step and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\n1. **Premise 1: (Q ∨ Q)**\n   - This is a tautology because any statement ORed with itself is equivalent to the statement itself. Therefore, (Q ∨ Q) simplifies to Q.\n\n2. **Premise 2: (P ↔ Q)**\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means P is true if and only if Q is true. In other words, P and Q have the same truth value.\n\n3. **Premise 3: Q**\n   - This premise states that Q is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications of these premises:\n\n- From Premise 3, we know that Q is true.\n- Since Q is true, and from Premise 2 (P ↔ Q), we can infer that P must also be true because P and Q have the same truth value.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that can be drawn from the given premises is that P is true.\n\nThe final conclusion logic statement is:\n\n<<<P>>>"
