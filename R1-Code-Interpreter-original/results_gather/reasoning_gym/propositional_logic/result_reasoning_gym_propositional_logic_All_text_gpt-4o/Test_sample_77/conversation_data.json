    "To solve this propositional logic reasoning question, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. \\( R \\rightarrow P \\)\n2. \\( P \\)\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Premises:**\n   - The first premise \\( R \\rightarrow P \\) means \"If R is true, then P is true.\"\n   - The second premise \\( P \\) means \"P is true.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing the Implications:**\n   - From the second premise, we know that P is true.\n   - The first premise \\( R \\rightarrow P \\) does not directly tell us anything about R when P is true. It only tells us that if R were true, then P would be true. However, since P is already true, this does not provide any new information about R.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the truth of P does not affect the truth of R in the context of the given premises, we cannot conclude anything about R. The premises do not provide enough information to determine whether R is true or false.\n\nTherefore, the only conclusion we can draw from the given premises is that P is true, which is already stated in the second premise.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe conclusion that can be drawn from the premises is simply that P is true.\n\nThus, the conclusion logic statement is:\n\n<<<P>>>"
