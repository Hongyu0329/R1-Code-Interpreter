    "To solve this propositional logic reasoning question, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\n**Premise 1: ((P ∨ Q) → ¬P)**\n- This premise states that if either P is true or Q is true (or both), then P must be false.\n- In other words, if P is true, then the premise is false because ¬P would be false.\n- If Q is true, then P must be false for the premise to hold true.\n\n**Premise 2: ((Q ∧ P) → (Q ∧ Q))**\n- This premise is a tautology because (Q ∧ Q) is logically equivalent to Q.\n- Therefore, this premise simplifies to ((Q ∧ P) → Q).\n- This means that if both Q and P are true, then Q is true, which is always true if Q is true.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- From Premise 1, we know that if P ∨ Q is true, then P must be false.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if both Q and P are true, then Q is true, which is trivially true.\n- The key point from Premise 1 is that P cannot be true if P ∨ Q is true, which implies that if Q is true, P must be false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The only consistent scenario with both premises is that if Q is true, then P must be false.\n- Therefore, we can conclude that Q implies ¬P.\n\nThus, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is:\n\n<<<Q → ¬P>>>"
