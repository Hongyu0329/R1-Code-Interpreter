    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises step by step and determine what conclusion can be drawn.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. \\( Q \\leftrightarrow R \\)\n2. \\( \\neg R \\)\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Biconditional (IFF) Statement:**\n   - The statement \\( Q \\leftrightarrow R \\) means that \\( Q \\) is true if and only if \\( R \\) is true. This can be broken down into two implications:\n     - \\( Q \\rightarrow R \\) (If \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( R \\) is true)\n     - \\( R \\rightarrow Q \\) (If \\( R \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) is true)\n\n2. **Using the Second Premise:**\n   - The second premise is \\( \\neg R \\), which means \\( R \\) is false.\n\n3. **Applying \\( \\neg R \\) to the Implications:**\n   - From \\( R \\rightarrow Q \\), if \\( R \\) is false (\\( \\neg R \\)), then \\( Q \\) must also be false to satisfy the implication. This is because if the antecedent (\\( R \\)) is false, the only way for the implication to hold true is if the consequent (\\( Q \\)) is also false.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \\( \\neg R \\) leads to \\( \\neg Q \\) through the implication \\( R \\rightarrow Q \\), we can conclude that \\( Q \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is:\n\n<<<¬Q>>>"
