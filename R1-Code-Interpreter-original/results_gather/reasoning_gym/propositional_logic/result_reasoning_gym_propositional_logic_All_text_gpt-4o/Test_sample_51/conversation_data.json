    "To analyze the given premises and infer a conclusion, let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Premise 1: P**\n   - This states that proposition P is true.\n\n2. **Premise 2: (P ∧ R)**\n   - This states that both propositions P and R are true simultaneously.\n\n3. **Premise 3: P**\n   - This is a repetition of Premise 1, reinforcing that proposition P is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze these premises:\n\n- From Premise 1 and Premise 3, we know that P is true.\n- Premise 2 states that both P and R are true. Since we already know P is true, this implies that R must also be true for the conjunction (P ∧ R) to hold.\n\nGiven these observations, we can conclude that both P and R are true. Therefore, the conclusion we can draw from the premises is that R is true.\n\nThus, the conclusion logic statement is:\n\n<<<R>>>"
