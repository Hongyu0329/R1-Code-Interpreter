    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze each premise and see how they interact with each other to derive a conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1: (¬Q ∨ ¬P)**\n   - This is equivalent to saying \"not Q or not P.\" In other words, at least one of Q or P must be false.\n\n2. **Premise 2: ¬(Q ∨ P)**\n   - This is equivalent to saying \"neither Q nor P is true.\" This means both Q and P are false.\n\n3. **Premise 3: ((Q ∨ P) ∧ (P → Q))**\n   - This premise is a conjunction of two parts:\n     - (Q ∨ P): Either Q or P is true.\n     - (P → Q): If P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\n4. **Premise 4: Q**\n   - This states that Q is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze these premises step by step:\n\n- From Premise 4 (Q is true), we have a contradiction with Premise 2 (¬(Q ∨ P)), which states that neither Q nor P is true. Since Q is true, Premise 2 cannot hold. Therefore, Premise 2 is false given Premise 4.\n\n- Since Premise 2 is false, we need to consider the other premises.\n\n- From Premise 1 (¬Q ∨ ¬P), if Q is true (from Premise 4), then ¬Q is false, which means ¬P must be true. Therefore, P must be false.\n\n- Now, let's consider Premise 3 ((Q ∨ P) ∧ (P → Q)):\n  - We know Q is true, so (Q ∨ P) is true regardless of P.\n  - Since P is false (from the analysis of Premise 1), the implication (P → Q) is vacuously true because a false antecedent makes the implication true.\n\nGiven these analyses, we have:\n- Q is true.\n- P is false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the premises is that P is false.\n\nThe final conclusion is:\n<<<¬P>>>"
