    "To solve this propositional logic reasoning question, we need to analyze the given premises step by step and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. ((R ∧ R) ∧ ¬Q)\n2. (Q ∨ P)\n3. (¬Q → (S → S))\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Simplify Premise 1:**\n   - The expression (R ∧ R) is equivalent to R because a conjunction of a proposition with itself is the proposition itself.\n   - Therefore, Premise 1 simplifies to (R ∧ ¬Q).\n\n2. **Analyze Premise 2:**\n   - Premise 2 is (Q ∨ P), which means either Q is true, or P is true, or both are true.\n\n3. **Analyze Premise 3:**\n   - Premise 3 is (¬Q → (S → S)).\n   - The expression (S → S) is a tautology because any proposition implies itself. Therefore, (S → S) is always true.\n   - Thus, (¬Q → (S → S)) simplifies to (¬Q → true), which is always true regardless of the truth value of ¬Q. This means that Premise 3 does not provide any new information about Q or S.\n\n4. **Combine Information:**\n   - From Premise 1, we have (R ∧ ¬Q), which means R is true and Q is false.\n   - Since Q is false, from Premise 2 (Q ∨ P), we can infer that P must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - From the analysis, we have determined that R is true, Q is false, and P is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the premises is that R is true and P is true.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe conclusion logic statement is: <<<R ∧ P>>>."
