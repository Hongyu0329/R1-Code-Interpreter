    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze each premise and see how they interact with each other to derive a conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1: ¬(Q → Q)**\n   - The expression (Q → Q) is a tautology, meaning it is always true because if Q is true, then Q implies Q is true, and if Q is false, Q implies Q is still true.\n   - Therefore, ¬(Q → Q) is a contradiction because it negates a tautology, making it always false.\n\n2. **Premise 2: Q**\n   - This premise states that Q is true.\n\n3. **Premise 3: (Q ↔ P)**\n   - This is a biconditional statement, meaning Q is true if and only if P is true. Since we know from Premise 2 that Q is true, it follows that P must also be true for the biconditional to hold.\n\nNow, let's analyze the interaction between these premises:\n\n- Premise 1 is a contradiction, which means it cannot be true under any circumstances. However, since we are given this as a premise, it suggests that there is an inconsistency in the premises themselves.\n- Premise 2 asserts that Q is true.\n- Premise 3, combined with Premise 2, implies that P must also be true.\n\nGiven the contradiction in Premise 1, the logical conclusion is that the set of premises is inconsistent. However, if we ignore the contradiction and focus on the consistent premises (Premise 2 and Premise 3), we can conclude that P is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the consistent premises is that P is true.\n\nThe final conclusion is:\n<<<P>>>"
