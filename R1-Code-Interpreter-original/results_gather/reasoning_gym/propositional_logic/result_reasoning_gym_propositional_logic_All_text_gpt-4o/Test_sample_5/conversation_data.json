    "To analyze the given premises and infer a conclusion, let's break down each premise and understand its implications:\n\n1. **Premise 1: P**\n   - This states that proposition P is true.\n\n2. **Premise 2: ¬(P → S)**\n   - The implication P → S is equivalent to ¬P ∨ S. Therefore, ¬(P → S) is equivalent to ¬(¬P ∨ S), which simplifies to P ∧ ¬S. This means P is true and S is false.\n\n3. **Premise 3: ¬(S → S)**\n   - The implication S → S is a tautology, as any proposition implies itself. Therefore, ¬(S → S) is a contradiction, as it states that S does not imply S, which is always false. This premise is inherently false and does not contribute to a valid conclusion.\n\n4. **Premise 4: P**\n   - This is a repetition of Premise 1, reinforcing that P is true.\n\nNow, let's summarize the valid information from the premises:\n- From Premise 1 and Premise 4, we know P is true.\n- From Premise 2, we know P is true and S is false.\n\nGiven these deductions, the only consistent conclusion we can draw is that S is false, as Premise 3 is a contradiction and does not provide any valid information.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can infer from the premises is:\n\n<<<¬S>>>"
