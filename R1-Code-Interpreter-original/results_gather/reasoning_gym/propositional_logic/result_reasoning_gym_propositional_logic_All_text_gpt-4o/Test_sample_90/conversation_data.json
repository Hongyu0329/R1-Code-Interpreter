    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises and determine what conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. ¬(R ∧ Q)\n2. (Q ↔ P)\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Understanding Premise 1: ¬(R ∧ Q)**\n   - This premise states that it is not the case that both R and Q are true simultaneously. This can be interpreted as either R is false, Q is false, or both are false.\n\n2. **Understanding Premise 2: (Q ↔ P)**\n   - This premise states that Q is true if and only if P is true. This means Q and P have the same truth value: both are true or both are false.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Interaction Between Premises:**\n   - From Premise 1, we know that R and Q cannot both be true. Therefore, if Q is true, R must be false.\n   - From Premise 2, if Q is true, then P must also be true (since Q ↔ P).\n   - Conversely, if Q is false, then P must also be false (again, due to Q ↔ P).\n\n4. **Exploring Possible Scenarios:**\n   - **Scenario 1:** Q is true.\n     - If Q is true, then P is true (from Premise 2).\n     - However, R must be false (from Premise 1, since R and Q cannot both be true).\n   - **Scenario 2:** Q is false.\n     - If Q is false, then P is false (from Premise 2).\n     - R can be either true or false, but it doesn't affect the truth of Q or P.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The key point is that the truth of Q directly affects the truth of P due to the biconditional relationship (Q ↔ P).\n   - Since ¬(R ∧ Q) ensures that Q cannot be true if R is true, and Q ↔ P ensures that Q and P have the same truth value, we can conclude that if R is true, then both Q and P must be false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the premises is that if R is true, then P must be false.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n- If R is true, then P is false.\n\nThus, the conclusion logic statement is:\n<<<R → ¬P>>>"
