    "To solve this propositional logic problem, we need to analyze the given premises step by step and determine what conclusion can be drawn.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. \\((P ∨ Q) → (R ∧ P)\\)\n2. \\(Q\\)\n3. ¬(Q ∧ Q)\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Understanding Premise 1:**\n   - The first premise \\((P ∨ Q) → (R ∧ P)\\) is a conditional statement. It tells us that if \\(P ∨ Q\\) is true, then \\(R ∧ P\\) must also be true.\n\n2. **Understanding Premise 2:**\n   - The second premise \\(Q\\) states that \\(Q\\) is true.\n\n3. **Understanding Premise 3:**\n   - The third premise ¬(Q ∧ Q) is a tautology because \\(Q ∧ Q\\) is equivalent to \\(Q\\), and ¬(Q) would contradict premise 2. Therefore, this premise does not provide additional information beyond confirming that \\(Q\\) is true.\n\n4. **Applying Premise 2 to Premise 1:**\n   - Since \\(Q\\) is true (from premise 2), \\(P ∨ Q\\) is also true regardless of the truth value of \\(P\\). Therefore, the antecedent of the conditional statement in premise 1 is true.\n\n5. **Conclusion from Premise 1:**\n   - Because the antecedent \\((P ∨ Q)\\) is true, the consequent \\((R ∧ P)\\) must also be true for the conditional statement to hold. This means both \\(R\\) and \\(P\\) must be true.\n\n6. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - From the above analysis, we can conclude that both \\(R\\) and \\(P\\) are true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is:\n\n<<<R ∧ P>>>"
