    "To analyze the given premises and infer a conclusion, let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the Premises:**\n   - Premise 1: R\n   - Premise 2: R (This is a repetition of Premise 1 and does not add new information.)\n   - Premise 3: Q\n   - Premise 4: (S ∧ S) (This is logically equivalent to S, as a conjunction of a statement with itself is the statement.)\n\n2. **Simplify the Premises:**\n   - From Premise 4, we simplify (S ∧ S) to S.\n\n3. **Analyze the Logical Implications:**\n   - We have the following simplified premises:\n     - R\n     - Q\n     - S\n\n4. **Determine Possible Conclusions:**\n   - Since we have R, Q, and S as true statements, we can conclude any combination of these statements using logical conjunction (AND, denoted as ∧).\n   - The simplest non-trivial conclusion that combines all the given true statements is (R ∧ Q ∧ S).\n\n5. **Formulate the Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the conclusion that logically follows from the premises is (R ∧ Q ∧ S).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion from the given premises is:\n\n<<<R ∧ Q ∧ S>>>"
