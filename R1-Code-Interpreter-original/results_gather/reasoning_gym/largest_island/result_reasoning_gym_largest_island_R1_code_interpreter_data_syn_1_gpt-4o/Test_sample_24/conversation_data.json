    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum area of an island in the given binary matrix. An island is defined as a group of connected 1's, and the area of an island is the number of 1's in it. We can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore each island and calculate its area.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**: We need a variable to keep track of the maximum area found so far. We'll also need a visited matrix to keep track of the cells we've already explored to avoid counting the same cell multiple times.\n\n2. **DFS Function**: We'll define a recursive DFS function that will explore all connected 1's starting from a given cell. This function will return the area of the island it explores.\n\n3. **Iterate Over the Grid**: We'll iterate over each cell in the grid. If we find a 1 that hasn't been visited, we'll start a DFS from that cell to calculate the area of the island.\n\n4. **Update Maximum Area**: After calculating the area of each island, we'll update the maximum area if the current island's area is larger.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we'll return the maximum area found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code.\n\n```python\ndef max_area_of_island(grid):\n    def dfs(x, y):\n        if x < 0 or x >= len(grid) or y < 0 or y >= len(grid[0]) or grid[x][y] == 0 or visited[x][y]:\n            return 0\n        visited[x][y] = True\n        area = 1  # Current cell\n        # Explore neighbors\n        area += dfs(x + 1, y)\n        area += dfs(x - 1, y)\n        area += dfs(x, y + 1)\n        area += dfs(x, y - 1)\n        return area\n\n    max_area = 0\n    visited = [[False for _ in range(len(grid[0]))] for _ in range(len(grid))]\n    \n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:\n                max_area = max(max_area, dfs(i, j))\n    \n    return max_area\n\n# Given grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate and print the maximum area of an island\nprint(max_area_of_island(grid))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the maximum area of an island in the given grid.",
