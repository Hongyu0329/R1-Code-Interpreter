    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum area of an island in the given binary matrix. An island is defined as a group of connected 1's, and the area of an island is the number of 1's in it. We can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore each island and calculate its area.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**: We need a variable to keep track of the maximum area found so far. We'll also need a visited matrix to keep track of which cells have already been explored.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Grid**: We'll iterate through each cell in the grid. If we find a '1' that hasn't been visited, it means we've found a new island.\n\n3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: When we find a new island, we'll perform a DFS to explore the entire island. We'll use a stack or recursion to explore all connected '1's, marking them as visited and counting them to calculate the area of the island.\n\n4. **Update Maximum Area**: After exploring an island, we'll compare its area to the current maximum area and update if it's larger.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Once we've explored the entire grid, the maximum area variable will contain the largest island area.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef max_area_of_island(grid):\n    def dfs(x, y):\n        if x < 0 or x >= len(grid) or y < 0 or y >= len(grid[0]) or grid[x][y] == 0 or visited[x][y]:\n            return 0\n        visited[x][y] = True\n        area = 1  # Current cell\n        # Explore neighbors\n        area += dfs(x + 1, y)\n        area += dfs(x - 1, y)\n        area += dfs(x, y + 1)\n        area += dfs(x, y - 1)\n        return area\n\n    if not grid or not grid[0]:\n        return 0\n\n    max_area = 0\n    visited = [[False for _ in range(len(grid[0]))] for _ in range(len(grid))]\n\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:\n                max_area = max(max_area, dfs(i, j))\n\n    return max_area\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Calculate the maximum area of an island\nresult = max_area_of_island(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the maximum area of an island in the given grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `2`, which indicates that the maximum area of an island in the given grid is 2. This is expected because there is a single island consisting of two connected '1's in the grid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
