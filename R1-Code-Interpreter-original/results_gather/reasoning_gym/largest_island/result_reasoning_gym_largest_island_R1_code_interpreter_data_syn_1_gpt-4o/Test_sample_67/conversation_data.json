    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum area of an island in the given 8x8 binary matrix. An island is defined as a group of connected 1's, and the area of an island is the number of 1's in it. We can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore each island and calculate its area.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**: We need a variable to keep track of the maximum area found so far.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Grid**: We will iterate through each cell in the grid. If we find a '1', it means we have found a new island.\n\n3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: When we find a '1', we will perform a DFS to explore the entire island. During the DFS, we will mark the visited cells to avoid counting them again and calculate the area of the island.\n\n4. **Update Maximum Area**: After exploring an island, we will update the maximum area if the current island's area is larger.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the maximum area found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code.\n\n```python\ndef max_area_of_island(grid):\n    def dfs(x, y):\n        if x < 0 or x >= len(grid) or y < 0 or y >= len(grid[0]) or grid[x][y] == 0:\n            return 0\n        grid[x][y] = 0  # Mark the cell as visited\n        area = 1  # Current cell\n        # Explore all 4 directions\n        area += dfs(x + 1, y)\n        area += dfs(x - 1, y)\n        area += dfs(x, y + 1)\n        area += dfs(x, y - 1)\n        return area\n\n    max_area = 0\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                max_area = max(max_area, dfs(i, j))\n    return max_area\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Calculate and print the maximum area of an island\nprint(max_area_of_island(grid))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the maximum area of an island in the given grid. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `3`, which is the maximum area of an island in the given grid. The island consists of three connected '1's, so the area is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
