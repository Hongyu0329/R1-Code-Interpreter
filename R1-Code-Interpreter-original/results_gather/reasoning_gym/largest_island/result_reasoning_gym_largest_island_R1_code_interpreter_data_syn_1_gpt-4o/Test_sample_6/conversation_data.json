    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the connected components of 1s in the grid, which represent islands. We can use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to explore each island and calculate its area. The goal is to find the maximum area among all islands.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `max_area` to 0 to keep track of the maximum area found.\n2. Create a helper function to perform DFS on the grid. This function will:\n   - Mark the current cell as visited by setting it to 0.\n   - Recursively visit all 4-directionally connected cells that are part of the island.\n   - Return the total area of the island.\n3. Iterate over each cell in the grid. If a cell contains a 1, it is part of an unvisited island:\n   - Use the DFS helper function to calculate the area of this island.\n   - Update `max_area` if the current island's area is greater than the current `max_area`.\n4. After iterating through the entire grid, `max_area` will contain the maximum area of any island found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef max_area_of_island(grid):\n    def dfs(x, y):\n        if x < 0 or x >= len(grid) or y < 0 or y >= len(grid[0]) or grid[x][y] == 0:\n            return 0\n        grid[x][y] = 0  # Mark as visited\n        area = 1  # Current cell\n        # Visit all 4-directionally connected cells\n        area += dfs(x + 1, y)\n        area += dfs(x - 1, y)\n        area += dfs(x, y + 1)\n        area += dfs(x, y - 1)\n        return area\n\n    max_area = 0\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                max_area = max(max_area, dfs(i, j))\n    return max_area\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Calculate and print the maximum area of an island\nprint(max_area_of_island(grid))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the maximum area of an island in the given grid. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the maximum area of an island as 5. This means that the largest connected group of 1s in the grid has an area of 5 cells.\n\n<<<5>>>"
