    "To solve the problem of finding the maximum area of an island in the given binary matrix grid, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid**: The grid is a 9x7 matrix where each cell is either 0 (water) or 1 (land). An island is formed by connecting 1s horizontally or vertically.\n\n2. **Identify Islands**: We need to traverse the grid to identify all the islands. An island starts at a cell with a value of 1 and includes all connected 1s.\n\n3. **Traversal Method**: We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore each island. Starting from a cell with a value of 1, we explore all connected 1s and mark them as visited to avoid counting them again.\n\n4. **Calculate Area**: For each island, count the number of 1s to determine its area.\n\n5. **Track Maximum Area**: Keep track of the maximum area encountered during the traversal of the grid.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**: Consider the case where there are no islands (all 0s), in which case the maximum area is 0.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and move through each cell.\n- When a 1 is found, initiate a DFS or BFS to explore the entire island.\n- For each island, count the number of 1s to determine its area.\n- Compare this area with the current maximum area and update if it's larger.\n- Continue this process until all cells have been checked.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**:\n\n- **First Island**: Starting at (0,1), explore connected 1s. The island includes cells: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (4,2). Total area = 17.\n\n- **Second Island**: Starting at (7,4), explore connected 1s. The island includes cells: (7,4), (8,4). Total area = 2.\n\n- Compare the areas of the two islands: 17 and 2. The maximum area is 17.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area of an island in the grid is 17.\n\nFinal answer: <<<17>>>."
