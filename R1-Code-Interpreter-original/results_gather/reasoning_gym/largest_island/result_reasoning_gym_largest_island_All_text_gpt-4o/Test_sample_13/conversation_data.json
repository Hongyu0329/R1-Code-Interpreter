    "To solve the problem of finding the maximum area of an island in the given binary matrix, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid**: The grid is a 7x8 matrix where '1' represents land and '0' represents water. We need to identify connected components of '1's, which form islands.\n\n2. **Identify Connectivity**: An island is formed by '1's that are connected 4-directionally, meaning we can move up, down, left, or right to connect '1's.\n\n3. **Traverse the Grid**: We need to traverse each cell in the grid to find all the islands. We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore each island starting from a '1'.\n\n4. **Mark Visited Cells**: To avoid counting the same island multiple times, we should mark cells as visited once they are part of an island. This can be done by changing '1's to '0's after they are visited.\n\n5. **Calculate Area**: For each island found, calculate its area by counting the number of '1's connected together.\n\n6. **Track Maximum Area**: Keep track of the maximum area encountered during the traversal of the grid.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as no islands present (all '0's) or the entire grid being one large island.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and move through each cell.\n- When a '1' is found, initiate a DFS or BFS to explore the entire island.\n- For each '1' visited, mark it as '0' to prevent revisiting.\n- Count the number of '1's in each island to determine its area.\n- Compare each island's area to the current maximum area and update if necessary.\n\nApplying this to the given grid:\n\n- The first island is found starting at (0, 4) and consists of two '1's connected vertically.\n- The second island is found starting at (2, 1) and consists of four '1's connected in a 2x2 block.\n\nThe maximum area of an island in this grid is 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
