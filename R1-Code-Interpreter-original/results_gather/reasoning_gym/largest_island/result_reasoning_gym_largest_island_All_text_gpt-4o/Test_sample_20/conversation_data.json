    "To solve the problem of finding the maximum area of an island in the given binary matrix grid, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify connected components of 1's. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid**: The grid is a 7 x 5 matrix, where each cell is either 0 (water) or 1 (land). We need to find the largest connected group of 1's.\n\n2. **Define Connectivity**: Two 1's are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically. Diagonal connections are not considered.\n\n3. **Initialize Variables**: We need a variable to keep track of the maximum area found. Let's call it `max_area` and initialize it to 0.\n\n4. **Traversal Strategy**: We will traverse each cell in the grid. If we encounter a 1 that hasn't been visited, it means we've found a new island. We will then perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to explore the entire island and calculate its area.\n\n5. **Marking Visited Cells**: To avoid counting the same island multiple times, we need to mark cells as visited. This can be done by either maintaining a separate visited matrix or by modifying the grid itself (e.g., changing 1's to 0's after visiting).\n\n6. **DFS/BFS Implementation**: For each unvisited 1, initiate a DFS/BFS to explore all connected 1's. Count the number of 1's encountered during this exploration to determine the area of the island.\n\n7. **Update Maximum Area**: After calculating the area of an island, compare it with `max_area`. If it's larger, update `max_area`.\n\n8. **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as:\n   - The grid being entirely water (all 0's).\n   - The grid having multiple small islands.\n\n9. **Final Result**: After traversing the entire grid, `max_area` will contain the size of the largest island.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and traverse each cell.\n- The first island is found starting at (0,0) and includes all 1's in the first two rows, giving an area of 10.\n- The second island starts at (2,2) and includes all connected 1's in the third to seventh rows, giving an area of 10.\n- Compare the areas of the two islands. Both have an area of 10, so the maximum area is 10.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area of an island in the given grid is 10.\n\nFinal answer: <<<10>>>."
