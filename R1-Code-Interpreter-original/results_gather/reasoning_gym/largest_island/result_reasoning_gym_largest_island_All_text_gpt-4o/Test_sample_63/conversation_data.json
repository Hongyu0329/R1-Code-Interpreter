    "To solve the problem of finding the maximum area of an island in the given 9x9 binary matrix, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify all the islands. An island is defined as a group of connected 1's, where connectivity is only allowed in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Islands**: We need to traverse the grid and identify all the distinct islands. This can be done using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) approach. We will start from each unvisited cell that contains a '1' and explore all connected '1's to mark the entire island.\n\n2. **Calculate Area**: For each island identified, we will calculate its area by counting the number of '1's that are part of the island.\n\n3. **Track Maximum Area**: As we calculate the area of each island, we will keep track of the maximum area encountered.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: Consider the case where there are no '1's in the grid, in which case the maximum area would be 0.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and move through each cell in the grid.\n- When a '1' is found, initiate a DFS or BFS to explore the entire island.\n- Mark visited cells to avoid counting them multiple times.\n- Count the number of '1's in each island to determine its area.\n- Compare each island's area to the current maximum area and update if necessary.\n\nApplying this to the given grid:\n\n- The first island is found starting at (0,5) and extends to (1,8). This island has an area of 8.\n- The second island is found starting at (6,2) and extends to (8,4). This island has an area of 12.\n- The maximum area between these two islands is 12.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area of an island in the given grid is 12.\n\nFinal answer: <<<12>>>."
