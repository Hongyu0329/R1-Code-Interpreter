    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum area of an island in the given binary matrix grid. An island is defined as a group of 1's connected 4-directionally (horizontally or vertically). The area of an island is the number of cells with a value of 1 in the island.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The grid provided is a 10 x 7 matrix filled entirely with 0's. This means there are no 1's present in the grid.\n\n2. **Island Definition**: An island is formed by 1's that are connected either horizontally or vertically. Since the grid contains only 0's, there are no 1's to form any islands.\n\n3. **Maximum Area Calculation**: Since there are no islands (no 1's in the grid), the maximum area of an island is 0.\n\n4. **Edge Consideration**: The problem states that all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water, which is represented by 0's. This is consistent with the given grid, as it contains only 0's.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: Since there are no islands in the grid, the maximum area of an island is 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
