    "To solve the problem of finding the maximum area of an island in the given binary matrix grid, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid**: The grid is a 7x9 matrix with binary values (0s and 1s). The 1s represent land, and the 0s represent water.\n\n2. **Define an Island**: An island is a group of 1s connected 4-directionally (up, down, left, right). Diagonal connections do not count.\n\n3. **Objective**: We need to find the maximum area of an island, where the area is defined as the number of 1s in the connected group.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - We will use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore each island.\n   - We will iterate over each cell in the grid. If we find a 1, we will start a DFS/BFS from that cell to explore the entire island.\n   - During the exploration, we will mark the visited cells to avoid counting them again.\n   - We will keep track of the size of each island and update the maximum area found.\n\n5. **Implementation Details**:\n   - Initialize a variable `max_area` to 0 to keep track of the maximum island area found.\n   - Use a helper function to perform DFS/BFS from a given cell. This function will:\n     - Check if the current cell is within bounds and is a 1.\n     - Mark the cell as visited (e.g., by setting it to 0).\n     - Recursively explore all 4-directional neighbors.\n     - Return the total count of 1s in this connected component.\n   - For each cell in the grid, if it is a 1, call the helper function and update `max_area` if the returned area is larger than the current `max_area`.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If the grid is empty or contains no 1s, the maximum area is 0.\n\n7. **Execution**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the grid and iterate through each cell.\n   - For each unvisited 1, perform a DFS/BFS to calculate the area of the island.\n   - Update the `max_area` accordingly.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the given grid:\n\n- Start from (0,1), perform DFS/BFS to find the connected 1s. The island includes cells (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (3,0). The area of this island is 7.\n- The next unvisited 1 is at (6,0). Perform DFS/BFS to find the connected 1s. The island includes cells (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), and (6,3). The area of this island is 4.\n\nThe maximum area of an island found is 7.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7>>>"
