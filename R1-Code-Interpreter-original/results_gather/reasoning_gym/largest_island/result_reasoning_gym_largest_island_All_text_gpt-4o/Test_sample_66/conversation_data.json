    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum area of an island in the given binary matrix grid. An island is defined as a group of 1's connected 4-directionally (horizontally or vertically). The area of an island is the number of 1's in that island.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The provided grid is a 7 x 9 matrix filled entirely with 0's. This means there are no 1's present in the grid.\n\n2. **Island Definition**: An island is a group of 1's connected 4-directionally. Since there are no 1's in the grid, there cannot be any islands.\n\n3. **Maximum Area Calculation**: The area of an island is determined by counting the number of 1's in the connected group. Since there are no 1's, the area of any island is 0.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: Since there are no islands in the grid, the maximum area of an island is 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
