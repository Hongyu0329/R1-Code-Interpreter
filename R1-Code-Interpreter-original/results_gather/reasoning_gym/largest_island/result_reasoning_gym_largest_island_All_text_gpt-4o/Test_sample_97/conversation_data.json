    "To solve the problem of finding the maximum area of an island in the given 9x9 binary matrix, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a binary matrix where '1' represents land and '0' represents water. An island is a group of '1's connected 4-directionally (up, down, left, right). We need to find the maximum area of such an island.\n\n2. **Identify Islands**: We need to traverse the matrix to identify all the islands. This can be done using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from each '1' that hasn't been visited yet.\n\n3. **Calculate Area**: For each island identified, calculate its area by counting the number of '1's connected 4-directionally.\n\n4. **Track Maximum Area**: Keep track of the maximum area encountered during the traversal of the matrix.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: Consider the case where there are no '1's in the matrix, in which case the maximum area is 0.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and traverse each cell.\n- When a '1' is found, initiate a DFS or BFS to explore the entire island.\n- Mark each visited '1' to avoid counting it multiple times.\n- Count the number of '1's in the current island to determine its area.\n- Compare the current island's area with the maximum area found so far and update the maximum if necessary.\n\nApplying this to the given matrix:\n\n- The first island is found starting at (0,5) and extends to (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), and (2,4). The area of this island is 5.\n- The second island is found starting at (3,2) and extends to (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3), (6,2), (6,3), and (6,4). The area of this island is 10.\n\nThe maximum area of an island in the given matrix is 10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10>>>"
