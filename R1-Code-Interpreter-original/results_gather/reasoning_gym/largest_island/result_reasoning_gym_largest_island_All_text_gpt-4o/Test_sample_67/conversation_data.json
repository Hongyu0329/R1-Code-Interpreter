    "To solve the problem of finding the maximum area of an island in the given binary matrix, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid**: The grid is an 8x8 matrix filled with 0s and 1s. The 1s represent land, and the 0s represent water. We need to find the largest connected group of 1s.\n\n2. **Identify Connectivity**: An island is defined as a group of 1s connected 4-directionally, meaning we can move up, down, left, or right to connect to another 1.\n\n3. **Initial Observation**: By examining the grid, we can see that there is a single horizontal line of 1s located in the third row, from the second column to the fourth column.\n\n4. **Calculate the Area of the Island**: Since the 1s are connected horizontally, they form a single island. The area of this island is simply the count of 1s in this connected group.\n\n5. **Count the 1s**: In the third row, the 1s are located at positions (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3). This gives us a total of 3 connected 1s.\n\n6. **Check for Other Islands**: The rest of the grid is filled with 0s, and there are no other 1s that are connected to form another island.\n\n7. **Determine the Maximum Area**: Since there is only one island, the maximum area of an island is the area of this single island, which is 3.\n\n8. **Return the Result**: The final answer is the maximum area of the island found in the grid.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area of an island in the given grid is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
