    "To solve the problem of finding the maximum area of an island in the given binary matrix, we need to carefully analyze the grid and identify connected components of 1s. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid**: The grid is a 6x6 matrix with binary values (0s and 1s). The 1s represent land, and 0s represent water.\n\n2. **Identify Islands**: An island is defined as a group of 1s connected 4-directionally (up, down, left, right). Diagonal connections do not count.\n\n3. **Initial Observation**: \n   - The grid has 1s located at positions (1,3) and (2,3).\n   - These two 1s are vertically adjacent, meaning they form a single island.\n\n4. **Calculate the Area of the Island**:\n   - Start from one of the 1s, say (1,3).\n   - Check its 4-directional neighbors: (0,3), (2,3), (1,2), and (1,4).\n   - (2,3) is also a 1, so it is part of the same island.\n   - From (2,3), check its neighbors: (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), and (2,4).\n   - All other neighbors are 0s or already visited, so the island consists of the 1s at (1,3) and (2,3).\n\n5. **Count the Cells in the Island**:\n   - The island consists of two cells: (1,3) and (2,3).\n   - Therefore, the area of this island is 2.\n\n6. **Check for Other Islands**:\n   - There are no other 1s in the grid, so no other islands exist.\n\n7. **Determine the Maximum Area**:\n   - Since there is only one island, the maximum area of an island in the grid is 2.\n\n8. **Final Answer**:\n   - The maximum area of an island in the given grid is 2.\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<2>>>"
