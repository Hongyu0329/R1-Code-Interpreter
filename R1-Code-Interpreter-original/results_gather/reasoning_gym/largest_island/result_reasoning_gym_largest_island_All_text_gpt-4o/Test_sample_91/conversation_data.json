    "To solve the problem of finding the maximum area of an island in the given binary matrix grid, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid**: The grid is a 5 x 7 matrix filled entirely with 0s. This means there are no 1s in the grid, which represent land.\n\n2. **Definition of an Island**: An island is defined as a group of 1s connected 4-directionally (up, down, left, right). Since the grid contains only 0s, there are no 1s to form any islands.\n\n3. **Calculate the Area of an Island**: The area of an island is the number of 1s in the connected group. Since there are no 1s in the grid, the area of any island is 0.\n\n4. **Determine the Maximum Area**: Since there are no islands in the grid, the maximum area of an island is 0.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: As there are no islands, the result is straightforward. The maximum area of an island is 0.\n\nBy following these steps, we conclude that the maximum area of an island in the given grid is 0.\n\nFinal answer: <<<0>>>."
