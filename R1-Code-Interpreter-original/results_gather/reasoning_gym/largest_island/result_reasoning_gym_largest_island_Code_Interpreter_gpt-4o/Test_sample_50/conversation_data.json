    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore each island in the grid. We'll iterate through each cell in the grid, and whenever we encounter a '1', we'll initiate a DFS to calculate the area of the island starting from that cell. We'll keep track of the maximum area encountered during this process.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef max_area_of_island(grid):\n    def dfs(x, y):\n        # If out of bounds or at a water cell, return 0\n        if x < 0 or x >= len(grid) or y < 0 or y >= len(grid[0]) or grid[x][y] == 0:\n            return 0\n        # Mark the cell as visited by setting it to 0\n        grid[x][y] = 0\n        # Explore all 4 directions and sum up the area\n        return 1 + dfs(x + 1, y) + dfs(x - 1, y) + dfs(x, y + 1) + dfs(x, y - 1)\n\n    max_area = 0\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Calculate the area of the island starting from (i, j)\n                max_area = max(max_area, dfs(i, j))\n    \n    return max_area\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Get the maximum area of an island\nmax_area = max_area_of_island(grid)\nmax_area\nassistant > The maximum area of an island in the given grid is <<<9>>>."
