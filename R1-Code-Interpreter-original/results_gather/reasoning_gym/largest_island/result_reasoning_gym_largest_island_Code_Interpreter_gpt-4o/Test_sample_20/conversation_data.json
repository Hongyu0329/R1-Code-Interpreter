    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to explore each island in the grid. We'll iterate through each cell in the grid, and whenever we encounter a '1', we'll initiate a DFS to calculate the area of the island starting from that cell. We'll keep track of the maximum area encountered during this process.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef max_area_of_island(grid):\n    if not grid:\n        return 0\n\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    visited = [[False for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    def dfs(r, c):\n        if r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or grid[r][c] == 0 or visited[r][c]:\n            return 0\n        visited[r][c] = True\n        area = 1  # Current cell\n        # Explore neighbors\n        area += dfs(r + 1, c)\n        area += dfs(r - 1, c)\n        area += dfs(r, c + 1)\n        area += dfs(r, c - 1)\n        return area\n\n    max_area = 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 1 and not visited[r][c]:\n                max_area = max(max_area, dfs(r, c))\n\n    return max_area\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n]\n\n# Calculate the maximum area of an island\nmax_area = max_area_of_island(grid)\nmax_area\nassistant > The maximum area of an island in the given grid is <<<24>>>."
