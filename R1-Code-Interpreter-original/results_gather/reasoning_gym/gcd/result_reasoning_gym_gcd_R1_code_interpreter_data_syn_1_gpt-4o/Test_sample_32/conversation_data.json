    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD. The algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Given two numbers, a and b, where a > b, compute the remainder of a divided by b.\n2. Replace a with b and b with the remainder from step 1.\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the numbers 128 and 646.\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\n# Given numbers\nnum1 = 128\nnum2 = 646\n\n# Calculate GCD\nresult = gcd(num1, num2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the GCD.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the GCD of the numbers 128 and 646 as 2. Therefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of these numbers is:\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of these numbers: 128, 646.
