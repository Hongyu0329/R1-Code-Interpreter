    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD. The algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number.\n2. Take the remainder from step 1 and divide the previous divisor by this remainder.\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.\n4. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD of the two numbers.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python to find the GCD of 668 and 927.\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\n# Given numbers\nnum1 = 668\nnum2 = 927\n\n# Calculate GCD\nresult = gcd(num1, num2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the GCD.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output indicates that the GCD of 668 and 927 is 1. This means that 668 and 927 are coprime, i.e., they have no common divisors other than 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of these numbers: 668, 927.
