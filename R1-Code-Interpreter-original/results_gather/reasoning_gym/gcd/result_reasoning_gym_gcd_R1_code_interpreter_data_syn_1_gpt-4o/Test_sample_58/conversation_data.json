    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm is efficient and works by repeatedly applying the division algorithm. Specifically, the GCD of two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (where \\(a > b\\)) is the same as the GCD of \\(b\\) and \\(a \\mod b\\). This process is repeated until the remainder is zero, at which point the divisor is the GCD.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to find the GCD of 650 and 908.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 650\nb = 908\n\n# Calculate the GCD using the math library\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(gcd)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the GCD.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the GCD of 650 and 908 as 2. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of these two numbers is:\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of these numbers: 650, 908.
