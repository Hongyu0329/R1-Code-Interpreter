    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm is efficient and works by repeatedly applying the division algorithm. Specifically, the GCD of two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (where \\(a > b\\)) is the same as the GCD of \\(b\\) and \\(a \\mod b\\). This process is repeated until the remainder is zero, at which point the divisor is the GCD.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the numbers 949 and 219.\n\n1. Compute \\(949 \\mod 219\\).\n2. Replace 949 with 219 and 219 with the remainder from step 1.\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the GCD.\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\n# Given numbers\nnum1 = 949\nnum2 = 219\n\n# Calculate GCD\nresult = gcd(num1, num2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will return the GCD of 949 and 219.",
