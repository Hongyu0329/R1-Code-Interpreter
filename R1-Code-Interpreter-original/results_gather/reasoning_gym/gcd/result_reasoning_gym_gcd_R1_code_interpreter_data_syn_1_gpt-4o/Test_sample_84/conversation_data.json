    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers, based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.\n\nThe steps for the Euclidean algorithm are as follows:\n1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number.\n2. Take the remainder from step 1.\n3. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n4. Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.\n5. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD of the two numbers.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to find the GCD of 9 and 771.\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\n# Numbers to find the GCD of\nnum1 = 9\nnum2 = 771\n\n# Calculate GCD\nresult = gcd(num1, num2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the GCD.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the GCD of the numbers 9 and 771 as 3. \n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 9 and 771 is:\n\n<<<3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of these numbers: 9, 771.
