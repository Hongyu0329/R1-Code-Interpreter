Let's calculate the GCD manually.\n\nTo find the GCD of 275 and 90, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1. Divide 275 by 90, which gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 275 - 3 * 90 = 5.\n2. Divide 90 by 5, which gives a quotient of 18 and a remainder of 90 - 18 * 5 = 0.\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the divisor at this step (5) is the GCD.\n\nThus, the GCD of 275 and 90 is <<<5>>>."
