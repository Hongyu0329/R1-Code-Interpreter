    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 814 and 842, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 814 and 842. Identify which is larger. In this case, 842 is larger than 814.\n\n3. **First Division**: Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - \\( 842 \\div 814 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 842 - 814 \\times 1 = 28 \\).\n\n4. **Second Step**: Replace the larger number with the smaller number, and the smaller number with the remainder from the previous step. Now, find the GCD of 814 and 28.\n\n5. **Second Division**: Divide 814 by 28 and find the remainder.\n   - \\( 814 \\div 28 = 29 \\) with a remainder of \\( 814 - 28 \\times 29 = 2 \\).\n\n6. **Third Step**: Replace 814 with 28, and 28 with the remainder 2. Now, find the GCD of 28 and 2.\n\n7. **Third Division**: Divide 28 by 2 and find the remainder.\n   - \\( 28 \\div 2 = 14 \\) with a remainder of \\( 28 - 2 \\times 14 = 0 \\).\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD. In this case, the last non-zero remainder is 2.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 814 and 842 is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>."
