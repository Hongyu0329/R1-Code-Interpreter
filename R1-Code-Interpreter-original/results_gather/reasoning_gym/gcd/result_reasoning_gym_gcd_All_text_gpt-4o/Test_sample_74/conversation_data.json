    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 824 and 66, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder of the division. Repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the numbers 824 and 66.\n   - Divide 824 by 66 and find the remainder:\n     - 824 รท 66 = 12 with a remainder of 32 (since 824 = 66 * 12 + 32).\n   - Replace 824 with 66 and 66 with 32, and repeat the process:\n     - 66 รท 32 = 2 with a remainder of 2 (since 66 = 32 * 2 + 2).\n   - Replace 66 with 32 and 32 with 2, and repeat the process:\n     - 32 รท 2 = 16 with a remainder of 0 (since 32 = 2 * 16 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 2. Therefore, the GCD of 824 and 66 is 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of the numbers 824 and 66 is 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
