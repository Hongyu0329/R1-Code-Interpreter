    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 924 and 936, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 924 and 936.\n   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - **First Division**: Divide 936 by 924.\n     - 936 รท 924 = 1 remainder 12 (since 936 - 924 = 12).\n   - **Second Division**: Now, divide 924 by 12.\n     - 924 รท 12 = 77 remainder 0.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: When the remainder becomes zero, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD. In this case, the last non-zero remainder is 12.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 924 and 936 is 12.\n\nFinal answer: <<<12>>>"
