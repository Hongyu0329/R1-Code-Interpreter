    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 410 and 41, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of GCD**: The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**: We are given two numbers: 410 and 41.\n\n3. **Check if One Number Divides the Other**: \n   - If one number divides the other exactly, then the smaller number is the GCD.\n   - Check if 41 divides 410 without a remainder.\n\n4. **Perform the Division**:\n   - Divide 410 by 41: \n     - 410 รท 41 = 10\n     - Since the division results in an integer (10) with no remainder, 41 divides 410 exactly.\n\n5. **Conclude the GCD**:\n   - Since 41 divides 410 exactly, the GCD of 410 and 41 is 41.\n\n6. **Verify**:\n   - Double-check the division to ensure no mistakes were made.\n   - 410 รท 41 = 10, remainder 0, confirms that 41 is a divisor of 410.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 410 and 41 is 41.\n\nFinal answer: <<<41>>>"
