    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 902 and 678, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the process:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 902 and 678.\n   - Divide 902 by 678 and find the remainder.\n     - 902 ÷ 678 = 1 remainder 224 (since 902 = 678 × 1 + 224).\n   - Replace 902 with 678 and 678 with the remainder 224.\n   - Now, divide 678 by 224 and find the remainder.\n     - 678 ÷ 224 = 3 remainder 6 (since 678 = 224 × 3 + 6).\n   - Replace 678 with 224 and 224 with the remainder 6.\n   - Now, divide 224 by 6 and find the remainder.\n     - 224 ÷ 6 = 37 remainder 2 (since 224 = 6 × 37 + 2).\n   - Replace 224 with 6 and 6 with the remainder 2.\n   - Now, divide 6 by 2 and find the remainder.\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0 (since 6 = 2 × 3 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching a remainder of zero is 2.\n   - Therefore, the GCD of 902 and 678 is 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of the numbers 902 and 678 is 2.\n\nThe final answer, enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
