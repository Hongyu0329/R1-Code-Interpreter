    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 936 and 794, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 936 and 794. We will divide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n\n3. **First Division**: \n   - Divide 936 by 794.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 936 \\div 794 = 1 \\) (since 794 goes into 936 once).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 936 - 794 \\times 1 = 936 - 794 = 142 \\).\n\n4. **Second Step**: Now, take the previous divisor (794) and the remainder (142) and apply the Euclidean algorithm again.\n   - Divide 794 by 142.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 794 \\div 142 = 5 \\) (since 142 goes into 794 five times).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 794 - 142 \\times 5 = 794 - 710 = 84 \\).\n\n5. **Third Step**: Continue with the new divisor (142) and the new remainder (84).\n   - Divide 142 by 84.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 142 \\div 84 = 1 \\) (since 84 goes into 142 once).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 142 - 84 \\times 1 = 142 - 84 = 58 \\).\n\n6. **Fourth Step**: Continue with the new divisor (84) and the new remainder (58).\n   - Divide 84 by 58.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 84 \\div 58 = 1 \\) (since 58 goes into 84 once).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 84 - 58 \\times 1 = 84 - 58 = 26 \\).\n\n7. **Fifth Step**: Continue with the new divisor (58) and the new remainder (26).\n   - Divide 58 by 26.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 58 \\div 26 = 2 \\) (since 26 goes into 58 twice).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 58 - 26 \\times 2 = 58 - 52 = 6 \\).\n\n8. **Sixth Step**: Continue with the new divisor (26) and the new remainder (6).\n   - Divide 26 by 6.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 26 \\div 6 = 4 \\) (since 6 goes into 26 four times).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 26 - 6 \\times 4 = 26 - 24 = 2 \\).\n\n9. **Seventh Step**: Continue with the new divisor (6) and the new remainder (2).\n   - Divide 6 by 2.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 6 \\div 2 = 3 \\) (since 2 goes into 6 three times).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 6 - 2 \\times 3 = 6 - 6 = 0 \\).\n\n10. **Conclusion**: The remainder is now zero, and the last non-zero remainder is 2. Therefore, the GCD of 936 and 794 is 2.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
