    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 996 and 485, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Larger and Smaller Number**: \n   - Larger number: 996\n   - Smaller number: 485\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Step 1: Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n     - 996 ÷ 485 = 2 remainder 26\n   - Step 2: Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder from the previous step.\n     - New pair: 485 and 26\n   - Step 3: Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n     - 485 ÷ 26 = 18 remainder 17\n     - New pair: 26 and 17\n     - 26 ÷ 17 = 1 remainder 9\n     - New pair: 17 and 9\n     - 17 ÷ 9 = 1 remainder 8\n     - New pair: 9 and 8\n     - 9 ÷ 8 = 1 remainder 1\n     - New pair: 8 and 1\n     - 8 ÷ 1 = 8 remainder 0\n\n3. **Determine the GCD**:\n   - The process stops when the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n   - In this case, the last non-zero remainder is 1.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 996 and 485 is 1.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1>>>"
