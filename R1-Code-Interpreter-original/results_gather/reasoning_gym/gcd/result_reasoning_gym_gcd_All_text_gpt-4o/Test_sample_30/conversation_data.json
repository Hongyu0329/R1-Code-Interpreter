    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 914 and 476, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 914 and 476.\n   - Divide 914 by 476 and find the remainder.\n     - 914 ÷ 476 = 1 remainder 438\n   - Replace 914 with 476 and 476 with 438, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 476 by 438 and find the remainder.\n     - 476 ÷ 438 = 1 remainder 38\n   - Replace 476 with 438 and 438 with 38, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 438 by 38 and find the remainder.\n     - 438 ÷ 38 = 11 remainder 20\n   - Replace 438 with 38 and 38 with 20, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 38 by 20 and find the remainder.\n     - 38 ÷ 20 = 1 remainder 18\n   - Replace 38 with 20 and 20 with 18, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 20 by 18 and find the remainder.\n     - 20 ÷ 18 = 1 remainder 2\n   - Replace 20 with 18 and 18 with 2, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 18 by 2 and find the remainder.\n     - 18 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 0\n   - Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 2, which is the GCD of 914 and 476.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 914 and 476 is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
