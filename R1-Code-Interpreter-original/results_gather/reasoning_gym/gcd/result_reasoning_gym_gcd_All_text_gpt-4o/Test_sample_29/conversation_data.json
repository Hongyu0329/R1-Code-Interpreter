    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 301 and 329, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 301 and 329. Identify which is larger. In this case, 329 is larger than 301.\n\n3. **First Division**: Divide the larger number by the smaller number:\n   - Divide 329 by 301.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( \\text{Quotient} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{329}{301} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( \\text{Remainder} = 329 - 301 \\times 1 = 28 \\).\n\n4. **Second Step**: Replace the larger number with the smaller number, and the smaller number with the remainder from the previous step. Now, find the GCD of 301 and 28.\n\n5. **Second Division**: Divide 301 by 28:\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( \\text{Quotient} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{301}{28} \\right\\rfloor = 10 \\).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( \\text{Remainder} = 301 - 28 \\times 10 = 21 \\).\n\n6. **Third Step**: Replace 301 with 28, and 28 with 21. Now, find the GCD of 28 and 21.\n\n7. **Third Division**: Divide 28 by 21:\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( \\text{Quotient} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{28}{21} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( \\text{Remainder} = 28 - 21 \\times 1 = 7 \\).\n\n8. **Fourth Step**: Replace 28 with 21, and 21 with 7. Now, find the GCD of 21 and 7.\n\n9. **Fourth Division**: Divide 21 by 7:\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( \\text{Quotient} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{21}{7} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( \\text{Remainder} = 21 - 7 \\times 3 = 0 \\).\n\n10. **Conclusion**: Since the remainder is now zero, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD. In this case, the last non-zero remainder is 7.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 301 and 329 is 7.\n\nFinal answer: <<<7>>>"
