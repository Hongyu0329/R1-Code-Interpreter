    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 486 and 669, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 486 and 669.\n   - Divide 669 by 486 and find the remainder.\n     - 669 ÷ 486 = 1 with a remainder of 183 (since 669 - 486 = 183).\n   - Now, take 486 and 183, and repeat the process.\n     - 486 ÷ 183 = 2 with a remainder of 120 (since 486 - 2*183 = 120).\n   - Next, take 183 and 120, and repeat the process.\n     - 183 ÷ 120 = 1 with a remainder of 63 (since 183 - 120 = 63).\n   - Now, take 120 and 63, and repeat the process.\n     - 120 ÷ 63 = 1 with a remainder of 57 (since 120 - 63 = 57).\n   - Next, take 63 and 57, and repeat the process.\n     - 63 ÷ 57 = 1 with a remainder of 6 (since 63 - 57 = 6).\n   - Finally, take 57 and 6, and repeat the process.\n     - 57 ÷ 6 = 9 with a remainder of 3 (since 57 - 9*6 = 3).\n   - Now, take 6 and 3, and repeat the process.\n     - 6 ÷ 3 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**: The last non-zero remainder is 3. Therefore, the GCD of 486 and 669 is 3.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The GCD of the numbers 486 and 669 is 3.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
