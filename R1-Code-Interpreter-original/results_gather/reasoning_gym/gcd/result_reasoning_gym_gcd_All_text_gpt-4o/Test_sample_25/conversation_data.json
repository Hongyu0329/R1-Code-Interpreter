    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 489 and 298, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 489 and 298.\n   - Divide 489 by 298 and find the remainder.\n     - 489 ÷ 298 = 1 remainder 191 (since 298 * 1 = 298 and 489 - 298 = 191).\n   - Replace 489 with 298 and 298 with 191, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 298 by 191 and find the remainder.\n     - 298 ÷ 191 = 1 remainder 107 (since 191 * 1 = 191 and 298 - 191 = 107).\n   - Replace 298 with 191 and 191 with 107, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 191 by 107 and find the remainder.\n     - 191 ÷ 107 = 1 remainder 84 (since 107 * 1 = 107 and 191 - 107 = 84).\n   - Replace 191 with 107 and 107 with 84, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 107 by 84 and find the remainder.\n     - 107 ÷ 84 = 1 remainder 23 (since 84 * 1 = 84 and 107 - 84 = 23).\n   - Replace 107 with 84 and 84 with 23, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 84 by 23 and find the remainder.\n     - 84 ÷ 23 = 3 remainder 15 (since 23 * 3 = 69 and 84 - 69 = 15).\n   - Replace 84 with 23 and 23 with 15, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 23 by 15 and find the remainder.\n     - 23 ÷ 15 = 1 remainder 8 (since 15 * 1 = 15 and 23 - 15 = 8).\n   - Replace 23 with 15 and 15 with 8, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 15 by 8 and find the remainder.\n     - 15 ÷ 8 = 1 remainder 7 (since 8 * 1 = 8 and 15 - 8 = 7).\n   - Replace 15 with 8 and 8 with 7, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 8 by 7 and find the remainder.\n     - 8 ÷ 7 = 1 remainder 1 (since 7 * 1 = 7 and 8 - 7 = 1).\n   - Replace 8 with 7 and 7 with 1, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 7 by 1 and find the remainder.\n     - 7 ÷ 1 = 7 remainder 0 (since 1 * 7 = 7 and 7 - 7 = 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching a remainder of 0 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 489 and 298 is 1.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1>>>"
