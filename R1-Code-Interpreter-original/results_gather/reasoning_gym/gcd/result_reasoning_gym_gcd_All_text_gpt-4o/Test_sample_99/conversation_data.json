    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 400 and 798, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Method**:\n   - First, find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 400:\n     - 400 is even, divide by 2: 400 ÷ 2 = 200\n     - 200 is even, divide by 2: 200 ÷ 2 = 100\n     - 100 is even, divide by 2: 100 ÷ 2 = 50\n     - 50 is even, divide by 2: 50 ÷ 2 = 25\n     - 25 is not even, divide by 5: 25 ÷ 5 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 400 is \\(2^4 \\times 5^2\\).\n\n   - For 798:\n     - 798 is even, divide by 2: 798 ÷ 2 = 399\n     - 399 is not even, check divisibility by 3: 399 ÷ 3 = 133\n     - 133 is not divisible by 3, check divisibility by 5: not divisible\n     - Check divisibility by 7: not divisible\n     - Check divisibility by 11: 133 ÷ 11 = 11\n     - 11 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 798 is \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 11^2\\).\n\n2. **Identify Common Prime Factors**:\n   - From the prime factorizations:\n     - 400: \\(2^4 \\times 5^2\\)\n     - 798: \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 11^2\\)\n   - The only common prime factor is 2.\n\n3. **Determine the GCD**:\n   - The GCD is found by taking the lowest power of all common prime factors.\n   - For the common prime factor 2, the lowest power is \\(2^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the GCD**:\n   - Therefore, the GCD of 400 and 798 is \\(2^1 = 2\\).\n\nThus, the Greatest Common Divisor of 400 and 798 is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
