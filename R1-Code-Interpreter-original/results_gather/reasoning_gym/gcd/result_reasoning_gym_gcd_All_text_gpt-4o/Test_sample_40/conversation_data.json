    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 801 and 609, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Larger and Smaller Number**: \n   - Larger number: 801\n   - Smaller number: 609\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Step 1: Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 801 \\div 609 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 192 \\)\n   - Step 2: Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder from the previous step.\n     - New larger number: 609\n     - New smaller number: 192\n   - Step 3: Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n     - \\( 609 \\div 192 = 3 \\) remainder \\( 33 \\)\n     - New larger number: 192\n     - New smaller number: 33\n     - \\( 192 \\div 33 = 5 \\) remainder \\( 27 \\)\n     - New larger number: 33\n     - New smaller number: 27\n     - \\( 33 \\div 27 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 6 \\)\n     - New larger number: 27\n     - New smaller number: 6\n     - \\( 27 \\div 6 = 4 \\) remainder \\( 3 \\)\n     - New larger number: 6\n     - New smaller number: 3\n     - \\( 6 \\div 3 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\)\n\n3. **Determine the GCD**:\n   - The process stops when the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n   - In this case, the last non-zero remainder is 3.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 801 and 609 is 3.\n\nFinal answer: <<<3>>>"
