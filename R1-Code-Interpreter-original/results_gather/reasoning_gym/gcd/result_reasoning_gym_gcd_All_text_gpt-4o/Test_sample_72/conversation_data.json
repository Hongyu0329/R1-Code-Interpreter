    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 731 and 129, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division. Repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 731 and 129.\n   - Divide 731 by 129 and find the remainder.\n     - 731 รท 129 = 5 remainder 86 (since 731 = 129 * 5 + 86).\n   - Replace 731 with 129 and 129 with 86, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 129 by 86 and find the remainder.\n     - 129 รท 86 = 1 remainder 43 (since 129 = 86 * 1 + 43).\n   - Replace 129 with 86 and 86 with 43, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 86 by 43 and find the remainder.\n     - 86 รท 43 = 2 remainder 0 (since 86 = 43 * 2 + 0).\n   - Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching 0 is 43.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 731 and 129 is 43.\n\nFinal answer: <<<43>>>"
