    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 617 and 228, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the process:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 617 and 228.\n   - Divide 617 by 228 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 617 \\div 228 = 2 \\) with a remainder of \\( 617 - 2 \\times 228 = 161 \\).\n   - Now, take 228 and 161, and repeat the process.\n     - \\( 228 \\div 161 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 228 - 1 \\times 161 = 67 \\).\n   - Next, take 161 and 67, and repeat the process.\n     - \\( 161 \\div 67 = 2 \\) with a remainder of \\( 161 - 2 \\times 67 = 27 \\).\n   - Now, take 67 and 27, and repeat the process.\n     - \\( 67 \\div 27 = 2 \\) with a remainder of \\( 67 - 2 \\times 27 = 13 \\).\n   - Next, take 27 and 13, and repeat the process.\n     - \\( 27 \\div 13 = 2 \\) with a remainder of \\( 27 - 2 \\times 13 = 1 \\).\n   - Finally, take 13 and 1, and repeat the process.\n     - \\( 13 \\div 1 = 13 \\) with a remainder of \\( 13 - 13 \\times 1 = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**: The last non-zero remainder before reaching zero is 1. Therefore, the GCD of 617 and 228 is 1.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the GCD is 1, it indicates that 617 and 228 are coprime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1.\n\nThe final answer, enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
