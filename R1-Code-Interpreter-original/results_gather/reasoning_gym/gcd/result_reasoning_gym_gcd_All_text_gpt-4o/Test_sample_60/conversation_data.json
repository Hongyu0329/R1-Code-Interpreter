    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 584 and 536, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 584 and 536.\n   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - **First Division**: Divide 584 by 536.\n     - 584 รท 536 = 1 remainder 48 (since 584 - 536 = 48).\n   - **Second Division**: Now, divide 536 by 48.\n     - 536 รท 48 = 11 remainder 8 (since 536 - 48 ร 11 = 8).\n   - **Third Division**: Now, divide 48 by 8.\n     - 48 รท 8 = 6 remainder 0.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The last non-zero remainder is 8, which is the GCD of 584 and 536.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 584 and 536 is:\n\n<<<8>>>"
