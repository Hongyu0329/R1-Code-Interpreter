    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 957 and 737, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder of the division. \n   - Repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the numbers 957 and 737.\n   - Divide 957 by 737 and find the remainder:\n     - 957 ÷ 737 = 1 with a remainder of 220 (since 957 - 737 = 220).\n   - Replace 957 with 737 and 737 with 220, and repeat the process:\n     - 737 ÷ 220 = 3 with a remainder of 77 (since 737 - 3*220 = 77).\n   - Replace 737 with 220 and 220 with 77, and repeat the process:\n     - 220 ÷ 77 = 2 with a remainder of 66 (since 220 - 2*77 = 66).\n   - Replace 220 with 77 and 77 with 66, and repeat the process:\n     - 77 ÷ 66 = 1 with a remainder of 11 (since 77 - 66 = 11).\n   - Replace 77 with 66 and 66 with 11, and repeat the process:\n     - 66 ÷ 11 = 6 with a remainder of 0 (since 66 - 6*11 = 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching a remainder of 0 is 11.\n   - Therefore, the GCD of 957 and 737 is 11.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of the numbers 957 and 737 is 11.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<11>>>"
