    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 194 and 968, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 968 (larger) and 194 (smaller).\n   - Divide 968 by 194 and find the remainder.\n     - 968 รท 194 = 4 remainder 192 (since 194 * 4 = 776 and 968 - 776 = 192).\n   - Replace 968 with 194 and 194 with 192, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 194 by 192 and find the remainder.\n     - 194 รท 192 = 1 remainder 2 (since 192 * 1 = 192 and 194 - 192 = 2).\n   - Replace 194 with 192 and 192 with 2, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 192 by 2 and find the remainder.\n     - 192 รท 2 = 96 remainder 0 (since 2 * 96 = 192 and 192 - 192 = 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching a remainder of zero is 2.\n   - Therefore, the GCD of 194 and 968 is 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of the numbers 194 and 968 is 2.\n\nThe final answer, enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
