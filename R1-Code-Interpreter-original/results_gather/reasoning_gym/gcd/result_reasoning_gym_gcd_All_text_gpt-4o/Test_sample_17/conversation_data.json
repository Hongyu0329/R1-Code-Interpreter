    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 697 and 46, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 697 and 46. We will divide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n\n3. **First Division**: \n   - Divide 697 by 46.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 697 \\div 46 = 15 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 697 - (46 \\times 15) = 697 - 690 = 7 \\).\n\n4. **Second Step**: Now, take the remainder (7) and divide the previous divisor (46) by this remainder.\n   - Divide 46 by 7.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 46 \\div 7 = 6 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 46 - (7 \\times 6) = 46 - 42 = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Third Step**: Continue the process with the new remainder (4).\n   - Divide 7 by 4.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 7 \\div 4 = 1 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 7 - (4 \\times 1) = 7 - 4 = 3 \\).\n\n6. **Fourth Step**: Continue with the new remainder (3).\n   - Divide 4 by 3.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 4 \\div 3 = 1 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 4 - (3 \\times 1) = 4 - 3 = 1 \\).\n\n7. **Fifth Step**: Continue with the new remainder (1).\n   - Divide 3 by 1.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 3 \\div 1 = 3 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 3 - (1 \\times 3) = 3 - 3 = 0 \\).\n\n8. **Conclusion**: The process stops when the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is 1, which is the GCD of 697 and 46.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 697 and 46 is 1.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1>>>"
