    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 650 and 908, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 650 and 908.\n   - Divide 908 by 650 and find the remainder.\n     - 908 ÷ 650 = 1 with a remainder of 258 (since 908 - 650 = 258).\n   - Replace 908 with 650 and 650 with 258, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 650 by 258 and find the remainder.\n     - 650 ÷ 258 = 2 with a remainder of 134 (since 650 - 2*258 = 134).\n   - Replace 650 with 258 and 258 with 134, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 258 by 134 and find the remainder.\n     - 258 ÷ 134 = 1 with a remainder of 124 (since 258 - 134 = 124).\n   - Replace 258 with 134 and 134 with 124, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 134 by 124 and find the remainder.\n     - 134 ÷ 124 = 1 with a remainder of 10 (since 134 - 124 = 10).\n   - Replace 134 with 124 and 124 with 10, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 124 by 10 and find the remainder.\n     - 124 ÷ 10 = 12 with a remainder of 4 (since 124 - 12*10 = 4).\n   - Replace 124 with 10 and 10 with 4, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 10 by 4 and find the remainder.\n     - 10 ÷ 4 = 2 with a remainder of 2 (since 10 - 2*4 = 2).\n   - Replace 10 with 4 and 4 with 2, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 4 by 2 and find the remainder.\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 with a remainder of 0 (since 4 - 2*2 = 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching a remainder of 0 is 2.\n   - Therefore, the GCD of 650 and 908 is 2.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
