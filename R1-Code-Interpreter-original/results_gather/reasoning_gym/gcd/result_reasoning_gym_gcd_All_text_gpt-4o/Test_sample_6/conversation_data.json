    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 68 and 376, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division. Repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 68 and 376.\n   - Divide 376 by 68 and find the remainder.\n     - 376 รท 68 = 5 remainder 36 (since 68 * 5 = 340 and 376 - 340 = 36).\n   - Replace 376 with 68 and 68 with 36, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 68 by 36 and find the remainder.\n     - 68 รท 36 = 1 remainder 32 (since 36 * 1 = 36 and 68 - 36 = 32).\n   - Replace 68 with 36 and 36 with 32, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 36 by 32 and find the remainder.\n     - 36 รท 32 = 1 remainder 4 (since 32 * 1 = 32 and 36 - 32 = 4).\n   - Replace 36 with 32 and 32 with 4, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 32 by 4 and find the remainder.\n     - 32 รท 4 = 8 remainder 0 (since 4 * 8 = 32 and 32 - 32 = 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 4, which is the GCD of 68 and 376.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 68 and 376 is 4.\n\nFinal answer: <<<4>>>"
