    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 853 and 566, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 853 and 566.\n   - Divide 853 by 566 and find the remainder.\n     - 853 ÷ 566 = 1 remainder 287 (since 853 = 566 × 1 + 287).\n   - Replace 853 with 566 and 566 with 287, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 566 by 287 and find the remainder.\n     - 566 ÷ 287 = 1 remainder 279 (since 566 = 287 × 1 + 279).\n   - Replace 566 with 287 and 287 with 279, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 287 by 279 and find the remainder.\n     - 287 ÷ 279 = 1 remainder 8 (since 287 = 279 × 1 + 8).\n   - Replace 287 with 279 and 279 with 8, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 279 by 8 and find the remainder.\n     - 279 ÷ 8 = 34 remainder 7 (since 279 = 8 × 34 + 7).\n   - Replace 279 with 8 and 8 with 7, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 8 by 7 and find the remainder.\n     - 8 ÷ 7 = 1 remainder 1 (since 8 = 7 × 1 + 1).\n   - Replace 8 with 7 and 7 with 1, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 7 by 1 and find the remainder.\n     - 7 ÷ 1 = 7 remainder 0 (since 7 = 1 × 7 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching a remainder of zero is 1.\n   - Therefore, the GCD of 853 and 566 is 1.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of 853 and 566 is 1, which means they are coprime (they have no common divisors other than 1).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1>>>"
