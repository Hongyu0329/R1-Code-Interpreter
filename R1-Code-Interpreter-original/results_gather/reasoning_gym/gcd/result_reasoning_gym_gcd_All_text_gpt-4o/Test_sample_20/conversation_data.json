    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 56 and 902, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of GCD**: The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization Method**: One way to find the GCD is to perform the prime factorization of each number and then identify the common factors.\n\n   - **Prime Factorization of 56**:\n     - 56 is an even number, so divide by 2: 56 ÷ 2 = 28\n     - 28 is also even, divide by 2: 28 ÷ 2 = 14\n     - 14 is even, divide by 2: 14 ÷ 2 = 7\n     - 7 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 56 is \\(2^3 \\times 7\\).\n\n   - **Prime Factorization of 902**:\n     - 902 is even, divide by 2: 902 ÷ 2 = 451\n     - 451 is not divisible by 2, check the next prime number, 3: 451 ÷ 3 is not an integer.\n     - Check divisibility by 5: 451 ÷ 5 is not an integer.\n     - Check divisibility by 7: 451 ÷ 7 is not an integer.\n     - Check divisibility by 11: 451 ÷ 11 is not an integer.\n     - Check divisibility by 13: 451 ÷ 13 = 34.69, not an integer.\n     - Check divisibility by 17: 451 ÷ 17 = 26.53, not an integer.\n     - Check divisibility by 19: 451 ÷ 19 = 23.73, not an integer.\n     - Check divisibility by 23: 451 ÷ 23 = 19.61, not an integer.\n     - Check divisibility by 29: 451 ÷ 29 = 15.55, not an integer.\n     - Check divisibility by 31: 451 ÷ 31 = 14.55, not an integer.\n     - Check divisibility by 37: 451 ÷ 37 = 12.19, not an integer.\n     - Check divisibility by 41: 451 ÷ 41 = 11, which is an integer.\n     - Therefore, 451 = 41 × 11.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 902 is \\(2 \\times 11 \\times 41\\).\n\n3. **Identify Common Factors**: Compare the prime factors of both numbers.\n   - Prime factors of 56: \\(2^3 \\times 7\\)\n   - Prime factors of 902: \\(2 \\times 11 \\times 41\\)\n\n4. **Find the GCD**: The only common prime factor is 2. The lowest power of 2 common to both factorizations is \\(2^1\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The GCD of 56 and 902 is 2.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 56 and 902 is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
