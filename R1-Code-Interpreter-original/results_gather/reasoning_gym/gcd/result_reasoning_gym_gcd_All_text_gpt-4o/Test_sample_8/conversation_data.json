    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 252 and 290, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 252 and 290.\n   - Since 290 is greater than 252, we divide 290 by 252.\n\n3. **First Division**:\n   - Divide 290 by 252: \n     - 290 ÷ 252 = 1 with a remainder of 38 (since 290 - 252 = 38).\n   - Replace 290 with 252 and 252 with 38.\n\n4. **Second Division**:\n   - Divide 252 by 38:\n     - 252 ÷ 38 = 6 with a remainder of 24 (since 252 - 38*6 = 24).\n   - Replace 252 with 38 and 38 with 24.\n\n5. **Third Division**:\n   - Divide 38 by 24:\n     - 38 ÷ 24 = 1 with a remainder of 14 (since 38 - 24 = 14).\n   - Replace 38 with 24 and 24 with 14.\n\n6. **Fourth Division**:\n   - Divide 24 by 14:\n     - 24 ÷ 14 = 1 with a remainder of 10 (since 24 - 14 = 10).\n   - Replace 24 with 14 and 14 with 10.\n\n7. **Fifth Division**:\n   - Divide 14 by 10:\n     - 14 ÷ 10 = 1 with a remainder of 4 (since 14 - 10 = 4).\n   - Replace 14 with 10 and 10 with 4.\n\n8. **Sixth Division**:\n   - Divide 10 by 4:\n     - 10 ÷ 4 = 2 with a remainder of 2 (since 10 - 4*2 = 2).\n   - Replace 10 with 4 and 4 with 2.\n\n9. **Seventh Division**:\n   - Divide 4 by 2:\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 with a remainder of 0 (since 4 - 2*2 = 0).\n   - The remainder is now 0, so the last non-zero remainder is 2.\n\n10. **Conclusion**:\n    - The GCD of 252 and 290 is the last non-zero remainder, which is 2.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 252 and 290 is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
