    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 970 and 506, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 970 and 506.\n   - Divide 970 by 506 and find the remainder.\n     - 970 รท 506 = 1 remainder 464\n   - Replace 970 with 506 and 506 with 464, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 506 by 464 and find the remainder.\n     - 506 รท 464 = 1 remainder 42\n   - Replace 506 with 464 and 464 with 42, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 464 by 42 and find the remainder.\n     - 464 รท 42 = 11 remainder 2\n   - Replace 464 with 42 and 42 with 2, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 42 by 2 and find the remainder.\n     - 42 รท 2 = 21 remainder 0\n   - Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching 0 is 2.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 970 and 506 is 2.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2>>>"
