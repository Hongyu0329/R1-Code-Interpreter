    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 668 and 927, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 668 and 927.\n   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - **Step 1**: Divide 927 by 668.\n     - 927 ÷ 668 = 1 remainder 259 (since 927 = 668 × 1 + 259).\n   - **Step 2**: Now, take 668 and 259.\n     - Divide 668 by 259.\n     - 668 ÷ 259 = 2 remainder 150 (since 668 = 259 × 2 + 150).\n   - **Step 3**: Now, take 259 and 150.\n     - Divide 259 by 150.\n     - 259 ÷ 150 = 1 remainder 109 (since 259 = 150 × 1 + 109).\n   - **Step 4**: Now, take 150 and 109.\n     - Divide 150 by 109.\n     - 150 ÷ 109 = 1 remainder 41 (since 150 = 109 × 1 + 41).\n   - **Step 5**: Now, take 109 and 41.\n     - Divide 109 by 41.\n     - 109 ÷ 41 = 2 remainder 27 (since 109 = 41 × 2 + 27).\n   - **Step 6**: Now, take 41 and 27.\n     - Divide 41 by 27.\n     - 41 ÷ 27 = 1 remainder 14 (since 41 = 27 × 1 + 14).\n   - **Step 7**: Now, take 27 and 14.\n     - Divide 27 by 14.\n     - 27 ÷ 14 = 1 remainder 13 (since 27 = 14 × 1 + 13).\n   - **Step 8**: Now, take 14 and 13.\n     - Divide 14 by 13.\n     - 14 ÷ 13 = 1 remainder 1 (since 14 = 13 × 1 + 1).\n   - **Step 9**: Now, take 13 and 1.\n     - Divide 13 by 1.\n     - 13 ÷ 1 = 13 remainder 0 (since 13 = 1 × 13 + 0).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 1, which means the GCD of 668 and 927 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 668 and 927 is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
