    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 886 and 158, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 886 and 158.\n   - Divide 886 by 158 and find the remainder.\n     - 886 ÷ 158 = 5 remainder 96 (since 158 * 5 = 790 and 886 - 790 = 96).\n   - Replace 886 with 158 and 158 with 96, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 158 by 96 and find the remainder.\n     - 158 ÷ 96 = 1 remainder 62 (since 96 * 1 = 96 and 158 - 96 = 62).\n   - Replace 158 with 96 and 96 with 62, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 96 by 62 and find the remainder.\n     - 96 ÷ 62 = 1 remainder 34 (since 62 * 1 = 62 and 96 - 62 = 34).\n   - Replace 96 with 62 and 62 with 34, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 62 by 34 and find the remainder.\n     - 62 ÷ 34 = 1 remainder 28 (since 34 * 1 = 34 and 62 - 34 = 28).\n   - Replace 62 with 34 and 34 with 28, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 34 by 28 and find the remainder.\n     - 34 ÷ 28 = 1 remainder 6 (since 28 * 1 = 28 and 34 - 28 = 6).\n   - Replace 34 with 28 and 28 with 6, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 28 by 6 and find the remainder.\n     - 28 ÷ 6 = 4 remainder 4 (since 6 * 4 = 24 and 28 - 24 = 4).\n   - Replace 28 with 6 and 6 with 4, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 6 by 4 and find the remainder.\n     - 6 ÷ 4 = 1 remainder 2 (since 4 * 1 = 4 and 6 - 4 = 2).\n   - Replace 6 with 4 and 4 with 2, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 4 by 2 and find the remainder.\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0 (since 2 * 2 = 4 and 4 - 4 = 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 2, which is the GCD of 886 and 158.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 886 and 158 is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
