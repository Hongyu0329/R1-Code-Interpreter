    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 154 and 868, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 154 and 868.\n   - Divide 868 by 154 and find the remainder.\n     - 868 ÷ 154 = 5 remainder 78 (since 154 * 5 = 770 and 868 - 770 = 98).\n   - Replace 868 with 154 and 154 with 98, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 154 by 98 and find the remainder.\n     - 154 ÷ 98 = 1 remainder 56 (since 98 * 1 = 98 and 154 - 98 = 56).\n   - Replace 154 with 98 and 98 with 56, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 98 by 56 and find the remainder.\n     - 98 ÷ 56 = 1 remainder 42 (since 56 * 1 = 56 and 98 - 56 = 42).\n   - Replace 98 with 56 and 56 with 42, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 56 by 42 and find the remainder.\n     - 56 ÷ 42 = 1 remainder 14 (since 42 * 1 = 42 and 56 - 42 = 14).\n   - Replace 56 with 42 and 42 with 14, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 42 by 14 and find the remainder.\n     - 42 ÷ 14 = 3 remainder 0 (since 14 * 3 = 42 and 42 - 42 = 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching a remainder of zero is 14.\n   - Therefore, the GCD of 154 and 868 is 14.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of the numbers 154 and 868 is 14.\n\nThe final answer, enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<14>>>"
