    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 622 and 594, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 622 and 594.\n   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - **Step 1**: Divide 622 by 594.\n     - 622 ÷ 594 = 1 remainder 28 (since 622 = 594 × 1 + 28).\n   - **Step 2**: Now, take 594 and 28.\n     - 594 ÷ 28 = 21 remainder 6 (since 594 = 28 × 21 + 6).\n   - **Step 3**: Now, take 28 and 6.\n     - 28 ÷ 6 = 4 remainder 4 (since 28 = 6 × 4 + 4).\n   - **Step 4**: Now, take 6 and 4.\n     - 6 ÷ 4 = 1 remainder 2 (since 6 = 4 × 1 + 2).\n   - **Step 5**: Now, take 4 and 2.\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0 (since 4 = 2 × 2 + 0).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 2, which is the GCD of 622 and 594.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 622 and 594 is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
