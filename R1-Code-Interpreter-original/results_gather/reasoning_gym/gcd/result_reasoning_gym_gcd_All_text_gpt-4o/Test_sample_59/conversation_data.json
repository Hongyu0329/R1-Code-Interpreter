    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 412 and 972, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the process:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 412 and 972. We will divide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n\n3. **First Division**: Divide 972 by 412.\n   - 972 ÷ 412 = 2 with a remainder of 148 (since 972 - 2*412 = 148).\n\n4. **Second Division**: Now, take the previous divisor (412) and divide it by the remainder (148).\n   - 412 ÷ 148 = 2 with a remainder of 116 (since 412 - 2*148 = 116).\n\n5. **Third Division**: Take the previous divisor (148) and divide it by the new remainder (116).\n   - 148 ÷ 116 = 1 with a remainder of 32 (since 148 - 1*116 = 32).\n\n6. **Fourth Division**: Take the previous divisor (116) and divide it by the new remainder (32).\n   - 116 ÷ 32 = 3 with a remainder of 20 (since 116 - 3*32 = 20).\n\n7. **Fifth Division**: Take the previous divisor (32) and divide it by the new remainder (20).\n   - 32 ÷ 20 = 1 with a remainder of 12 (since 32 - 1*20 = 12).\n\n8. **Sixth Division**: Take the previous divisor (20) and divide it by the new remainder (12).\n   - 20 ÷ 12 = 1 with a remainder of 8 (since 20 - 1*12 = 8).\n\n9. **Seventh Division**: Take the previous divisor (12) and divide it by the new remainder (8).\n   - 12 ÷ 8 = 1 with a remainder of 4 (since 12 - 1*8 = 4).\n\n10. **Eighth Division**: Take the previous divisor (8) and divide it by the new remainder (4).\n    - 8 ÷ 4 = 2 with a remainder of 0 (since 8 - 2*4 = 0).\n\n11. **Conclusion**: The last non-zero remainder is 4. Therefore, the GCD of 412 and 972 is 4.\n\nThe final answer, enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
