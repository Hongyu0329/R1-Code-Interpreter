    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 274 and 968, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 968 and 274.\n   - Divide 968 by 274 and find the remainder.\n     - 968 ÷ 274 = 3 remainder 146 (since 968 = 274 * 3 + 146).\n   - Replace 968 with 274 and 274 with 146, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 274 by 146 and find the remainder.\n     - 274 ÷ 146 = 1 remainder 128 (since 274 = 146 * 1 + 128).\n   - Replace 274 with 146 and 146 with 128, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 146 by 128 and find the remainder.\n     - 146 ÷ 128 = 1 remainder 18 (since 146 = 128 * 1 + 18).\n   - Replace 146 with 128 and 128 with 18, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 128 by 18 and find the remainder.\n     - 128 ÷ 18 = 7 remainder 2 (since 128 = 18 * 7 + 2).\n   - Replace 128 with 18 and 18 with 2, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 18 by 2 and find the remainder.\n     - 18 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 0 (since 18 = 2 * 9 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 2, which is the GCD of 274 and 968.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 274 and 968 is 2.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2>>>"
