    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 374 and 978, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 374 and 978.\n   - Divide 978 by 374 and find the remainder.\n     - 978 ÷ 374 = 2 with a remainder of 230 (since 978 - 2*374 = 230).\n   - Replace 978 with 374 and 374 with the remainder 230.\n   - Now, divide 374 by 230 and find the remainder.\n     - 374 ÷ 230 = 1 with a remainder of 144 (since 374 - 1*230 = 144).\n   - Replace 374 with 230 and 230 with the remainder 144.\n   - Now, divide 230 by 144 and find the remainder.\n     - 230 ÷ 144 = 1 with a remainder of 86 (since 230 - 1*144 = 86).\n   - Replace 230 with 144 and 144 with the remainder 86.\n   - Now, divide 144 by 86 and find the remainder.\n     - 144 ÷ 86 = 1 with a remainder of 58 (since 144 - 1*86 = 58).\n   - Replace 144 with 86 and 86 with the remainder 58.\n   - Now, divide 86 by 58 and find the remainder.\n     - 86 ÷ 58 = 1 with a remainder of 28 (since 86 - 1*58 = 28).\n   - Replace 86 with 58 and 58 with the remainder 28.\n   - Now, divide 58 by 28 and find the remainder.\n     - 58 ÷ 28 = 2 with a remainder of 2 (since 58 - 2*28 = 2).\n   - Replace 58 with 28 and 28 with the remainder 2.\n   - Now, divide 28 by 2 and find the remainder.\n     - 28 ÷ 2 = 14 with a remainder of 0 (since 28 - 14*2 = 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching a remainder of 0 is 2.\n   - Therefore, the GCD of 374 and 978 is 2.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
