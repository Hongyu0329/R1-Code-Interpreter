    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 416 and 362, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 416 and 362.\n   - Divide 416 by 362, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 54 (since 416 = 362 * 1 + 54).\n   - Replace 416 with 362 and 362 with 54, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 362 by 54, which gives a quotient of 6 and a remainder of 38 (since 362 = 54 * 6 + 38).\n   - Replace 362 with 54 and 54 with 38, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 54 by 38, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 16 (since 54 = 38 * 1 + 16).\n   - Replace 54 with 38 and 38 with 16, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 38 by 16, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 6 (since 38 = 16 * 2 + 6).\n   - Replace 38 with 16 and 16 with 6, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 16 by 6, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 4 (since 16 = 6 * 2 + 4).\n   - Replace 16 with 6 and 6 with 4, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 6 by 4, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2 (since 6 = 4 * 1 + 2).\n   - Replace 6 with 4 and 4 with 2, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 4 by 2, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0 (since 4 = 2 * 2 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 2, which is the GCD of 416 and 362.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 416 and 362 is 2.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2>>>"
