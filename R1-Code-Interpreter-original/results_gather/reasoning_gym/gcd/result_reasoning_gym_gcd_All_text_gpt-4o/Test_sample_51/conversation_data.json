    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 36 and 51, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of GCD**: The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization Method**:\n   - **Prime Factorization of 36**: \n     - 36 is an even number, so divide by 2: \n       - 36 ÷ 2 = 18\n     - 18 is also even, divide by 2 again:\n       - 18 ÷ 2 = 9\n     - 9 is not divisible by 2, try the next prime number, 3:\n       - 9 ÷ 3 = 3\n     - 3 is a prime number, divide by 3:\n       - 3 ÷ 3 = 1\n     - Prime factors of 36 are: 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 or \\(2^2 \\times 3^2\\).\n\n   - **Prime Factorization of 51**:\n     - 51 is not even, so start with the next prime number, 3:\n       - 51 ÷ 3 = 17\n     - 17 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 51 are: 3 × 17.\n\n3. **Identify Common Prime Factors**:\n   - From the prime factorizations:\n     - 36: \\(2^2 \\times 3^2\\)\n     - 51: \\(3 \\times 17\\)\n   - The common prime factor is 3.\n\n4. **Determine the GCD**:\n   - The GCD is the product of all common prime factors raised to the lowest power found in both factorizations.\n   - Here, the common factor is 3, and it appears as \\(3^1\\) in both factorizations.\n   - Therefore, the GCD is 3.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check that 3 divides both 36 and 51 without a remainder:\n     - 36 ÷ 3 = 12\n     - 51 ÷ 3 = 17\n   - Both results are integers, confirming that 3 is indeed a divisor of both numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined that the GCD of 36 and 51 is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3>>>."
