    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 732 and 781, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 732 and 781.\n   - Since 781 > 732, divide 781 by 732.\n\n3. **First Division**:\n   - Calculate 781 ÷ 732, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 781 - 732 = 49.\n   - Replace 781 with 732 and 732 with 49.\n\n4. **Second Division**:\n   - Now, divide 732 by 49.\n   - Calculate 732 ÷ 49, which gives a quotient of 14 and a remainder of 732 - (49 × 14) = 48.\n   - Replace 732 with 49 and 49 with 48.\n\n5. **Third Division**:\n   - Divide 49 by 48.\n   - Calculate 49 ÷ 48, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 49 - 48 = 1.\n   - Replace 49 with 48 and 48 with 1.\n\n6. **Fourth Division**:\n   - Divide 48 by 1.\n   - Calculate 48 ÷ 1, which gives a quotient of 48 and a remainder of 48 - (1 × 48) = 0.\n   - Since the remainder is now 0, the process stops here.\n\n7. **Determine the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 1, which means the GCD of 732 and 781 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 732 and 781 is 1.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1>>>"
