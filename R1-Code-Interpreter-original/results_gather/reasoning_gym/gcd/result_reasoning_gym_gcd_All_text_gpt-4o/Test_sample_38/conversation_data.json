    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 302 and 720, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division. Repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 302 and 720.\n   - Divide 720 by 302 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 720 \\div 302 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 116 \\).\n   - Replace 720 with 302 and 302 with 116, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 302 by 116 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 302 \\div 116 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 70 \\).\n   - Replace 302 with 116 and 116 with 70, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 116 by 70 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 116 \\div 70 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 46 \\).\n   - Replace 116 with 70 and 70 with 46, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 70 by 46 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 70 \\div 46 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 24 \\).\n   - Replace 70 with 46 and 46 with 24, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 46 by 24 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 46 \\div 24 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 22 \\).\n   - Replace 46 with 24 and 24 with 22, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 24 by 22 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 24 \\div 22 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 2 \\).\n   - Replace 24 with 22 and 22 with 2, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 22 by 2 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 22 \\div 2 = 11 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 2, which is the GCD of 302 and 720.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 302 and 720 is 2.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2>>>"
