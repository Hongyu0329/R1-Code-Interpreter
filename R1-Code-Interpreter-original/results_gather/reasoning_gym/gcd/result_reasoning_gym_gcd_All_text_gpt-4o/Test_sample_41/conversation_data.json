    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 578 and 188, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 578 and 188.\n   - Divide 578 by 188 and find the remainder.\n     - 578 รท 188 = 3 remainder 14 (since 188 * 3 = 564 and 578 - 564 = 14).\n   - Replace 578 with 188 and 188 with the remainder 14, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 188 by 14 and find the remainder.\n     - 188 รท 14 = 13 remainder 6 (since 14 * 13 = 182 and 188 - 182 = 6).\n   - Replace 188 with 14 and 14 with the remainder 6, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 14 by 6 and find the remainder.\n     - 14 รท 6 = 2 remainder 2 (since 6 * 2 = 12 and 14 - 12 = 2).\n   - Replace 14 with 6 and 6 with the remainder 2, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 6 by 2 and find the remainder.\n     - 6 รท 2 = 3 remainder 0 (since 2 * 3 = 6 and 6 - 6 = 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching a remainder of 0 is 2.\n   - Therefore, the GCD of 578 and 188 is 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of the numbers 578 and 188 is 2.\n\nThe final answer, enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
