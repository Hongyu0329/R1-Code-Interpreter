    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 174 and 568, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 174 and 568. We will divide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n\n3. **First Division**: Divide 568 by 174.\n   - Calculate: 568 ÷ 174 = 3 remainder 46.\n   - So, 568 = 174 × 3 + 46.\n\n4. **Second Step**: Now, take the remainder (46) and divide the previous divisor (174) by this remainder.\n   - Calculate: 174 ÷ 46 = 3 remainder 36.\n   - So, 174 = 46 × 3 + 36.\n\n5. **Third Step**: Take the new remainder (36) and divide the previous remainder (46) by this new remainder.\n   - Calculate: 46 ÷ 36 = 1 remainder 10.\n   - So, 46 = 36 × 1 + 10.\n\n6. **Fourth Step**: Take the new remainder (10) and divide the previous remainder (36) by this new remainder.\n   - Calculate: 36 ÷ 10 = 3 remainder 6.\n   - So, 36 = 10 × 3 + 6.\n\n7. **Fifth Step**: Take the new remainder (6) and divide the previous remainder (10) by this new remainder.\n   - Calculate: 10 ÷ 6 = 1 remainder 4.\n   - So, 10 = 6 × 1 + 4.\n\n8. **Sixth Step**: Take the new remainder (4) and divide the previous remainder (6) by this new remainder.\n   - Calculate: 6 ÷ 4 = 1 remainder 2.\n   - So, 6 = 4 × 1 + 2.\n\n9. **Seventh Step**: Take the new remainder (2) and divide the previous remainder (4) by this new remainder.\n   - Calculate: 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0.\n   - So, 4 = 2 × 2 + 0.\n\n10. **Conclusion**: The remainder is now 0, and the last non-zero remainder is 2. Therefore, the GCD of 174 and 568 is 2.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
