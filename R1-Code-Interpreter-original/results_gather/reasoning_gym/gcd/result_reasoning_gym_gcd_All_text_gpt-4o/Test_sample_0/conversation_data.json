    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 949 and 219, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the process:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 949 and 219. We will divide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n\n3. **First Division**: \n   - Divide 949 by 219.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 949 \\div 219 = 4 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 949 - 219 \\times 4 = 949 - 876 = 73 \\).\n\n4. **Second Division**:\n   - Now take the previous divisor (219) and divide it by the remainder (73).\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 219 \\div 73 = 3 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 219 - 73 \\times 3 = 219 - 219 = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the remainder is now zero, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD. In this case, the last non-zero remainder is 73.\n\n6. **Verification**: To ensure correctness, verify that 73 divides both 949 and 219 without leaving a remainder:\n   - \\( 949 \\div 73 = 13 \\) (exact division).\n   - \\( 219 \\div 73 = 3 \\) (exact division).\n\nBoth divisions confirm that 73 is indeed a divisor of both numbers.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 949 and 219 is 73.\n\nFinal answer: <<<73>>>"
