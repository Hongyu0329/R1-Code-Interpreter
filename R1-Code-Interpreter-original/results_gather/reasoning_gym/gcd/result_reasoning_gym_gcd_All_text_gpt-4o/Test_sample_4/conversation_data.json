    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 60 and 22, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of GCD**: The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **List the Factors**:\n   - Factors of 60: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60\n   - Factors of 22: 1, 2, 11, 22\n\n3. **Identify Common Factors**: The common factors of 60 and 22 are the numbers that appear in both lists of factors. Here, the common factors are 1 and 2.\n\n4. **Determine the Greatest Common Factor**: Among the common factors, the greatest one is 2.\n\n5. **Verification Using the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm.\n   - Start with the two numbers: 60 and 22.\n   - Divide 60 by 22, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 16 (since 60 = 22 * 2 + 16).\n   - Now, take 22 and 16. Divide 22 by 16, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 6 (since 22 = 16 * 1 + 6).\n   - Next, take 16 and 6. Divide 16 by 6, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 4 (since 16 = 6 * 2 + 4).\n   - Then, take 6 and 4. Divide 6 by 4, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2 (since 6 = 4 * 1 + 2).\n   - Finally, take 4 and 2. Divide 4 by 2, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0 (since 4 = 2 * 2 + 0).\n   - When the remainder reaches 0, the divisor at this step (2) is the GCD.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The GCD of 60 and 22 is 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
