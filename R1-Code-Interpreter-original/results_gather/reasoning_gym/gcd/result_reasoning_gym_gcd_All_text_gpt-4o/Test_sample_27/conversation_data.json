    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 24 and 140, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of GCD**: The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization Method**:\n   - **Prime Factorization of 24**: \n     - 24 is even, so divide by 2: 24 ÷ 2 = 12\n     - 12 is even, so divide by 2: 12 ÷ 2 = 6\n     - 6 is even, so divide by 2: 6 ÷ 2 = 3\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 24 is \\(2^3 \\times 3\\).\n\n   - **Prime Factorization of 140**:\n     - 140 is even, so divide by 2: 140 ÷ 2 = 70\n     - 70 is even, so divide by 2: 70 ÷ 2 = 35\n     - 35 is not even, check next smallest prime, 3: 35 is not divisible by 3.\n     - Check next prime, 5: 35 ÷ 5 = 7\n     - 7 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 140 is \\(2^2 \\times 5 \\times 7\\).\n\n3. **Identify Common Prime Factors**:\n   - The common prime factor between 24 and 140 is 2.\n   - The lowest power of the common prime factor 2 is \\(2^2\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the GCD**:\n   - The GCD is the product of all common prime factors raised to their lowest powers.\n   - Here, the GCD is \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check that 4 divides both 24 and 140 without a remainder:\n     - 24 ÷ 4 = 6\n     - 140 ÷ 4 = 35\n   - Both divisions result in integers, confirming that 4 is indeed the GCD.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 24 and 140 is 4.\n\nFinal answer: <<<4>>>"
