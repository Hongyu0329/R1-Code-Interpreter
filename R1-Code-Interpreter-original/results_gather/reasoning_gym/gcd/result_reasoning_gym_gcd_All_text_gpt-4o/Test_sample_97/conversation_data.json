    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 48 and 906, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division. Repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 906 and 48.\n   - Divide 906 by 48 and find the remainder.\n     - 906 รท 48 = 18 with a remainder of 42 (since 906 = 48 * 18 + 42).\n   - Replace 906 with 48 and 48 with 42, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 48 by 42 and find the remainder.\n     - 48 รท 42 = 1 with a remainder of 6 (since 48 = 42 * 1 + 6).\n   - Replace 48 with 42 and 42 with 6, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 42 by 6 and find the remainder.\n     - 42 รท 6 = 7 with a remainder of 0 (since 42 = 6 * 7 + 0).\n   - Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 6, which is the GCD of 48 and 906.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 48 and 906 is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
