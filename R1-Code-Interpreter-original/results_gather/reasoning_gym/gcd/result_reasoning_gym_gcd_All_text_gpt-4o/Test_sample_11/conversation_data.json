    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 688 and 716, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 688 and 716.\n   - Since 716 is greater than 688, we divide 716 by 688.\n\n3. **First Division**:\n   - Divide 716 by 688: \n     - 716 ÷ 688 = 1 with a remainder of 716 - 688 = 28.\n   - Replace 716 with 688 and 688 with 28.\n\n4. **Second Division**:\n   - Now divide 688 by 28:\n     - 688 ÷ 28 = 24 with a remainder of 688 - (28 × 24) = 16.\n   - Replace 688 with 28 and 28 with 16.\n\n5. **Third Division**:\n   - Now divide 28 by 16:\n     - 28 ÷ 16 = 1 with a remainder of 28 - 16 = 12.\n   - Replace 28 with 16 and 16 with 12.\n\n6. **Fourth Division**:\n   - Now divide 16 by 12:\n     - 16 ÷ 12 = 1 with a remainder of 16 - 12 = 4.\n   - Replace 16 with 12 and 12 with 4.\n\n7. **Fifth Division**:\n   - Now divide 12 by 4:\n     - 12 ÷ 4 = 3 with a remainder of 12 - (4 × 3) = 0.\n   - Since the remainder is now 0, the process stops here.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 4, which is the GCD of 688 and 716.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 688 and 716 is 4.\n\nFinal answer: <<<4>>>"
