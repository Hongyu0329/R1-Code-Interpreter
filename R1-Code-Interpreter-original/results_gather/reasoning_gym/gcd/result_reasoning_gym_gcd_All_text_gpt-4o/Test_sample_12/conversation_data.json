    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 297 and 30, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 297 and 30.\n   - Divide 297 by 30 and find the remainder.\n     - 297 รท 30 = 9 with a remainder of 27 (since 297 = 30 * 9 + 27).\n   - Replace 297 with 30 and 30 with the remainder 27, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 30 by 27 and find the remainder.\n     - 30 รท 27 = 1 with a remainder of 3 (since 30 = 27 * 1 + 3).\n   - Replace 30 with 27 and 27 with the remainder 3, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 27 by 3 and find the remainder.\n     - 27 รท 3 = 9 with a remainder of 0 (since 27 = 3 * 9 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 3, which is the GCD of 297 and 30.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of 297 and 30 is 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
