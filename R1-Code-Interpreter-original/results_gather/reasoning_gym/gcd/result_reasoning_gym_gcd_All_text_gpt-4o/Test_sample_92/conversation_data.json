    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 562 and 6, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the largest positive integer that divides both 562 and 6 without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization Method**: \n   - First, we can find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 6, the prime factorization is straightforward: \\(6 = 2 \\times 3\\).\n   - For 562, we need to determine its prime factors:\n     - Check divisibility by 2: 562 is even, so it is divisible by 2. Dividing, we get \\(562 \\div 2 = 281\\).\n     - Check divisibility of 281 by the next smallest primes (3, 5, 7, 11, etc.). 281 is not divisible by any of these primes, indicating that 281 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 562 is \\(562 = 2 \\times 281\\).\n\n3. **Identify Common Factors**:\n   - The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.\n   - The prime factors of 562 are 2 and 281.\n   - The only common prime factor between 6 and 562 is 2.\n\n4. **Calculate the GCD**:\n   - Since the only common factor is 2, the GCD of 562 and 6 is 2.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Verify by dividing both numbers by 2:\n     - \\(562 \\div 2 = 281\\) (no remainder)\n     - \\(6 \\div 2 = 3\\) (no remainder)\n   - No larger number than 2 can divide both 562 and 6 without leaving a remainder.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 562 and 6 is 2.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<2>>>"
