    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 200 and 226, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of GCD**: The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization Method**: One way to find the GCD is to perform the prime factorization of each number and then identify the common factors.\n\n   - **Prime Factorization of 200**:\n     - 200 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 200 \\div 2 = 100 \\)\n     - 100 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 100 \\div 2 = 50 \\)\n     - 50 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 50 \\div 2 = 25 \\)\n     - 25 is not even, divide by 5: \\( 25 \\div 5 = 5 \\)\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 200: \\( 2^3 \\times 5^2 \\)\n\n   - **Prime Factorization of 226**:\n     - 226 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 226 \\div 2 = 113 \\)\n     - 113 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factors of 226: \\( 2^1 \\times 113^1 \\)\n\n3. **Identify Common Prime Factors**: Compare the prime factors of both numbers.\n   - Common prime factor: 2\n\n4. **Calculate the GCD**: The GCD is the product of the lowest power of all common prime factors.\n   - The only common prime factor is 2, and the lowest power is \\( 2^1 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The GCD of 200 and 226 is 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
