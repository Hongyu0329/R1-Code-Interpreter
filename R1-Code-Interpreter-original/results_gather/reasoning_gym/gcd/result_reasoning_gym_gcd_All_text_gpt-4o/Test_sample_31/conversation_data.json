    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 496 and 676, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 496 and 676.\n   - Divide 676 by 496 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 676 \\div 496 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 180 \\).\n   - Replace 676 with 496 and 496 with 180, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 496 by 180.\n     - \\( 496 \\div 180 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 136 \\).\n   - Replace 496 with 180 and 180 with 136, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 180 by 136.\n     - \\( 180 \\div 136 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 44 \\).\n   - Replace 180 with 136 and 136 with 44, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 136 by 44.\n     - \\( 136 \\div 44 = 3 \\) remainder \\( 4 \\).\n   - Replace 136 with 44 and 44 with 4, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 44 by 4.\n     - \\( 44 \\div 4 = 11 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 4, which is the GCD of 496 and 676.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 496 and 676 is 4.\n\nFinal answer: <<<4>>>"
