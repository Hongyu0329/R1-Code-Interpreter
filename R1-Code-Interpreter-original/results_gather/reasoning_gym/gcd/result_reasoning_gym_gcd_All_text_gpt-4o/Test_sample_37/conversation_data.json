    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 336 and 942, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 336 and 942.\n   - Divide 942 by 336 and find the remainder.\n     - 942 รท 336 = 2 remainder 270 (since 942 = 336 * 2 + 270).\n   - Replace 942 with 336 and 336 with 270, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 336 by 270 and find the remainder.\n     - 336 รท 270 = 1 remainder 66 (since 336 = 270 * 1 + 66).\n   - Replace 336 with 270 and 270 with 66, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 270 by 66 and find the remainder.\n     - 270 รท 66 = 4 remainder 6 (since 270 = 66 * 4 + 6).\n   - Replace 270 with 66 and 66 with 6, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 66 by 6 and find the remainder.\n     - 66 รท 6 = 11 remainder 0 (since 66 = 6 * 11 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 6, which is the GCD of 336 and 942.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of 336 and 942 is 6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
