    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 275 and 90, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 275 and 90.\n   - Divide 275 by 90 and find the remainder.\n     - 275 ÷ 90 = 3 with a remainder of 275 - (90 × 3) = 275 - 270 = 5.\n   - Now, take 90 and the remainder 5, and repeat the process.\n     - 90 ÷ 5 = 18 with a remainder of 90 - (5 × 18) = 90 - 90 = 0.\n   - Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching 0 is 5.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of 275 and 90 is 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
