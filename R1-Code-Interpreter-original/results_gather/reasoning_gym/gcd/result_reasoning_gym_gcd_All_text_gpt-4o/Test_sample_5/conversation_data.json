    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 541 and 809, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 541 and 809. Assume 809 is the larger number (if not, swap them).\n\n3. **First Division**: Divide 809 by 541 and find the remainder.\n   - 809 ÷ 541 = 1 with a remainder of 268 (since 809 = 541 × 1 + 268).\n\n4. **Second Division**: Now, take 541 and divide it by the remainder from the previous step, which is 268.\n   - 541 ÷ 268 = 2 with a remainder of 5 (since 541 = 268 × 2 + 5).\n\n5. **Third Division**: Next, take 268 and divide it by the remainder from the previous step, which is 5.\n   - 268 ÷ 5 = 53 with a remainder of 3 (since 268 = 5 × 53 + 3).\n\n6. **Fourth Division**: Now, take 5 and divide it by the remainder from the previous step, which is 3.\n   - 5 ÷ 3 = 1 with a remainder of 2 (since 5 = 3 × 1 + 2).\n\n7. **Fifth Division**: Next, take 3 and divide it by the remainder from the previous step, which is 2.\n   - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 with a remainder of 1 (since 3 = 2 × 1 + 1).\n\n8. **Final Division**: Finally, take 2 and divide it by the remainder from the previous step, which is 1.\n   - 2 ÷ 1 = 2 with a remainder of 0 (since 2 = 1 × 2 + 0).\n\n9. **Conclusion**: The last non-zero remainder is 1, which means the GCD of 541 and 809 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 541 and 809 is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
