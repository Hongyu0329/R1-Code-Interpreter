    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 245 and 447, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 245 and 447.\n   - Divide 447 by 245 and find the remainder.\n     - 447 ÷ 245 = 1 remainder 202\n   - Replace 447 with 245 and 245 with 202, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 245 by 202 and find the remainder.\n     - 245 ÷ 202 = 1 remainder 43\n   - Replace 245 with 202 and 202 with 43, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 202 by 43 and find the remainder.\n     - 202 ÷ 43 = 4 remainder 30\n   - Replace 202 with 43 and 43 with 30, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 43 by 30 and find the remainder.\n     - 43 ÷ 30 = 1 remainder 13\n   - Replace 43 with 30 and 30 with 13, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 30 by 13 and find the remainder.\n     - 30 ÷ 13 = 2 remainder 4\n   - Replace 30 with 13 and 13 with 4, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 13 by 4 and find the remainder.\n     - 13 ÷ 4 = 3 remainder 1\n   - Replace 13 with 4 and 4 with 1, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 4 by 1 and find the remainder.\n     - 4 ÷ 1 = 4 remainder 0\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 1, which means the GCD of 245 and 447 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 245 and 447 is 1.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1>>>"
