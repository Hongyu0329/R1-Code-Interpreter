    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 128 and 646, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 646 and 128.\n   - Divide 646 by 128 and find the remainder.\n     - 646 ÷ 128 = 5 remainder 46 (since 646 = 128 * 5 + 46).\n   - Replace 646 with 128 and 128 with the remainder 46.\n   - Now, divide 128 by 46 and find the remainder.\n     - 128 ÷ 46 = 2 remainder 36 (since 128 = 46 * 2 + 36).\n   - Replace 128 with 46 and 46 with the remainder 36.\n   - Now, divide 46 by 36 and find the remainder.\n     - 46 ÷ 36 = 1 remainder 10 (since 46 = 36 * 1 + 10).\n   - Replace 46 with 36 and 36 with the remainder 10.\n   - Now, divide 36 by 10 and find the remainder.\n     - 36 ÷ 10 = 3 remainder 6 (since 36 = 10 * 3 + 6).\n   - Replace 36 with 10 and 10 with the remainder 6.\n   - Now, divide 10 by 6 and find the remainder.\n     - 10 ÷ 6 = 1 remainder 4 (since 10 = 6 * 1 + 4).\n   - Replace 10 with 6 and 6 with the remainder 4.\n   - Now, divide 6 by 4 and find the remainder.\n     - 6 ÷ 4 = 1 remainder 2 (since 6 = 4 * 1 + 2).\n   - Replace 6 with 4 and 4 with the remainder 2.\n   - Now, divide 4 by 2 and find the remainder.\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0 (since 4 = 2 * 2 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**: The last non-zero remainder is 2. Therefore, the GCD of 128 and 646 is 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The GCD of the numbers 128 and 646 is 2.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
