    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 710 and 485, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 710 and 485. We will divide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n\n3. **First Division**: \n   - Divide 710 by 485.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 710 \\div 485 = 1 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 710 - 485 \\times 1 = 225 \\).\n\n4. **Second Step**: Now, take 485 and 225, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 485 by 225.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 485 \\div 225 = 2 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 485 - 225 \\times 2 = 35 \\).\n\n5. **Third Step**: Now, take 225 and 35, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 225 by 35.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 225 \\div 35 = 6 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 225 - 35 \\times 6 = 15 \\).\n\n6. **Fourth Step**: Now, take 35 and 15, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 35 by 15.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 35 \\div 15 = 2 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 35 - 15 \\times 2 = 5 \\).\n\n7. **Fifth Step**: Now, take 15 and 5, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 15 by 5.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 15 \\div 5 = 3 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 15 - 5 \\times 3 = 0 \\).\n\n8. **Conclusion**: The remainder is now zero, and the last non-zero remainder is 5. Therefore, the GCD of 710 and 485 is 5.\n\nThe final answer, enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
