    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 717 and 477, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division. Repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 717 and 477.\n   - Divide 717 by 477 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 717 \\div 477 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 240 \\).\n   - Replace 717 with 477 and 477 with 240, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 477 by 240.\n     - \\( 477 \\div 240 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 237 \\).\n   - Replace 477 with 240 and 240 with 237, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 240 by 237.\n     - \\( 240 \\div 237 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 3 \\).\n   - Replace 240 with 237 and 237 with 3, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 237 by 3.\n     - \\( 237 \\div 3 = 79 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching zero is 3. Therefore, the GCD of 717 and 477 is 3.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of the numbers 717 and 477 is 3.\n\nThe final answer, enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
