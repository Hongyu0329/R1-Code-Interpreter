    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 570 and 858, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 570 and 858.\n   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - Divide 858 by 570:\n     - 858 รท 570 = 1 remainder 288 (since 570 * 1 = 570, and 858 - 570 = 288).\n   - Now, take 570 and 288:\n     - Divide 570 by 288:\n     - 570 รท 288 = 1 remainder 282 (since 288 * 1 = 288, and 570 - 288 = 282).\n   - Now, take 288 and 282:\n     - Divide 288 by 282:\n     - 288 รท 282 = 1 remainder 6 (since 282 * 1 = 282, and 288 - 282 = 6).\n   - Now, take 282 and 6:\n     - Divide 282 by 6:\n     - 282 รท 6 = 47 remainder 0 (since 6 * 47 = 282, and 282 - 282 = 0).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 6, which is the GCD of 570 and 858.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 570 and 858 is 6.\n\nFinal answer: <<<6>>>"
