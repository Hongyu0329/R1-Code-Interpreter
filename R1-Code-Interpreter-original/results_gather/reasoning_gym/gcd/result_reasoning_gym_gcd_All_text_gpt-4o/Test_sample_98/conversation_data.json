    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 280 and 804, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 280 and 804.\n   - Divide 804 by 280 and find the remainder.\n     - 804 ÷ 280 = 2 with a remainder of 244 (since 804 - 2*280 = 244).\n   - Replace 804 with 280 and 280 with 244, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 280 by 244 and find the remainder.\n     - 280 ÷ 244 = 1 with a remainder of 36 (since 280 - 1*244 = 36).\n   - Replace 280 with 244 and 244 with 36, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 244 by 36 and find the remainder.\n     - 244 ÷ 36 = 6 with a remainder of 28 (since 244 - 6*36 = 28).\n   - Replace 244 with 36 and 36 with 28, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 36 by 28 and find the remainder.\n     - 36 ÷ 28 = 1 with a remainder of 8 (since 36 - 1*28 = 8).\n   - Replace 36 with 28 and 28 with 8, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 28 by 8 and find the remainder.\n     - 28 ÷ 8 = 3 with a remainder of 4 (since 28 - 3*8 = 4).\n   - Replace 28 with 8 and 8 with 4, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 8 by 4 and find the remainder.\n     - 8 ÷ 4 = 2 with a remainder of 0 (since 8 - 2*4 = 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**: The last non-zero remainder is 4. Therefore, the GCD of 280 and 804 is 4.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The GCD of the numbers 280 and 804 is 4.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
