    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 198 and 843, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 198 and 843.\n   - Divide 843 by 198 and find the remainder.\n     - 843 ÷ 198 = 4 remainder 51 (since 843 = 198 × 4 + 51).\n   - Replace 843 with 198 and 198 with 51, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 198 by 51 and find the remainder.\n     - 198 ÷ 51 = 3 remainder 45 (since 198 = 51 × 3 + 45).\n   - Replace 198 with 51 and 51 with 45, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 51 by 45 and find the remainder.\n     - 51 ÷ 45 = 1 remainder 6 (since 51 = 45 × 1 + 6).\n   - Replace 51 with 45 and 45 with 6, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 45 by 6 and find the remainder.\n     - 45 ÷ 6 = 7 remainder 3 (since 45 = 6 × 7 + 3).\n   - Replace 45 with 6 and 6 with 3, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 6 by 3 and find the remainder.\n     - 6 ÷ 3 = 2 remainder 0 (since 6 = 3 × 2 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 3, which is the GCD of 198 and 843.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 198 and 843 is 3.\n\nFinal answer: <<<3>>>"
