    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 925 and 190, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 925 and 190.\n   - Divide 925 by 190 and find the remainder.\n     - 925 ÷ 190 = 4 remainder 165 (since 925 = 190 * 4 + 165).\n   - Replace 925 with 190 and 190 with the remainder 165.\n   - Divide 190 by 165 and find the remainder.\n     - 190 ÷ 165 = 1 remainder 25 (since 190 = 165 * 1 + 25).\n   - Replace 190 with 165 and 165 with the remainder 25.\n   - Divide 165 by 25 and find the remainder.\n     - 165 ÷ 25 = 6 remainder 15 (since 165 = 25 * 6 + 15).\n   - Replace 165 with 25 and 25 with the remainder 15.\n   - Divide 25 by 15 and find the remainder.\n     - 25 ÷ 15 = 1 remainder 10 (since 25 = 15 * 1 + 10).\n   - Replace 25 with 15 and 15 with the remainder 10.\n   - Divide 15 by 10 and find the remainder.\n     - 15 ÷ 10 = 1 remainder 5 (since 15 = 10 * 1 + 5).\n   - Replace 15 with 10 and 10 with the remainder 5.\n   - Divide 10 by 5 and find the remainder.\n     - 10 ÷ 5 = 2 remainder 0 (since 10 = 5 * 2 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**: The last non-zero remainder is 5. Therefore, the GCD of 925 and 190 is 5.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The GCD of the numbers 925 and 190 is 5.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
