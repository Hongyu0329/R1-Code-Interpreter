    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 364 and 152, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder of the division. Repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 364 and 152.\n   - Divide 364 by 152 and find the remainder:\n     - 364 ÷ 152 = 2 with a remainder of 60 (since 364 = 152 * 2 + 60).\n   - Replace 364 with 152 and 152 with 60, and repeat the process:\n     - 152 ÷ 60 = 2 with a remainder of 32 (since 152 = 60 * 2 + 32).\n   - Replace 152 with 60 and 60 with 32, and repeat the process:\n     - 60 ÷ 32 = 1 with a remainder of 28 (since 60 = 32 * 1 + 28).\n   - Replace 60 with 32 and 32 with 28, and repeat the process:\n     - 32 ÷ 28 = 1 with a remainder of 4 (since 32 = 28 * 1 + 4).\n   - Replace 32 with 28 and 28 with 4, and repeat the process:\n     - 28 ÷ 4 = 7 with a remainder of 0 (since 28 = 4 * 7 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 4, which is the GCD of 364 and 152.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 364 and 152 is 4.\n\nFinal answer: <<<4>>>"
