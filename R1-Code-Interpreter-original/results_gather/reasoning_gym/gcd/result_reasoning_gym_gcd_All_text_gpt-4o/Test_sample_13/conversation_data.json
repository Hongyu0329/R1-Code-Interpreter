    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 428 and 500, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 428 and 500.\n   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - Divide 500 by 428:\n     - 500 รท 428 = 1 remainder 72 (since 500 - 428 = 72).\n   - Now, take 428 and 72:\n     - Divide 428 by 72:\n     - 428 รท 72 = 5 remainder 68 (since 428 - 360 = 68, where 360 is 72 * 5).\n   - Now, take 72 and 68:\n     - Divide 72 by 68:\n     - 72 รท 68 = 1 remainder 4 (since 72 - 68 = 4).\n   - Now, take 68 and 4:\n     - Divide 68 by 4:\n     - 68 รท 4 = 17 remainder 0.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 4, which is the GCD of 428 and 500.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 428 and 500 is 4.\n\nFinal answer: <<<4>>>"
