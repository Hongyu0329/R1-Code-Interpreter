    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 595 and 810, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and takes the remainder until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 595 and 810. We will divide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n\n3. **First Division**: Divide 810 by 595.\n   - 810 ÷ 595 = 1 with a remainder of 215 (since 810 - 595 = 215).\n\n4. **Second Division**: Now, take the remainder (215) and divide the previous divisor (595) by this remainder.\n   - 595 ÷ 215 = 2 with a remainder of 165 (since 595 - 2*215 = 165).\n\n5. **Third Division**: Take the new remainder (165) and divide the previous remainder (215) by this new remainder.\n   - 215 ÷ 165 = 1 with a remainder of 50 (since 215 - 165 = 50).\n\n6. **Fourth Division**: Take the new remainder (50) and divide the previous remainder (165) by this new remainder.\n   - 165 ÷ 50 = 3 with a remainder of 15 (since 165 - 3*50 = 15).\n\n7. **Fifth Division**: Take the new remainder (15) and divide the previous remainder (50) by this new remainder.\n   - 50 ÷ 15 = 3 with a remainder of 5 (since 50 - 3*15 = 5).\n\n8. **Sixth Division**: Take the new remainder (5) and divide the previous remainder (15) by this new remainder.\n   - 15 ÷ 5 = 3 with a remainder of 0 (since 15 - 3*5 = 0).\n\n9. **Conclusion**: The last non-zero remainder is 5. Therefore, the GCD of 595 and 810 is 5.\n\nThe final answer, enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
