    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 963 and 208, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division. Repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 963 and 208.\n   - Divide 963 by 208 and find the remainder.\n     - 963 ÷ 208 = 4 remainder 131 (since 963 = 208 * 4 + 131).\n   - Replace 963 with 208 and 208 with 131, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 208 by 131 and find the remainder.\n     - 208 ÷ 131 = 1 remainder 77 (since 208 = 131 * 1 + 77).\n   - Replace 208 with 131 and 131 with 77, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 131 by 77 and find the remainder.\n     - 131 ÷ 77 = 1 remainder 54 (since 131 = 77 * 1 + 54).\n   - Replace 131 with 77 and 77 with 54, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 77 by 54 and find the remainder.\n     - 77 ÷ 54 = 1 remainder 23 (since 77 = 54 * 1 + 23).\n   - Replace 77 with 54 and 54 with 23, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 54 by 23 and find the remainder.\n     - 54 ÷ 23 = 2 remainder 8 (since 54 = 23 * 2 + 8).\n   - Replace 54 with 23 and 23 with 8, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 23 by 8 and find the remainder.\n     - 23 ÷ 8 = 2 remainder 7 (since 23 = 8 * 2 + 7).\n   - Replace 23 with 8 and 8 with 7, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 8 by 7 and find the remainder.\n     - 8 ÷ 7 = 1 remainder 1 (since 8 = 7 * 1 + 1).\n   - Replace 8 with 7 and 7 with 1, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 7 by 1 and find the remainder.\n     - 7 ÷ 1 = 7 remainder 0 (since 7 = 1 * 7 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching a remainder of zero is 1.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 963 and 208 is 1.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1>>>"
