    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 26 and 760, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of GCD**: The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization Method**:\n   - **Prime Factorization of 26**: \n     - 26 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 26 ÷ 2 = 13, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 26 is 2 × 13.\n   \n   - **Prime Factorization of 760**:\n     - 760 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 760 ÷ 2 = 380\n     - 380 is also even, so divide by 2 again.\n     - 380 ÷ 2 = 190\n     - 190 is even, so divide by 2 once more.\n     - 190 ÷ 2 = 95\n     - 95 is not even, but it ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.\n     - 95 ÷ 5 = 19, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 760 is 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 19 or 2^3 × 5 × 19.\n\n3. **Identify Common Factors**:\n   - From the prime factorizations:\n     - 26 = 2 × 13\n     - 760 = 2^3 × 5 × 19\n   - The common factor between 26 and 760 is 2.\n\n4. **Determine the GCD**:\n   - The GCD is the product of all the common prime factors raised to their lowest power.\n   - The only common prime factor is 2, and it appears as 2^1 in the factorization of 26 and 2^3 in the factorization of 760.\n   - Therefore, the GCD is 2^1 = 2.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The greatest common divisor of 26 and 760 is 2.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
