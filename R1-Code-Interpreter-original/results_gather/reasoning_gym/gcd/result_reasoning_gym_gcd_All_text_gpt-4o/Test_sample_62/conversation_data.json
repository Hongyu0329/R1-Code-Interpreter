    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 128 and 844, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 128 and 844.\n   - Divide 844 by 128 and find the remainder.\n     - 844 ÷ 128 = 6 with a remainder of 76 (since 844 = 128 * 6 + 76).\n   - Replace 844 with 128 and 128 with 76, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 128 by 76 and find the remainder.\n     - 128 ÷ 76 = 1 with a remainder of 52 (since 128 = 76 * 1 + 52).\n   - Replace 128 with 76 and 76 with 52, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 76 by 52 and find the remainder.\n     - 76 ÷ 52 = 1 with a remainder of 24 (since 76 = 52 * 1 + 24).\n   - Replace 76 with 52 and 52 with 24, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 52 by 24 and find the remainder.\n     - 52 ÷ 24 = 2 with a remainder of 4 (since 52 = 24 * 2 + 4).\n   - Replace 52 with 24 and 24 with 4, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 24 by 4 and find the remainder.\n     - 24 ÷ 4 = 6 with a remainder of 0 (since 24 = 4 * 6 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 4, which is the GCD of 128 and 844.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 128 and 844 is 4.\n\nFinal answer: <<<4>>>"
