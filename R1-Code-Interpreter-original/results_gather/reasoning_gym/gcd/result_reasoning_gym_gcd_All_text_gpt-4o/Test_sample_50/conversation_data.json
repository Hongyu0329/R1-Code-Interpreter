    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 788 and 502, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 788 and 502.\n   - Divide 788 by 502 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 788 \\div 502 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 788 - 502 \\times 1 = 286 \\).\n   - Replace 788 with 502 and 502 with 286, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 502 by 286 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 502 \\div 286 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 502 - 286 \\times 1 = 216 \\).\n   - Replace 502 with 286 and 286 with 216, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 286 by 216 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 286 \\div 216 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 286 - 216 \\times 1 = 70 \\).\n   - Replace 286 with 216 and 216 with 70, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 216 by 70 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 216 \\div 70 = 3 \\) with a remainder of \\( 216 - 70 \\times 3 = 6 \\).\n   - Replace 216 with 70 and 70 with 6, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 70 by 6 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 70 \\div 6 = 11 \\) with a remainder of \\( 70 - 6 \\times 11 = 4 \\).\n   - Replace 70 with 6 and 6 with 4, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 6 by 4 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 6 \\div 4 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 6 - 4 \\times 1 = 2 \\).\n   - Replace 6 with 4 and 4 with 2, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 4 by 2 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 4 \\div 2 = 2 \\) with a remainder of \\( 4 - 2 \\times 2 = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 2, which is the GCD of 788 and 502.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 788 and 502 is 2.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2>>>"
