    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 360 and 123, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 360 and 123.\n   - Divide 360 by 123 and find the remainder.\n     - 360 ÷ 123 = 2 with a remainder of 360 - (123 × 2) = 360 - 246 = 114.\n   - Now, take 123 and 114, and repeat the process.\n     - 123 ÷ 114 = 1 with a remainder of 123 - (114 × 1) = 123 - 114 = 9.\n   - Next, take 114 and 9, and repeat the process.\n     - 114 ÷ 9 = 12 with a remainder of 114 - (9 × 12) = 114 - 108 = 6.\n   - Now, take 9 and 6, and repeat the process.\n     - 9 ÷ 6 = 1 with a remainder of 9 - (6 × 1) = 9 - 6 = 3.\n   - Finally, take 6 and 3, and repeat the process.\n     - 6 ÷ 3 = 2 with a remainder of 6 - (3 × 2) = 6 - 6 = 0.\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**: The last non-zero remainder is 3. Therefore, the GCD of 360 and 123 is 3.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The GCD of the numbers 360 and 123 is 3.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
