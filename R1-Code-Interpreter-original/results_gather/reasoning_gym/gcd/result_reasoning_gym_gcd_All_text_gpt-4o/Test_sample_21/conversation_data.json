    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 960 and 736, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 960 and 736. We will divide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n\n3. **First Division**: \n   - Divide 960 by 736.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\(960 \\div 736 = 1\\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\(960 - 736 \\times 1 = 224\\).\n\n4. **Second Division**:\n   - Now, take 736 and divide it by the remainder from the previous step, which is 224.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\(736 \\div 224 = 3\\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\(736 - 224 \\times 3 = 64\\).\n\n5. **Third Division**:\n   - Take 224 and divide it by the remainder from the previous step, which is 64.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\(224 \\div 64 = 3\\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\(224 - 64 \\times 3 = 32\\).\n\n6. **Fourth Division**:\n   - Take 64 and divide it by the remainder from the previous step, which is 32.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\(64 \\div 32 = 2\\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\(64 - 32 \\times 2 = 0\\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The remainder is now zero, and the last non-zero remainder is 32. Therefore, the GCD of 960 and 736 is 32.\n\nThe final answer, enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<32>>>"
