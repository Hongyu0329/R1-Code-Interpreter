    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 642 and 640, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 642 and 640.\n   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - **Step 1**: Divide 642 by 640.\n     - 642 รท 640 = 1 remainder 2.\n   - **Step 2**: Replace 642 with 640 and 640 with 2.\n   - **Step 3**: Divide 640 by 2.\n     - 640 รท 2 = 320 remainder 0.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 2.\n   - Therefore, the GCD of 642 and 640 is 2.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - Enclose the GCD in triple angle brackets as requested.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>"
