    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 224 and 598, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division. Repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 598 and 224.\n   - Divide 598 by 224 and find the remainder.\n     - 598 รท 224 = 2 remainder 150 (since 598 = 224 * 2 + 150).\n   - Replace 598 with 224 and 224 with 150, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 224 by 150 and find the remainder.\n     - 224 รท 150 = 1 remainder 74 (since 224 = 150 * 1 + 74).\n   - Replace 224 with 150 and 150 with 74, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 150 by 74 and find the remainder.\n     - 150 รท 74 = 2 remainder 2 (since 150 = 74 * 2 + 2).\n   - Replace 150 with 74 and 74 with 2, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 74 by 2 and find the remainder.\n     - 74 รท 2 = 37 remainder 0 (since 74 = 2 * 37 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 2, which is the GCD of 224 and 598.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 224 and 598 is 2.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2>>>"
