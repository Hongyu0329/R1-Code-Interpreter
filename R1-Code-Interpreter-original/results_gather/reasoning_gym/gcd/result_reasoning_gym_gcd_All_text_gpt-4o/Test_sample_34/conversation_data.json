    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 320 and 446, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 320 and 446.\n   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - Divide 446 by 320:\n     - 446 ÷ 320 = 1 remainder 126\n     - So, 446 = 320 × 1 + 126\n   - Now, take 320 and 126:\n     - Divide 320 by 126:\n     - 320 ÷ 126 = 2 remainder 68\n     - So, 320 = 126 × 2 + 68\n   - Now, take 126 and 68:\n     - Divide 126 by 68:\n     - 126 ÷ 68 = 1 remainder 58\n     - So, 126 = 68 × 1 + 58\n   - Now, take 68 and 58:\n     - Divide 68 by 58:\n     - 68 ÷ 58 = 1 remainder 10\n     - So, 68 = 58 × 1 + 10\n   - Now, take 58 and 10:\n     - Divide 58 by 10:\n     - 58 ÷ 10 = 5 remainder 8\n     - So, 58 = 10 × 5 + 8\n   - Now, take 10 and 8:\n     - Divide 10 by 8:\n     - 10 ÷ 8 = 1 remainder 2\n     - So, 10 = 8 × 1 + 2\n   - Now, take 8 and 2:\n     - Divide 8 by 2:\n     - 8 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 0\n     - So, 8 = 2 × 4 + 0\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The last non-zero remainder is 2, which is the GCD of 320 and 446.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 320 and 446 is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
