    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 164 and 153, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder of the division. Repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 164 and 153.\n   - Divide 164 by 153 and find the remainder:\n     - 164 ÷ 153 = 1 remainder 11 (since 164 = 153 × 1 + 11).\n   - Replace 164 with 153 and 153 with 11, and repeat the process:\n     - 153 ÷ 11 = 13 remainder 10 (since 153 = 11 × 13 + 10).\n   - Replace 153 with 11 and 11 with 10, and repeat the process:\n     - 11 ÷ 10 = 1 remainder 1 (since 11 = 10 × 1 + 1).\n   - Replace 11 with 10 and 10 with 1, and repeat the process:\n     - 10 ÷ 1 = 10 remainder 0 (since 10 = 1 × 10 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching a remainder of zero is 1. Therefore, the GCD of 164 and 153 is 1.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of 164 and 153 is 1, which means they are coprime (they have no common divisors other than 1).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
