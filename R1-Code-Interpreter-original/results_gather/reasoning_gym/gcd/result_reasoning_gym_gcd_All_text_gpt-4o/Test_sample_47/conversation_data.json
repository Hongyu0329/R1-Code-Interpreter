    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 159 and 68, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 159 and 68.\n   - Divide 159 by 68 and find the remainder.\n     - 159 รท 68 = 2 remainder 23 (since 159 = 68 * 2 + 23).\n   - Now, take the divisor (68) and the remainder (23) and apply the algorithm again.\n   - Divide 68 by 23 and find the remainder.\n     - 68 รท 23 = 2 remainder 22 (since 68 = 23 * 2 + 22).\n   - Now, take the divisor (23) and the remainder (22) and apply the algorithm again.\n   - Divide 23 by 22 and find the remainder.\n     - 23 รท 22 = 1 remainder 1 (since 23 = 22 * 1 + 1).\n   - Now, take the divisor (22) and the remainder (1) and apply the algorithm again.\n   - Divide 22 by 1 and find the remainder.\n     - 22 รท 1 = 22 remainder 0 (since 22 = 1 * 22 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**: The last non-zero remainder is 1. Therefore, the GCD of 159 and 68 is 1.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The GCD of 159 and 68 is 1, which means they are coprime (they have no common divisors other than 1).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
