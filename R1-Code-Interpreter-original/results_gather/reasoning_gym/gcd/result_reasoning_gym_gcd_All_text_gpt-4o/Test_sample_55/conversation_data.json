    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 756 and 194, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 756 and 194. We will divide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n\n3. **First Division**: \n   - Divide 756 by 194.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 756 \\div 194 = 3 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 756 - (194 \\times 3) = 756 - 582 = 174 \\).\n\n4. **Second Division**:\n   - Now, take the previous divisor (194) and the remainder (174) and apply the Euclidean algorithm again.\n   - Divide 194 by 174.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 194 \\div 174 = 1 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 194 - (174 \\times 1) = 194 - 174 = 20 \\).\n\n5. **Third Division**:\n   - Now, take the previous divisor (174) and the remainder (20) and apply the Euclidean algorithm again.\n   - Divide 174 by 20.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 174 \\div 20 = 8 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 174 - (20 \\times 8) = 174 - 160 = 14 \\).\n\n6. **Fourth Division**:\n   - Now, take the previous divisor (20) and the remainder (14) and apply the Euclidean algorithm again.\n   - Divide 20 by 14.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 20 \\div 14 = 1 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 20 - (14 \\times 1) = 20 - 14 = 6 \\).\n\n7. **Fifth Division**:\n   - Now, take the previous divisor (14) and the remainder (6) and apply the Euclidean algorithm again.\n   - Divide 14 by 6.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 14 \\div 6 = 2 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 14 - (6 \\times 2) = 14 - 12 = 2 \\).\n\n8. **Sixth Division**:\n   - Now, take the previous divisor (6) and the remainder (2) and apply the Euclidean algorithm again.\n   - Divide 6 by 2.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 6 \\div 2 = 3 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 6 - (2 \\times 3) = 6 - 6 = 0 \\).\n\n9. **Conclusion**: The last non-zero remainder is 2. Therefore, the GCD of 756 and 194 is 2.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
