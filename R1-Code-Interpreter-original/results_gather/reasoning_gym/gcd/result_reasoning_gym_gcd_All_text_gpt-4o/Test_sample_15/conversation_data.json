    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 525 and 396, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 525 and 396. We will divide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n\n3. **First Division**: \n   - Divide 525 by 396.\n   - 525 รท 396 = 1 with a remainder of 129 (since 525 - 396 = 129).\n\n4. **Second Division**: \n   - Now, take the previous divisor (396) and divide it by the remainder (129).\n   - 396 รท 129 = 3 with a remainder of 9 (since 396 - 3*129 = 9).\n\n5. **Third Division**: \n   - Take the previous divisor (129) and divide it by the remainder (9).\n   - 129 รท 9 = 14 with a remainder of 3 (since 129 - 14*9 = 3).\n\n6. **Fourth Division**: \n   - Take the previous divisor (9) and divide it by the remainder (3).\n   - 9 รท 3 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: When the remainder becomes 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD. In this case, the last non-zero remainder is 3.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 525 and 396 is 3.\n\nFinal answer: <<<3>>>"
