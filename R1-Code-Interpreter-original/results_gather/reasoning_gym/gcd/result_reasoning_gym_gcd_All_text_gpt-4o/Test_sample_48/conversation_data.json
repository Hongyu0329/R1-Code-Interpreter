    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 378 and 374, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 378 and 374.\n   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - Divide 378 by 374:\n     - 378 รท 374 = 1 remainder 4 (since 378 - 374 = 4)\n   - Now, take 374 and 4:\n     - Divide 374 by 4:\n     - 374 รท 4 = 93 remainder 2 (since 374 - 372 = 2)\n   - Now, take 4 and 2:\n     - Divide 4 by 2:\n     - 4 รท 2 = 2 remainder 0\n\n4. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 2, which is the GCD of 378 and 374.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of 378 and 374 is 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
