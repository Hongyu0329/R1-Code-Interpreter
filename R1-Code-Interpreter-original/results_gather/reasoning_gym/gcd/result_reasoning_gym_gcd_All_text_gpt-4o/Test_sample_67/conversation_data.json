    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 390 and 205, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 390 and 205.\n   - Divide 390 by 205 and find the remainder.\n     - 390 ÷ 205 = 1 with a remainder of 185 (since 390 - 205 × 1 = 185).\n   - Replace 390 with 205 and 205 with 185, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 205 by 185 and find the remainder.\n     - 205 ÷ 185 = 1 with a remainder of 20 (since 205 - 185 × 1 = 20).\n   - Replace 205 with 185 and 185 with 20, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 185 by 20 and find the remainder.\n     - 185 ÷ 20 = 9 with a remainder of 5 (since 185 - 20 × 9 = 5).\n   - Replace 185 with 20 and 20 with 5, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 20 by 5 and find the remainder.\n     - 20 ÷ 5 = 4 with a remainder of 0 (since 20 - 5 × 4 = 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 5, which is the GCD of 390 and 205.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 390 and 205 is 5.\n\nFinal answer: <<<5>>>"
