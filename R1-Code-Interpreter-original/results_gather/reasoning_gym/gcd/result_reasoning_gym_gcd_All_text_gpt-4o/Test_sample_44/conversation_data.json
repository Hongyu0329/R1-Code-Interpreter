    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 55 and 429, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 429 and 55.\n   - Divide 429 by 55 and find the remainder.\n     - 429 ÷ 55 = 7 with a remainder of 44 (since 429 = 55 × 7 + 44).\n   - Replace 429 with 55 and 55 with the remainder 44, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 55 by 44 and find the remainder.\n     - 55 ÷ 44 = 1 with a remainder of 11 (since 55 = 44 × 1 + 11).\n   - Replace 55 with 44 and 44 with the remainder 11, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 44 by 11 and find the remainder.\n     - 44 ÷ 11 = 4 with a remainder of 0 (since 44 = 11 × 4 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**: The last non-zero remainder is 11, which is the GCD of 55 and 429.\n\n4. **Verify the Result**: To ensure the correctness, check that 11 divides both 55 and 429 without leaving a remainder:\n   - 55 ÷ 11 = 5 (exact division)\n   - 429 ÷ 11 = 39 (exact division)\n\nSince 11 divides both numbers exactly, it confirms that 11 is indeed the GCD.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 55 and 429 is:\n\n<<<11>>>"
