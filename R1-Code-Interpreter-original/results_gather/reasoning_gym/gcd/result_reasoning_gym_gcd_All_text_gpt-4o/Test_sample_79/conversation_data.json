    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 944 and 966, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 944 and 966. Identify which is larger. In this case, 966 is larger than 944.\n\n3. **First Division**: Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - 966 divided by 944 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 966 - 944 = 22.\n\n4. **Second Step**: Replace the larger number with the smaller number (944) and the smaller number with the remainder (22) from the previous division.\n\n5. **Second Division**: Divide 944 by 22.\n   - 944 divided by 22 gives a quotient of 42 and a remainder of 944 - (22 * 42) = 20.\n\n6. **Third Step**: Replace 944 with 22 and 22 with 20.\n\n7. **Third Division**: Divide 22 by 20.\n   - 22 divided by 20 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 22 - 20 = 2.\n\n8. **Fourth Step**: Replace 22 with 20 and 20 with 2.\n\n9. **Fourth Division**: Divide 20 by 2.\n   - 20 divided by 2 gives a quotient of 10 and a remainder of 20 - (2 * 10) = 0.\n\n10. **Conclusion**: Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD. In this case, the last non-zero remainder is 2.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 944 and 966 is 2.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2>>>"
