    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 410 and 864, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 410 and 864. We will divide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n\n3. **First Division**: Divide 864 by 410.\n   - 864 รท 410 = 2 with a remainder of 44 (since 864 - 2*410 = 44).\n\n4. **Second Step**: Now, take the remainder (44) and divide the previous divisor (410) by this remainder.\n   - 410 รท 44 = 9 with a remainder of 14 (since 410 - 9*44 = 14).\n\n5. **Third Step**: Take the new remainder (14) and divide the previous remainder (44) by this new remainder.\n   - 44 รท 14 = 3 with a remainder of 2 (since 44 - 3*14 = 2).\n\n6. **Fourth Step**: Take the new remainder (2) and divide the previous remainder (14) by this new remainder.\n   - 14 รท 2 = 7 with a remainder of 0 (since 14 - 7*2 = 0).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The remainder is now 0, and the last non-zero remainder is 2. Therefore, the GCD of 410 and 864 is 2.\n\nThe final answer, enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
