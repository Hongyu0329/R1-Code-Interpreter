    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 99 and 308, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 99 and 308.\n   - Divide 308 by 99 and find the remainder.\n     - 308 รท 99 = 3 with a remainder of 11 (since 308 = 99 * 3 + 11).\n   - Replace 308 with 99 and 99 with 11, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 99 by 11.\n     - 99 รท 11 = 9 with a remainder of 0 (since 99 = 11 * 9 + 0).\n   - Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is 11.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of 99 and 308 is the last non-zero remainder, which is 11.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 99 and 308 is:\n\n<<<11>>>"
