    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 561 and 60, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 561 and 60.\n   - Divide 561 by 60 and find the remainder.\n     - 561 รท 60 = 9 with a remainder of 21 (since 561 = 60 * 9 + 21).\n   - Replace 561 with 60 and 60 with 21, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 60 by 21 and find the remainder.\n     - 60 รท 21 = 2 with a remainder of 18 (since 60 = 21 * 2 + 18).\n   - Replace 60 with 21 and 21 with 18, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 21 by 18 and find the remainder.\n     - 21 รท 18 = 1 with a remainder of 3 (since 21 = 18 * 1 + 3).\n   - Replace 21 with 18 and 18 with 3, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 18 by 3 and find the remainder.\n     - 18 รท 3 = 6 with a remainder of 0 (since 18 = 3 * 6 + 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 3, which is the GCD of 561 and 60.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of 561 and 60 is 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
