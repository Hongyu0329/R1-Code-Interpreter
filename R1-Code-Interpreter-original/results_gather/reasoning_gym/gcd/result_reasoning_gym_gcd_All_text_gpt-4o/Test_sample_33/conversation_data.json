    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 455 and 470, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 455 and 470.\n   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - **Step 1**: Divide 470 by 455.\n     - 470 รท 455 = 1 remainder 15 (since 470 - 455 = 15).\n   - **Step 2**: Now, take 455 and 15.\n     - Divide 455 by 15.\n     - 455 รท 15 = 30 remainder 5 (since 455 - 450 = 5, where 450 is 15 ร 30).\n   - **Step 3**: Now, take 15 and 5.\n     - Divide 15 by 5.\n     - 15 รท 5 = 3 remainder 0.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 5.\n   - Therefore, the GCD of 455 and 470 is 5.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - Enclose the GCD in triple angle brackets as requested.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<5>>>."
