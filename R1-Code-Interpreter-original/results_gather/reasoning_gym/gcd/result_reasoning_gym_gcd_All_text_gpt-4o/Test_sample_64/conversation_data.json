    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 838 and 350, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 838 and 350.\n   - Divide 838 by 350 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 838 \\div 350 = 2 \\) with a remainder of \\( 838 - 2 \\times 350 = 838 - 700 = 138 \\).\n   - Now, take 350 and 138, and repeat the process.\n     - \\( 350 \\div 138 = 2 \\) with a remainder of \\( 350 - 2 \\times 138 = 350 - 276 = 74 \\).\n   - Next, take 138 and 74.\n     - \\( 138 \\div 74 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 138 - 1 \\times 74 = 138 - 74 = 64 \\).\n   - Continue with 74 and 64.\n     - \\( 74 \\div 64 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 74 - 1 \\times 64 = 74 - 64 = 10 \\).\n   - Now, take 64 and 10.\n     - \\( 64 \\div 10 = 6 \\) with a remainder of \\( 64 - 6 \\times 10 = 64 - 60 = 4 \\).\n   - Finally, take 10 and 4.\n     - \\( 10 \\div 4 = 2 \\) with a remainder of \\( 10 - 2 \\times 4 = 10 - 8 = 2 \\).\n   - Continue with 4 and 2.\n     - \\( 4 \\div 2 = 2 \\) with a remainder of \\( 4 - 2 \\times 2 = 4 - 4 = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 2, which is the GCD of 838 and 350.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 838 and 350 is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
