    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 9 and 771, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of GCD**: The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **List the Factors**:\n   - Factors of 9: 1, 3, 9\n   - Factors of 771: To find the factors of 771, we can start by checking divisibility by smaller prime numbers:\n     - 771 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n     - Sum of digits of 771 is 7 + 7 + 1 = 15, which is divisible by 3. So, 771 is divisible by 3.\n     - Dividing 771 by 3 gives 257.\n     - 257 is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13 (as it doesn't meet the divisibility rules for these primes).\n     - 257 is a prime number.\n\n3. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - Prime factorization of 9: \\(3^2\\)\n   - Prime factorization of 771: \\(3 \\times 257\\)\n\n4. **Identify Common Factors**:\n   - The common factor between 9 and 771 is 3.\n\n5. **Determine the GCD**:\n   - The greatest common factor from the common factors is 3.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 9 and 771 is 3.\n\nFinal answer: <<<3>>>"
