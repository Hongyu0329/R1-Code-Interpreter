    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 228 and 473, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 228 and 473. Identify which is larger. In this case, 473 is larger than 228.\n\n3. **First Division**: Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - \\( 473 \\div 228 = 2 \\) with a remainder of \\( 473 - 2 \\times 228 = 473 - 456 = 17 \\).\n\n4. **Second Step**: Replace the larger number with the smaller number (228) and the smaller number with the remainder (17) from the previous step.\n\n5. **Second Division**: Divide the new larger number by the new smaller number.\n   - \\( 228 \\div 17 = 13 \\) with a remainder of \\( 228 - 13 \\times 17 = 228 - 221 = 7 \\).\n\n6. **Third Step**: Replace the larger number with the smaller number (17) and the smaller number with the remainder (7).\n\n7. **Third Division**: Divide the new larger number by the new smaller number.\n   - \\( 17 \\div 7 = 2 \\) with a remainder of \\( 17 - 2 \\times 7 = 17 - 14 = 3 \\).\n\n8. **Fourth Step**: Replace the larger number with the smaller number (7) and the smaller number with the remainder (3).\n\n9. **Fourth Division**: Divide the new larger number by the new smaller number.\n   - \\( 7 \\div 3 = 2 \\) with a remainder of \\( 7 - 2 \\times 3 = 7 - 6 = 1 \\).\n\n10. **Fifth Step**: Replace the larger number with the smaller number (3) and the smaller number with the remainder (1).\n\n11. **Fifth Division**: Divide the new larger number by the new smaller number.\n    - \\( 3 \\div 1 = 3 \\) with a remainder of \\( 3 - 3 \\times 1 = 3 - 3 = 0 \\).\n\n12. **Conclusion**: The remainder is now zero, and the last non-zero remainder is 1. Therefore, the GCD of 228 and 473 is 1.\n\nThe GCD of 228 and 473 is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
