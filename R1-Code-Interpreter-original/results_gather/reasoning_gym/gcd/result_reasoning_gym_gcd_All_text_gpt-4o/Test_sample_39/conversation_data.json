    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 270 and 89, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder of the division. Repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the numbers 270 and 89.\n   - Divide 270 by 89, which gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 270 - 3*89 = 3.\n   - Replace 270 with 89 and 89 with 3, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 89 by 3, which gives a quotient of 29 and a remainder of 89 - 29*3 = 2.\n   - Replace 89 with 3 and 3 with 2, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 3 by 2, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 3 - 1*2 = 1.\n   - Replace 3 with 2 and 2 with 1, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 2 by 1, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 2 - 2*1 = 0.\n   - Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder in the Euclidean algorithm is 1.\n   - Therefore, the GCD of 270 and 89 is 1.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
