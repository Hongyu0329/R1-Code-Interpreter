    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 980 and 142, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder of the division. \n   - Repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the numbers 980 and 142.\n   - Divide 980 by 142 and find the remainder:\n     - \\( 980 \\div 142 = 6 \\) remainder \\( 112 \\).\n   - Replace 980 with 142 and 142 with 112, and repeat the process:\n     - \\( 142 \\div 112 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 30 \\).\n   - Replace 142 with 112 and 112 with 30, and repeat the process:\n     - \\( 112 \\div 30 = 3 \\) remainder \\( 22 \\).\n   - Replace 112 with 30 and 30 with 22, and repeat the process:\n     - \\( 30 \\div 22 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 8 \\).\n   - Replace 30 with 22 and 22 with 8, and repeat the process:\n     - \\( 22 \\div 8 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 6 \\).\n   - Replace 22 with 8 and 8 with 6, and repeat the process:\n     - \\( 8 \\div 6 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 2 \\).\n   - Replace 8 with 6 and 6 with 2, and repeat the process:\n     - \\( 6 \\div 2 = 3 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before the remainder becomes zero is 2. Therefore, the GCD of 980 and 142 is 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of 980 and 142 is 2.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
