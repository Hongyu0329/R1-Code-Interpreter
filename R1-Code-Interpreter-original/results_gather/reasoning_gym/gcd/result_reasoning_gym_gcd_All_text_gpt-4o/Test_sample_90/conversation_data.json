    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 748 and 376, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 748 and 376. We will divide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n\n3. **First Division**: \n   - Divide 748 by 376.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 748 \\div 376 = 1 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 748 - 376 \\times 1 = 372 \\).\n\n4. **Second Division**:\n   - Now, take 376 and divide it by the remainder from the previous step, which is 372.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 376 \\div 372 = 1 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 376 - 372 \\times 1 = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Third Division**:\n   - Now, take 372 and divide it by the remainder from the previous step, which is 4.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 372 \\div 4 = 93 \\) (integer division).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 372 - 4 \\times 93 = 0 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The remainder is now zero, which means the last non-zero remainder is the GCD. In this case, the last non-zero remainder is 4.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 748 and 376 is 4.\n\nFinal answer: <<<4>>>"
