    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 272 and 236, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 272 and 236.\n   - Divide 272 by 236 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 272 \\div 236 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 272 - 236 \\times 1 = 36 \\).\n   - Now, take 236 and 36, and repeat the process.\n     - \\( 236 \\div 36 = 6 \\) with a remainder of \\( 236 - 36 \\times 6 = 20 \\).\n   - Next, take 36 and 20.\n     - \\( 36 \\div 20 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 36 - 20 \\times 1 = 16 \\).\n   - Now, take 20 and 16.\n     - \\( 20 \\div 16 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 20 - 16 \\times 1 = 4 \\).\n   - Finally, take 16 and 4.\n     - \\( 16 \\div 4 = 4 \\) with a remainder of \\( 16 - 4 \\times 4 = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 4. Therefore, the GCD of 272 and 236 is 4.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of the numbers 272 and 236 is 4.\n\nThe final answer, enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
