    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 228 and 849, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 228 and 849. We will divide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n\n3. **First Division**: Divide 849 by 228.\n   - 849 ÷ 228 = 3 with a remainder of 165 (since 849 = 228 * 3 + 165).\n\n4. **Second Division**: Now, take the remainder 165 and divide the previous divisor 228 by 165.\n   - 228 ÷ 165 = 1 with a remainder of 63 (since 228 = 165 * 1 + 63).\n\n5. **Third Division**: Next, take the remainder 63 and divide the previous divisor 165 by 63.\n   - 165 ÷ 63 = 2 with a remainder of 39 (since 165 = 63 * 2 + 39).\n\n6. **Fourth Division**: Now, take the remainder 39 and divide the previous divisor 63 by 39.\n   - 63 ÷ 39 = 1 with a remainder of 24 (since 63 = 39 * 1 + 24).\n\n7. **Fifth Division**: Next, take the remainder 24 and divide the previous divisor 39 by 24.\n   - 39 ÷ 24 = 1 with a remainder of 15 (since 39 = 24 * 1 + 15).\n\n8. **Sixth Division**: Now, take the remainder 15 and divide the previous divisor 24 by 15.\n   - 24 ÷ 15 = 1 with a remainder of 9 (since 24 = 15 * 1 + 9).\n\n9. **Seventh Division**: Next, take the remainder 9 and divide the previous divisor 15 by 9.\n   - 15 ÷ 9 = 1 with a remainder of 6 (since 15 = 9 * 1 + 6).\n\n10. **Eighth Division**: Now, take the remainder 6 and divide the previous divisor 9 by 6.\n    - 9 ÷ 6 = 1 with a remainder of 3 (since 9 = 6 * 1 + 3).\n\n11. **Ninth Division**: Finally, take the remainder 3 and divide the previous divisor 6 by 3.\n    - 6 ÷ 3 = 2 with a remainder of 0 (since 6 = 3 * 2 + 0).\n\n12. **Conclusion**: The last non-zero remainder is 3. Therefore, the GCD of 228 and 849 is 3.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
