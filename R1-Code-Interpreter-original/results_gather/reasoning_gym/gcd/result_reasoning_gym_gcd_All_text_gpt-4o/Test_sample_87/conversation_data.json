    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 112 and 82, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 112 and 82.\n   - Divide 112 by 82 and find the remainder.\n     - 112 ÷ 82 = 1 with a remainder of 30 (since 112 - 82 = 30).\n   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n     - Now, use 82 and 30.\n   - Divide 82 by 30 and find the remainder.\n     - 82 ÷ 30 = 2 with a remainder of 22 (since 82 - 60 = 22).\n   - Replace 82 with 30 and 30 with 22.\n   - Divide 30 by 22 and find the remainder.\n     - 30 ÷ 22 = 1 with a remainder of 8 (since 30 - 22 = 8).\n   - Replace 30 with 22 and 22 with 8.\n   - Divide 22 by 8 and find the remainder.\n     - 22 ÷ 8 = 2 with a remainder of 6 (since 22 - 16 = 6).\n   - Replace 22 with 8 and 8 with 6.\n   - Divide 8 by 6 and find the remainder.\n     - 8 ÷ 6 = 1 with a remainder of 2 (since 8 - 6 = 2).\n   - Replace 8 with 6 and 6 with 2.\n   - Divide 6 by 2 and find the remainder.\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3 with a remainder of 0 (since 6 - 6 = 0).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 2, which is the GCD of 112 and 82.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 112 and 82 is 2.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2>>>"
