    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 758 and 310, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division, and repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 758 and 310.\n   - Divide 758 by 310 and find the remainder:\n     - \\( 758 \\div 310 = 2 \\) with a remainder of \\( 758 - 2 \\times 310 = 758 - 620 = 138 \\).\n   - Replace 758 with 310 and 310 with 138, and repeat the process:\n     - Divide 310 by 138:\n       - \\( 310 \\div 138 = 2 \\) with a remainder of \\( 310 - 2 \\times 138 = 310 - 276 = 34 \\).\n   - Replace 310 with 138 and 138 with 34, and repeat the process:\n     - Divide 138 by 34:\n       - \\( 138 \\div 34 = 4 \\) with a remainder of \\( 138 - 4 \\times 34 = 138 - 136 = 2 \\).\n   - Replace 138 with 34 and 34 with 2, and repeat the process:\n     - Divide 34 by 2:\n       - \\( 34 \\div 2 = 17 \\) with a remainder of \\( 34 - 17 \\times 2 = 34 - 34 = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder before reaching zero is 2. Therefore, the GCD of 758 and 310 is 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of the numbers 758 and 310 is 2.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
