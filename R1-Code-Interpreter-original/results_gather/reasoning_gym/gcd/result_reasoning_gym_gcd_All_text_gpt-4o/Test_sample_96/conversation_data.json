    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 416 and 524, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: \n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. \n   - The algorithm involves repeated division: divide the larger number by the smaller number, then replace the larger number with the remainder of this division. Repeat this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 416 and 524.\n   - Divide 524 by 416 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 524 \\div 416 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 108 \\).\n   - Replace 524 with 416 and 416 with 108, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 416 by 108.\n     - \\( 416 \\div 108 = 3 \\) remainder \\( 92 \\).\n   - Replace 416 with 108 and 108 with 92, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 108 by 92.\n     - \\( 108 \\div 92 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 16 \\).\n   - Replace 108 with 92 and 92 with 16, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 92 by 16.\n     - \\( 92 \\div 16 = 5 \\) remainder \\( 12 \\).\n   - Replace 92 with 16 and 16 with 12, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 16 by 12.\n     - \\( 16 \\div 12 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 4 \\).\n   - Replace 16 with 12 and 12 with 4, and repeat the process.\n   - Divide 12 by 4.\n     - \\( 12 \\div 4 = 3 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**:\n   - The last non-zero remainder is 4. Therefore, the GCD of 416 and 524 is 4.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The GCD of the numbers 416 and 524 is 4.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
