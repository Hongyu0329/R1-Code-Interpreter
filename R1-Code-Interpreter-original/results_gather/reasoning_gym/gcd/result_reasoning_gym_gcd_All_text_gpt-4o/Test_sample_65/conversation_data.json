    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 440 and 826, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 440 and 826.\n   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.\n   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.\n   - Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - **First Division**: Divide 826 by 440.\n     - 826 ÷ 440 = 1 with a remainder of 826 - (1 × 440) = 386.\n   - **Second Division**: Now, divide 440 by 386.\n     - 440 ÷ 386 = 1 with a remainder of 440 - (1 × 386) = 54.\n   - **Third Division**: Now, divide 386 by 54.\n     - 386 ÷ 54 = 7 with a remainder of 386 - (7 × 54) = 8.\n   - **Fourth Division**: Now, divide 54 by 8.\n     - 54 ÷ 8 = 6 with a remainder of 54 - (6 × 8) = 6.\n   - **Fifth Division**: Now, divide 8 by 6.\n     - 8 ÷ 6 = 1 with a remainder of 8 - (1 × 6) = 2.\n   - **Sixth Division**: Now, divide 6 by 2.\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3 with a remainder of 6 - (3 × 2) = 0.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The last non-zero remainder is 2, which is the GCD of 440 and 826.\n\nTherefore, the Greatest Common Divisor of 440 and 826 is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
