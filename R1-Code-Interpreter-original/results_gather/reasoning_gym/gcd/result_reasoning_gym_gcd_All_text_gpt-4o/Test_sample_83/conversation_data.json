    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 773 and 894, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the process:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Initial Step**: Start with the two numbers, 773 and 894. We will perform the division of the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.\n\n3. **First Division**: Divide 894 by 773.\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 894 \\div 773 \\approx 1 \\).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 894 - 773 \\times 1 = 121 \\).\n\n4. **Second Division**: Now, take the previous divisor (773) and divide it by the remainder (121).\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 773 \\div 121 \\approx 6 \\).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 773 - 121 \\times 6 = 47 \\).\n\n5. **Third Division**: Take the previous divisor (121) and divide it by the new remainder (47).\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 121 \\div 47 \\approx 2 \\).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 121 - 47 \\times 2 = 27 \\).\n\n6. **Fourth Division**: Take the previous divisor (47) and divide it by the new remainder (27).\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 47 \\div 27 \\approx 1 \\).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 47 - 27 \\times 1 = 20 \\).\n\n7. **Fifth Division**: Take the previous divisor (27) and divide it by the new remainder (20).\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 27 \\div 20 \\approx 1 \\).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 27 - 20 \\times 1 = 7 \\).\n\n8. **Sixth Division**: Take the previous divisor (20) and divide it by the new remainder (7).\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 20 \\div 7 \\approx 2 \\).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 20 - 7 \\times 2 = 6 \\).\n\n9. **Seventh Division**: Take the previous divisor (7) and divide it by the new remainder (6).\n   - Calculate the quotient: \\( 7 \\div 6 \\approx 1 \\).\n   - Calculate the remainder: \\( 7 - 6 \\times 1 = 1 \\).\n\n10. **Eighth Division**: Take the previous divisor (6) and divide it by the new remainder (1).\n    - Calculate the quotient: \\( 6 \\div 1 = 6 \\).\n    - Calculate the remainder: \\( 6 - 1 \\times 6 = 0 \\).\n\n11. **Conclusion**: The last non-zero remainder is 1, which means the GCD of 773 and 894 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 773 and 894 is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
