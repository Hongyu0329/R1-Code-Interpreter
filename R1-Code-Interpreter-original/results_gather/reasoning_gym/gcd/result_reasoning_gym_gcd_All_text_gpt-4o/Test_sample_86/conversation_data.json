    "To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numbers 320 and 102, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the two numbers: 320 and 102.\n   - Divide 320 by 102 and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 320 \\div 102 = 3 \\) remainder \\( 320 - 3 \\times 102 = 320 - 306 = 14 \\).\n   - Now, take 102 and 14, and repeat the process.\n     - \\( 102 \\div 14 = 7 \\) remainder \\( 102 - 7 \\times 14 = 102 - 98 = 4 \\).\n   - Next, take 14 and 4, and repeat the process.\n     - \\( 14 \\div 4 = 3 \\) remainder \\( 14 - 3 \\times 4 = 14 - 12 = 2 \\).\n   - Finally, take 4 and 2, and repeat the process.\n     - \\( 4 \\div 2 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 4 - 2 \\times 2 = 4 - 4 = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Identify the GCD**: The last non-zero remainder is 2. Therefore, the GCD of 320 and 102 is 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The GCD of the numbers 320 and 102 is 2.\n\nThe final answer, enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
