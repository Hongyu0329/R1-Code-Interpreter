    "To transform the word \"LASS\" to \"PORT\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: LASS**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"PORT\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: LASS to LOSS**\n   - Change the second letter 'A' to 'O': LASS -> LOSS\n   - LOSS is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: LOSS to LOPS**\n   - Change the third letter 'S' to 'P': LOSS -> LOPS\n   - LOPS is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: LOPS to LOOT**\n   - Change the fourth letter 'S' to 'T': LOPS -> LOOT\n   - LOOT is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation: LOOT to POOT**\n   - Change the first letter 'L' to 'P': LOOT -> POOT\n   - POOT is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\n6. **Re-evaluate the Path:**\n   - Let's try a different approach from LOOT.\n\n7. **Fourth Transformation: LOOT to LOTS**\n   - Change the fourth letter 'T' to 'S': LOOT -> LOTS\n   - LOTS is a valid English word.\n\n8. **Fifth Transformation: LOTS to PORT**\n   - Change the first letter 'L' to 'P': LOTS -> PORT\n   - PORT is the target word and a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"LASS\" to \"PORT\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: LASS, LOSS, LOPS, LOOT, LOTS, PORT.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<LASS, LOSS, LOPS, LOOT, LOTS, PORT>>>"
