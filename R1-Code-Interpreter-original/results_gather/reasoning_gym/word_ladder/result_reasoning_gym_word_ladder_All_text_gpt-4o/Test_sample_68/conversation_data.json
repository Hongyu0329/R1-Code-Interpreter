    "To transform the word \"REGS\" to \"RATE\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word**: REGS\n\n2. **Target Word**: RATE\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - We need to change one letter at a time, ensuring each intermediate word is valid.\n   - Let's start by changing the first letter 'R' to 'R', which remains the same.\n   - Next, change the second letter 'E' to 'A', forming the word \"RAGS\".\n   - \"RAGS\" is a valid English word.\n   - Now, change the third letter 'G' to 'T', forming the word \"RATS\".\n   - \"RATS\" is a valid English word.\n   - Finally, change the last letter 'S' to 'E', forming the word \"RATE\".\n   - \"RATE\" is the target word and is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Sequence of Words**:\n   - REGS -> RAGS -> RATS -> RATE\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word. Therefore, the transformation sequence is complete.\n\nThe final answer, presented as a comma-separated sequence of uppercase letters without spaces, enclosed within triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<REGS,RAGS,RATS,RATE>>>"
