    "To transform the word \"FAVS\" to \"SUDS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word**: FAVS\n2. **Target Word**: SUDS\n\nWe need to change one letter at a time, ensuring each intermediate word is valid. Let's break it down:\n\n- **Step 1**: Change 'FAVS' to 'SAVS'\n  - Change the first letter 'F' to 'S'.\n  - 'SAVS' is not a valid English word, so let's try another approach.\n\n- **Step 1**: Change 'FAVS' to 'FADS'\n  - Change the third letter 'V' to 'D'.\n  - 'FADS' is a valid English word.\n\n- **Step 2**: Change 'FADS' to 'SADS'\n  - Change the first letter 'F' to 'S'.\n  - 'SADS' is a valid English word.\n\n- **Step 3**: Change 'SADS' to 'SUDS'\n  - Change the second letter 'A' to 'U'.\n  - 'SUDS' is a valid English word and matches the target word.\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word. Therefore, the sequence of transformations is:\n\n- FAVS\n- FADS\n- SADS\n- SUDS\n\nThe final answer, as a comma-separated sequence of uppercase letters without spaces, enclosed within triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<FAVS,FADS,SADS,SUDS>>>"
