    "To transform the word \"LESS\" to \"DANG\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **LESS to LASS**: Change the second letter 'E' to 'A'. \"LASS\" is a valid English word.\n\n2. **LASS to LAGS**: Change the third letter 'S' to 'G'. \"LAGS\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **LAGS to LING**: Change the second letter 'A' to 'I'. \"LING\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **LING to LANG**: Change the third letter 'I' to 'A'. \"LANG\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **LANG to DANG**: Change the first letter 'L' to 'D'. \"DANG\" is a valid English word.\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word. Therefore, the sequence of transformations is:\n\nLESS → LASS → LAGS → LING → LANG → DANG\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<LESS, LASS, LAGS, LING, LANG, DANG>>>"
