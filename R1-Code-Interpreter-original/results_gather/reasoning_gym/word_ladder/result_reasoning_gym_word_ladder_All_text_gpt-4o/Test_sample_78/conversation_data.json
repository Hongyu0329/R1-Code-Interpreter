    "To transform the word \"VEND\" to \"HAST\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: VEND**\n\n2. **First Transformation:**\n   - Change 'V' to 'B' to form the word \"BEND\".\n   - \"BEND\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation:**\n   - Change 'B' to 'S' to form the word \"SEND\".\n   - \"SEND\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation:**\n   - Change 'E' to 'A' to form the word \"SAND\".\n   - \"SAND\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation:**\n   - Change 'N' to 'S' to form the word \"SAST\".\n   - \"SAST\" is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n1. **Starting Word: VEND**\n\n2. **First Transformation:**\n   - Change 'V' to 'B' to form the word \"BEND\".\n   - \"BEND\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation:**\n   - Change 'B' to 'L' to form the word \"LEND\".\n   - \"LEND\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation:**\n   - Change 'L' to 'H' to form the word \"HEND\".\n   - \"HEND\" is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. **Starting Word: VEND**\n\n2. **First Transformation:**\n   - Change 'V' to 'S' to form the word \"SEND\".\n   - \"SEND\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation:**\n   - Change 'E' to 'A' to form the word \"SAND\".\n   - \"SAND\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation:**\n   - Change 'S' to 'H' to form the word \"HAND\".\n   - \"HAND\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation:**\n   - Change 'N' to 'S' to form the word \"HAST\".\n   - \"HAST\" is a valid English word.\n\nThus, the sequence of transformations is:\n\n- VEND\n- SEND\n- SAND\n- HAND\n- HAST\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<VEND, SEND, SAND, HAND, HAST>>>"
