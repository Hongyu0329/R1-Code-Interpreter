    "To transform the word \"HYPE\" to \"PUCK\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: HYPE**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"PUCK\".\n   - The first letter 'H' needs to be changed to 'P' to match the first letter of \"PUCK\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: HYPE to PYPE**\n   - Change 'H' to 'P': \"HYPE\" becomes \"PYPE\".\n   - \"PYPE\" is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\n3. **Re-evaluate the Approach:**\n   - Let's try changing the last letter 'E' first, as it might give us more flexibility.\n\n4. **First Valid Transformation: HYPE to HYPE**\n   - Change 'E' to 'K': \"HYPE\" becomes \"HYKE\".\n   - \"HYKE\" is not a valid English word, so let's try another letter.\n\n5. **Try Changing the Second Letter:**\n   - Change 'Y' to 'U': \"HYPE\" becomes \"HUPE\".\n   - \"HUPE\" is not a valid English word, so let's try another letter.\n\n6. **Try Changing the Third Letter:**\n   - Change 'P' to 'C': \"HYPE\" becomes \"HYCE\".\n   - \"HYCE\" is not a valid English word, so let's try another letter.\n\n7. **Re-evaluate the Approach Again:**\n   - Let's try changing the first letter 'H' to 'P' again, but with a different path.\n\n8. **First Valid Transformation: HYPE to TYPE**\n   - Change 'H' to 'T': \"HYPE\" becomes \"TYPE\".\n   - \"TYPE\" is a valid English word.\n\n9. **Second Transformation: TYPE to TAPE**\n   - Change 'Y' to 'A': \"TYPE\" becomes \"TAPE\".\n   - \"TAPE\" is a valid English word.\n\n10. **Third Transformation: TAPE to TALE**\n    - Change 'P' to 'L': \"TAPE\" becomes \"TALE\".\n    - \"TALE\" is a valid English word.\n\n11. **Fourth Transformation: TALE to PALE**\n    - Change 'T' to 'P': \"TALE\" becomes \"PALE\".\n    - \"PALE\" is a valid English word.\n\n12. **Fifth Transformation: PALE to PALL**\n    - Change 'E' to 'L': \"PALE\" becomes \"PALL\".\n    - \"PALL\" is a valid English word.\n\n13. **Sixth Transformation: PALL to PULL**\n    - Change 'A' to 'U': \"PALL\" becomes \"PULL\".\n    - \"PULL\" is a valid English word.\n\n14. **Seventh Transformation: PULL to PUCK**\n    - Change 'L' to 'C': \"PULL\" becomes \"PUCK\".\n    - \"PUCK\" is the target word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is as follows: HYPE, TYPE, TAPE, TALE, PALE, PALL, PULL, PUCK.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<HYPE,TYPE,TAPE,TALE,PALE,PALL,PULL,PUCK>>>"
