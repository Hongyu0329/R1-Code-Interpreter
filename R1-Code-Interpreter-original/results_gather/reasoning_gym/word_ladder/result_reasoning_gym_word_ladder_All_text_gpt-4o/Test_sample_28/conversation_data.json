    "To transform the word \"JADE\" to \"TOSS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Start with \"JADE\":**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"TOSS\".\n   - The first letter of \"JADE\" is 'J', and the first letter of \"TOSS\" is 'T'. We can change 'J' to 'T' to form the word \"TADE\", but \"TADE\" is not a valid English word. So, we need to find another path.\n\n2. **Change 'J' to 'L' to form \"LADE\":**\n   - \"LADE\" is a valid English word.\n   - Now, we have \"LADE\" and need to move towards \"TOSS\".\n\n3. **Change 'L' to 'L' to form \"LADE\":**\n   - We keep \"LADE\" as it is for now.\n\n4. **Change 'A' to 'O' to form \"LODE\":**\n   - \"LODE\" is a valid English word.\n   - Now, we have \"LODE\" and need to move towards \"TOSS\".\n\n5. **Change 'D' to 'S' to form \"LOSE\":**\n   - \"LOSE\" is a valid English word.\n   - Now, we have \"LOSE\" and need to move towards \"TOSS\".\n\n6. **Change 'L' to 'T' to form \"TOSE\":**\n   - \"TOSE\" is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\n7. **Change 'S' to 'S' to form \"LOSE\":**\n   - We keep \"LOSE\" as it is for now.\n\n8. **Change 'E' to 'S' to form \"LOSS\":**\n   - \"LOSS\" is a valid English word.\n   - Now, we have \"LOSS\" and need to move towards \"TOSS\".\n\n9. **Change 'L' to 'T' to form \"TOSS\":**\n   - \"TOSS\" is the target word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"JADE\" to \"TOSS\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: JADE, LADE, LODE, LOSE, LOSS, TOSS.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<JADE, LADE, LODE, LOSE, LOSS, TOSS>>>"
