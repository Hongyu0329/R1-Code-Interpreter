    "To transform the word \"NAGS\" to \"FOPS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word**: NAGS\n\n2. **Target Word**: FOPS\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - We need to change one letter at a time, ensuring each intermediate word is valid.\n   - Let's start by changing the first letter 'N' to 'F'. However, \"FAGS\" is not a valid word, so let's try another approach.\n   - Change the last letter 'S' to 'P': NAGP is not a valid word.\n   - Change the third letter 'G' to 'P': NAPS is a valid word.\n   - Now, we have NAPS. Change the first letter 'N' to 'F': FAPS is not a valid word.\n   - Change the second letter 'A' to 'O': NOPS is a valid word.\n   - Now, we have NOPS. Change the first letter 'N' to 'F': FOPS is a valid word.\n\n4. **Sequence of Words**:\n   - NAGS → NAPS → NOPS → FOPS\n\nEach step involves changing one letter, and each intermediate word is a valid English word.\n\nThe final answer, presented as a comma-separated sequence of uppercase letters without spaces, enclosed within triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<NAGS, NAPS, NOPS, FOPS>>>"
