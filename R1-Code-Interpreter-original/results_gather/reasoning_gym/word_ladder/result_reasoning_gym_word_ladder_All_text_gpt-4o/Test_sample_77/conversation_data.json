    "To transform the word \"GOLF\" to \"REFS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: GOLF**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"REFS\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: GOLF to GULF**\n   - Change the letter 'O' to 'U'. \n   - \"GULF\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: GULF to GULS**\n   - Change the letter 'F' to 'S'.\n   - \"GULS\" is a valid English word (plural of \"GUL\", a Scottish term for a yellow flower).\n\n4. **Third Transformation: GULS to GELS**\n   - Change the letter 'U' to 'E'.\n   - \"GELS\" is a valid English word (plural of \"GEL\").\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation: GELS to REFS**\n   - Change the letter 'G' to 'R'.\n   - \"REFS\" is a valid English word (plural of \"REF\", short for referee).\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"GOLF\" to \"REFS\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: GOLF, GULF, GULS, GELS, REFS.\n\nFinal answer: <<<GOLF, GULF, GULS, GELS, REFS>>>"
