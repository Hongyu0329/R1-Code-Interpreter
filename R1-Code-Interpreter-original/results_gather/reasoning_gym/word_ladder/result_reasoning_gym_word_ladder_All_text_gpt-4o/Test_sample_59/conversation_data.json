    "To transform the word \"REEK\" to \"PUCK\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Start with \"REEK\":**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"PUCK\".\n\n2. **Change 'R' to 'P':**\n   - \"REEK\" to \"PEEK\" (valid word).\n\n3. **Change 'E' to 'U':**\n   - \"PEEK\" to \"PUKE\" (valid word).\n\n4. **Change 'E' to 'C':**\n   - \"PUKE\" to \"PUCK\" (valid word).\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word. The sequence of transformations is as follows:\n\n- REEK\n- PEEK\n- PUKE\n- PUCK\n\nThus, the transformation sequence is complete.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<REEK, PEEK, PUKE, PUCK>>>"
