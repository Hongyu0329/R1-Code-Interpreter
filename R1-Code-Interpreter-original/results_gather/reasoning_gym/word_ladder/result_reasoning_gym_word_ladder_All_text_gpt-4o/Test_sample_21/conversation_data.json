    "To transform the word \"READ\" to \"SHIP\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: READ**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"SHIP\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: READ to ROAD**\n   - Change the letter 'E' to 'O'. \n   - \"ROAD\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: ROAD to LOAD**\n   - Change the letter 'R' to 'L'.\n   - \"LOAD\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: LOAD to LOAN**\n   - Change the letter 'D' to 'N'.\n   - \"LOAN\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation: LOAN to LOIN**\n   - Change the letter 'A' to 'I'.\n   - \"LOIN\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Fifth Transformation: LOIN to LIP**\n   - Change the letter 'O' to 'P'.\n   - \"LIP\" is a valid English word.\n\n7. **Sixth Transformation: LIP to SIP**\n   - Change the letter 'L' to 'S'.\n   - \"SIP\" is a valid English word.\n\n8. **Seventh Transformation: SIP to SHIP**\n   - Change the letter 'I' to 'H'.\n   - \"SHIP\" is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"READ\" to \"SHIP\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: READ, ROAD, LOAD, LOAN, LOIN, LIP, SIP, SHIP.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<READ, ROAD, LOAD, LOAN, LOIN, LIP, SIP, SHIP>>>"
