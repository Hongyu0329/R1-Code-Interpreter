    "To transform the word \"FISC\" to \"SUMS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: FISC**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"SUMS\".\n\n2. **First Transformation:**\n   - Change 'F' to 'D' to form the word \"DISC\".\n   - \"DISC\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation:**\n   - Change 'I' to 'U' to form the word \"DUSK\".\n   - \"DUSK\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation:**\n   - Change 'D' to 'S' to form the word \"SUSK\".\n   - \"SUSK\" is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\n5. **Re-evaluate Second Transformation:**\n   - Instead of changing 'I' to 'U', change 'C' to 'K' to form the word \"DISK\".\n   - \"DISK\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Third Transformation:**\n   - Change 'D' to 'R' to form the word \"RISK\".\n   - \"RISK\" is a valid English word.\n\n7. **Fourth Transformation:**\n   - Change 'R' to 'S' to form the word \"SISK\".\n   - \"SISK\" is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\n8. **Re-evaluate Third Transformation:**\n   - Instead of changing 'D' to 'R', change 'I' to 'U' to form the word \"DUSK\".\n   - \"DUSK\" is a valid English word.\n\n9. **Fourth Transformation:**\n   - Change 'D' to 'S' to form the word \"SUSK\".\n   - \"SUSK\" is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\n10. **Re-evaluate Fourth Transformation:**\n    - Instead of changing 'D' to 'S', change 'K' to 'M' to form the word \"DUSM\".\n    - \"DUSM\" is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\n11. **Re-evaluate Third Transformation:**\n    - Instead of changing 'I' to 'U', change 'C' to 'K' to form the word \"DISK\".\n    - \"DISK\" is a valid English word.\n\n12. **Fourth Transformation:**\n    - Change 'D' to 'S' to form the word \"SISK\".\n    - \"SISK\" is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\n13. **Re-evaluate Fourth Transformation:**\n    - Instead of changing 'D' to 'S', change 'K' to 'M' to form the word \"DIMS\".\n    - \"DIMS\" is a valid English word.\n\n14. **Fifth Transformation:**\n    - Change 'D' to 'S' to form the word \"SIMS\".\n    - \"SIMS\" is a valid English word.\n\n15. **Final Transformation:**\n    - Change 'I' to 'U' to form the word \"SUMS\".\n    - \"SUMS\" is the target word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is as follows:\n\n- FISC\n- DISC\n- DISK\n- DIMS\n- SIMS\n- SUMS\n\nEach step is a valid English word, and we have successfully transformed \"FISC\" to \"SUMS\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<FISC, DISC, DISK, DIMS, SIMS, SUMS>>>"
