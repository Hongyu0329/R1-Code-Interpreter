    "To transform the word \"WOAD\" to \"GLOP\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: WOAD**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"GLOP\".\n   - The words must remain valid English words at each step.\n\n2. **First Transformation: WOAD to LOAD**\n   - Change the first letter 'W' to 'L'.\n   - \"LOAD\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: LOAD to LOAP**\n   - Change the third letter 'D' to 'P'.\n   - \"LOAP\" is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\n4. **Re-evaluate: LOAD to LOOD**\n   - Change the third letter 'A' to 'O'.\n   - \"LOOD\" is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\n5. **Re-evaluate: LOAD to GOAD**\n   - Change the first letter 'L' to 'G'.\n   - \"GOAD\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Third Transformation: GOAD to GOLD**\n   - Change the third letter 'A' to 'L'.\n   - \"GOLD\" is a valid English word.\n\n7. **Fourth Transformation: GOLD to GOLP**\n   - Change the fourth letter 'D' to 'P'.\n   - \"GOLP\" is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\n8. **Re-evaluate: GOLD to GLOP**\n   - Change the second letter 'O' to 'L'.\n   - \"GLOP\" is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"WOAD\" to \"GLOP\" using valid English words at each step.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is:\n- WOAD\n- LOAD\n- GOAD\n- GOLD\n- GLOP\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<WOAD, LOAD, GOAD, GOLD, GLOP>>>"
