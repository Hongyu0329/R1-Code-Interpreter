    "To transform the word \"DICE\" to \"TEEN\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: DICE**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"TEEN\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: DICE to TICE**\n   - Change the first letter 'D' to 'T'.\n   - Check if \"TICE\" is a valid English word. It is not, so we need to find another valid transformation.\n\n3. **First Transformation: DICE to RICE**\n   - Change the first letter 'D' to 'R'.\n   - \"RICE\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Second Transformation: RICE to RINE**\n   - Change the third letter 'C' to 'N'.\n   - \"RINE\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Third Transformation: RINE to TINE**\n   - Change the first letter 'R' to 'T'.\n   - \"TINE\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Fourth Transformation: TINE to TEEN**\n   - Change the third letter 'I' to 'E'.\n   - \"TEEN\" is a valid English word and matches the target word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"DICE\" to \"TEEN\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: DICE, RICE, RINE, TINE, TEEN.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<DICE, RICE, RINE, TINE, TEEN>>>"
