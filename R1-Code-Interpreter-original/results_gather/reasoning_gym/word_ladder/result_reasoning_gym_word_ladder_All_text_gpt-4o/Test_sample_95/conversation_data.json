    "To transform the word \"WHIZ\" to \"TRAY\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: WHIZ**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"TRAY\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: WHIZ to WHEY**\n   - Change the third letter 'I' to 'E': WHIZ -> WHEY\n   - WHEY is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: WHEY to WHEY**\n   - Change the first letter 'W' to 'T': WHEY -> THEY\n   - THEY is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: THEY to THAY**\n   - Change the second letter 'E' to 'A': THEY -> THAY\n   - THAY is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\n5. **Re-evaluate:**\n   - Let's try a different path from WHEY.\n\n6. **Second Transformation: WHEY to TREY**\n   - Change the first letter 'W' to 'T': WHEY -> TREY\n   - TREY is a valid English word.\n\n7. **Third Transformation: TREY to TRAY**\n   - Change the third letter 'E' to 'A': TREY -> TRAY\n   - TRAY is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"WHIZ\" to \"TRAY\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: WHIZ, WHEY, TREY, TRAY.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<WHIZ, WHEY, TREY, TRAY>>>"
