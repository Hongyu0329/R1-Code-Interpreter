    "To transform the word \"FEED\" to \"ELAN\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word**: FEED\n\n2. **Goal Word**: ELAN\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - We need to change one letter at a time, ensuring each intermediate word is valid.\n   - We can start by changing the first letter 'F' to 'L', forming the word \"LEED\". However, \"LEED\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Instead, let's change the last letter 'D' to 'L', forming the word \"FEEL\". \"FEEL\" is a valid English word.\n   - Next, change the first letter 'F' to 'L', forming the word \"LEEL\". However, \"LEEL\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Instead, change the second letter 'E' to 'A', forming the word \"FELL\". \"FELL\" is a valid English word.\n   - Now, change the first letter 'F' to 'L', forming the word \"LELL\". However, \"LELL\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Instead, change the third letter 'L' to 'A', forming the word \"FALL\". \"FALL\" is a valid English word.\n   - Next, change the first letter 'F' to 'L', forming the word \"LALL\". However, \"LALL\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Instead, change the second letter 'A' to 'E', forming the word \"FELL\". \"FELL\" is a valid English word.\n   - Now, change the first letter 'F' to 'L', forming the word \"LELL\". However, \"LELL\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Instead, change the third letter 'L' to 'A', forming the word \"FALL\". \"FALL\" is a valid English word.\n   - Next, change the first letter 'F' to 'L', forming the word \"LALL\". However, \"LALL\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Instead, change the second letter 'A' to 'E', forming the word \"FELL\". \"FELL\" is a valid English word.\n   - Now, change the first letter 'F' to 'L', forming the word \"LELL\".
