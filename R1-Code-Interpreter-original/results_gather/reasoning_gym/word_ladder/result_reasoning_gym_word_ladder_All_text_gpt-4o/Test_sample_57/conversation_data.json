    "To transform the word \"VOTE\" to \"HISS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: VOTE**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"HISS\".\n   - The first letter 'V' needs to be changed to 'H' to match the first letter of \"HISS\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: VOTE to HOTE**\n   - Change 'V' to 'H': VOTE -> HOTE\n   - However, \"HOTE\" is not a valid English word. Let's try another approach.\n\n3. **First Transformation: VOTE to NOTE**\n   - Change 'V' to 'N': VOTE -> NOTE\n   - \"NOTE\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Second Transformation: NOTE to NOSE**\n   - Change 'T' to 'S': NOTE -> NOSE\n   - \"NOSE\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Third Transformation: NOSE to HOSE**\n   - Change 'N' to 'H': NOSE -> HOSE\n   - \"HOSE\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Fourth Transformation: HOSE to HOSS**\n   - Change 'E' to 'S': HOSE -> HOSS\n   - \"HOSS\" is a valid English word (informal term for a horse).\n\n7. **Fifth Transformation: HOSS to HISS**\n   - Change 'O' to 'I': HOSS -> HISS\n   - \"HISS\" is the target word and is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"VOTE\" to \"HISS\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: VOTE, NOTE, NOSE, HOSE, HOSS, HISS.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<VOTE, NOTE, NOSE, HOSE, HOSS, HISS>>>."
