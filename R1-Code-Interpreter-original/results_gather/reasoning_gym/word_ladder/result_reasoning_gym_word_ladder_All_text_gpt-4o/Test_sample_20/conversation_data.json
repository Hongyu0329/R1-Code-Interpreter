    "To transform the word \"BOIL\" to \"SLAB\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **BOIL to SOIL**: Change the first letter 'B' to 'S'. \"SOIL\" is a valid English word.\n\n2. **SOIL to SAIL**: Change the second letter 'O' to 'A'. \"SAIL\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **SAIL to SALI**: This is not a valid English word. Let's try a different approach.\n\n4. **SAIL to SALE**: Change the last letter 'L' to 'E'. \"SALE\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **SALE to SLAB**: Change the third letter 'E' to 'B'. \"SLAB\" is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"BOIL\" to \"SLAB\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: BOIL, SOIL, SAIL, SALE, SLAB.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<BOIL, SOIL, SAIL, SALE, SLAB>>>"
