    "To transform the word \"MAGE\" to \"PANG\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: MAGE**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"PANG\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: MAGE to PAGE**\n   - Change the first letter 'M' to 'P'.\n   - PAGE is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: PAGE to PANE**\n   - Change the last letter 'G' to 'N'.\n   - PANE is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: PANE to PANG**\n   - Change the third letter 'E' to 'G'.\n   - PANG is a valid English word.\n\nEach step involves changing only one letter, and all intermediate words are valid English words. Therefore, the sequence of transformations is correct.\n\nThe final sequence of words is: MAGE, PAGE, PANE, PANG.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<MAGE, PAGE, PANE, PANG>>>"
