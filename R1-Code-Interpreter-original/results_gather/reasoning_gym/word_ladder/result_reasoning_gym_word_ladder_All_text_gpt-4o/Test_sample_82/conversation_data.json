    "To transform the word \"THIS\" to \"COCO\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Start with \"THIS\":**\n   - The word \"THIS\" is our starting point.\n\n2. **Change one letter at a time:**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to form a new valid English word, gradually transforming \"THIS\" into \"COCO\".\n\n3. **Identify possible transformations:**\n   - From \"THIS\", we can change the 'T' to 'H' to form \"HIS\", which is a valid word.\n   - From \"HIS\", we can change the 'H' to 'C' to form \"CIS\", which is a valid word (CIS is a prefix used in chemistry and biology, but it is also recognized as a word).\n   - From \"CIS\", we can change the 'S' to 'O' to form \"CIO\", which is not a valid word. Therefore, we need to find another path.\n\n4. **Re-evaluate the path:**\n   - Let's try a different approach from \"THIS\":\n   - Change 'T' to 'C' to form \"CHIS\", which is not a valid word. \n   - Change 'T' to 'C' to form \"CIS\", which is a valid word.\n   - From \"CIS\", change 'I' to 'O' to form \"COS\", which is a valid word.\n   - From \"COS\", change 'S' to 'O' to form \"COO\", which is a valid word.\n   - Finally, change the last 'O' to 'C' to form \"COCO\".\n\n5. **Verify each step:**\n   - Ensure each step is a valid English word:\n     - \"THIS\" -> \"CIS\" (valid)\n     - \"CIS\" -> \"COS\" (valid)\n     - \"COS\" -> \"COO\" (valid)\n     - \"COO\" -> \"COCO\" (valid)\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"THIS\" to \"COCO\" using valid English words at each step.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<THIS,CIS,COS,COO,COCO>>>"
