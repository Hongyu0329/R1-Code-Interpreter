    "To transform the word \"CLAN\" to \"RUSH\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: CLAN**\n\n2. **First Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"CLAN\" to get a new word.\n   - Possible transformations include changing the first letter 'C' to 'P' to form \"PLAN\", which is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"PLAN\" to get a new word.\n   - Change the second letter 'L' to 'U' to form \"PUN\", which is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"PUN\" to get a new word.\n   - Change the first letter 'P' to 'R' to form \"RUN\", which is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"RUN\" to get a new word.\n   - Change the last letter 'N' to 'H' to form \"RUSH\", which is the target word.\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word. The sequence of transformations is as follows:\n\n- CLAN\n- PLAN\n- PUN\n- RUN\n- RUSH\n\nThus, the transformation sequence is:\n\n<<<CLAN, PLAN, PUN, RUN, RUSH>>>"
