    "To transform the word \"FORK\" to \"BELL\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: FORK**\n\n2. **First Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"FORK\" to get a new word.\n   - Change 'F' to 'P' to form \"PORK\", which is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"PORK\" to get a new word.\n   - Change 'P' to 'B' to form \"BORK\". However, \"BORK\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Instead, change 'O' to 'A' to form \"PARK\", which is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"PARK\" to get a new word.\n   - Change 'P' to 'B' to form \"BARK\", which is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"BARK\" to get a new word.\n   - Change 'A' to 'E' to form \"BERK\". However, \"BERK\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Instead, change 'R' to 'E' to form \"BELL\", which is the target word and a valid English word.\n\nThus, the sequence of transformations is:\n\n- FORK\n- PORK\n- PARK\n- BARK\n- BELL\n\nEach step is a valid English word, and we have successfully transformed \"FORK\" to \"BELL\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<FORK, PORK, PARK, BARK, BELL>>>"
