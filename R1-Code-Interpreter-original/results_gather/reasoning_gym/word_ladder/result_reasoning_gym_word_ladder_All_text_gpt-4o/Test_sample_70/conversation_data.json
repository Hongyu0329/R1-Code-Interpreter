    "To transform the word \"WEAN\" to \"MESA\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: WEAN**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"MESA\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: WEAN to MEAN**\n   - Change the first letter 'W' to 'M'.\n   - \"MEAN\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: MEAN to MESA**\n   - Change the third letter 'N' to 'S'.\n   - \"MESA\" is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"WEAN\" to \"MESA\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: WEAN, MEAN, MESA.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<WEAN, MEAN, MESA>>>"
