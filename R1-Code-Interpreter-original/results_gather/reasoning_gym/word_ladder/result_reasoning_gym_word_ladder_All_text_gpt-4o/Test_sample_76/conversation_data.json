    "To transform the word \"CELT\" to \"NECK\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: CELT**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"NECK\".\n\n2. **First Transformation:**\n   - Change the first letter 'C' to 'B' to form the word \"BELT\".\n   - \"BELT\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation:**\n   - Change the second letter 'E' to 'A' to form the word \"BALT\".\n   - \"BALT\" is not a valid English word, so let's try another option.\n   - Change the third letter 'L' to 'A' to form the word \"BEAT\".\n   - \"BEAT\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation:**\n   - Change the first letter 'B' to 'N' to form the word \"NEAT\".\n   - \"NEAT\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation:**\n   - Change the third letter 'A' to 'C' to form the word \"NECT\".\n   - \"NECT\" is not a valid English word, so let's try another option.\n   - Change the fourth letter 'T' to 'K' to form the word \"NECK\".\n   - \"NECK\" is a valid English word and matches the target word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"CELT\" to \"NECK\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: CELT, BELT, BEAT, NEAT, NECK.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<CELT, BELT, BEAT, NEAT, NECK>>>"
