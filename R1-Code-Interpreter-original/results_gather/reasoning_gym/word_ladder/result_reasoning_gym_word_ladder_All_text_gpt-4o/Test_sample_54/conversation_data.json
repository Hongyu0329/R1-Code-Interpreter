    "To transform the word \"TECH\" to \"LEET\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: TECH**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"LEET\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: TECH to TEET**\n   - Change the 'C' in \"TECH\" to 'E' to form \"TEET\".\n   - \"TEET\" is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\n3. **Alternative First Transformation: TECH to TEEH**\n   - Change the 'C' in \"TECH\" to 'E' to form \"TEEH\".\n   - \"TEEH\" is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\n4. **Alternative First Transformation: TECH to LECH**\n   - Change the 'T' in \"TECH\" to 'L' to form \"LECH\".\n   - \"LECH\" is a valid English word (a Scottish term for a physician or healer).\n\n5. **Second Transformation: LECH to LEET**\n   - Change the 'C' in \"LECH\" to 'E' to form \"LEET\".\n   - \"LEET\" is a valid English word (an archaic term for a court or a list).\n\nThus, the transformation sequence is:\n\n- Start with \"TECH\".\n- Change \"TECH\" to \"LECH\".\n- Change \"LECH\" to \"LEET\".\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word.\n\nThe final answer, as a comma-separated sequence of uppercase letters, is:\n\n<<<TECH, LECH, LEET>>>"
