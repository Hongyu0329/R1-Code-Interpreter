    "To transform the word \"WEFT\" to \"WOPS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word**: WEFT\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach the word \"WOPS\".\n\n2. **First Transformation**: Change 'E' to 'O'\n   - WEFT -> WOFT\n   - Check if \"WOFT\" is a valid English word. It is not, so we need to find another valid word.\n\n3. **Alternative First Transformation**: Change 'F' to 'O'\n   - WEFT -> WOST\n   - Check if \"WOST\" is a valid English word. It is not, so we need to find another valid word.\n\n4. **Alternative First Transformation**: Change 'F' to 'A'\n   - WEFT -> WEAT\n   - Check if \"WEAT\" is a valid English word. It is not, so we need to find another valid word.\n\n5. **Alternative First Transformation**: Change 'F' to 'A'\n   - WEFT -> WAFT\n   - \"WAFT\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Second Transformation**: Change 'A' to 'O'\n   - WAFT -> WOFT\n   - Check if \"WOFT\" is a valid English word. It is not, so we need to find another valid word.\n\n7. **Alternative Second Transformation**: Change 'A' to 'O'\n   - WAFT -> WIFT\n   - Check if \"WIFT\" is a valid English word. It is not, so we need to find another valid word.\n\n8. **Alternative Second Transformation**: Change 'A' to 'O'\n   - WAFT -> WART\n   - \"WART\" is a valid English word.\n\n9. **Third Transformation**: Change 'R' to 'O'\n   - WART -> WORT\n   - \"WORT\" is a valid English word.\n\n10. **Fourth Transformation**: Change 'T' to 'S'\n    - WORT -> WORS\n    - Check if \"WORS\" is a valid English word. It is not, so we need to find another valid word.\n\n11. **Alternative Fourth Transformation**: Change 'T' to 'S'\n    - WORT -> WOPS\n    - \"WOPS\" is a valid English word.\n\nThus, the sequence of transformations is:\n\n- WEFT -> WAFT -> WART -> WORT -> WOPS\n\nEach step is a valid English word, and we have successfully transformed \"WEFT\" to \"WOPS\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<WEFT, WAFT, WART, WORT, WOPS>>>"
