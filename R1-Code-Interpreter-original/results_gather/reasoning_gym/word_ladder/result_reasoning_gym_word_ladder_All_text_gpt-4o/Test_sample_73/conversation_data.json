    "To transform the word \"TREE\" to \"COWS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **TREE**: Start with the word \"TREE\".\n\n2. **Step 1**: Change one letter in \"TREE\" to form a new word. We can change the 'T' to 'F' to form the word \"FREE\", which is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Step 2**: Change one letter in \"FREE\" to form a new word. We can change the 'F' to 'C' to form the word \"CREE\", which is not a valid English word. Instead, let's change the 'R' to 'L' to form the word \"FLEE\", which is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Step 3**: Change one letter in \"FLEE\" to form a new word. We can change the 'F' to 'C' to form the word \"CLEE\", which is not a valid English word. Instead, let's change the 'L' to 'R' to form the word \"FREE\", which is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Step 4**: Change one letter in \"FREE\" to form a new word.

We can change the 'F' to 'C' to form the word \"CLEE\", which is not a valid English word.
