    "To transform the word \"OFFS\" to \"BEEP\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **OFFS to BEEP**: We need to change each letter one at a time, ensuring each intermediate word is valid.\n\n2. **Step 1**: Change 'O' to 'B':\n   - OFFS -> BOFS (BOFS is not a valid English word)\n   - Instead, let's change 'O' to 'B' in a different position:\n   - OFFS -> BFFS (BFFS is not a valid English word)\n   - Let's try changing 'O' to 'B' in a different way:\n   - OFFS -> COFF (COFF is a valid English word)\n\n3. **Step 2**: Change 'C' to 'B':\n   - COFF -> BOFF (BOFF is a valid English word)\n\n4. **Step 3**: Change 'F' to 'E':\n   - BOFF -> BEEF (BEEF is a valid English word)\n\n5. **Step 4**: Change 'F' to 'P':\n   - BEEF -> BEEP (BEEP is a valid English word)\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and ensuring the result is a valid English word. The sequence of transformations is:\n\n- OFFS\n- COFF\n- BOFF\n- BEEF\n- BEEP\n\nThus, the transformation sequence is:\n\n<<<OFFS, COFF, BOFF, BEEF, BEEP>>>"
