    "To transform the word \"DIBS\" to \"LUMP\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: DIBS**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"LUMP\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: DIBS to DIMS**\n   - Change the letter 'B' to 'M'. \n   - \"DIMS\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: DIMS to DUMP**\n   - Change the letter 'I' to 'U'.\n   - \"DUMP\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: DUMP to LUMP**\n   - Change the letter 'D' to 'L'.\n   - \"LUMP\" is a valid English word.\n\nEach step involves changing only one letter, and all intermediate words are valid English words. Therefore, the sequence of transformations is:\n\n- DIBS\n- DIMS\n- DUMP\n- LUMP\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<DIBS,DIMS,DUMP,LUMP>>>"
