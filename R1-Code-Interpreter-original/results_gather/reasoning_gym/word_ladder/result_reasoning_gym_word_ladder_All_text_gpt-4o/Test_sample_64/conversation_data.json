    "To transform the word \"LAZE\" to \"NUKE\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: LAZE**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"NUKE\".\n   - The words must remain valid English words at each step.\n\n2. **First Transformation: LAZE to LATE**\n   - Change the 'Z' in \"LAZE\" to 'T' to form \"LATE\".\n   - \"LATE\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: LATE to LITE**\n   - Change the 'A' in \"LATE\" to 'I' to form \"LITE\".\n   - \"LITE\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: LITE to LIKE**\n   - Change the 'T' in \"LITE\" to 'K' to form \"LIKE\".\n   - \"LIKE\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation: LIKE to LUKE**\n   - Change the 'I' in \"LIKE\" to 'U' to form \"LUKE\".\n   - \"LUKE\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Fifth Transformation: LUKE to NUKE**\n   - Change the 'L' in \"LUKE\" to 'N' to form \"NUKE\".\n   - \"NUKE\" is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"LAZE\" to \"NUKE\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: LAZE, LATE, LITE, LIKE, LUKE, NUKE.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<LAZE,LATE,LITE,LIKE,LUKE,NUKE>>>"
