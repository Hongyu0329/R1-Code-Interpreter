    "To transform the word \"JAZZ\" to \"DORM\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word**: JAZZ\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach DORM.\n   - The first step is to change one of the letters in \"JAZZ\" to form a new valid word.\n\n2. **First Transformation**: JAZZ to JARS\n   - Change the last 'Z' to 'S' to form the word \"JARS\".\n   - \"JARS\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation**: JARS to CARS\n   - Change the first 'J' to 'C' to form the word \"CARS\".\n   - \"CARS\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation**: CARS to CARD\n   - Change the last 'S' to 'D' to form the word \"CARD\".\n   - \"CARD\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation**: CARD to CORD\n   - Change the second 'A' to 'O' to form the word \"CORD\".\n   - \"CORD\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Fifth Transformation**: CORD to CORM\n   - Change the last 'D' to 'M' to form the word \"CORM\".\n   - \"CORM\" is a valid English word.\n\n7. **Final Transformation**: CORM to DORM\n   - Change the first 'C' to 'D' to form the word \"DORM\".\n   - \"DORM\" is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"JAZZ\" to \"DORM\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: JAZZ, JARS, CARS, CARD, CORD, CORM, DORM.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<JAZZ,JARS,CARS,CARD,CORD,CORM,DORM>>>"
