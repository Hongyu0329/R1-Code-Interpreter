    "To transform the word \"SUES\" to \"MESS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: SUES**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"MESS\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: SUES to SEES**\n   - Change the 'U' in \"SUES\" to 'E' to form \"SEES\".\n   - \"SEES\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: SEES to SEAS**\n   - Change the second 'E' in \"SEES\" to 'A' to form \"SEAS\".\n   - \"SEAS\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: SEAS to MEAS**\n   - Change the first 'S' in \"SEAS\" to 'M' to form \"MEAS\".\n   - \"MEAS\" is not a valid English word, so we need to find another path.\n\n5. **Re-evaluate: SEAS to MESS**\n   - Change the 'A' in \"SEAS\" to 'E' to form \"SEES\".\n   - \"SEES\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Fourth Transformation: SEES to MESS**\n   - Change the first 'S' in \"SEES\" to 'M' to form \"MESS\".\n   - \"MESS\" is the target word and is a valid English word.\n\nAfter evaluating the steps, the correct transformation sequence is:\n\n- SUES\n- SEES\n- SEAS\n- SEES\n- MESS\n\nTherefore, the sequence of transformations is:\n\n<<<SUES, SEES, SEAS, SEES, MESS>>>"
