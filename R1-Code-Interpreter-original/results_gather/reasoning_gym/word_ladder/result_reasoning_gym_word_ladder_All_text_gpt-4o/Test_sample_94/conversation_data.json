    "To transform the word \"TOSS\" to \"VACS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: TOSS**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"VACS\".\n\n2. **First Change: TOSS to TOSS**\n   - We can start by changing the first letter 'T' to 'V', but we need to ensure each step is a valid word. \n   - Instead, let's change the last letter 'S' to 'E' to form the word \"TOSE\". However, \"TOSE\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Let's try changing the second 'S' to 'E' to form \"TOSE\". Again, \"TOSE\" is not valid.\n   - Let's change the first 'T' to 'L' to form \"LOSS\", which is a valid word.\n\n3. **Second Change: LOSS to LASS**\n   - Change the second 'O' to 'A' to form \"LASS\", which is a valid word.\n\n4. **Third Change: LASS to VASS**\n   - Change the first 'L' to 'V' to form \"VASS\", which is a valid word.\n\n5. **Fourth Change: VASS to VACS**\n   - Change the second 'S' to 'C' to form \"VACS\", which is the target word.\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and forming a valid English word. The sequence of transformations is:\n\n- TOSS\n- LOSS\n- LASS\n- VASS\n- VACS\n\nThus, the transformation sequence is:\n\n<<<TOSS, LOSS, LASS, VASS, VACS>>>"
