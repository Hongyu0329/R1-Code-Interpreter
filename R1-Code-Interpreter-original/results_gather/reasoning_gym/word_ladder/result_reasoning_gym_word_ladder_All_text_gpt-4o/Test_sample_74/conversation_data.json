    "To transform the word \"APES\" to \"TEAM\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: APES**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"TEAM\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: APES to APE**\n   - Change the last letter 'S' to 'E' to form the word \"APE\", which is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: APE to ATE**\n   - Change the second letter 'P' to 'T' to form the word \"ATE\", which is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: ATE to TEA**\n   - Change the first letter 'A' to 'T' to form the word \"TEA\", which is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation: TEA to TEAM**\n   - Change the last letter 'A' to 'M' to form the word \"TEAM\", which is the target word and a valid English word.\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word. The sequence of transformations is as follows:\n\n- APES\n- APE\n- ATE\n- TEA\n- TEAM\n\nThus, the transformation sequence is:\n\n<<<APES, APE, ATE, TEA, TEAM>>>"
