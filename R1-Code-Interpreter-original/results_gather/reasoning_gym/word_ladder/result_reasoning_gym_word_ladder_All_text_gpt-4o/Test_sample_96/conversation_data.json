    "To transform the word \"OPUS\" to \"SKIS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **OPUS to SPUS**: Change the first letter 'O' to 'S'. However, \"SPUS\" is not a valid English word. Let's try another approach.\n\n2. **OPUS to OPIS**: Change the third letter 'U' to 'I'. However, \"OPIS\" is not a valid English word. Let's try another approach.\n\n3. **OPUS to OPES**: Change the third letter 'U' to 'E'. \"OPES\" is a valid English word (plural of \"ope\", an archaic word for opening).\n\n4. **OPES to APES**: Change the first letter 'O' to 'A'. \"APES\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **APES to APIS**: Change the third letter 'E' to 'I'. \"APIS\" is a valid English word (a genus of bees).\n\n6. **APIS to SPIS**: Change the first letter 'A' to 'S'. However, \"SPIS\" is not a valid English word. Let's try another approach.\n\n7. **APIS to SKIS**: Change the second letter 'P' to 'K'. \"SKIS\" is a valid English word.\n\nThus, the transformation sequence is:\n\n- OPUS\n- OPES\n- APES\n- APIS\n- SKIS\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<OPUS, OPES, APES, APIS, SKIS>>>"
