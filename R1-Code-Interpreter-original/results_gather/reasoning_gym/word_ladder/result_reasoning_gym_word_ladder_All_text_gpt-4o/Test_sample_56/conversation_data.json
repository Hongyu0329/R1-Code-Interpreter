    "To transform the word \"FIST\" to \"LOLL\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: FIST**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"LOLL\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: FIST to LIST**\n   - Change the first letter 'F' to 'L'.\n   - LIST is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: LIST to LOST**\n   - Change the second letter 'I' to 'O'.\n   - LOST is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: LOST to LOLL**\n   - Change the third letter 'S' to 'L'.\n   - LOLL is a valid English word.\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word. The sequence of transformations is as follows:\n\n- FIST\n- LIST\n- LOST\n- LOLL\n\nThus, the transformation sequence is:\n\n<<<FIST, LIST, LOST, LOLL>>>"
