    "To transform the word \"REIN\" to \"CHIS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word**: REIN\n\n2. **Target Word**: CHIS\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - We need to change one letter at a time, ensuring each intermediate word is valid.\n   - Let's start by changing the first letter 'R' to 'C' to get closer to the target word:\n     - Change 'R' to 'C': CEIN (not a valid word)\n     - Change 'R' to 'C': COIN (valid word)\n   - Now, we have the word \"COIN\".\n   - Next, let's change the second letter 'O' to 'H':\n     - Change 'O' to 'H': CHIN (valid word)\n   - Now, we have the word \"CHIN\".\n   - Finally, change the last letter 'N' to 'S':\n     - Change 'N' to 'S': CHIS (valid word)\n\n4. **Sequence of Words**:\n   - REIN → COIN → CHIN → CHIS\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word. Therefore, the transformation sequence is complete.\n\nThe final answer, as a comma-separated sequence of uppercase letters, is:\n\n<<<REIN, COIN, CHIN, CHIS>>>"
