    "To transform the word \"HIYA\" to \"NEED\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **HIYA to HIDE**: \n   - Change the third letter 'Y' to 'D'.\n   - \"HIDE\" is a valid English word.\n\n2. **HIDE to HIND**: \n   - Change the third letter 'E' to 'N'.\n   - \"HIND\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **HIND to HAND**: \n   - Change the second letter 'I' to 'A'.\n   - \"HAND\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **HAND to HARD**: \n   - Change the third letter 'N' to 'R'.\n   - \"HARD\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **HARD to HEAD**: \n   - Change the second letter 'A' to 'E'.\n   - \"HEAD\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **HEAD to HEED**: \n   - Change the third letter 'A' to 'E'.\n   - \"HEED\" is a valid English word.\n\n7. **HEED to NEED**: \n   - Change the first letter 'H' to 'N'.\n   - \"NEED\" is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"HIYA\" to \"NEED\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of words is: HIYA, HIDE, HIND, HAND, HARD, HEAD, HEED, NEED.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<HIYA, HIDE, HIND, HAND, HARD, HEAD, HEED, NEED>>>"
