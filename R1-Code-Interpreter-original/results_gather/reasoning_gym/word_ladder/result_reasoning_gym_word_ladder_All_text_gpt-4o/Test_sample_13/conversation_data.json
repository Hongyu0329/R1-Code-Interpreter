    "To transform the word \"PAYS\" to \"SASH\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: PAYS**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"SASH\".\n\n2. **First Transformation:**\n   - Change 'P' to 'S': \"SAYS\"\n   - \"SAYS\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation:**\n   - Change 'Y' to 'A': \"SASS\"\n   - \"SASS\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation:**\n   - Change the last 'S' to 'H': \"SASH\"\n   - \"SASH\" is the target word and is a valid English word.\n\nEach step involves changing only one letter, and each intermediate word is a valid English word. Therefore, the sequence of transformations is correct.\n\nThe sequence of words from \"PAYS\" to \"SASH\" is:\n\n- PAYS\n- SAYS\n- SASS\n- SASH\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<PAYS, SAYS, SASS, SASH>>>"
