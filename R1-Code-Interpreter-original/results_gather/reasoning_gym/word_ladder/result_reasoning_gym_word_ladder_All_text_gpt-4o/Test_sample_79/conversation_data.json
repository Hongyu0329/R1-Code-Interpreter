    "To transform the word \"LEAP\" to \"SEED\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: LEAP**\n\n2. **First Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"LEAP\" to get closer to \"SEED\".\n   - We can change the 'L' to 'S' to form the word \"SEAP\".\n   - However, \"SEAP\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Alternatively, change 'L' to 'S' to form \"SOAP\", which is a valid word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation:**\n   - From \"SOAP\", change one letter to get closer to \"SEED\".\n   - Change 'O' to 'E' to form \"SEAP\".\n   - However, \"SEAP\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Alternatively, change 'O' to 'E' to form \"SEEP\", which is a valid word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation:**\n   - From \"SEEP\", change one letter to get closer to \"SEED\".\n   - Change 'P' to 'D' to form \"SEED\", which is the target word.\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and ensuring the result is a valid English word. The sequence of transformations is as follows:\n\n- LEAP\n- SOAP\n- SEEP\n- SEED\n\nThus, the transformation sequence is:\n\n<<<LEAP, SOAP, SEEP, SEED>>>"
