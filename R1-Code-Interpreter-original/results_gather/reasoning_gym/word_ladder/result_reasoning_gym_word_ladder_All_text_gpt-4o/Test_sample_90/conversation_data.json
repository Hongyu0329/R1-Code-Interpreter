    "To transform the word \"VANS\" to \"KIRS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Word**: VANS\n\n2. **Target Word**: KIRS\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - We need to change one letter at a time, ensuring each intermediate word is valid.\n   - Start with \"VANS\":\n     - Change 'V' to 'C' to form \"CANS\" (a valid word).\n     - Change 'A' to 'I' to form \"CINS\" (not a valid word, so try another approach).\n     - Change 'N' to 'R' to form \"CARS\" (a valid word).\n     - Change 'C' to 'K' to form \"KARS\" (a valid word).\n     - Change 'A' to 'I' to form \"KIRS\" (the target word).\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Each step results in a valid English word: VANS -> CANS -> CARS -> KARS -> KIRS.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The sequence of transformations is: VANS, CANS, CARS, KARS, KIRS.\n\nTherefore, the transformation sequence is:\n\n<<<VANS, CANS, CARS, KARS, KIRS>>>"
