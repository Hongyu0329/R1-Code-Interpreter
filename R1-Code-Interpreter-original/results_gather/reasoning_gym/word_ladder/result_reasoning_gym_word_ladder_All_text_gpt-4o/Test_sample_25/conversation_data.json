    "To transform the word \"MODE\" to \"TYRE\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **MODE to MOTE**: Change the 'D' in \"MODE\" to 'T'. \"MOTE\" is a valid English word.\n\n2. **MOTE to MATE**: Change the 'O' in \"MOTE\" to 'A'. \"MATE\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **MATE to MATE**: No change needed here, as we need to find a way to transition to a word closer to \"TYRE\".\n\n4. **MATE to MITE**: Change the 'A' in \"MATE\" to 'I'. \"MITE\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **MITE to MIRE**: Change the 'T' in \"MITE\" to 'R'. \"MIRE\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **MIRE to TIRE**: Change the 'M' in \"MIRE\" to 'T'. \"TIRE\" is a valid English word.\n\n7. **TIRE to TYRE**: Change the 'I' in \"TIRE\" to 'Y'. \"TYRE\" is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"MODE\" to \"TYRE\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: MODE, MOTE, MATE, MITE, MIRE, TIRE, TYRE.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<MODE, MOTE, MATE, MITE, MIRE, TIRE, TYRE>>>"
