    "To transform the word \"WAYS\" to \"COSY\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Word**: WAYS\n\n2. **Target Word**: COSY\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - We need to change 'W' to 'C', 'A' to 'O', 'Y' to 'S', and 'S' to 'Y'.\n   - We can only change one letter at a time, ensuring each intermediate word is valid.\n\n4. **Possible Steps**:\n   - Start with \"WAYS\".\n   - Change 'W' to 'C': \"CAYS\" (valid word).\n   - Change 'A' to 'O': \"COYS\" (valid word).\n   - Change 'Y' to 'S': \"COSS\" (not a valid word, so this path is incorrect).\n   - Instead, change 'S' to 'Y': \"COSY\" (valid word).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Each step results in a valid English word.\n   - The sequence of transformations is logical and follows the rule of changing one letter at a time.\n\n6. **Final Sequence**:\n   - WAYS → CAYS → COYS → COSY\n\nTherefore, the sequence of transformations from \"WAYS\" to \"COSY\" is:\n\n<<<WAYS, CAYS, COYS, COSY>>>"
