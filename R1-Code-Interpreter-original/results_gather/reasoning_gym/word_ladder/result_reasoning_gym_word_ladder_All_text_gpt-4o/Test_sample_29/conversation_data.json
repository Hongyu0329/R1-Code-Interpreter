    "To transform the word \"FEEL\" to \"TEEM\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: FEEL**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"TEEM\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: FEEL to TEEL**\n   - Change the first letter 'F' to 'T'.\n   - TEEL is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: TEEL to TEEM**\n   - Change the last letter 'L' to 'M'.\n   - TEEM is a valid English word.\n\nEach step involves changing only one letter, and all intermediate words are valid English words. Therefore, the sequence of transformations is:\n\n- FEEL\n- TEEL\n- TEEM\n\nThus, the transformation sequence is:\n\n<<<FEEL, TEEL, TEEM>>>"
