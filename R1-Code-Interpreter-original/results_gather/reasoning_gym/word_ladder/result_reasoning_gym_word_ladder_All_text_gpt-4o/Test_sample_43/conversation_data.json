    "To transform the word \"TUMS\" to \"PREP\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: TUMS**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"PREP\".\n   - The first letter 'T' needs to be changed to 'P' to match the first letter of \"PREP\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: TUMS to PUMS**\n   - Change 'T' to 'P': \"TUMS\" becomes \"PUMS\".\n   - \"PUMS\" is a valid English word (a plural form of \"PUM\").\n\n3. **Second Transformation: PUMS to PEMS**\n   - Change 'U' to 'E': \"PUMS\" becomes \"PEMS\".\n   - \"PEMS\" is a valid English word (a plural form of \"PEM\").\n\n4. **Third Transformation: PEMS to PEPS**\n   - Change 'M' to 'P': \"PEMS\" becomes \"PEPS\".\n   - \"PEPS\" is a valid English word (a plural form of \"PEP\").\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation: PEPS to PREP**\n   - Change 'E' to 'R': \"PEPS\" becomes \"PREP\".\n   - \"PREP\" is the target word and is a valid English word.\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word. Therefore, the sequence of transformations is:\n\n<<<TUMS,PUMS,PEMS,PEPS,PREP>>>"
