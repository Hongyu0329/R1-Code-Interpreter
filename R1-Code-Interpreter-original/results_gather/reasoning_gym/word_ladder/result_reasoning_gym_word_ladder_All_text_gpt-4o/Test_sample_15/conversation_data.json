    "To transform the word \"BRAD\" to \"POEM\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **BRAD to BREAD**: Change the 'R' to 'E'. \"BREAD\" is a valid English word.\n2. **BREAD to BREED**: Change the 'A' to 'E'. \"BREED\" is a valid English word.\n3. **BREED to CREED**: Change the 'B' to 'C'. \"CREED\" is a valid English word.\n4. **CREED to CRED**: Change the 'E' to 'O'. \"CRED\" is a valid English word.\n5. **CRED to CROP**: Change the 'E' to 'O'. \"CROP\" is a valid English word.\n6. **CROP to PROP**: Change the 'C' to 'P'. \"PROP\" is a valid English word.\n7. **PROP to PROM**: Change the 'P' to 'M'. \"PROM\" is a valid English word.\n8. **PROM to POEM**: Change the 'R' to 'E'. \"POEM\" is a valid English word.\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word. Therefore, the sequence of transformations is:\n\n<<<BRAD, BREAD, BREED, CREED, CRED, CROP, PROP, PROM, POEM>>>"
