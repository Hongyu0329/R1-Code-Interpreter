    "To transform the word \"DAMS\" to \"DIED\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: DAMS**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"DIED\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: DAMS to DIMS**\n   - Change the second letter 'A' to 'I'.\n   - \"DIMS\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: DIMS to DIES**\n   - Change the third letter 'M' to 'E'.\n   - \"DIES\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: DIES to DIED**\n   - Change the fourth letter 'S' to 'D'.\n   - \"DIED\" is a valid English word.\n\nEach step involves changing only one letter, and all intermediate words are valid English words. Therefore, the sequence of transformations is:\n\n- DAMS\n- DIMS\n- DIES\n- DIED\n\nThe final answer, presented as a comma-separated sequence of uppercase letters without spaces, enclosed within triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<DAMS,DIMS,DIES,DIED>>>"
