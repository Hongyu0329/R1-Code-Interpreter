    "To transform the word \"GHAT\" to \"TUCK\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: GHAT**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"TUCK\".\n   - The first letter 'G' needs to be changed to 'T', but we need to do this gradually while ensuring each step is a valid word.\n\n2. **Step 1: Change 'G' to 'C'**\n   - \"CHAT\" is a valid English word.\n   - New word: CHAT\n\n3. **Step 2: Change 'H' to 'U'**\n   - \"CUT\" is not a valid word, but \"CUT\" is a valid word.\n   - New word: CUT\n\n4. **Step 3: Change 'C' to 'T'**\n   - \"TUT\" is not a valid word, but \"TUCK\" is a valid word.\n   - New word: TUCK\n\n5. **Final Word: TUCK**\n   - We have successfully transformed \"GHAT\" to \"TUCK\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: GHAT -> CHAT -> CUT -> TUCK.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<GHAT, CHAT, CUT, TUCK>>>"
