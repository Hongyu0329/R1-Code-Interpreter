    "To transform the word \"FIRN\" to \"WORM\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: FIRN**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"WORM\".\n   - The first letter 'F' needs to be changed to 'W', but we must ensure each step is a valid word.\n\n2. **Step 1: Change 'F' to 'W'**\n   - Change \"FIRN\" to \"WIRN\". However, \"WIRN\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Instead, let's change 'F' to 'B' to form \"BIRN\". \"BIRN\" is not a valid word either.\n   - Let's try changing 'F' to 'C' to form \"CIRN\". \"CIRN\" is not a valid word.\n   - Let's try changing 'F' to 'B' to form \"BARN\". \"BARN\" is a valid word.\n\n3. **Step 2: Change 'A' to 'O'**\n   - Change \"BARN\" to \"BORN\". \"BORN\" is a valid word.\n\n4. **Step 3: Change 'B' to 'W'**\n   - Change \"BORN\" to \"WORN\". \"WORN\" is a valid word.\n\n5. **Step 4: Change 'N' to 'M'**\n   - Change \"WORN\" to \"WORM\". \"WORM\" is a valid word.\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and ensuring the result is a valid English word. The sequence of transformations is as follows:\n\n- FIRN\n- BARN\n- BORN\n- WORN\n- WORM\n\nThus, the transformation sequence is:\n\n<<<FIRN, BARN, BORN, WORN, WORM>>>"
