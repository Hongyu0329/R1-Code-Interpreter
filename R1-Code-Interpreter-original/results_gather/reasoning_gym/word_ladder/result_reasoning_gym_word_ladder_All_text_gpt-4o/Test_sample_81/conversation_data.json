    "To transform the word \"ICED\" to \"ARCH\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: ICED**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"ARCH\".\n\n2. **First Transformation:**\n   - Change 'I' to 'A': \"ICED\" becomes \"ACED\".\n   - \"ACED\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation:**\n   - Change 'C' to 'R': \"ACED\" becomes \"ARED\".\n   - \"ARED\" is not a valid English word, so let's try another transformation.\n\n4. **Alternative Second Transformation:**\n   - Change 'E' to 'H': \"ACED\" becomes \"ACHE\".\n   - \"ACHE\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Third Transformation:**\n   - Change 'D' to 'R': \"ACHE\" becomes \"ARCH\".\n   - \"ARCH\" is the target word and is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"ICED\" to \"ARCH\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is:\n- ICED\n- ACED\n- ACHE\n- ARCH\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<ICED, ACED, ACHE, ARCH>>>"
