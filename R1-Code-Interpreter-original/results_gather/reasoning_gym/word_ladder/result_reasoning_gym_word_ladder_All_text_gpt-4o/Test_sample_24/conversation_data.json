    "To transform the word \"ROPY\" to \"SODS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **ROPY to SO**PY**: Change the first letter 'R' to 'S'. \"SOPY\" is not a valid English word, so this step is not possible.\n\n2. **ROPY to RO**DY**: Change the third letter 'P' to 'D'. \"RODY\" is not a valid English word, so this step is not possible.\n\n3. **ROPY to RO**DS**: Change the third letter 'P' to 'D'. \"RODS\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **RODS to SO**DS**: Change the first letter 'R' to 'S'. \"SODS\" is a valid English word.\n\nThus, the transformation sequence is:\n\n- Start with \"ROPY\".\n- Change 'P' to 'D' to get \"RODS\".\n- Change 'R' to 'S' to get \"SODS\".\n\nEach step results in a valid English word, and we have successfully transformed \"ROPY\" to \"SODS\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<ROPY, RODS, SODS>>>."
