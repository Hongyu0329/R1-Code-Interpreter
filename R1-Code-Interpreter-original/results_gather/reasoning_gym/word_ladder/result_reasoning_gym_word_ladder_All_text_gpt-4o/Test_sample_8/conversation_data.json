    "To transform the word \"TOWS\" to \"SOIL\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: TOWS**\n\n2. **First Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"TOWS\" to get a new word.\n   - Change 'T' to 'S' to form \"SOWS\".\n   - \"SOWS\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"SOWS\" to get a new word.\n   - Change 'W' to 'I' to form \"SOIS\".\n   - \"SOIS\" is not a valid English word, so let's try another option.\n   - Change 'W' to 'I' to form \"SOIL\".\n   - \"SOIL\" is a valid English word and matches the target word.\n\nThus, the sequence of transformations is:\n\n- TOWS\n- SOWS\n- SOIL\n\nEach step is a valid English word, and we have successfully transformed \"TOWS\" to \"SOIL\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<TOWS, SOWS, SOIL>>>"
