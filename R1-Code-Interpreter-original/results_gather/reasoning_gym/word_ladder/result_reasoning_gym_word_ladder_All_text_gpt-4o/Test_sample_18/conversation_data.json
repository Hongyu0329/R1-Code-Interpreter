    "To transform the word \"HOPS\" to \"MINI\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: HOPS**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"MINI\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: HOPS to MOPS**\n   - Change the first letter 'H' to 'M'.\n   - MOPS is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: MOPS to MIPS**\n   - Change the second letter 'O' to 'I'.\n   - MIPS is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: MIPS to MINS**\n   - Change the third letter 'P' to 'N'.\n   - MINS is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation: MINS to MINI**\n   - Change the last letter 'S' to 'I'.\n   - MINI is a valid English word.\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word. Therefore, the sequence of transformations is:\n\n<<<HOPS, MOPS, MIPS, MINS, MINI>>>"
