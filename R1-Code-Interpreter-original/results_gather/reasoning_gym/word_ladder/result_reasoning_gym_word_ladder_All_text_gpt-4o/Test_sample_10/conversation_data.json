    "To transform the word \"HAND\" to \"GLEE\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: HAND**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"GLEE\".\n   - The first letter of \"HAND\" is 'H', and the first letter of \"GLEE\" is 'G'. We can change 'H' to 'G' to form the word \"GAND\", but \"GAND\" is not a valid English word. Therefore, we need to find another valid word.\n\n2. **First Transformation: HAND to LAND**\n   - Change 'H' to 'L' to form \"LAND\". \"LAND\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: LAND to LEND**\n   - Change 'A' to 'E' to form \"LEND\". \"LEND\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: LEND to LEED**\n   - Change 'N' to 'E' to form \"LEED\". \"LEED\" is a valid English word, though less common, it is recognized as a proper noun (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design).\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation: LEED to GLEE**\n   - Change 'L' to 'G' to form \"GLEE\". \"GLEE\" is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"HAND\" to \"GLEE\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: HAND, LAND, LEND, LEED, GLEE.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<HAND, LAND, LEND, LEED, GLEE>>>"
