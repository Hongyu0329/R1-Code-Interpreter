    "To transform the word \"RICH\" to \"NITE\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: RICH**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"NITE\".\n\n2. **First Transformation:**\n   - Change 'R' to 'L' to form the word \"LICH\".\n   - \"LICH\" is a valid English word (a type of undead creature in fantasy settings).\n\n3. **Second Transformation:**\n   - Change 'L' to 'L' (no change) to form the word \"LICE\".\n   - \"LICE\" is a valid English word (plural of louse, a type of parasitic insect).\n\n4. **Third Transformation:**\n   - Change 'C' to 'K' to form the word \"LIKE\".\n   - \"LIKE\" is a valid English word (to find agreeable or enjoyable).\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation:**\n   - Change 'K' to 'N' to form the word \"NIKE\".\n   - \"NIKE\" is a valid English word (name of the Greek goddess of victory, also a well-known brand).\n\n6. **Fifth Transformation:**\n   - Change 'K' to 'T' to form the word \"NITE\".\n   - \"NITE\" is a valid English word (an informal spelling of \"night\").\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"RICH\" to \"NITE\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: RICH, LICH, LICE, LIKE, NIKE, NITE.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<RICH, LICH, LICE, LIKE, NIKE, NITE>>>"
