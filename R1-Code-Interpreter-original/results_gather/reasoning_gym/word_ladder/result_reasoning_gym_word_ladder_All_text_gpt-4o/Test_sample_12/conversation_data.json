    "To transform the word \"SNOG\" to \"SUQS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: SNOG**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"SUQS\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: SNOG to SLOG**\n   - Change the 'N' in \"SNOG\" to 'L' to form \"SLOG\".\n   - \"SLOG\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: SLOG to SLUG**\n   - Change the 'O' in \"SLOG\" to 'U' to form \"SLUG\".\n   - \"SLUG\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: SLUG to SUGS**\n   - Change the 'L' in \"SLUG\" to 'S' to form \"SUGS\".\n   - \"SUGS\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation: SUGS to SUQS**\n   - Change the 'G' in \"SUGS\" to 'Q' to form \"SUQS\".\n   - \"SUQS\" is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"SNOG\" to \"SUQS\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: SNOG, SLOG, SLUG, SUGS, SUQS.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<SNOG, SLOG, SLUG, SUGS, SUQS>>>"
