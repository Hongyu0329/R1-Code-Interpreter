    "To transform the word \"PROD\" to \"MARL\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: PROD**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"MARL\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: Change 'P' to 'B'**\n   - Change \"PROD\" to \"BROD\". However, \"BROD\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Instead, change \"PROD\" to \"PROS\". \"PROS\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: Change 'P' to 'B'**\n   - Change \"PROS\" to \"BROS\". \"BROS\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: Change 'B' to 'M'**\n   - Change \"BROS\" to \"MROS\". However, \"MROS\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Instead, change \"BROS\" to \"BROW\". \"BROW\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation: Change 'B' to 'M'**\n   - Change \"BROW\" to \"MROW\". However, \"MROW\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Instead, change \"BROW\" to \"BRAW\". \"BRAW\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Fifth Transformation: Change 'B' to 'M'**\n   - Change \"BRAW\" to \"MRAW\". However, \"MRAW\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Instead, change \"BRAW\" to \"MAWL\". \"MAWL\" is a valid English word.\n\n7. **Sixth Transformation: Change 'W' to 'R'**\n   - Change \"MAWL\" to \"MARL\". \"MARL\" is a valid English word and matches the target word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"PROD\" to \"MARL\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: PROD, PROS, BROS, BROW, BRAW, MAWL, MARL.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<PROD, PROS, BROS, BROW, BRAW, MAWL, MARL>>>"
