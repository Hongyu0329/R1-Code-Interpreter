    "To transform the word \"SINS\" to \"WEST\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: SINS**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"WEST\".\n   - The first letter of \"SINS\" is 'S', and the first letter of \"WEST\" is 'W'. We can consider changing 'S' to 'W' first.\n\n2. **First Transformation: SINS to WINS**\n   - Change the first letter 'S' to 'W'.\n   - \"WINS\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: WINS to WINE**\n   - Change the last letter 'S' to 'E'.\n   - \"WINE\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: WINE to WISE**\n   - Change the third letter 'N' to 'S'.\n   - \"WISE\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation: WISE to WIST**\n   - Change the last letter 'E' to 'T'.\n   - \"WIST\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Fifth Transformation: WIST to WEST**\n   - Change the second letter 'I' to 'E'.\n   - \"WEST\" is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"SINS\" to \"WEST\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: SINS, WINS, WINE, WISE, WIST, WEST.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<SINS, WINS, WINE, WISE, WIST, WEST>>>"
