    "To transform the word \"DARN\" to \"SHIP\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: DARN**\n\n2. **First Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"DARN\" to form a new word.\n   - Possible transformations include changing the first letter to form \"BARN\" or \"CARN\", or changing the last letter to form \"DART\".\n   - Let's choose \"DART\" as it is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"DART\" to form a new word.\n   - Possible transformations include changing the first letter to form \"CART\", or changing the last letter to form \"DARS\".\n   - Let's choose \"CART\" as it is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"CART\" to form a new word.\n   - Possible transformations include changing the first letter to form \"BART\", or changing the last letter to form \"CARD\".\n   - Let's choose \"CARD\" as it is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"CARD\" to form a new word.\n   - Possible transformations include changing the first letter to form \"WARD\", or changing the last letter to form \"CARS\".\n   - Let's choose \"WARD\" as it is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Fifth Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"WARD\" to form a new word.\n   - Possible transformations include changing the first letter to form \"HARD\", or changing the last letter to form \"WARS\".\n   - Let's choose \"HARD\" as it is a valid English word.\n\n7. **Sixth Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"HARD\" to form a new word.\n   - Possible transformations include changing the first letter to form \"CARD\", or changing the last letter to form \"HARP\".\n   - Let's choose \"HARP\" as it is a valid English word.\n\n8. **Seventh Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"HARP\" to form a new word.\n   - Possible transformations include changing the first letter to form \"SHARP\", or changing the last letter to form \"HARD\".\n   - Let's choose \"HARP\" as it is a valid English word.\n\n9. **Eighth Transformation:**\n   - Change one letter in \"HARP\" to form a new word.\n   - Possible transformations include changing the first letter to form \"SHARP\", or changing the last letter to form \"HARD\".\n   - Let's choose \"SHARP\" as it is a valid English word.\n\n10. **Ninth Transformation:**\n    - Change one letter in \"SHARP\" to form a new word.\n    - Possible transformations include changing the first letter to form \"SHARP\", or changing the last letter to form \"SHIP\".\n    - Let's choose \"SHIP\" as it is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"DARN\" to \"SHIP\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: DARN, DART, CART, CARD, WARD, HARD, HARP, SHARP, SHIP.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<DARN, DART, CART, CARD, WARD, HARD, HARP, SHARP, SHIP>>>."
