    "To transform the word \"SHIV\" to \"TARP\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word**: SHIV\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach TARP.\n\n2. **First Transformation**: Change 'S' to 'T'\n   - SHIV -> THIV\n   - However, \"THIV\" is not a valid English word. Let's try another approach.\n\n3. **First Transformation**: Change 'H' to 'A'\n   - SHIV -> SAIV\n   - \"SAIV\" is not a valid English word. Let's try another approach.\n\n4. **First Transformation**: Change 'H' to 'A'\n   - SHIV -> SHAV\n   - \"SHAV\" is not a valid English word. Let's try another approach.\n\n5. **First Transformation**: Change 'H' to 'A'\n   - SHIV -> SHIP\n   - \"SHIP\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Second Transformation**: Change 'I' to 'A'\n   - SHIP -> SHAP\n   - \"SHAP\" is not a valid English word. Let's try another approach.\n\n7. **Second Transformation**: Change 'P' to 'A'\n   - SHIP -> SHIA\n   - \"SHIA\" is not a valid English word. Let's try another approach.\n\n8. **Second Transformation**: Change 'P' to 'A'\n   - SHIP -> SHIP (no change)\n   - We need to find a valid word that gets us closer to \"TARP\".\n\n9. **Second Transformation**: Change 'S' to 'C'\n   - SHIP -> CHIP\n   - \"CHIP\" is a valid English word.\n\n10. **Third Transformation**: Change 'C' to 'T'\n    - CHIP -> THIP\n    - \"THIP\" is not a valid English word. Let's try another approach.\n\n11. **Third Transformation**: Change 'H' to 'A'\n    - CHIP -> CHAP\n    - \"CHAP\" is a valid English word.\n\n12. **Fourth Transformation**: Change 'C' to 'T'\n    - CHAP -> THAP\n    - \"THAP\" is not a valid English word. Let's try another approach.\n\n13. **Fourth Transformation**: Change 'C' to 'T'\n    - CHAP -> TRAP\n    - \"TRAP\" is a valid English word.\n\n14. **Fifth Transformation**: Change 'R' to 'A'\n    - TRAP -> TARP\n    - \"TARP\" is the target word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"SHIV\" to \"TARP\" using valid English words at each step.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: SHIV, SHIP, CHIP, CHAP, TRAP, TARP.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<SHIV, SHIP, CHIP, CHAP, TRAP, TARP>>>."
