    "To transform the word \"LINE\" to \"FOGS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: LINE**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"FOGS\".\n\n2. **First Transformation:**\n   - Change 'L' to 'F': FINE (valid word)\n   - Now we have: FINE\n\n3. **Second Transformation:**\n   - Change 'I' to 'O': FONE (not a valid word)\n   - Change 'N' to 'O': FONE (not a valid word)\n   - Change 'E' to 'S': FINS (valid word)\n   - Now we have: FINS\n\n4. **Third Transformation:**\n   - Change 'I' to 'O': FONS (not a valid word)\n   - Change 'N' to 'O': FIOS (not a valid word)\n   - Change 'S' to 'G': FING (not a valid word)\n   - Change 'N' to 'G': FIGS (valid word)\n   - Now we have: FIGS\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation:**\n   - Change 'F' to 'F': FIGS (no change)\n   - Change 'I' to 'O': FOGS (valid word)\n   - Now we have: FOGS\n\nEach step involves changing one letter to form a valid English word, and we have successfully transformed \"LINE\" to \"FOGS\".\n\nThe sequence of transformations is:\n- LINE\n- FINE\n- FINS\n- FIGS\n- FOGS\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<LINE, FINE, FINS, FIGS, FOGS>>>"
