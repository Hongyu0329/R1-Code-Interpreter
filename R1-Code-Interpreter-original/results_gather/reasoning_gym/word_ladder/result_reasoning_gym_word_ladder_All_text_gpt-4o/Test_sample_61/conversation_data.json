    "To transform the word \"TIFF\" to \"MAZE\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Word**: TIFF\n2. **Target Word**: MAZE\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **TIFF to RIFF**: Change the first letter 'T' to 'R'. RIFF is a valid English word.\n2. **RIFF to RIFE**: Change the last letter 'F' to 'E'. RIFE is a valid English word.\n3. **RIFE to RILE**: Change the third letter 'F' to 'L'. RILE is a valid English word.\n4. **RILE to MILE**: Change the first letter 'R' to 'M'. MILE is a valid English word.\n5. **MILE to MALE**: Change the second letter 'I' to 'A'. MALE is a valid English word.\n6. **MALE to MAZE**: Change the last letter 'E' to 'Z'. MAZE is a valid English word.\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word. Therefore, the sequence of transformations is:\n\n- TIFF\n- RIFF\n- RIFE\n- RILE\n- MILE\n- MALE\n- MAZE\n\nThe final answer, presented as a comma-separated sequence of uppercase letters, is:\n\n<<<TIFF,RIFF,RIFE,RILE,MILE,MALE,MAZE>>>"
