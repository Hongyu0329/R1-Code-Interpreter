    "To transform the word \"TOOK\" to \"BETA\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: TOOK**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"BETA\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: TOOK to BOOK**\n   - Change the first letter 'T' to 'B'.\n   - BOOK is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: BOOK to BOOT**\n   - Change the third letter 'K' to 'T'.\n   - BOOT is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: BOOT to BOLT**\n   - Change the second letter 'O' to 'L'.\n   - BOLT is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation: BOLT to BELT**\n   - Change the third letter 'O' to 'E'.\n   - BELT is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Fifth Transformation: BELT to BEAT**\n   - Change the fourth letter 'L' to 'A'.\n   - BEAT is a valid English word.\n\n7. **Final Transformation: BEAT to BETA**\n   - Change the fourth letter 'T' to 'A'.\n   - BETA is a valid English word.\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word. Therefore, the sequence of transformations is:\n\n<<<TOOK, BOOK, BOOT, BOLT, BELT, BEAT, BETA>>>"
