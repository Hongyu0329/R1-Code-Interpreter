    "To transform the word \"BOON\" to \"ARTY\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **BOON**: Start with the word \"BOON\".\n\n2. **Change 'B' to 'M'**: \n   - BOON -> MOON\n   - \"MOON\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Change 'M' to 'L'**:\n   - MOON -> LOON\n   - \"LOON\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Change 'L' to 'C'**:\n   - LOON -> COON\n   - \"COON\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Change 'C' to 'C'**:\n   - COON -> COOT\n   - \"COOT\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Change 'C' to 'C'**:\n   - COOT -> CART\n   - \"CART\" is a valid English word.\n\n7. **Change 'C' to 'A'**:\n   - CART -> ARTY\n   - \"ARTY\" is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"BOON\" to \"ARTY\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of words is: BOON, MOON, LOON, COON, COOT, CART, ARTY.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<BOON, MOON, LOON, COON, COOT, CART, ARTY>>>"
