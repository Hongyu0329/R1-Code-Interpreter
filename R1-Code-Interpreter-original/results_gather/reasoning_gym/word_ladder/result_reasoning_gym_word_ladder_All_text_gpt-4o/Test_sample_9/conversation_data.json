    "To transform the word \"LOGS\" to \"GORE\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word**: LOGS\n\n2. **First Transformation**: Change one letter in \"LOGS\" to get closer to \"GORE\". \n   - We can change the 'L' to 'G' to form the word \"GOGS\". However, \"GOGS\" is not a valid English word.\n   - Alternatively, we can change the 'S' to 'E' to form the word \"LOGE\". \"LOGE\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation**: Change one letter in \"LOGE\" to get closer to \"GORE\".\n   - We can change the 'L' to 'G' to form the word \"GOGE\".
