    "To transform the word \"FOAL\" to \"DROP\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: FOAL**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"DROP\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: FOAL to FOOL**\n   - Change the letter 'A' to 'O' to form the word \"FOOL\".\n   - \"FOOL\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: FOOL to POOL**\n   - Change the letter 'F' to 'P' to form the word \"POOL\".\n   - \"POOL\" is a valid English word.\n\n4. **Third Transformation: POOL to POLL**\n   - Change the letter 'O' to 'L' to form the word \"POLL\".\n   - \"POLL\" is a valid English word.\n\n5. **Fourth Transformation: POLL to PALL**\n   - Change the letter 'O' to 'A' to form the word \"PALL\".\n   - \"PALL\" is a valid English word.\n\n6. **Fifth Transformation: PALL to PALP**\n   - Change the letter 'L' to 'P' to form the word \"PALP\".\n   - \"PALP\" is a valid English word.\n\n7. **Sixth Transformation: PALP to PLOP**\n   - Change the letter 'A' to 'O' to form the word \"PLOP\".\n   - \"PLOP\" is a valid English word.\n\n8. **Seventh Transformation: PLOP to PROP**\n   - Change the letter 'L' to 'R' to form the word \"PROP\".\n   - \"PROP\" is a valid English word.\n\n9. **Eighth Transformation: PROP to DROP**\n   - Change the letter 'P' to 'D' to form the word \"DROP\".\n   - \"DROP\" is the target word and is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these transformations, we have successfully changed \"FOAL\" to \"DROP\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of transformations is: FOAL, FOOL, POOL, POLL, PALL, PALP, PLOP, PROP, DROP.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<FOAL, FOOL, POOL, POLL, PALL, PALP, PLOP, PROP, DROP>>>"
