    "To transform the word \"COAL\" to \"KILL\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: COAL**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"KILL\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: COAL to COIL**\n   - Change the third letter 'A' to 'I'.\n   - COIL is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: COIL to KILL**\n   - Change the first letter 'C' to 'K'.\n   - KILL is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"COAL\" to \"KILL\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of words is: COAL, COIL, KILL.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<COAL, COIL, KILL>>>"
