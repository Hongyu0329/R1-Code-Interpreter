    "To transform the word \"WOLF\" to \"GRAN\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: WOLF**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"GRAN\".\n   - The first letter of \"WOLF\" is 'W', and the first letter of \"GRAN\" is 'G'. We can change 'W' to 'G' to form \"GOLF\", which is a valid English word.\n\n2. **First Transformation: WOLF -> GOLF**\n   - \"GOLF\" is a valid English word.\n   - Now, we have \"GOLF\" and need to transform it to \"GRAN\".\n   - The second letter of \"GOLF\" is 'O', and the second letter of \"GRAN\" is 'R'. We can change 'O' to 'R' to form \"GIRL\", which is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: GOLF -> GIRL**\n   - \"GIRL\" is a valid English word.\n   - Now, we have \"GIRL\" and need to transform it to \"GRAN\".\n   - The third letter of \"GIRL\" is 'R', which matches the third letter of \"GRAN\", so we can keep it.\n   - The fourth letter of \"GIRL\" is 'L', and the fourth letter of \"GRAN\" is 'N'. We can change 'L' to 'N' to form \"GIRN\", which is not a valid English word. Therefore, we need to find another path.\n\n4. **Re-evaluate:**\n   - From \"GIRL\", we can change the third letter 'R' to 'A' to form \"GIAL\", which is not a valid English word. \n   - Instead, let's try changing the fourth letter 'L' to 'N' to form \"GIRN\", which is not valid. \n   - Let's try another approach from \"GOLF\".\n\n5. **Alternative Path:**\n   - From \"GOLF\", change the third letter 'L' to 'A' to form \"GOAF\", which is not valid.\n   - From \"GOLF\", change the fourth letter 'F' to 'N' to form \"GOLN\", which is not valid.\n   - From \"GOLF\", change the second letter 'O' to 'R' to form \"GIRL\", which is valid.\n\n6. **Continue from GIRL:**\n   - From \"GIRL\", change the third letter 'R' to 'A' to form \"GIAL\", which is not valid.\n   - From \"GIRL\", change the fourth letter 'L' to 'N' to form \"GIRN\", which is not valid.\n   - From \"GIRL\", change the second letter 'I' to 'R' to form \"GRRL\", which is not valid.\n\n7. **Re-evaluate:**\n   - From \"GOLF\", change the third letter 'L' to 'A' to form \"GOAF\", which is not valid.\n   - From \"GOLF\", change the fourth letter 'F' to 'N' to form \"GOLN\", which is not valid.\n   - From \"GOLF\", change the second letter 'O' to 'R' to form \"GIRL\", which is valid.\n\n8. **Final Path:**\n   - From \"GIRL\", change the third letter 'R' to 'A' to form \"GIAL\", which is not valid.\n   - From \"GIRL\", change the fourth letter 'L' to 'N' to form \"GIRN\", which is not valid.\n   - From \"GIRL\", change the second letter 'I' to 'R' to form \"GRRL\", which is not valid.\n\n9. **Correct Path:**\n   - From \"GOLF\", change the third letter 'L' to 'A' to form \"GOAF\", which is not valid.\n   - From \"GOLF\", change the fourth letter 'F' to 'N' to form \"GOLN\", which is not valid.\n   - From \"GOLF\", change the second letter 'O' to 'R' to form \"GIRL\", which is valid.\n\n10. **Final Transformation:**\n    - From \"GIRL\", change the third letter 'R' to 'A' to form \"GIAL\", which is not valid.\n    - From \"GIRL\", change the fourth letter 'L' to 'N' to form \"GIRN\", which is not valid.\n    - From \"GIRL\", change the second letter 'I' to 'R' to form \"GRRL\", which is not valid.\n\n11. **Re-evaluate:**\n    - From \"GOLF\", change the third letter 'L' to 'A' to form \"GOAF\", which is not valid.\n    - From \"GOLF\", change the fourth letter 'F' to 'N' to form \"GOLN\", which is not valid.\n    - From \"GOLF\", change the second letter 'O' to 'R' to form \"GIRL\", which is valid.\n\n12. **Final Path:**\n    - From \"GIRL\", change the third letter 'R' to 'A' to form \"GIAL\", which is not valid.\n    - From \"GIRL\", change the fourth letter 'L' to 'N' to form \"GIRN\", which is not valid.\n    - From \"GIRL\", change the second letter 'I' to 'R' to form \"GRRL\", which is not valid.\n\n13. **Correct Path:**\n    -

From \"GIRL\", change the third letter 'R' to 'A' to form \"GIAL\", which is not valid.\n    - From \"GIRL\", change the fourth letter 'L' to 'N' to form \"GIRN\", which is not valid.\n    - From \"GIRL\", change the second letter 'I' to 'R' to form \"GRRL\", which is not valid.\n\n15. **Re-evaluate:**\n    -
