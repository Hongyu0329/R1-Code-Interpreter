    "To transform the word \"GAVE\" to \"DOSE\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: GAVE**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"DOSE\".\n   - The words must remain valid English words at each step.\n\n2. **First Transformation: GAVE to DAVE**\n   - Change the first letter 'G' to 'D'.\n   - \"DAVE\" is a valid English word (a common name).\n\n3. **Second Transformation: DAVE to DOVE**\n   - Change the second letter 'A' to 'O'.\n   - \"DOVE\" is a valid English word (a type of bird).\n\n4. **Third Transformation: DOVE to DOSE**\n   - Change the third letter 'V' to 'S'.\n   - \"DOSE\" is a valid English word (a quantity of medicine).\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word. The sequence of transformations is as follows:\n\n- GAVE\n- DAVE\n- DOVE\n- DOSE\n\nThus, the transformation sequence is complete.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<GAVE, DAVE, DOVE, DOSE>>>"
