    "To transform the word \"PLOY\" to \"COMP\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Word: PLOY**\n   - We need to change one letter at a time to eventually reach \"COMP\".\n\n2. **First Transformation: PLOY to POMP**\n   - Change the letter 'L' to 'M'.\n   - \"POMP\" is a valid English word.\n\n3. **Second Transformation: POMP to COMP**\n   - Change the letter 'P' to 'C'.\n   - \"COMP\" is a valid English word.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully transformed \"PLOY\" to \"COMP\" with each step being a valid English word.\n\nThe sequence of words is: PLOY, POMP, COMP.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<PLOY, POMP, COMP>>>"
