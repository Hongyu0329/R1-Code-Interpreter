    "To transform the word \"MORE\" to \"SING\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's analyze the transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Start with \"MORE\":**\n   - Current word: MORE\n\n2. **Change one letter to form a new word:**\n   - We can change the 'M' to 'S' to form the word \"SORE\".\n   - Current word: SORE\n\n3. **Change one letter to form a new word:**\n   - We can change the 'O' to 'I' to form the word \"SIRE\".\n   - Current word: SIRE\n\n4. **Change one letter to form a new word:**\n   - We can change the 'R' to 'N' to form the word \"SINE\".\n   - Current word: SINE\n\n5. **Change one letter to form a new word:**\n   - We can change the 'E' to 'G' to form the word \"SING\".\n   - Current word: SING\n\nEach step involves changing one letter and results in a valid English word. Therefore, the sequence of transformations is:\n\n<<<MORE, SORE, SIRE, SINE, SING>>>"
