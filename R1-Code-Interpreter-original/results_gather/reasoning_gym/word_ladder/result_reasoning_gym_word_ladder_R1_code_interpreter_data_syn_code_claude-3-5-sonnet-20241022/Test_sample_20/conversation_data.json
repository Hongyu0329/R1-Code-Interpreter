    "Let me solve this word ladder puzzle step by step.\n\n1. First, I need to check if there's a valid path from 'BOIL' to 'SLAB' by changing one letter at a time.\n2. I'll need a dictionary of 4-letter words and implement a breadth-first search algorithm.\n3. Let me write code to solve this efficiently:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque, defaultdict\n\n# First, let's create a set of common 4-letter words\nwords = set('''\nABLE ACID ACTS ADDS AGED

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
