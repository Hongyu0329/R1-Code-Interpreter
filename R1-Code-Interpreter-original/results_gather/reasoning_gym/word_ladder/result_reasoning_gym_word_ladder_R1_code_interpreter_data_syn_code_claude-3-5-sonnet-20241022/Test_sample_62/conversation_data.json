    "Let me solve this word ladder puzzle step by step.\n\n1. First, I need to check if there's a valid path from 'DAZE' to 'INNS' by changing one letter at a time.\n2. I'll need a dictionary of 4-letter words and implement a breadth-first search algorithm.\n3. Let me write code to solve this efficiently:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque, defaultdict\n\n# First, let's create a set of common 4-letter words\nwords = set('''\nABLE ACHE ACID ACRE ACTS
