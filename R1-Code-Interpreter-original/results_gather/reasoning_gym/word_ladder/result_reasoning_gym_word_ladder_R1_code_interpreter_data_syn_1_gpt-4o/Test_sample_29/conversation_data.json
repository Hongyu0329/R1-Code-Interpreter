    "To solve the word ladder problem, we need to transform the word \"FEEL\" into \"TEEM\" by changing one letter at a time, ensuring that each intermediate step is a valid English word.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Start with the word \"FEEL\".\n2. Change one letter at a time to form a new valid word.\n3. Continue this process until we reach the word \"TEEM\".\n\nWe need to ensure that each intermediate word is a valid English word. Let's try to find a sequence of words that satisfies these conditions.\n\n1. FEEL\n2. Change 'F' to 'T' to get \"TEEL\" (a valid word)\n3. Change 'L' to 'M' to get \"TEEM\" (the target word)\n\nThus, the sequence is: FEEL -> TEEL -> TEEM.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<FEEL,TEEL,TEEM>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Transform the word ladder 'FEEL' to 'TEEM' by changing one letter at a time.\nProvide your answer as a comma-separated sequence of uppercase letters without spaces, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<your answer>>>.\nEach step must be a valid English word."
