    "To solve the word ladder problem, we need to transform the word \"MAGE\" into \"PANG\" by changing one letter at a time, ensuring that each intermediate step is a valid English word. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the differences**: \n   - MAGE -> PANG\n   - M -> P\n   - A -> A (no change)\n   - G -> N\n   - E -> G\n\n2. **Plan the transformation**:\n   - We need to change 'M' to 'P', 'G' to 'N', and 'E' to 'G'.\n   - Each change must result in a valid English word.\n\n3. **Generate possible transformations**:\n   - Start with \"MAGE\".\n   - Change one letter at a time, checking for valid words.\n\n4. **Use Python to find a valid sequence**:\n   - We can use a dictionary of English words to verify each step.\n   - Implement a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from \"MAGE\" to \"PANG\".\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the sequence:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# A small dictionary of words for demonstration purposes\n# In a real scenario, this would be a comprehensive list of English words\nword_list = {\"MAGE\", \"PAGE\", \"PANE\", \"PANG\", \"MANG\", \"MANY\", \"MINE\", \"PING\", \"PINE\"}\n\ndef is_valid_word(word):\n    return word in word_list\n\ndef get_neighbors(word):\n    neighbors = []\n    for i in range(len(word)):\n        for c in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':\n            if c != word[i]:\n                new_word = word[:i] + c + word[i+1:]\n                if is_valid_word(new_word):\n                    neighbors.append(new_word)\n    return neighbors\n\ndef word_ladder(start, end):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set([start])\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_word, path = queue.popleft()\n        if current_word == end:\n            return path\n        \n        for neighbor in get_neighbors(current_word):\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))\n    \n    return []\n\n# Find the word ladder\nladder = word_ladder(\"MAGE\", \"PANG\")\nprint(\",\".join(ladder))\n```\n\nThis script will find the shortest sequence of valid words transforming \"MAGE\" to \"PANG\". Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code successfully found a valid word ladder from \"MAGE\" to \"PANG\". The sequence of words is:\n\n- MAGE\n- PAGE\n- PANE\n- PANG\n\nEach step involves changing one letter to form a valid English word. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<MAGE,PAGE,PANE,PANG>>>"
