    "To solve the word ladder problem, we need to transform the word \"CELT\" into \"NECK\" by changing one letter at a time, ensuring that each intermediate step is a valid English word. \n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Start with the word \"CELT\".\n2. Change one letter at a time to form a new valid English word.\n3. Continue this process until we reach the word \"NECK\".\n\nWe need to ensure that each intermediate word is a valid English word. Let's try to find a sequence of words that accomplishes this transformation.\n\n1. CELT\n2. Change 'C' to 'B': BELT\n3. Change 'B' to 'M': MELT\n4. Change 'M' to 'N': NELT (not a valid word, so let's try another path)\n5. Change 'T' to 'K': MELK (not a valid word, so let's try another path)\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n1. CELT\n2. Change 'T' to 'K': CELK (not a valid word, so let's try another path)\n3. Change 'L' to 'C': CECK (not a valid word, so let's try another path)\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. CELT\n2.
