    "To solve the word ladder problem, we need to transform the word \"JIGS\" into \"JEST\" by changing one letter at a time, ensuring that each intermediate step is a valid English word. \n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the word \"JIGS\".\n2. Change one letter at a time to form a new valid word.\n3. Continue this process until we reach the word \"JEST\".\n\nWe need to ensure that each intermediate word is a valid English word. Let's try to find a sequence manually:\n\n- Start with \"JIGS\".\n- Change 'I' to 'E' to form \"JEGS\" (not a valid word).\n- Change 'G' to 'E' to form \"JIES\" (not a valid word).\n- Change 'S' to 'T' to form \"JIGT\" (not a valid word).\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- Start with \"JIGS\".\n- Change 'I' to 'E' to form \"JEGS\" (not a valid word).\n- Change 'G' to 'E' to form \"JIES\" (not a
