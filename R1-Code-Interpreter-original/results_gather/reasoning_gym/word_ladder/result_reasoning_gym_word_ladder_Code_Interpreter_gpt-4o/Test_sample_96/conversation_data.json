    "\nassistant > To transform the word \"OPUS\" to \"SKIS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Here's one possible sequence:\n\n1. OPUS\n2. ONUS\n3. ONES\n4. ORES\n5. SRES\n6. SKES\n7. SKIS\n\nHowever, \"SRES\" and \"SKES\" are not valid English words. Let's try another approach:\n\n1. OPUS\n2. ONUS\n3. ONES\n4. ORES\n5. SKES\n6. SKIS\n\nAgain, \"SKES\" is not a valid English word. Let's try another approach:\n\n1. OPUS\n2. ONUS\n3. ONES\n4. SONS\n5. SINS\n6. SKIS\n\nThis sequence works, as each step is a valid English word. Therefore, the transformation is:\n\n<<<OPUS,ONUS,ONES,SONS,SINS,SKIS>>>"
