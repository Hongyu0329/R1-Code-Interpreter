    "\nassistant > To transform the word \"VANS\" to \"KIRS\" by changing one letter at a time, we need to ensure that each intermediate step is a valid English word. Let's find a sequence that accomplishes this:\n\n1. VANS\n2. VANS -> VANS (no change)\n3. VANS -> VINS (change 'A' to 'I')\n4. VINS -> VIRS (change 'N' to 'R')\n5. VIRS -> KIRS (change 'V' to 'K')\n\nThe sequence is:\n\n<<<VANS,VINS,VIRS,KIRS>>>"
