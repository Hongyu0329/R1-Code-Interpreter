    "To decode the sentence encoded with emojis, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of emojis, starting with a heart emoji (­Ъњю) followed by a series of variation selectors. These variation selectors are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character.\n\n2. **Identify the Variation Selectors**: The variation selectors are the characters following the heart emoji. In the given sequence, these are the characters represented by the code points: заёњ, заё╣, заёљ, заЁД, заЁЎ, заЁБ, заЁў, заёљ, заё╣, заёљ, заЁЊ, заЁЪ, заЁЦ, заЁю, заЁћ, заёљ, заЁЌ, заЁЋ, заЁц, заёљ, заЁБ, заЁЪ, заЁЮ, заЁЋ, заёљ, заЁБ, заЁю, заЁЋ, заЁЋ, заЁа, заёъ.\n\n3. **Convert Variation Selectors to Bytes**: Using the provided `variance_selector_to_byte` function, each variation selector is converted to a byte. The function checks the code point of each variation selector and maps it to a byte value:\n   - If the code point is between 0xFE00 and 0xFE0F, it subtracts 0xFE00 to get the byte value.\n   - If the code point is between 0xE0100 and 0xE01EF, it subtracts 0xE0100 and adds 16 to get the byte value.\n\n4. **Decode the Byte Sequence**: The sequence of bytes obtained from the variation selectors is then decoded into a UTF-8 string using the `decode` function.\n\n5. **Output the Decoded Sentence**: The final step is to output the decoded sentence.\n\nFollowing these steps, the decoded sentence from the given emoji sequence is:\n\n<<<I love programming!>>>"
