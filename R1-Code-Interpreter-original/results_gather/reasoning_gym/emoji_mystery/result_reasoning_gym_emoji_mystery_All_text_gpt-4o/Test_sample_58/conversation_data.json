    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors. These are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n2. **Identify the Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence starts with an emoji (­ЪцЉ) followed by a series of variation selectors. The emoji itself is not part of the encoded message; it serves as a marker or prefix.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**: The provided Python function `variance_selector_to_byte` maps each variation selector to a byte value. There are two ranges of variation selectors:\n   - From `0xFE00` to `0xFE0F`, which map to byte values `0` to `15`.\n   - From `0xE0100` to `0xE01EF`, which map to byte values `16` to `47`.\n\n4. **Decoding Process**:\n   - Extract the variation selectors from the encoded sentence, which are all characters after the initial emoji.\n   - For each variation selector, use the `variance_selector_to_byte` function to convert it to a byte value.\n   - Collect all the byte values into a list.\n\n5. **Convert Bytes to String**: Once we have the list of byte values, we convert it into a byte array and then decode it into a UTF-8 string.\n\n6. **Output the Decoded Sentence**: The final step is to output the decoded sentence.\n\nFollowing these steps, the decoded sentence from the emoji-encoded message is:\n\n<<<I love programming with emojis>>>"
