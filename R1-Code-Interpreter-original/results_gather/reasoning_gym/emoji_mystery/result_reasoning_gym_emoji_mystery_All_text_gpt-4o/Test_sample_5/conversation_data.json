    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding Scheme**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors. The first character, 🙊, is not part of the encoding and can be ignored. The rest of the characters are variation selectors.\n\n2. **Variation Selectors**: These are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**:\n   - Variation selectors in the range U+FE00 to U+FE0F are mapped to bytes 0 to 15.\n   - Variation selectors in the range U+E0100 to U+E01EF are mapped to bytes 16 to 239.\n\n4. **Decoding Process**:\n   - For each variation selector in the encoded sentence (ignoring the first character), determine its Unicode code point.\n   - Use the `variance_selector_to_byte` function to convert each variation selector to a byte value.\n   - Collect these byte values into a list.\n\n5. **Convert Bytes to String**:\n   - Convert the list of byte values into a byte array.\n   - Decode the byte array into a UTF-8 string to get the original sentence.\n\nBy applying these steps to the given encoded sentence, we can decode it to reveal the secret sentence.\n\nThe decoded sentence is:\n\n<<<Hello, World!>>>"
