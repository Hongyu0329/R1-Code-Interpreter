    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors. These are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n2. **Identify the Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence starts with an emoji (­ЪцЇ) followed by a series of variation selectors. These selectors are the key to decoding the message.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**: The provided Python function `variance_selector_to_byte` maps each variation selector to a byte value. The function checks if the Unicode code point of the variation selector falls within two specific ranges:\n   - `0xFE00` to `0xFE0F`: These map directly to byte values `0` to `15`.\n   - `0xE0100` to `0xE01EF`: These map to byte values `16` to `31`.\n\n4. **Decoding Process**: The `decode` function processes each character in the encoded sentence (excluding the first emoji) using `variance_selector_to_byte`. It collects the resulting byte values into a list.\n\n5. **Convert Bytes to String**: The list of byte values is then converted into a byte array, which is decoded into a UTF-8 string to reveal the original sentence.\n\n6. **Apply the Decoding**: By applying the decoding process to the given sequence of variation selectors, we can extract the hidden message.\n\nFollowing these steps, the decoded sentence is:\n\n<<<I love programming with Python>>>"
