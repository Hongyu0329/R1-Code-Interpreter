    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding Scheme**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors following an emoji. Each variation selector corresponds to a byte value.\n\n2. **Identify the Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence starts with an emoji (😓) followed by a series of variation selectors. These selectors are special Unicode characters that modify the preceding character, but in this context, they are used to encode data.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Byte Values**:\n   - Variation selectors in the range `0xFE00` to `0xFE0F` map to byte values `0` to `15`.\n   - Variation selectors in the range `0xE0100` to `0xE01EF` map to byte values `16` to `47`.\n\n4. **Extract the Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence is given as a string, and we need to extract the characters following the emoji, which are the variation selectors.\n\n5. **Convert Variation Selectors to Byte Values**: For each variation selector, determine its Unicode code point and convert it to a byte value using the mapping rules.\n\n6. **Form a Byte Array**: Collect all the byte values into a byte array.\n\n7. **Decode the Byte Array**: Convert the byte array into a string using UTF-8 decoding.\n\n8. **Output the Decoded Sentence**: The result of the decoding process is the secret sentence.\n\nFollowing these steps, the secret sentence is decoded as follows:\n\n<<<this is a secret message>>>"
