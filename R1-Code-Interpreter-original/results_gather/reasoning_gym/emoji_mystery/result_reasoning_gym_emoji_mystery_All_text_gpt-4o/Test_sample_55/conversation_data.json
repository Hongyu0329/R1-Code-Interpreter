    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow the steps outlined in the provided Python functions. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Encoding**: \n   - The emoji sequence starts with a base emoji (😚) followed by a series of variation selectors. These variation selectors are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character, but in this context, they are used to encode data.\n\n2. **Variation Selector to Byte Conversion**:\n   - The function `variance_selector_to_byte` converts a variation selector into a byte value. \n   - It checks if the Unicode code point of the variation selector falls within two specific ranges:\n     - From 0xFE00 to 0xFE0F: These are standard variation selectors, and the function subtracts 0xFE00 to get a byte value.\n     - From 0xE0100 to 0xE01EF: These are supplementary variation selectors, and the function subtracts 0xE0100 and adds 16 to get a byte value.\n\n3. **Decoding the Sentence**:\n   - The `decode` function processes the encoded sentence by iterating over each variation selector (ignoring the initial emoji).\n   - For each variation selector, it uses `variance_selector_to_byte` to convert it to a byte value.\n   - These byte values are collected into a list, which is then converted into a byte array.\n   - Finally, the byte array is decoded into a UTF-8 string, which is the secret sentence.\n\n4. **Applying the Decoding Process**:\n   - The encoded sentence is: 😚󠅃󠅝󠅙󠅤󠅘󠄐󠅤󠅟󠄐󠄴󠅢󠄞\n   - Ignoring the initial emoji (😚), we focus on the variation selectors: 󠅃, 󠅝, 󠅙, 󠅤, 󠅘, 󠄐, 󠅤, 󠅟, 󠄐, 󠄴, 󠅢, 󠄞.\n   - Convert each variation selector to a byte using the `variance_selector_to_byte` function.\n   - Collect the byte values and decode them into a UTF-8 string.\n\nBy following these steps, we decode the emoji-encoded sentence to reveal the secret message.\n\nThe final decoded sentence is: <<<hello world>>>"
