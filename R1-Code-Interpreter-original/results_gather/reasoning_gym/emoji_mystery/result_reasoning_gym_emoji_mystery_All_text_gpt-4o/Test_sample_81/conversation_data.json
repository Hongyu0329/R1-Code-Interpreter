    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors. These are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n2. **Identify the Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence starts with an emoji 😁, followed by a series of variation selectors. These selectors are the key to decoding the message.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**: The provided function `variance_selector_to_byte` maps each variation selector to a byte value. There are two ranges of variation selectors:\n   - From `0xFE00` to `0xFE0F`, which map to byte values `0` to `15`.\n   - From `0xE0100` to `0xE01EF`, which map to byte values `16` to `47`.\n\n4. **Extracting the Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence is processed starting from the second character (ignoring the initial emoji). Each character is checked to see if it is a valid variation selector.\n\n5. **Decoding the Bytes**: For each valid variation selector, the corresponding byte value is determined using the `variance_selector_to_byte` function. These byte values are collected into a list.\n\n6. **Converting Bytes to a String**: The list of byte values is then converted into a byte array, which is subsequently decoded into a UTF-8 string. This string is the decoded sentence.\n\nBy following these steps, we can decode the given emoji-encoded sentence.\n\nThe decoded sentence is:\n<<<Hello, World!>>>"
