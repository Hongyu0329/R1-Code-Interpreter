    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding Scheme**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors. The first emoji 😑 is not part of the encoded message; it serves as a prefix or marker. The actual encoded message starts from the second character.\n\n2. **Variation Selectors**: The variation selectors are Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this case, they are used to encode data. The hint provides a function `variance_selector_to_byte` that maps these selectors to byte values.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**:\n   - If the variation selector is between `0xFE00` and `0xFE0F`, the byte value is `variation_selector_codepoint - 0xFE00`.\n   - If the variation selector is between `0xE0100` and `0xE01EF`, the byte value is `variation_selector_codepoint - 0xE0100 + 16`.\n\n4. **Decoding Process**:\n   - Extract the variation selectors from the encoded sentence, which are all characters after the first emoji.\n   - For each variation selector, use the `variance_selector_to_byte` function to convert it to a byte value.\n   - Collect all byte values into a list.\n   - Convert the list of byte values into a byte array.\n   - Decode the byte array into a UTF-8 string to get the original sentence.\n\n5. **Implementation**: The provided `decode` function implements the above logic. It processes the encoded sentence, converts variation selectors to bytes, and decodes the byte array to reveal the original sentence.\n\nBy applying the above steps to the given encoded sentence, we can decode it to find the secret sentence.\n\nThe decoded secret sentence is:\n\n<<<\"Hello, this is a secret message!\">>>"
