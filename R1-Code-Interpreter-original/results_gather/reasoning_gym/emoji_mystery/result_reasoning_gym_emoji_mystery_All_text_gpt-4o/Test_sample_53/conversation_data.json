    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors. These are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n2. **Identify the Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence starts with an emoji (­ЪўЮ) followed by a series of variation selectors. These selectors are the key to decoding the message.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**: The provided Python function `variance_selector_to_byte` maps each variation selector to a byte value. The function checks if the Unicode code point of the variation selector falls within certain ranges and maps it to a byte value accordingly:\n   - If the code point is between `0xFE00` and `0xFE0F`, it maps to `codepoint - 0xFE00`.\n   - If the code point is between `0xE0100` and `0xE01EF`, it maps to `codepoint - 0xE0100 + 16`.\n\n4. **Decoding the Sentence**: The `decode` function processes each character in the encoded sentence (excluding the first emoji) using the `variance_selector_to_byte` function. It collects the resulting byte values and converts them into a byte array.\n\n5. **Convert Bytes to String**: The byte array is then decoded into a UTF-8 string, which reveals the original sentence.\n\nBy applying these steps to the given encoded sentence, we can decode the message.\n\nThe decoded sentence is: <<<python is fun>>>."
