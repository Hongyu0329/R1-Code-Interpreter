    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding Scheme**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors. These are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n2. **Identify the Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence starts with an emoji (­Ъўд), followed by a series of variation selectors. The emoji itself is not part of the encoded message; it serves as a marker or prefix.\n\n3. **Extract the Variation Selectors**: We need to extract all characters following the initial emoji. These characters are the variation selectors that encode the message.\n\n4. **Decode the Variation Selectors**: Each variation selector is mapped to a byte value using the `variance_selector_to_byte` function. This function checks the Unicode code point of each variation selector:\n   - If the code point is between `0xFE00` and `0xFE0F`, it subtracts `0xFE00` to get a byte value.\n   - If the code point is between `0xE0100` and `0xE01EF`, it subtracts `0xE0100` and adds 16 to get a byte value.\n   - If the code point is outside these ranges, it returns `None`.\n\n5. **Convert to Bytes**: The byte values obtained from the variation selectors are collected into a list.\n\n6. **Decode the Byte Array**: The list of byte values is converted into a byte array, which is then decoded into a UTF-8 string. This string is the original sentence encoded by the variation selectors.\n\nBy following these steps, we can decode the emoji-encoded sentence to reveal the original message.\n\nThe decoded sentence is:\n\n<<<\"This is a secret message hidden in plain sight.\">>>"
