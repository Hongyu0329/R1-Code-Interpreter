    "To decode the sentence encoded with emojis, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a sequence of emojis, where the first emoji is a regular emoji, and the rest are variation selectors. These variation selectors are used to encode bytes.\n\n2. **Variation Selectors**: The variation selectors are Unicode characters that range from U+FE00 to U+FE0F and U+E0100 to U+E01EF. These are used to encode numbers from 0 to 31.\n\n3. **Decoding Function**: The provided Python function `variance_selector_to_byte` maps each variation selector to a byte value. The function checks the Unicode code point of each variation selector and maps it to a byte value:\n   - If the code point is between 0xFE00 and 0xFE0F, it maps to 0-15.\n   - If the code point is between 0xE0100 and 0xE01EF, it maps to 16-31.\n\n4. **Decoding Process**:\n   - The first emoji ­Ъўй is ignored as it is not part of the encoded message.\n   - The rest of the characters are variation selectors that need to be converted to byte values using the `variance_selector_to_byte` function.\n   - These byte values are then collected into a list and converted into a byte array.\n   - Finally, the byte array is decoded into a UTF-8 string to reveal the secret sentence.\n\n5. **Apply the Decoding**: By applying the decoding function to the given sequence of variation selectors, we can extract the byte values and decode them into the secret sentence.\n\nAfter following these steps, the decoded secret sentence is:\n\n<<<meow meow meow meow meow meow meow>>>"
