    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding Scheme**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors. Each variation selector is mapped to a byte value using the `variance_selector_to_byte` function.\n\n2. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**:\n   - If the variation selector's codepoint is between `0xFE00` and `0xFE0F`, the byte value is `variation_selector_codepoint - 0xFE00`.\n   - If the variation selector's codepoint is between `0xE0100` and `0xE01EF`, the byte value is `variation_selector_codepoint - 0xE0100 + 16`.\n\n3. **Extract Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence starts with an emoji ­ЪўЅ, followed by a series of variation selectors. We need to extract these variation selectors, which are the characters after the first emoji.\n\n4. **Convert Variation Selectors to Bytes**: For each variation selector, use the `variance_selector_to_byte` function to convert it to a byte value. Collect these byte values into a list.\n\n5. **Decode the Byte List**: Convert the list of byte values into a byte array and decode it using UTF-8 to get the original sentence.\n\nBy following these steps, we can decode the sentence. Applying this process to the given encoded sentence, we obtain the decoded message.\n\nThe final decoded sentence is:\n\n<<<The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog>>>"
