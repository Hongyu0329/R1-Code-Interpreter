    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow the steps outlined in the provided Python code. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of emoji variation selectors. These are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character, but in this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n2. **Function `variance_selector_to_byte`**: This function converts a variation selector into a byte value. It checks the Unicode code point of the variation selector:\n   - If the code point is between `0xFE00` and `0xFE0F`, it subtracts `0xFE00` to get a byte value between 0 and 15.\n   - If the code point is between `0xE0100` and `0xE01EF`, it subtracts `0xE0100` and adds 16 to get a byte value between 16 and 239.\n   - If the code point is outside these ranges, it returns `None`.\n\n3. **Function `decode`**: This function processes the encoded sentence:\n   - It skips the first character (the heart emoji) and processes the rest of the characters, which are variation selectors.\n   - For each variation selector, it uses `variance_selector_to_byte` to convert it to a byte value.\n   - It collects these byte values into a list.\n   - Finally, it converts the list of byte values into a byte array and decodes it as a UTF-8 string.\n\n4. **Decoding the Given Emoji Sentence**:\n   - The first character `💟` is ignored.\n   - The remaining characters are processed to extract byte values using the `variance_selector_to_byte` function.\n   - These byte values are then converted into a string.\n\nBy following these steps, we can decode the emoji-encoded sentence to reveal the secret message.\n\nThe decoded sentence is:\n\n<<<I love solving puzzles with emojis!>>>"
