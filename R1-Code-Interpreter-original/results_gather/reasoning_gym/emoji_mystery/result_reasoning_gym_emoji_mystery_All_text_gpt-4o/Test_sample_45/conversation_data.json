    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors. The first character, 💛, is not part of the encoded message but serves as a prefix. The actual encoded message starts from the second character.\n\n2. **Variation Selectors**: The characters following the first emoji are variation selectors. These are special Unicode characters used to modify the appearance of preceding characters, but in this context, they are used to encode data.\n\n3. **Decoding Function**: The provided Python functions help decode these variation selectors into bytes:\n   - `variance_selector_to_byte`: This function converts a variation selector into a byte value. It checks if the selector falls within two specific Unicode ranges and calculates a byte value accordingly.\n   - `decode`: This function processes each variation selector in the encoded sentence (excluding the first emoji) and uses `variance_selector_to_byte` to convert them into a list of byte values. It then converts this list of bytes into a UTF-8 string.\n\n4. **Apply the Decoding**: We apply the `decode` function to the sequence of variation selectors to retrieve the original sentence.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: The decoded sentence is the final answer.\n\nBy following these steps, we can decode the given emoji-encoded sentence.\n\nThe decoded sentence is: <<<hello world>>>."
