    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of emoji variation selectors. These are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character, but in this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n2. **Identify the Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence starts with an emoji 😚, followed by a series of variation selectors. The hint provides a function `variance_selector_to_byte` that maps these selectors to byte values.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**:\n   - The function `variance_selector_to_byte` checks if a variation selector falls within two specific Unicode ranges:\n     - From 0xFE00 to 0xFE0F: These are mapped to byte values 0 to 15.\n     - From 0xE0100 to 0xE01EF: These are mapped to byte values 16 to 239.\n   - If a variation selector falls outside these ranges, it returns `None`.\n\n4. **Decoding Process**:\n   - The `decode` function processes the encoded sentence by skipping the first character (the emoji) and iterating over the remaining characters (the variation selectors).\n   - For each variation selector, it uses `variance_selector_to_byte` to convert it to a byte value.\n   - These byte values are collected into a list `decoded_bytes`.\n\n5. **Convert Bytes to String**:\n   - The list of byte values is then converted into a byte array.\n   - This byte array is decoded into a UTF-8 string, which is the original sentence.\n\n6. **Apply the Decoding**:\n   - By applying the above logic to the given encoded sentence, we can extract the original sentence.\n\nThe final decoded sentence is:\n\n<<<I love programming with emojis>>>"
