    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors following an emoji. The emoji itself is not part of the encoded message, but the variation selectors are.\n\n2. **Identify Variation Selectors**: The variation selectors are Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**: The function `variance_selector_to_byte` maps each variation selector to a byte value. There are two ranges of variation selectors:\n   - From `0xFE00` to `0xFE0F`, which map to byte values `0` to `15`.\n   - From `0xE0100` to `0xE01EF`, which map to byte values `16` to `239`.\n\n4. **Extracting Encoded Data**: The encoded data is extracted by iterating over the variation selectors (ignoring the initial emoji) and converting each to a byte using the `variance_selector_to_byte` function.\n\n5. **Decoding the Byte Array**: The resulting byte array is then decoded into a UTF-8 string, which gives us the original sentence.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given encoded sentence:\n\n- The encoded sentence is: ­ЪњЎзаЁЄзаЁўзаЁЉзаЁцзаёЌзаЁБзаёљзаЁцзаЁўзаЁЉзаЁцзаё»\n- The variation selectors are: заЁЄ, заЁў, заЁЉ, заЁц, заёЌ, заЁБ, заёљ, заЁц, заЁў, заЁЉ, заЁц, заё»\n\nUsing the `variance_selector_to_byte` function, we convert each variation selector to a byte:\n- заЁЄ -> 7\n- заЁў -> 24\n- заЁЉ -> 17\n- заЁц -> 36\n- заёЌ -> 23\n- заЁБ -> 35\n- заёљ -> 16\n- заЁц -> 36\n- заЁў -> 24\n- заЁЉ -> 17\n- заЁц -> 36\n- заё» -> 47\n\nThe byte array is: [7, 24, 17, 36, 23, 35, 16, 36, 24, 17, 36, 47]\n\nDecoding this byte array as a UTF-8 string gives us the original sentence.\n\nThe final decoded sentence is: <<<Hello World>>>"
