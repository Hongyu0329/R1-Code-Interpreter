    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding Scheme**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors. The first emoji (­ЪњЌ) is not part of the encoding and can be ignored. The rest are variation selectors.\n\n2. **Variation Selectors**: These are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**:\n   - Variation selectors in the range `0xFE00` to `0xFE0F` are mapped to bytes `0` to `15`.\n   - Variation selectors in the range `0xE0100` to `0xE01EF` are mapped to bytes `16` to `239`.\n\n4. **Decoding Process**:\n   - Iterate over each variation selector in the encoded sentence (ignoring the first emoji).\n   - Convert each variation selector to its corresponding byte using the `variance_selector_to_byte` function.\n   - Collect these bytes into a list.\n\n5. **Convert Bytes to String**:\n   - Convert the list of bytes into a byte array.\n   - Decode the byte array into a UTF-8 string to get the original sentence.\n\nBy following these steps, we can decode the given emoji-encoded sentence.\n\nThe decoded sentence is: <<<I love solving puzzles with emojis!>>>"
