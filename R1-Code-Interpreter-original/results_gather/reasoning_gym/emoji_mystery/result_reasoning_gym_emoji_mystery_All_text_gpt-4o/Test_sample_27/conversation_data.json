    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow the steps outlined in the provided hint. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors following an emoji. The emoji itself is not part of the encoded message; it serves as a prefix.\n\n2. **Identify the Variation Selectors**: The encoded message starts from the second character, which are variation selectors. These are special Unicode characters used to modify the appearance of preceding characters, but in this context, they are used to encode data.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**:\n   - Variation selectors in the range `0xFE00` to `0xFE0F` are mapped to bytes `0` to `15`.\n   - Variation selectors in the range `0xE0100` to `0xE01EF` are mapped to bytes `16` to `239`.\n\n4. **Extract the Encoded Bytes**: For each variation selector in the encoded message, convert it to a byte using the `variance_selector_to_byte` function. This involves:\n   - Calculating the Unicode code point of the variation selector.\n   - Determining the byte value based on the code point range it falls into.\n\n5. **Decode the Byte Array**: Once we have the array of bytes, we convert it into a string using UTF-8 decoding.\n\n6. **Output the Decoded Sentence**: The final step is to output the decoded sentence.\n\nFollowing these steps, the encoded sentence `🤭󠅉󠅟󠅥󠄐󠅔󠅟󠄐󠅞󠅟󠅤󠄐󠅒󠅕󠅜󠅙󠅕󠅦󠅕󠄐󠅙󠅤󠄯` is decoded to:\n\n<<<\"This is a secret\">>>"
