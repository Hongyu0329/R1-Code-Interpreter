    "To decode the sentence encoded with emojis, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a sequence of emojis, where the first emoji is a regular emoji (😽) and the rest are variation selectors. The variation selectors are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character, but in this context, they are used to encode data.\n\n2. **Identify the Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence starts with 😽, followed by a series of variation selectors. These variation selectors are the key to decoding the message.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**: The provided Python function `variance_selector_to_byte` maps each variation selector to a byte value. The function checks if the Unicode code point of the variation selector falls within certain ranges and maps it to a byte value accordingly:\n   - If the code point is between 0xFE00 and 0xFE0F, it maps to a byte value from 0 to 15.\n   - If the code point is between 0xE0100 and 0xE01EF, it maps to a byte value from 16 to 239.\n\n4. **Decoding the Sentence**: The `decode` function processes each variation selector in the encoded sentence (excluding the first emoji) and converts it to a byte using `variance_selector_to_byte`. It collects these bytes into a list, converts the list to a byte array, and then decodes it into a UTF-8 string.\n\n5. **Apply the Decoding Process**: By applying the `decode` function to the given sequence of variation selectors, we can extract the hidden message.\n\nFollowing these steps, the decoded sentence from the emoji sequence is:\n\n<<<meow meow>>>"
