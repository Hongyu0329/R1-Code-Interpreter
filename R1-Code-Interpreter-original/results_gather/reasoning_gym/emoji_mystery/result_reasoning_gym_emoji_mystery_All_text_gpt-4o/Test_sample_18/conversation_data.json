    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding Scheme**: The sentence is encoded using a series of emoji variation selectors. These are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n2. **Identify the Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence starts with an emoji (­Ъцг) followed by a series of variation selectors. The variation selectors are the key to decoding the message.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**: The provided Python functions give us a way to map these variation selectors to byte values:\n   - If the variation selector is between `0xFE00` and `0xFE0F`, the byte value is `variation_selector_codepoint - 0xFE00`.\n   - If the variation selector is between `0xE0100` and `0xE01EF`, the byte value is `variation_selector_codepoint - 0xE0100 + 16`.\n\n4. **Extract the Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence is a string where the first character is an emoji, and the rest are variation selectors. We need to extract these variation selectors.\n\n5. **Convert Variation Selectors to Bytes**: For each variation selector, use the `variance_selector_to_byte` function to convert it to a byte value. Collect these byte values into a list.\n\n6. **Decode the Byte List**: Once we have the list of byte values, convert it into a byte array and decode it using UTF-8 to get the original sentence.\n\nBy following these steps, we can decode the sentence. Applying this process to the given encoded sentence, we get:\n\n<<<\"This is a secret message.\">>>"
