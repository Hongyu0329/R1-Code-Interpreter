    "To decode the sentence encoded with emojis, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding Scheme**: The sentence is encoded using a series of emojis, where the first emoji is a placeholder and the rest are variation selectors. Each variation selector corresponds to a byte value.\n\n2. **Variation Selector to Byte Conversion**: The function `variance_selector_to_byte` converts a variation selector to a byte. It checks the Unicode code point of the variation selector:\n   - If the code point is between `0xFE00` and `0xFE0F`, it subtracts `0xFE00` to get a byte value between 0 and 15.\n   - If the code point is between `0xE0100` and `0xE01EF`, it subtracts `0xE0100` and adds 16 to get a byte value between 16 and 47.\n\n3. **Decoding Process**: The `decode` function processes the encoded sentence:\n   - It skips the first emoji (🤔) and processes the rest.\n   - For each variation selector, it uses `variance_selector_to_byte` to get the corresponding byte value.\n   - It collects these byte values into a list.\n   - Finally, it converts the list of byte values into a byte array and decodes it into a UTF-8 string.\n\n4. **Apply the Decoding**: By applying the above logic to the given encoded sentence, we can decode the secret sentence.\n\nFollowing these steps, the decoded sentence is:\n\n<<<\"This is a secret message!\">>>"
