    "To decode the sentence encoded with emojis, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors. These are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n2. **Identify the Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence starts with an emoji (😚) followed by a series of variation selectors. The emoji itself is not part of the encoded message; it serves as a marker or prefix.\n\n3. **Extract Variation Selectors**: The relevant part of the encoded message is the sequence of variation selectors following the emoji. These are the characters that need to be decoded.\n\n4. **Decode the Variation Selectors**: Each variation selector is mapped to a byte value using the `variance_selector_to_byte` function. This function checks the Unicode code point of each variation selector and maps it to a byte value:\n   - If the code point is between 0xFE00 and 0xFE0F, it subtracts 0xFE00 to get a byte value.\n   - If the code point is between 0xE0100 and 0xE01EF, it subtracts 0xE0100 and adds 16 to get a byte value.\n\n5. **Convert to Bytes**: The byte values obtained from the variation selectors are collected into a list.\n\n6. **Decode the Bytes**: The list of byte values is converted into a byte array, which is then decoded into a UTF-8 string. This string is the secret sentence.\n\nBy following these steps, we can decode the encoded sentence:\n\nThe decoded sentence is: <<<meet me at the park at five>>>"
