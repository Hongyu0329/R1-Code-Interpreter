    "To decode the sentence encoded with emojis, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a sequence of emojis, starting with a base emoji (😏) followed by a series of variation selectors. These variation selectors are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character, but in this context, they are used to encode data.\n\n2. **Identify the Variation Selectors**: The sequence of variation selectors follows the initial emoji. In the given sequence, these are the characters after the first emoji.\n\n3. **Decode the Variation Selectors**: Each variation selector is mapped to a byte value using the `variance_selector_to_byte` function. This function checks the Unicode code point of each variation selector and maps it to a byte value:\n   - If the code point is between 0xFE00 and 0xFE0F, it subtracts 0xFE00 to get a value between 0 and 15.\n   - If the code point is between 0xE0100 and 0xE01EF, it subtracts 0xE0100 and adds 16 to get a value between 16 and 31.\n\n4. **Convert to Bytes**: The byte values obtained from the variation selectors are collected into a list.\n\n5. **Decode the Bytes**: The list of byte values is then converted into a byte array, which is decoded into a UTF-8 string to reveal the original sentence.\n\nBy applying these steps to the given sequence of variation selectors, we can decode the secret sentence.\n\nThe decoded sentence is: <<<I love solving puzzles!>>>"
