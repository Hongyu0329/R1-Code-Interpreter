    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding Scheme**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors following an emoji. The function `variance_selector_to_byte` maps these variation selectors to byte values.\n\n2. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**:\n   - If the variation selector is between `0xFE00` and `0xFE0F`, the byte value is `variation_selector_codepoint - 0xFE00`.\n   - If the variation selector is between `0xE0100` and `0xE01EF`, the byte value is `variation_selector_codepoint - 0xE0100 + 16`.\n\n3. **Extract Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence starts with an emoji `🙊`, and the rest are variation selectors. We need to process these variation selectors to decode the sentence.\n\n4. **Decode the Sentence**:\n   - Initialize an empty list `decoded_bytes` to store the byte values.\n   - Iterate over each character in the variation selectors part of the encoded sentence.\n   - Use the `variance_selector_to_byte` function to convert each variation selector to a byte value.\n   - Append the byte value to `decoded_bytes` if it is not `None`.\n   - Convert the list of byte values to a byte array and decode it using UTF-8 to get the original sentence.\n\n5. **Output the Decoded Sentence**: The final step is to output the decoded sentence.\n\nFollowing these steps, the decoded sentence is:\n\n<<<\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\">>>"
