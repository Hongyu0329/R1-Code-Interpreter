    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow the steps outlined in the provided hint. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Emoji and Variation Selectors:**\n   - The given encoded sentence is: üëæÛ†Ñ®Û†ÑêÛ†ÖüÛ†Ö¢Û†ÑêÛ†Ñ°Û†Ñû\n   - The first character is an emoji: üëæ\n   - The remaining characters are variation selectors: Û†Ñ®Û†ÑêÛ†ÖüÛ†Ö¢Û†ÑêÛ†Ñ°Û†Ñû\n\n2. **Understand the Functionality of `variance_selector_to_byte`:**\n   - This function converts a variation selector into a byte value.\n   - It checks if the variation selector is within two specific ranges:\n     - If the codepoint is between 0xFE00 and 0xFE0F, it subtracts 0xFE00 to get a byte value.\n     - If the codepoint is between 0xE0100 and 0xE01EF, it subtracts 0xE0100 and adds 16 to get a byte value.\n\n3. **Apply the Function to Each Variation Selector:**\n   - We need to apply `variance_selector_to_byte` to each of the variation selectors in the sequence.\n   - The sequence of variation selectors is: Û†Ñ®, Û†Ñê, Û†Öü, Û†Ö¢, Û†Ñê, Û†Ñ°, Û†Ñû\n\n4. **Convert Each Variation Selector to a Byte:**\n   - For each variation selector, determine its codepoint and apply the function:\n     - Û†Ñ®: Codepoint is 0xE028, which is in the range 0xE0100 to 0xE01EF. So, byte value = 0xE028 - 0xE0100 + 16 = 40.\n     - Û†Ñê: Codepoint is 0xE010, which is in the range 0xE0100 to 0xE01EF. So, byte value = 0xE010 - 0xE0100 + 16 = 16.\n     - Û†Öü: Codepoint is 0xE05F, which is in the range 0xE0100 to 0xE01EF. So, byte value = 0xE05F - 0xE0100 + 16 = 95.\n     - Û†Ö¢: Codepoint is 0xE062, which is in the range 0xE0100 to 0xE01EF. So, byte value = 0xE062 - 0xE0100 + 16 = 98.\n     - Û†Ñê: Codepoint is 0xE010, which is in the range 0xE0100 to 0xE01EF. So, byte value = 0xE010 - 0xE0100 + 16 = 16.\n     - Û†Ñ°: Codepoint is 0xE021, which is in the range 0xE0100 to 0xE01EF. So, byte value = 0xE021 - 0xE0100 + 16 = 33.\n     - Û†Ñû: Codepoint is 0xE01E, which is in the range 0xE0100 to 0xE01EF. So, byte value = 0xE01E - 0xE0100 + 16 = 30.\n\n5. **Form the Byte Array:**\n   - The byte array formed from these values is: [40, 16, 95, 98, 16, 33, 30]\n\n6. **Decode the Byte Array to a String:**\n   - Convert the byte array to a string using UTF-8 decoding.\n   - The decoded string is: \"(P_bP!~\"\n\nTherefore, the secret sentence is:\n\n<<<(P_bP!~>>>"
