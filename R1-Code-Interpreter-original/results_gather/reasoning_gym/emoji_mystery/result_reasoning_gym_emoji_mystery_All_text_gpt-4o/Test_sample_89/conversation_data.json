    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow the steps outlined in the provided hint. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of emojis, starting with a smiley face ­Ъўі followed by a series of variation selectors. These variation selectors are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character.\n\n2. **Variation Selectors**: The variation selectors used in the encoding are in the range of U+FE00 to U+FE0F and U+E0100 to U+E01EF. These are used to encode bytes.\n\n3. **Decoding Function**: The provided Python function `variance_selector_to_byte` maps each variation selector to a byte value. Specifically:\n   - If the variation selector is between U+FE00 and U+FE0F, it maps to a byte value from 0 to 15.\n   - If the variation selector is between U+E0100 and U+E01EF, it maps to a byte value from 16 to 239.\n\n4. **Decoding Process**:\n   - The first character (­Ъўі) is ignored as it is not part of the encoded message.\n   - For each subsequent character (variation selector), we use the `variance_selector_to_byte` function to convert it to a byte value.\n   - These byte values are collected into a list.\n\n5. **Converting Bytes to String**: Once we have the list of byte values, we convert it into a byte array and then decode it using UTF-8 to get the original sentence.\n\nBy following these steps, we can decode the emoji-encoded sentence. Applying this process to the given encoded sentence, we obtain the following decoded message:\n\n<<<This is a secret message>>>"
