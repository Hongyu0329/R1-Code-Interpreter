    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of emojis, starting with a base emoji (🤬) followed by a sequence of variation selectors. These variation selectors are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character.\n\n2. **Identify Variation Selectors**: The variation selectors are Unicode characters in the range U+FE00 to U+FE0F and U+E0100 to U+E01EF. These are used to encode the bytes of the original sentence.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**: \n   - If a variation selector is in the range U+FE00 to U+FE0F, it maps to a byte value from 0 to 15.\n   - If a variation selector is in the range U+E0100 to U+E01EF, it maps to a byte value from 16 to 239.\n\n4. **Extract Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence starts with the emoji 🤬, and the rest are variation selectors. We need to extract these variation selectors and convert them to byte values.\n\n5. **Convert to Bytes**: For each variation selector, determine its byte value using the `variance_selector_to_byte` function. Collect these byte values into a list.\n\n6. **Decode the Byte Array**: Convert the list of byte values into a byte array and decode it using UTF-8 to get the original sentence.\n\nBy following these steps, we can decode the emoji-encoded sentence to reveal the original message.\n\nThe decoded sentence is:\n\n<<<\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\">>>"
