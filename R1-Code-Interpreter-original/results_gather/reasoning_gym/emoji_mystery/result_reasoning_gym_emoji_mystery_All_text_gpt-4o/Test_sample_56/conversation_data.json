    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors following an emoji. The emoji itself (😢) is not part of the encoded message; it serves as a prefix.\n\n2. **Variation Selectors**: The variation selectors are Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n3. **Decoding Function**: The provided Python functions help decode the variation selectors into bytes:\n   - `variance_selector_to_byte` converts a variation selector into a byte value. It checks if the selector is within two specific ranges:\n     - From 0xFE00 to 0xFE0F, it subtracts 0xFE00 to get a byte value.\n     - From 0xE0100 to 0xE01EF, it subtracts 0xE0100 and adds 16 to get a byte value.\n   - `decode` function processes each character in the encoded sentence (excluding the first emoji) using `variance_selector_to_byte` and collects the resulting byte values.\n\n4. **Decoding Process**:\n   - Start with the encoded sentence: 😢󠅉󠅟󠅥󠄐󠅘󠅑󠅦󠅕󠄐󠅤󠅢󠅙󠅕󠅔󠄐󠅙󠅤󠄐󠅑󠅜󠅢󠅕󠅑󠅔󠅩󠄯\n   - Ignore the first emoji (😢).\n   - For each subsequent character, determine its byte value using `variance_selector_to_byte`.\n   - Collect these byte values into a list.\n   - Convert the list of byte values into a byte array.\n   - Decode the byte array into a UTF-8 string to get the original sentence.\n\n5. **Final Decoding**:\n   - The byte values obtained from the variation selectors are converted into a string using UTF-8 decoding.\n\nBy following these steps, the secret sentence is revealed.\n\nThe final decoded sentence is:\n<<<i love coding>>>"
