    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding Scheme**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors. These are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n2. **Identify the Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence starts with an emoji (­Ъњђ) followed by a series of variation selectors. The emoji itself is not part of the encoded message; it serves as a marker or prefix.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**: The hint provides a function `variance_selector_to_byte` that maps each variation selector to a byte value. The mapping is as follows:\n   - If the variation selector is between `0xFE00` and `0xFE0F`, the byte value is `variation_selector_codepoint - 0xFE00`.\n   - If the variation selector is between `0xE0100` and `0xE01EF`, the byte value is `variation_selector_codepoint - 0xE0100 + 16`.\n\n4. **Extracting the Variation Selectors**: We need to extract all the variation selectors from the encoded sentence, which are the characters following the initial emoji.\n\n5. **Decoding the Bytes**: For each variation selector, we use the `variance_selector_to_byte` function to convert it to a byte value. We collect these byte values into a list.\n\n6. **Converting Bytes to a String**: Once we have the list of byte values, we convert it into a byte array and then decode it into a UTF-8 string.\n\n7. **Output the Decoded Sentence**: The final step is to output the decoded sentence.\n\nFollowing these steps, the decoded sentence is:\n\n<<<\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\">>>"
