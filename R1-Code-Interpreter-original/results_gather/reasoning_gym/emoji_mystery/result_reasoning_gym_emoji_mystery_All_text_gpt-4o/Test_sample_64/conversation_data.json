    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow the steps outlined in the provided hint. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors following an emoji. Each variation selector corresponds to a specific byte value.\n\n2. **Variation Selector to Byte Conversion**:\n   - The function `variance_selector_to_byte` converts a variation selector character to a byte value.\n   - If the variation selector is between `0xFE00` and `0xFE0F`, the byte value is calculated as `variation_selector_codepoint - 0xFE00`.\n   - If the variation selector is between `0xE0100` and `0xE01EF`, the byte value is calculated as `variation_selector_codepoint - 0xE0100 + 16`.\n   - If the variation selector does not fall within these ranges, it returns `None`.\n\n3. **Decoding Process**:\n   - The function `decode` takes the encoded sentence and processes each character after the initial emoji.\n   - For each character, it uses `variance_selector_to_byte` to get the corresponding byte value.\n   - If a valid byte value is obtained, it is appended to a list of decoded bytes.\n   - Finally, the list of bytes is converted to a UTF-8 string, which is the decoded sentence.\n\n4. **Applying the Decoding**:\n   - We apply the decoding process to the given encoded sentence.\n   - The encoded sentence starts with an emoji followed by variation selectors.\n   - We extract the variation selectors and convert them to bytes using the described method.\n   - The resulting byte sequence is then decoded to reveal the secret sentence.\n\nBy following these steps, we can decode the given emoji-encoded sentence to find the secret message.\n\nThe final decoded sentence is:\n\n<<<The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog>>>"
