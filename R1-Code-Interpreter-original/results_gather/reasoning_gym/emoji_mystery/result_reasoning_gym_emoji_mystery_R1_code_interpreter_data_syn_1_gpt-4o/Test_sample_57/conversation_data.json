    "To decode the sentence from the emoji, we need to use the provided hint functions. The hint suggests that the emoji sentence is encoded using variation selectors, which are Unicode characters that modify the appearance of preceding characters. The `variance_selector_to_byte` function maps these variation selectors to byte values, which can then be decoded into a string.\n\nThe process involves:\n1. Ignoring the first character (the emoji) and focusing on the variation selectors.\n2. Converting each variation selector to a byte using the `variance_selector_to_byte` function.\n3. Collecting these bytes and decoding them into a UTF-8 string.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to decode the sentence.\n\n```python\ndef variance_selector_to_byte(variation_selector):\n    variation_selector_codepoint = ord(variation_selector)\n    if 0xFE00 <= variation_selector_codepoint <= 0xFE0F:\n        return variation_selector_codepoint - 0xFE00\n    elif 0xE0100 <= variation_selector_codepoint <= 0xE01EF:\n        return variation_selector_codepoint - 0xE0100 + 16\n    else:\n        return None\n\ndef decode(encoded_sentence):\n    decoded_bytes = []\n    variation_selectors_part = encoded_sentence[1:]\n    for char in variation_selectors_part:\n        byte_val = variance_selector_to_byte(char)\n        if byte_val is not None:\n            decoded_bytes.append(byte_val)\n    return bytes(decoded_bytes).decode('utf-8')\n\nencoded_sentence = \"­ЪўЅзаЁЊзаЁЪзаЁазаЁЕзаЁбзаЁЎзаЁЌзаЁўзаЁцзаёљзаЁюзаЁЉзаЁДзаёљзаЁЮзаЁЋзаЁЉзаЁъзаЁБзаёљзаЁцзаЁўзаЁЉзаЁцзаёљзаЁъзаЁЪзаёљзаЁЪзаЁъзаЁЋзаёљзаЁЪзаЁДзаЁъзаЁБзаёљзаЁЉзаёљзаЁЁзаЁъзаЁЎзаЁцзаЁЋзаЁћзаёљзаЁЃзаЁцзаЁЉзаЁцзаЁЋзаЁБзаёљзаЁЊзаЁЪзаЁазаЁЕзаЁбзаЁЎзаЁЌзаЁўзаЁцзаёљзаЁЎзаЁъзаёљзаЁцзаЁўзаЁЋзаЁБзаЁЋзаёљзаЁДзаЁЪзаЁбзаЁЏзаЁБзаёюзаёљзаЁБзаЁЪзаёљзаЁцзаЁўзаЁЋзаёљзаёХзаЁЪзаЁЦзаЁъзаЁћзаЁЉзаЁцзаЁЎзаЁЪзаЁъзаёљзаёўзаЁЉзаЁъзаЁћзаёљзаЁЕзаЁЪзаЁЦзаёЉ\"\ndecoded_sentence = decode(encoded_sentence)\nprint(decoded_sentence)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will decode the emoji-encoded sentence into a readable string.",

    "The consistent truncation of the output suggests that the input data might be incomplete or that there is a logical issue in the encoding or decoding process.

If the input string is indeed complete, the issue might be with the encoding logic or the way the bytes are being decoded.\n\nLet's try a different approach by examining the length of the decoded bytes and comparing it to the expected length of the output string.

If you have access to the complete input data, you can provide it, and we can attempt the decoding process again.\n\nIf the input data is indeed complete, then the issue might be with the encoding logic or the way the bytes are being interpreted.
