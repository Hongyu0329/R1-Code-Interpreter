    "To decode the given emoji-encoded sentence, we need to use the provided Python functions. The sentence is encoded using variation selectors, which are Unicode characters that modify the preceding character. The function `variance_selector_to_byte` maps these variation selectors to byte values, and the `decode` function converts these byte values into a UTF-8 string.\n\nLet's implement the decoding process using the provided functions and the given emoji-encoded sentence.\n\n```python\ndef variance_selector_to_byte(variation_selector):\n    variation_selector_codepoint = ord(variation_selector)\n    if 0xFE00 <= variation_selector_codepoint <= 0xFE0F:\n        return variation_selector_codepoint - 0xFE00\n    elif 0xE0100 <= variation_selector_codepoint <= 0xE01EF:\n        return variation_selector_codepoint - 0xE0100 + 16\n    else:\n        return None\n\ndef decode(encoded_sentence):\n    decoded_bytes = []\n    variation_selectors_part = encoded_sentence[1:]\n    for char in variation_selectors_part:\n        byte_val = variance_selector_to_byte(char)\n        if byte_val is not None:\n            decoded_bytes.append(byte_val)\n    return bytes(decoded_bytes).decode('utf-8')\n\n# The encoded sentence\nencoded_sentence = \"💙󠅇󠅘󠅑󠅤󠄗󠅣󠄐󠅤󠅘󠅑󠅤󠄯\"\n\n# Decode the sentence\ndecoded_sentence = decode(encoded_sentence)\nprint(decoded_sentence)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the secret sentence.",
