    "To decode the sentence from the emoji, we need to use the provided Python functions. The `variance_selector_to_byte` function converts each variation selector character into a byte value, and the `decode` function uses these byte values to construct a byte array, which is then decoded into a UTF-8 string.\n\nLet's implement the decoding process using the provided functions and the given emoji sequence.\n\n```python\ndef variance_selector_to_byte(variation_selector):\n    variation_selector_codepoint = ord(variation_selector)\n    if 0xFE00 <= variation_selector_codepoint <= 0xFE0F:\n        return variation_selector_codepoint - 0xFE00\n    elif 0xE0100 <= variation_selector_codepoint <= 0xE01EF:\n        return variation_selector_codepoint - 0xE0100 + 16\n    else:\n        return None\n\ndef decode(encoded_sentence):\n    decoded_bytes = []\n    variation_selectors_part = encoded_sentence[1:]\n    for char in variation_selectors_part:\n        byte_val = variance_selector_to_byte(char)\n        if byte_val is not None:\n            decoded_bytes.append(byte_val)\n    return bytes(decoded_bytes).decode('utf-8')\n\n# The encoded sentence\nencoded_sentence = \"💜󠄒󠄹󠄐󠅧󠅙󠅣󠅘󠄐󠄹󠄐󠅓󠅟󠅥󠅜󠅔󠄐󠅗󠅕󠅤󠄐󠅣󠅟󠅝󠅕󠄐󠅣󠅜󠅕󠅕󠅠󠄞\"\n\n# Decode the sentence\ndecoded_sentence = decode(encoded_sentence)\nprint(decoded_sentence)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the decoded sentence.",
