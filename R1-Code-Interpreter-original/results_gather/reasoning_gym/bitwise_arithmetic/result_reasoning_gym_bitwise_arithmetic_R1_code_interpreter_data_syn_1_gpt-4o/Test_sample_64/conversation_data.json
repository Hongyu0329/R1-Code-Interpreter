    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation given in the expression: \\((0xd25b + 0x5842) << 0x2\\).\n\n1. **Addition**: First, we add the two hexadecimal numbers \\(0xd25b\\) and \\(0x5842\\).\n2. **Left Shift**: Then, we perform a left shift operation by 2 bits on the result of the addition.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal, perform the addition, and then convert the result back to hexadecimal.\n- Perform the left shift operation on the result of the addition.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Perform the addition\nresult_addition = 0xd25b + 0x5842\n\n# Step 2: Perform the left shift operation\nresult_shift = result_addition << 2\n\n# Output the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result_shift))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\((0xd25b + 0x5842) << 0x2\\) is \\(0x4aa74\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x4aa74>>>"
