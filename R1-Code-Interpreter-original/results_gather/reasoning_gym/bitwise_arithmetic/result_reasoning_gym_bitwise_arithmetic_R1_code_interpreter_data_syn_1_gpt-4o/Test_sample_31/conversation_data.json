    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. The operations are multiplication and addition. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. First, we need to multiply two hexadecimal numbers: \\(0x7cfb\\) and \\(0xa9e9\\).\n2. Then, we need to add two hexadecimal numbers: \\(0x144f\\) and \\(0xa9cf\\).\n3. Finally, we multiply the results of the above two operations.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy, especially since the numbers are in hexadecimal format.\n\n```python\n# Define the hexadecimal numbers\nnum1 = 0x7cfb\nnum2 = 0xa9e9\nnum3 = 0x144f\nnum4 = 0xa9cf\n\n# Perform the calculations\nproduct1 = num1 * num2\nsum1 = num3 + num4\nfinal_product = product1 * sum1\n\n# Print the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_product))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the result of the given expression and print it in hexadecimal format. Let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the given expression is \\(0x3d9a6836e17a\\). \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x3d9a6836e17a>>>"
