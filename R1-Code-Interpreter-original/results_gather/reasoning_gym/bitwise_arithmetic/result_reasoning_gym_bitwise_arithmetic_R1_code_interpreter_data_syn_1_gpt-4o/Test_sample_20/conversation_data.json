    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate each part step by step, considering the operations and the hexadecimal values involved.\n\n1. **Right Shift Operation**: \n   - The expression `0x7cde >> 0x2` involves a right shift operation. In binary, a right shift by `n` positions is equivalent to dividing the number by `2^n`.\n   - `0x7cde` is a hexadecimal number. Converting it to decimal gives us `31966`.\n   - Right shifting `31966` by `2` positions is equivalent to dividing it by `4` (since `2^2 = 4`).\n\n2. **Subtraction**:\n   - The expression `0x29bd - 0xfc7e` involves subtraction.\n   - Convert `0x29bd` and `0xfc7e` to their decimal equivalents: `0x29bd` is `10685` and `0xfc7e` is `64638`.\n   - Subtract `64638` from `10685`.\n\n3. **Addition**:\n   - Add the result of the right shift operation to the result of the subtraction.\n\nLet's compute these steps using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Right shift operation\nright_shift_result = 0x7cde >> 0x2\n\n# Step 2: Subtraction\nsubtraction_result = 0x29bd - 0xfc7e\n\n# Step 3: Addition\nfinal_result = right_shift_result + subtraction_result\n\n# Convert the final result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(final_result)\n\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression in hexadecimal form. The final result of the expression \\((0x7cde >> 0x2) + (0x29bd - 0xfc7e)\\) is \\(-0xb38a\\).\n\n<<<-0xb38a>>>"
