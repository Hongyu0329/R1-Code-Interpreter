    "To solve the given expression, we need to break it down into parts and evaluate each part step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0xa154 - 0xa0cf) + (0xfc16 >> 0x2))\n\\]\n\n1. **Subtraction**: \\(0xa154 - 0xa0cf\\)\n2. **Right Shift**: \\(0xfc16 >> 0x2\\)\n3. **Addition**: Add the results of the above two operations.\n\nLet's evaluate each part:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal, perform the subtraction, and convert back to hexadecimal.\n2. **Right Shift**: Convert the hexadecimal number to decimal, perform the right shift operation, and convert back to hexadecimal.\n3. **Addition**: Add the results from the above two steps and convert the final result to hexadecimal.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtraction\nsubtraction_result = 0xa154 - 0xa0cf\n\n# Step 2: Right Shift\nright_shift_result = 0xfc16 >> 0x2\n\n# Step 3: Addition\nfinal_result = subtraction_result + right_shift_result\n\n# Convert the final result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(final_result)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final result.",
