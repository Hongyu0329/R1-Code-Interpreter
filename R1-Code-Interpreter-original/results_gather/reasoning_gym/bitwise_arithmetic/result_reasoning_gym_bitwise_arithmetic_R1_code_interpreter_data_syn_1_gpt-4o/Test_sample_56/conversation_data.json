    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations on the given hexadecimal numbers. The operations are as follows:\n\n1. Subtract 0x4b0 from 0xa123.\n2. Add 0xdb3c and 0x5864.\n3. Subtract the result of step 2 from the result of step 1.\n\nLet's perform these calculations step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate (0xa123 - 0x4b0)\n- Convert 0xa123 and 0x4b0 to decimal.\n- Perform the subtraction.\n- Convert the result back to hexadecimal.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate (0xdb3c + 0x5864)\n- Convert 0xdb3c and 0x5864 to decimal.\n- Perform the addition.\n- Convert the result back to hexadecimal.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the final result\n- Subtract the result of step 2 from the result of step 1.\n- Convert the final result to hexadecimal.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Step 1\nresult1 = 0xa123 - 0x4b0\n\n# Step 2\nresult2 = 0xdb3c + 0x5864\n\n# Step 3\nfinal_result = result1 - result2\n\n# Convert the final result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(final_result)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
