    "To solve the problem, we need to perform bitwise operations on the given hexadecimal number. The operations are a left shift followed by a right shift. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Left Shift (<<):** The left shift operation `0x5f7b << 0x3` means shifting the bits of `0x5f7b` to the left by 3 positions. This is equivalent to multiplying the number by \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n\n2. **Right Shift (>>):** The right shift operation `result >> 0x1` means shifting the bits of the result from the left shift to the right by 1 position. This is equivalent to dividing the number by \\(2^1 = 2\\).\n\nLet's perform these operations using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Initial value\nvalue = 0x5f7b\n\n# Perform left shift by 3\nleft_shifted = value << 0x3\n\n# Perform right shift by 1\nresult = left_shifted >> 0x1\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the bitwise operations. The final hexadecimal value after performing the left shift and right shift operations is `0x17dec`.\n\n<<<0x17dec>>>"
