    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. The operations are as follows:\n\n1. Subtract 0x55a4 from 0x651a.\n2. Subtract 0x2107 from the result of step 1.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- First, convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal to perform the subtraction.\n- Perform the subtraction operations in sequence.\n- Convert the final result back to hexadecimal.\n- If the result is negative, represent it as a negative hexadecimal value.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtract 0x55a4 from 0x651a\nresult1 = 0x651a - 0x55a4\n\n# Step 2: Subtract 0x2107 from the result of step 1\nfinal_result = result1 - 0x2107\n\n# Convert the final result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(final_result)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
