    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the following operations:\n\n1. Add the two hexadecimal numbers: 0x708 and 0x8a3.\n2. Right shift the result by 2 bits.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Addition of Hexadecimal Numbers:**\n   - 0x708 is equivalent to 1800 in decimal.\n   - 0x8a3 is equivalent to 2211 in decimal.\n   - Adding these two decimal numbers gives us 4011, which is equivalent to 0xfaB in hexadecimal.\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation:**\n   - Right shifting by 2 bits is equivalent to dividing the number by 4.\n   - 0xfaB in decimal is 4011.\n   - Dividing 4011 by 4 gives us 1002.75. Since we are dealing with integers, we take the floor value, which is 1002.\n   - 1002 in decimal is equivalent to 0x3ea in hexadecimal.\n\nNow, let's verify this with a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the hexadecimal numbers\nnum1 = 0x708\nnum2 = 0x8a3\n\n# Perform the addition\nsum_result = num1 + num2\n\n# Right shift the result by 2 bits\nfinal_result = sum_result >> 2\n\n# Print the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `0x3ea`. This confirms our manual calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final hexadecimal value after performing the operations is:\n\n<<<0x3ea>>>"
