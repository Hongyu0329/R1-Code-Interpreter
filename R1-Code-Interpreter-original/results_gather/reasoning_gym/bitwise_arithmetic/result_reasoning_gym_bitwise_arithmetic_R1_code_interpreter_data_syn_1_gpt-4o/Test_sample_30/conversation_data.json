    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. The operations include subtraction and multiplication. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: Calculate \\(0xe577 - 0x77f9\\).\n2. **Multiplication**: Calculate \\(0x2ccc \\times 0x830f\\).\n3. **Final Calculation**: Subtract the result of the multiplication from the result of the first subtraction.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy, especially since the numbers are in hexadecimal format and involve signed integers.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtraction\nsubtraction_result = 0xe577 - 0x77f9\n\n# Step 2: Multiplication\nmultiplication_result = 0x2ccc * 0x830f\n\n# Step 3: Final Calculation\nfinal_result = subtraction_result - multiplication_result\n\n# Output the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
