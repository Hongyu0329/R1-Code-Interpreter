    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of bitwise and arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Right Shift Operation**: \n   - We have `0xacc3` and we need to right shift it by `0x3` (which is 3 in decimal).\n   - Right shifting a number by 3 is equivalent to dividing the number by 2^3 (or 8).\n\n2. **Subtraction Operation**:\n   - We need to calculate `(0x3a20 - 0xdc9b)`.\n   - This involves subtracting two hexadecimal numbers.\n\n3. **Final Subtraction**:\n   - Subtract the result of the second operation from the result of the first operation.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Right shift 0xacc3 by 3\nright_shift_result = 0xacc3 >> 3\n\n# Step 2: Subtract 0x3a20 from 0xdc9b\nsubtraction_result = 0x3a20 - 0xdc9b\n\n# Step 3: Subtract the result of step 2 from step 1\nfinal_result = right_shift_result - subtraction_result\n\n# Output the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the computation. Let's interpret the result:\n\nThe final result of the expression \\((0xacc3 >> 0x3) - (0x3a20 - 0xdc9b)\\) is \\(0xb813\\).\n\nSince the problem asks for the final answer in hexadecimal format, and if the answer is negative, it should be represented as a negative value, not in two's-complement form. However, the result \\(0xb813\\) is positive.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0xb813>>>"
