    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform the following operations:\n\n1. Multiply the two hexadecimal numbers: \\(0xe82\\) and \\(0x6c09\\).\n2. Shift the result to the left by 3 bits.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- First, convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal to perform the multiplication.\n- Multiply the two decimal numbers.\n- Convert the result back to hexadecimal.\n- Perform the left shift operation on the hexadecimal result.\n- Convert the final result back to hexadecimal.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert hexadecimal to decimal and multiply\nresult = 0xe82 * 0x6c09\n\n# Step 2: Perform the left shift operation\nresult <<= 3\n\n# Step 3: Convert the result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(result)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the computation is \\(0x30fad490\\).\n\nTherefore, the final hexadecimal value after performing the operations is:\n\n<<<0x30fad490>>>"
