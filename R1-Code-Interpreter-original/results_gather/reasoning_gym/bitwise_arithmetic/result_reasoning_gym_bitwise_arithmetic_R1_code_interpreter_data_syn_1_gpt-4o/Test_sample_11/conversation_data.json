    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. The operations include multiplication, subtraction, and a bitwise left shift. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Hexadecimal Multiplication**: Multiply `0xacf1` by `0xb3cc`.\n2. **Hexadecimal Left Shift**: Shift `0x9a4b` to the left by `0x0` bits. Since shifting by zero bits means the number remains unchanged, `0x9a4b` remains `0x9a4b`.\n3. **Subtraction**: Subtract the result of the left shift from the result of the multiplication.\n\nLet's compute these operations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Perform the multiplication\nmultiplication_result = 0xacf1 * 0xb3cc\n\n# Step 2: Perform the left shift\nleft_shift_result = 0x9a4b << 0x0\n\n# Step 3: Subtract the left shift result from the multiplication result\nfinal_result = multiplication_result - left_shift_result\n\n# Output the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the computation is `0x7975b8c1`. Since the result is positive, we can directly use this value as the final answer.\n\n<<<0x7975b8c1>>>"
