    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. The operations are as follows:\n\n1. Multiply 0x1c92 by 0xd7a8.\n2. Add the result to the sum of 0x620e and 0x8a44.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- First, calculate the product of 0x1c92 and 0xd7a8.\n- Then, calculate the sum of 0x620e and 0x8a44.\n- Finally, add the two results together.\n\nWe will use Python to perform these calculations efficiently.\n\n```python\n# Define the hexadecimal values\na = 0x1c92\nb = 0xd7a8\nc = 0x620e\nd = 0x8a44\n\n# Perform the calculations\nproduct = a * b\nsum_cd = c + d\nresult = product + sum_cd\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
