    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. The operations are subtraction, bitwise right shift, and multiplication. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: Calculate \\(0x729a - 0x765d\\).\n2. **Bitwise Right Shift**: Perform a right shift on \\(0xee43\\) by 3 bits.\n3. **Multiplication**: Multiply the results from the subtraction and the right shift.\n\nLet's perform these calculations step by step using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtraction\nsubtraction_result = 0x729a - 0x765d\n\n# Step 2: Bitwise Right Shift\nright_shift_result = 0xee43 >> 3\n\n# Step 3: Multiplication\nfinal_result = subtraction_result * right_shift_result\n\n# Output the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
