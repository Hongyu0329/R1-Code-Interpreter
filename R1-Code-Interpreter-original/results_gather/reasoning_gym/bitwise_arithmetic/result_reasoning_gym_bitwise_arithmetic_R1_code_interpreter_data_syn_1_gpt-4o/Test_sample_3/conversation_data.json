    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate it step by step, considering the operations and the hexadecimal values involved. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0x4a31 - 0x6f85) - (0x10d2 >> 0x2))\n\\]\n\n1. **Subtraction**: Calculate \\(0x4a31 - 0x6f85\\).\n2. **Right Shift**: Calculate \\(0x10d2 >> 0x2\\).\n3. **Subtraction**: Subtract the result of the right shift from the result of the first subtraction.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- **Step 1**: Subtract \\(0x6f85\\) from \\(0x4a31\\).\n- **Step 2**: Right shift \\(0x10d2\\) by 2 bits.\n- **Step 3**: Subtract the result of Step 2 from the result of Step 1.\n\nNow, let's compute these steps using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtract 0x6f85 from 0x4a31\nstep1_result = 0x4a31 - 0x6f85\n\n# Step 2: Right shift 0x10d2 by 2 bits\nstep2_result = 0x10d2 >> 2\n\n# Step 3: Subtract the result of Step 2 from the result of Step 1\nfinal_result = step1_result - step2_result\n\n# Print the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression in hexadecimal format. The final answer to the expression \\(((0x4a31 - 0x6f85) - (0x10d2 >> 0x2))\\) is:\n\n<<<-0x2988>>>"
