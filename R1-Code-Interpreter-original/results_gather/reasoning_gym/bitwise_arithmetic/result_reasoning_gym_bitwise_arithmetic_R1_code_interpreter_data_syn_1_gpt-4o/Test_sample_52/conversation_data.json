    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform bitwise operations and arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0xff52 >> 0x2) + (0x80ac << 0x2))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Right Shift Operation**: \n   - \\(0xff52\\) is a hexadecimal number. In binary, it is represented as a 16-bit number: `1111 1111 0101 0010`.\n   - Right shifting by 2 bits (`>> 0x2`) means removing the two least significant bits and shifting the rest to the right. This is equivalent to integer division by 4.\n   - Perform the right shift operation.\n\n2. **Left Shift Operation**:\n   - \\(0x80ac\\) is another hexadecimal number. In binary, it is represented as: `1000 0000 1010 1100`.\n   - Left shifting by 2 bits (`<< 0x2`) means adding two zeros to the least significant bits and shifting the rest to the left. This is equivalent to multiplying by 4.\n   - Perform the left shift operation.\n\n3. **Addition**:\n   - Add the results of the right shift and left shift operations.\n\nLet's compute these operations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the hexadecimal numbers\nnum1 = 0xff52\nnum2 = 0x80ac\n\n# Perform the right shift and left shift operations\nright_shift_result = num1 >> 0x2\nleft_shift_result = num2 << 0x2\n\n# Add the results\nresult = right_shift_result + left_shift_result\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the result of the expression and print it in hexadecimal format.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression is `0x24284`. Since the problem specifies that if the answer is negative, it should be returned as a negative value, and the result here is positive, we can directly provide the final answer.\n\n<<<0x24284>>>"
