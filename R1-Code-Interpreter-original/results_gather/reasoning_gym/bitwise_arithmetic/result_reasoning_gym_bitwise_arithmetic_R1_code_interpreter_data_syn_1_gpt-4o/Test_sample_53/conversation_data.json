    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Multiply the two hexadecimal numbers: `0xe8b9` and `0xf30e`.\n2. Right shift the result by `0x1` (which is equivalent to shifting by 1 bit).\n3. Convert the final result to a hexadecimal value.\n4. If the result is negative, represent it as a negative hexadecimal value.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- `0xe8b9` is a hexadecimal number, which is `59577` in decimal.\n- `0xf30e` is a hexadecimal number, which is `62222` in decimal.\n\nFirst, we multiply these two numbers. Then, we perform a right shift by 1 bit on the result. Finally, we convert the result back to hexadecimal.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Define the hexadecimal numbers\nnum1 = 0xe8b9\nnum2 = 0xf30e\n\n# Multiply the numbers\nproduct = num1 * num2\n\n# Right shift the result by 1\nresult = product >> 1\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the computation is `0x6e7a2a8f`. Since the result is positive, we can directly use this value as the final answer.\n\n<<<0x6e7a2a8f>>>"
