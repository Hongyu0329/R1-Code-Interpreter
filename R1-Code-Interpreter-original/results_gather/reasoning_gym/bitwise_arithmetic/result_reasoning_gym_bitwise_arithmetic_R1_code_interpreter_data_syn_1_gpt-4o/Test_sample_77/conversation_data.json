    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation and bit manipulation as specified. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0x1afb + 0x3b47) << 0x0)\n\\]\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Addition**: First, we need to add the two hexadecimal numbers: `0x1afb` and `0x3b47`.\n\n2. **Bit Shift**: The result of the addition will then be left-shifted by `0x0` bits. Since shifting by zero bits means the number remains unchanged, this step will not alter the result of the addition.\n\n3. **Output**: Finally, we need to output the result in hexadecimal format.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Perform the addition\nresult = 0x1afb + 0x3b47\n\n# Step 2: Perform the left shift (which is effectively a no-op here)\nresult <<= 0x0\n\n# Step 3: Output the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\((0x1afb + 0x3b47) << 0x0\\) is \\(0x5642\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x5642>>>"
