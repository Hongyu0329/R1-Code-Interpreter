    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the following operations:\n\n1. Multiply the two hexadecimal numbers: \\(0xc18a\\) and \\(0x8eea\\).\n2. Shift the result to the left by 2 bits.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- First, convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal to perform the multiplication.\n- Multiply the two decimal numbers.\n- Convert the result back to hexadecimal.\n- Perform the left shift operation on the hexadecimal result.\n- Convert the final result back to hexadecimal.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert hexadecimal to decimal and multiply\nnum1 = 0xc18a\nnum2 = 0x8eea\nproduct = num1 * num2\n\n# Step 2: Perform the left shift operation\nresult = product << 2\n\n# Step 3: Convert the result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(result)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the result of the given expression and print it in hexadecimal format. Let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `0x1b02dd090`. This is the result of the expression \\((0xc18a \\times 0x8eea) \\ll 0x2\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x1b02dd090>>>"
