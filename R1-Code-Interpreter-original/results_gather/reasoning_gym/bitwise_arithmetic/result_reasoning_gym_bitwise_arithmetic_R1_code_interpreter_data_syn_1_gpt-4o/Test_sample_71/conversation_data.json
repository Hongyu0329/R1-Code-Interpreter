    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. The operations are as follows:\n\n1. Subtract 0x14fa from 0xb167.\n2. Shift the result to the left by 3 bits.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: We need to subtract 0x14fa from 0xb167. In decimal, this is equivalent to subtracting 5,122 from 45,671.\n\n2. **Bitwise Left Shift**: After obtaining the result from the subtraction, we need to perform a left shift by 3 bits. This is equivalent to multiplying the result by 2^3 (or 8 in decimal).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtract 0x14fa from 0xb167\nresult_subtraction = 0xb167 - 0x14fa\n\n# Step 2: Left shift the result by 3 bits\nresult_shift = result_subtraction << 3\n\n# Print the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result_shift))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the computation is 0x4e368. \n\nTherefore, the final answer to the problem is:\n\n<<<0x4e368>>>"
