    "To solve the problem, we need to perform bitwise operations on the given hexadecimal number. The operations are a right shift followed by a left shift. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Right Shift (>>):** The operation `0xad67 >> 0x3` means we need to right shift the hexadecimal number `0xad67` by 3 bits.\n2. **Left Shift (<<):** The result from the right shift operation is then left shifted by 2 bits as per the operation `<< 0x2`.\n\nLet's perform these operations using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Initial hexadecimal value\nvalue = 0xad67\n\n# Right shift by 3 bits\nright_shifted = value >> 0x3\n\n# Left shift the result by 2 bits\nresult = right_shifted << 0x2\n\n# Print the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the operations is `0x56b0`. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x56b0>>>"
