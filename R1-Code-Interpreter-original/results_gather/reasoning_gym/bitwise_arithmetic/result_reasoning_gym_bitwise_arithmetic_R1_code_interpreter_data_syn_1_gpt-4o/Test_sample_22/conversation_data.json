    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform the arithmetic operations in the correct order, taking into account the hexadecimal values and the operations specified:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: Calculate the product of `0x7ca7` and `0xe4cc`.\n2. **Left Shift**: Perform a left shift on `0x3910` by 2 bits.\n3. **Subtraction**: Subtract the result of the left shift from the product obtained in step 1.\n\nLet's break down the steps and calculate the result using Python:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Multiplication\nproduct = 0x7ca7 * 0xe4cc\n\n# Step 2: Left Shift\nshifted_value = 0x3910 << 2\n\n# Step 3: Subtraction\nresult = product - shifted_value\n\n# Output the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
