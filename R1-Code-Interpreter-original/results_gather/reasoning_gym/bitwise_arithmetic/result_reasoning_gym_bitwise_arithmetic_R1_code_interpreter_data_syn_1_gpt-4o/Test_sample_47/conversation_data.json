    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. The operations include subtraction and multiplication. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: \n   - First, subtract 0xba45 from 0x3ff2.\n   - Then, subtract 0x5ad5 from 0x11ef.\n\n2. **Multiplication**:\n   - Multiply the results of the two subtractions.\n\n3. **Hexadecimal Conversion**:\n   - Convert the final result into hexadecimal format.\n   - If the result is negative, represent it as a negative hexadecimal value.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Perform the arithmetic operations\nresult = (0x3ff2 - 0xba45) * (0x11ef - 0x5ad5)\n\n# Convert the result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(result)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code execution has provided the result in hexadecimal format. However, we need to ensure that if the result is negative, it should be represented as a negative hexadecimal value. Since the output is positive, we can directly use it.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0x22d53e92>>>"
