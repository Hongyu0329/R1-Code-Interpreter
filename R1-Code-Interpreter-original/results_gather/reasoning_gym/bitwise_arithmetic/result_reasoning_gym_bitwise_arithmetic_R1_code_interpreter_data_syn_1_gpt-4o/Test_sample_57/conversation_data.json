    "To solve the given expression \\(((0x24fd * 0x5922) >> 0x2)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply the two hexadecimal numbers**: \\(0x24fd\\) and \\(0x5922\\).\n2. **Right shift the result by 2 bits**: This is equivalent to dividing the result by 4.\n3. **Convert the final result to hexadecimal**: Ensure that if the result is negative, it is represented as a negative hexadecimal value.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Multiply the two hexadecimal numbers\nresult = 0x24fd * 0x5922\n\n# Step 2: Right shift the result by 2 bits (equivalent to dividing by 4)\nresult >>= 2\n\n# Step 3: Convert the result to hexadecimal\n# If the result is negative, Python will automatically handle the sign\nhex_result = hex(result)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\(((0x24fd * 0x5922) >> 0x2)\\) is \\(0x33837a6\\).\n\nTherefore, the final hexadecimal value is:\n\n<<<0x33837a6>>>"
