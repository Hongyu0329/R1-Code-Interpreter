    "To solve the given expression \\((0xd33b - 0xff5d) >> 0x3\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: Calculate \\(0xd33b - 0xff5d\\).\n2. **Bitwise Right Shift**: Perform a right shift by 3 bits on the result of the subtraction.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- **Subtraction**: \n  - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal.\n  - Perform the subtraction.\n  - Convert the result back to hexadecimal.\n\n- **Right Shift**:\n  - Convert the result of the subtraction to binary.\n  - Perform the right shift operation.\n  - Convert the result back to hexadecimal.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtraction\nresult_subtraction = 0xd33b - 0xff5d\n\n# Step 2: Right Shift\nresult_shift = result_subtraction >> 0x3\n\n# Output the final result in hexadecimal\nprint(hex(result_shift))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression \\((0xd33b - 0xff5d) >> 0x3\\) as \\(-0x585\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0x585>>>"
