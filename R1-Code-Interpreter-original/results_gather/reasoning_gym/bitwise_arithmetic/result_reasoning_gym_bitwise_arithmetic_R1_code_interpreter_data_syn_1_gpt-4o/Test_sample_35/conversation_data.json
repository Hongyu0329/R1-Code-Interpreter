    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform bitwise operations on the hexadecimal number `0x4550`. The operations are left shifts, which are equivalent to multiplying the number by powers of 2.\n\n1. **First Operation**: `0x4550 << 0x3`\n   - This operation shifts the bits of `0x4550` to the left by 3 positions. In terms of multiplication, this is equivalent to multiplying `0x4550` by \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n\n2. **Second Operation**: The result of the first operation is then shifted left by 1 position: `<< 0x1`\n   - This is equivalent to multiplying the result of the first operation by \\(2^1 = 2\\).\n\nLet's calculate the result step by step using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial value\nvalue = 0x4550\n\n# First shift: left shift by 3\nresult_after_first_shift = value << 0x3\n\n# Second shift: left shift by 1\nfinal_result = result_after_first_shift << 0x1\n\n# Print the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final result of the bitwise operations is `0x45500`. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x45500>>>"
