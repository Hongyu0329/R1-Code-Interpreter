    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate the bitwise operations step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0xd32d >> 0x0) << 0x1)\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Right Shift Operation**: \n   - The expression `0xd32d >> 0x0` means we are right-shifting the hexadecimal number `0xd32d` by `0x0` bits. \n   - Shifting by 0 bits means the number remains unchanged. So, `0xd32d >> 0x0` is simply `0xd32d`.\n\n2. **Left Shift Operation**:\n   - Next, we take the result from the previous step and left-shift it by `0x1` bit.\n   - Left-shifting a number by 1 bit is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2.\n\nLet's calculate the result using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Initial value\nvalue = 0xd32d\n\n# Right shift by 0 (no change)\nvalue = value >> 0x0\n\n# Left shift by 1 (equivalent to multiplying by 2)\nresult = value << 0x1\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\(((0xd32d >> 0x0) << 0x1)\\) is \\(0x1a65a\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x1a65a>>>"
