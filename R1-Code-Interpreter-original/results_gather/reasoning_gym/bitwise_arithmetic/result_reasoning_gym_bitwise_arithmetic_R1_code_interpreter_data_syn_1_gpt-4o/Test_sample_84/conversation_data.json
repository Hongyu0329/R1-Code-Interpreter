    "To solve the given expression \\(((0x33c * 0xc1ba) >> 0x3)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: Multiply the two hexadecimal numbers \\(0x33c\\) and \\(0xc1ba\\).\n2. **Right Shift**: Perform a right bitwise shift by 3 on the result of the multiplication.\n3. **Hexadecimal Conversion**: Convert the final result to hexadecimal format.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- **Step 1**: Multiply \\(0x33c\\) and \\(0xc1ba\\).\n- **Step 2**: Right shift the result by 3 bits.\n- **Step 3**: Convert the result to hexadecimal.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to get the final result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Multiplication\nresult = 0x33c * 0xc1ba\n\n# Step 2: Right Shift by 3\nresult >>= 3\n\n# Step 3: Convert to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(result)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the expression and print the result in hexadecimal format.",
