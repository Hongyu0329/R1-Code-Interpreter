    "To solve the given expression \\(((0x406d >> 0x3) << 0x2)\\), we need to perform bitwise operations step by step.\n\n1. **Right Shift Operation**: \n   - The expression starts with a right shift operation: \\(0x406d >> 0x3\\).\n   - The hexadecimal number \\(0x406d\\) is equivalent to the decimal number \\(16493\\).\n   - Right shifting by \\(0x3\\) (which is 3 in decimal) means dividing the number by \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n\n2. **Left Shift Operation**:\n   - After obtaining the result from the right shift, we perform a left shift: \\((result) << 0x2\\).\n   - Left shifting by \\(0x2\\) (which is 2 in decimal) means multiplying the number by \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial value\nvalue = 0x406d\n\n# Right shift by 3\nright_shifted = value >> 0x3\n\n# Left shift the result by 2\nresult = right_shifted << 0x2\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final result in hexadecimal format.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\(((0x406d >> 0x3) << 0x2)\\) is \\(0x2034\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x2034>>>"
