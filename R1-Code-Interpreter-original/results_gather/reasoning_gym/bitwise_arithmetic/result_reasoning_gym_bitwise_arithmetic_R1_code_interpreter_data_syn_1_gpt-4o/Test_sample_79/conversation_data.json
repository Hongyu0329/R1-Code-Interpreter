    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. The operations include multiplication, subtraction, and a bitwise right shift. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: Multiply `0x7f71` by `0x32b7`.\n2. **Bitwise Right Shift**: Right shift `0xd0c9` by `0x1` (which is equivalent to shifting by 1 bit).\n3. **Subtraction**: Subtract the result of the right shift from the result of the multiplication.\n\nFinally, we need to convert the result to a hexadecimal format. If the result is negative, it should be represented as a negative hexadecimal value.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Multiplication\nmultiplication_result = 0x7f71 * 0x32b7\n\n# Step 2: Bitwise Right Shift\nright_shift_result = 0xd0c9 >> 0x1\n\n# Step 3: Subtraction\nfinal_result = multiplication_result - right_shift_result\n\n# Convert the result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(final_result)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(hex_result)\n```",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the arithmetic operations is `0x193ec363`. This is the final hexadecimal value after performing the specified operations.\n\n<<<0x193ec363>>>"
