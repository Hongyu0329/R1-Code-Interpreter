    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform the arithmetic operations in the correct order, taking into account the bitwise operations and the signed integer representation.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[\n(0x6f42 \\times 0xda47) + (0x5ff3 \\ll 0x2)\n\\]\n\n1. **Multiplication**: First, we multiply `0x6f42` by `0xda47`.\n2. **Bitwise Shift**: Then, we perform a left shift on `0x5ff3` by 2 bits.\n3. **Addition**: Finally, we add the results of the multiplication and the bitwise shift.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Define the hexadecimal values\na = 0x6f42\nb = 0xda47\nc = 0x5ff3\nshift_amount = 0x2\n\n# Perform the operations\nmultiplication_result = a * b\nshift_result = c << shift_amount\nfinal_result = multiplication_result + shift_result\n\n# Print the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the expression and output the result in hexadecimal format. Let's execute it to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression is `0x5ede8f1a`. Since the problem specifies that if the answer is negative, it should be represented as a negative value, we need to check if this result is negative in the context of signed integers.\n\nHowever, given the operations and the result, `0x5ede8f1a` is a positive value. Therefore, we can directly provide the final answer.\n\n<<<0x5ede8f1a>>>"
