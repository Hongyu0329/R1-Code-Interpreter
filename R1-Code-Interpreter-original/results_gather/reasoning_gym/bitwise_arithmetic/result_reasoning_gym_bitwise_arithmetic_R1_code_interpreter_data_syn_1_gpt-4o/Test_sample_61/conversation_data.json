    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation given in the expression:\n\n1. Multiply the two hexadecimal numbers: \\(0xe315\\) and \\(0x1e15\\).\n2. Shift the result to the left by \\(0x0\\) bits, which effectively means no shift is applied.\n3. Convert the final result to a hexadecimal value.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- **Multiplication**: We multiply the two hexadecimal numbers. Since both numbers are positive, the result will also be positive.\n- **Left Shift**: Shifting by \\(0x0\\) means the result remains unchanged.\n- **Hexadecimal Conversion**: Convert the final result to hexadecimal format.\n\nNow, let's compute the result using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the hexadecimal numbers\nnum1 = 0xe315\nnum2 = 0x1e15\n\n# Perform the multiplication\nresult = num1 * num2\n\n# Perform the left shift (which is effectively no shift here)\nshifted_result = result << 0x0\n\n# Convert the result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(shifted_result)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the result of the given expression and output it in hexadecimal format.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\((0xe315 \\times 0x1e15) \\ll 0x0\\) is \\(0x1aaf16b9\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x1aaf16b9>>>"
