    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. The operations are as follows:\n\n1. Multiply 0xbf4f by 0x6e6f.\n2. Subtract 0xa7c5 from 0xe39c.\n3. Add the results of the above two operations.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- First, convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal to perform the arithmetic operations.\n- Perform the multiplication and subtraction.\n- Add the results of the multiplication and subtraction.\n- Convert the final result back to hexadecimal.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Convert hexadecimal to decimal and perform operations\nmultiplication_result = 0xbf4f * 0x6e6f\nsubtraction_result = 0xe39c - 0xa7c5\n\n# Add the results\nfinal_result = multiplication_result + subtraction_result\n\n# Convert the final result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(final_result)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final hexadecimal value.",
