    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: We need to subtract `0x4d33` from `0x7701`.\n2. **Right Shift**: The result of the subtraction needs to be right-shifted by `0x3` (which is 3 in decimal).\n\nLet's perform these operations using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Perform the subtraction\nresult_subtraction = 0x7701 - 0x4d33\n\n# Step 2: Perform the right shift\nresult_shift = result_subtraction >> 0x3\n\n# Print the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result_shift))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the operations. The final hexadecimal value after performing the subtraction and right shift is `0x539`.\n\n<<<0x539>>>"
