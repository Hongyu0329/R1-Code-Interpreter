    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the following operations:\n\n1. Multiply the two hexadecimal numbers: `0xfc9c` and `0x28a0`.\n2. Right shift the result by `0x1` (which is equivalent to shifting by 1 in decimal).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- First, convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal to perform the multiplication.\n- Multiply the two decimal numbers.\n- Perform the right shift operation on the result.\n- Convert the final result back to hexadecimal.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Convert hexadecimal to decimal\nnum1 = 0xfc9c\nnum2 = 0x28a0\n\n# Perform multiplication\nproduct = num1 * num2\n\n# Right shift the result by 1\nresult = product >> 1\n\n# Convert the result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(result)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the result of the given expression and print it in hexadecimal format.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `0x140b20c0`. This is the result of the expression \\((0xfc9c \\times 0x28a0) \\gg 0x1\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x140b20c0>>>"
