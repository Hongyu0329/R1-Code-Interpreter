    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the following operations step by step:\n\n1. Subtract the hexadecimal number `0x533b` from `0x849d`.\n2. Right shift the result by `0x3` (which is 3 in decimal).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- **Subtraction**: We need to subtract `0x533b` from `0x849d`.\n- **Right Shift**: After obtaining the result from the subtraction, we will perform a right shift by 3 bits.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtract 0x533b from 0x849d\nresult_subtraction = 0x849d - 0x533b\n\n# Step 2: Right shift the result by 3 bits\nresult_shift = result_subtraction >> 3\n\n# Print the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result_shift))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the computation is `0x62c`. \n\nTherefore, the final answer to the problem is:\n\n<<<0x62c>>>"
