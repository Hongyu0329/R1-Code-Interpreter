    "To solve the given expression \\(((0xa280 << 0x2) >> 0x1)\\), we need to follow the bitwise operations step by step:\n\n1. **Left Shift Operation**: The expression starts with a left shift operation on the hexadecimal number \\(0xa280\\). The left shift operator \\(<<\\) shifts the bits of the number to the left by the specified number of positions, in this case, \\(0x2\\) (which is 2 in decimal). This is equivalent to multiplying the number by \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation**: After the left shift, the result is then right shifted by \\(0x1\\) (which is 1 in decimal). The right shift operator \\(>>\\) shifts the bits of the number to the right by the specified number of positions. This is equivalent to dividing the number by \\(2^1 = 2\\).\n\nLet's perform these operations using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Initial value\nvalue = 0xa280\n\n# Perform left shift by 2\nleft_shifted = value << 0x2\n\n# Perform right shift by 1\nresult = left_shifted >> 0x1\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the result of the expression and print it in hexadecimal format. Let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\(((0xa280 << 0x2) >> 0x1)\\) is \\(0x14500\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x14500>>>"
