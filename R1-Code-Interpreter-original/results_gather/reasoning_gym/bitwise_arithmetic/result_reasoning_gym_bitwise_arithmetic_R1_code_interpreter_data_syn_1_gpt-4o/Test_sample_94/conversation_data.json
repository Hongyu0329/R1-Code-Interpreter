    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: We need to subtract `0x2dde` from `0xa627`.\n2. **Right Shift**: After obtaining the result from the subtraction, we need to perform a right shift by `0x3` (which is equivalent to 3 in decimal).\n\nLet's perform these operations step by step using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtraction\nresult_subtraction = 0xa627 - 0x2dde\n\n# Step 2: Right Shift\nresult_shift = result_subtraction >> 0x3\n\n# Output the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result_shift))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the operations. The subtraction and right shift operations have been performed correctly, and the final result is given in hexadecimal format.\n\nThe final answer to the problem is:\n\n<<<0xf09>>>"
