    "To solve the problem, we need to perform bitwise operations and arithmetic on hexadecimal numbers. The operations involved are right shifts and subtraction. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Right Shift Operations**:\n   - `0xed89 >> 0x3`: This operation shifts the bits of `0xed89` to the right by 3 positions.\n   - `0x37ea >> 0x1`: This operation shifts the bits of `0x37ea` to the right by 1 position.\n\n2. **Subtraction**:\n   - After performing the right shifts, subtract the result of the second operation from the first.\n\n3. **Hexadecimal Representation**:\n   - Convert the final result to a hexadecimal value. If the result is negative, it should be represented as a negative hexadecimal value.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Perform the right shift operations\nresult1 = 0xed89 >> 0x3\nresult2 = 0x37ea >> 0x1\n\n# Subtract the results\nfinal_result = result1 - result2\n\n# Print the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
