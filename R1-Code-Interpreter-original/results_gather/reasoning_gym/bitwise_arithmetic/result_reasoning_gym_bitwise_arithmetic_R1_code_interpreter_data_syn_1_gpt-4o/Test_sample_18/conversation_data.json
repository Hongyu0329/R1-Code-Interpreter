    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. The operations are subtraction, multiplication, and then another multiplication. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: Calculate \\(0xb24a - 0x7a21\\).\n2. **Multiplication**: Calculate \\(0x16ce \\times 0x8ada\\).\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the results from step 1 and step 2.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtraction\nsubtraction_result = 0xb24a - 0x7a21\n\n# Step 2: First Multiplication\nfirst_multiplication_result = 0x16ce * 0x8ada\n\n# Step 3: Final Multiplication\nfinal_result = subtraction_result * first_multiplication_result\n\n# Output the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
