    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. The operations are addition and multiplication. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. First, we need to add the two hexadecimal numbers: \\(0x9408\\) and \\(0x6a2\\).\n2. Next, we need to add the two hexadecimal numbers: \\(0x53d\\) and \\(0xe463\\).\n3. Finally, we multiply the results of the two additions.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Add the first pair of hexadecimal numbers\nfirst_sum = 0x9408 + 0x6a2\n\n# Step 2: Add the second pair of hexadecimal numbers\nsecond_sum = 0x53d + 0xe463\n\n# Step 3: Multiply the results of the two additions\nresult = first_sum * second_sum\n\n# Output the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the arithmetic operations is \\(0x8d256440\\). \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x8d256440>>>"
