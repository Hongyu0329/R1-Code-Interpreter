    "To solve the problem, we need to perform bitwise right shifts on the given hexadecimal number. The operation involves shifting the bits of the number to the right, which effectively divides the number by 2 for each shift.\n\nThe given expression is `((0xb766 >> 0x1) >> 0x1)`. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Start with the hexadecimal number `0xb766`.\n2. Perform the first right shift by 1 bit: `0xb766 >> 0x1`.\n3. Perform the second right shift by 1 bit on the result of the first shift: `(result of first shift) >> 0x1`.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Initial hexadecimal number\nnumber = 0xb766\n\n# First right shift by 1\nfirst_shift = number >> 0x1\n\n# Second right shift by 1\nsecond_shift = first_shift >> 0x1\n\n# Output the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(second_shift))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression `((0xb766 >> 0x1) >> 0x1)` is `0x2dd9`. \n\nSince the result is positive, we can directly provide the final answer in hexadecimal format.\n\n<<<0x2dd9>>>"
