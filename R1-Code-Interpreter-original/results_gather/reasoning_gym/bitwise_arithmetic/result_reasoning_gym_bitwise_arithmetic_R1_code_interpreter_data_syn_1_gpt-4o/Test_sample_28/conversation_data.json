    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation and bitwise shift as specified in the expression. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: We need to subtract the hexadecimal number `0x7cc7` from `0xcfd2`.\n\n2. **Bitwise Shift**: The result of the subtraction is then right-shifted by `0x0` bits. Since shifting by zero bits does not change the number, the result of the subtraction will be the final result.\n\n3. **Hexadecimal Representation**: Finally, we need to represent the result in hexadecimal form. If the result is negative, it should be represented as a negative hexadecimal value.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Perform the subtraction\nresult = 0xcfd2 - 0x7cc7\n\n# Right shift the result by 0x0 (which is 0 in decimal)\nshifted_result = result >> 0x0\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(shifted_result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final result.",
    "The code execution output is `0x530b`, which is the result of the arithmetic operation and bitwise shift as specified in the problem. Since the result is positive, it is represented directly in hexadecimal form.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x530b>>>"
