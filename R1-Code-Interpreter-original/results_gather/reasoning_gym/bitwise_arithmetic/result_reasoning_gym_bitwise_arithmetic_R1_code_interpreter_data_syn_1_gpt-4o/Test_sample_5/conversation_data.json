    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of bitwise and arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Right Shift Operation**: \n   - The expression `(0xa12 >> 0x2)` involves a right shift operation. In hexadecimal, `0xa12` is equivalent to `2578` in decimal. \n   - Right shifting by `0x2` (which is `2` in decimal) means dividing the number by `2^2 = 4`.\n   - So, `2578 >> 2` is equivalent to `2578 // 4`.\n\n2. **Addition**:\n   - The expression `(0xfc85 + 0xafd5)` involves adding two hexadecimal numbers.\n   - `0xfc85` is `64645` in decimal, and `0xafd5` is `45013` in decimal.\n   - Adding these two numbers gives us a result in decimal.\n\n3. **Final Addition**:\n   - Add the result of the right shift operation to the result of the addition operation.\n\nLet's compute these steps using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Right shift operation\nright_shift_result = 0xa12 >> 0x2\n\n# Step 2: Addition of two hexadecimal numbers\naddition_result = 0xfc85 + 0xafd5\n\n# Step 3: Final addition\nfinal_result = right_shift_result + addition_result\n\n# Output the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the final hexadecimal value.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the result of the computation in hexadecimal format. The final result of the expression `((0xa12 >> 0x2) + (0xfc85 + 0xafd5))` is `0x1aede`.\n\n<<<0x1aede>>>"
