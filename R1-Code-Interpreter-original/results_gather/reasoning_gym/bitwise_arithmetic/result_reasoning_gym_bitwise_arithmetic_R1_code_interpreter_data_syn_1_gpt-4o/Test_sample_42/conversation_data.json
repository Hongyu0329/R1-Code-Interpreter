    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform the following operations:\n\n1. Multiply the hexadecimal numbers 0x1fe0 and 0xcdcc.\n2. Right shift the result by 0x3 (which is 3 in decimal).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- First, convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal to perform the multiplication.\n- Multiply the two decimal numbers.\n- Perform a right shift operation on the result.\n- Convert the final result back to hexadecimal.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert hex to decimal and multiply\nresult = (0x1fe0 * 0xcdcc)\n\n# Step 2: Right shift the result by 3\nresult >>= 0x3\n\n# Step 3: Convert the result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(result)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
