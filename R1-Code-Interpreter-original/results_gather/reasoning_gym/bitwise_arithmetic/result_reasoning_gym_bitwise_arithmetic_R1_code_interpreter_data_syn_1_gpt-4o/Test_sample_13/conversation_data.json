    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation specified and then convert the result to a hexadecimal value. The operation involves multiplication and a bitwise left shift.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the operation:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: Multiply the two hexadecimal numbers `0x57b7` and `0x687`.\n2. **Bitwise Left Shift**: The result of the multiplication is then left-shifted by `0x0` bits. Since shifting by zero bits doesn't change the number, this step effectively leaves the multiplication result unchanged.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Define the hexadecimal numbers\nnum1 = 0x57b7\nnum2 = 0x687\n\n# Perform the multiplication\nresult = num1 * num2\n\n# Perform the left shift (which is effectively zero in this case)\nshifted_result = result << 0x0\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(shifted_result))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the result of the operation and print it in hexadecimal format. Let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the operation is `0x23c8b81`. Since the problem specifies that if the answer is negative, it should be represented as a negative value, we need to check if the result is negative. However, in this case, the result is positive.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x23c8b81>>>"
