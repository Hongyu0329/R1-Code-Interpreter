    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, taking into account the hexadecimal values and the bitwise shift operation. Here's the breakdown of the expression:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: \\(0x3a24 - 0x24b8\\)\n2. **Bitwise Right Shift**: \\(0x1741 >> 0x3\\)\n3. **Addition**: Add the results of the above two operations.\n\nLet's calculate each step:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: Convert the hexadecimal values to decimal, perform the subtraction, and convert back to hexadecimal.\n2. **Bitwise Right Shift**: Convert the hexadecimal value to decimal, perform the right shift, and convert back to hexadecimal.\n3. **Addition**: Add the results from step 1 and step 2.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtraction\nsubtraction_result = 0x3a24 - 0x24b8\n\n# Step 2: Bitwise Right Shift\nshift_result = 0x1741 >> 0x3\n\n# Step 3: Addition\nfinal_result = subtraction_result + shift_result\n\n# Output the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final result.",
