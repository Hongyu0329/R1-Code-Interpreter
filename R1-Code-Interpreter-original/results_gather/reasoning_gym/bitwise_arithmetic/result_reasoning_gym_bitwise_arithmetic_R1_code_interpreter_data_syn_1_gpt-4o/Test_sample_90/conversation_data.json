    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation and bitwise shift as specified in the expression:\n\n1. **Addition**: First, we add the two hexadecimal numbers `0xbbd0` and `0x5ed6`.\n2. **Bitwise Shift**: Then, we perform a right bitwise shift by `0x0` on the result of the addition. Since shifting by zero does not change the number, the result will be the same as the sum.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Define the hexadecimal numbers\nnum1 = 0xbbd0\nnum2 = 0x5ed6\n\n# Perform the addition\nresult = num1 + num2\n\n# Perform the right shift by 0x0\nfinal_result = result >> 0x0\n\n# Print the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the operation is `0x11aa6`. Since the problem specifies that if the answer is negative, it should be presented as a negative value, and the result here is positive, we can directly provide the final answer.\n\n<<<0x11aa6>>>"
