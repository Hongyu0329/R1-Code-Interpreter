    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform the operations step by step, taking into account the hexadecimal arithmetic and bitwise operations.\n\n1. **Addition**: First, we add the two hexadecimal numbers `0x9be9` and `0x5938`.\n\n2. **Bitwise Right Shift**: Next, we perform a right shift operation on `0x6b1e` by `0x3` (which is 3 in decimal). This operation effectively divides the number by 2^3 (or 8).\n\n3. **Final Addition**: Finally, we add the result of the first addition to the result of the right shift operation.\n\nLet's compute these steps using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Addition of 0x9be9 and 0x5938\nfirst_addition = 0x9be9 + 0x5938\n\n# Step 2: Right shift 0x6b1e by 3\nright_shift = 0x6b1e >> 3\n\n# Step 3: Final addition\nresult = first_addition + right_shift\n\n# Output the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the final result.",
