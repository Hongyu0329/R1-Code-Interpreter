    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform bitwise right shifts on the hexadecimal number `0x3f4d`. The operations are as follows:\n\n1. First, perform a right shift by `0x3` (which is 3 in decimal).\n2. Then, perform another right shift by `0x2` (which is 2 in decimal) on the result from step 1.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- Start with the hexadecimal number `0x3f4d`.\n- Convert `0x3f4d` to its binary form.\n- Perform the first right shift by 3 bits.\n- Perform the second right shift by 2 bits on the result from the first shift.\n- Convert the final binary result back to hexadecimal.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Initial hexadecimal value\nvalue = 0x3f4d\n\n# Perform the first right shift by 3 bits\nfirst_shift = value >> 0x3\n\n# Perform the second right shift by 2 bits\nsecond_shift = first_shift >> 0x2\n\n# Print the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(second_shift))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the result of the given expression and print it in hexadecimal format.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output is `0x1fa`. This is the result of performing the specified bitwise right shifts on the initial hexadecimal value `0x3f4d`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x1fa>>>"
