    "To solve the problem, we need to perform bitwise right shifts on two hexadecimal numbers and then add the results. The right shift operation (>>) effectively divides the number by 2 for each shift, and since we are dealing with signed integers, the sign bit is preserved.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Right Shift 0x970c by 2:**\n   - 0x970c is a hexadecimal number. In binary, it is represented as a signed integer.\n   - Right shifting by 2 means dividing the number by 4 (2^2).\n\n2. **Right Shift 0xe46c by 2:**\n   - Similarly, 0xe46c is another hexadecimal number.\n   - Right shifting by 2 means dividing the number by 4.\n\n3. **Add the Results:**\n   - After obtaining the results from the right shifts, we add them together.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the hexadecimal numbers\nnum1 = 0x970c\nnum2 = 0xe46c\n\n# Perform right shift by 2\nshifted_num1 = num1 >> 2\nshifted_num2 = num2 >> 2\n\n# Add the results\nresult = shifted_num1 + shifted_num2\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the calculation is `0x5ede`. \n\nTherefore, the final answer to the problem is:\n\n<<<0x5ede>>>"
