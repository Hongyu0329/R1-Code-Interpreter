    "To solve the given expression \\(((0xb7e1 * 0x6f4) << 0x3)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: First, multiply the two hexadecimal numbers \\(0xb7e1\\) and \\(0x6f4\\).\n2. **Left Shift**: Then, take the result of the multiplication and perform a left shift by 3 bits.\n3. **Hexadecimal Conversion**: Finally, convert the result to a hexadecimal format.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Multiplication\nmultiplication_result = 0xb7e1 * 0x6f4\n\n# Step 2: Left Shift by 3 bits\nshifted_result = multiplication_result << 3\n\n# Step 3: Convert to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(shifted_result)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
