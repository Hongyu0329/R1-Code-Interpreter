    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, taking into account the hexadecimal values and the operations involved. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0xd393 - 0xf18d) * (0xf4fa << 0x1))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: \\(0xd393 - 0xf18d\\)\n2. **Left Shift**: \\(0xf4fa << 0x1\\)\n3. **Multiplication**: Result of subtraction * Result of left shift\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation\n\n1. **Subtraction**: \n   - Convert \\(0xd393\\) and \\(0xf18d\\) to decimal.\n   - Perform the subtraction.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal.\n\n2. **Left Shift**:\n   - Convert \\(0xf4fa\\) to decimal.\n   - Perform the left shift by 1 (equivalent to multiplying by 2).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Multiplication**:\n   - Multiply the results from the subtraction and the left shift.\n   - Convert the result to hexadecimal.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtraction\nsubtraction_result = 0xd393 - 0xf18d\n\n# Step 2: Left Shift\nleft_shift_result = 0xf4fa << 1\n\n# Step 3: Multiplication\nmultiplication_result = subtraction_result * left_shift_result\n\n# Convert the final result to hexadecimal\nfinal_result_hex = hex(multiplication_result)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result_hex)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final hexadecimal value.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression in hexadecimal format. The final answer, considering the operations and the signed integer arithmetic, is:\n\n<<<-0x395f1c48>>>"
