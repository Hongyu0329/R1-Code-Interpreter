    "To solve the problem, we need to perform bitwise right shifts on the given hexadecimal number. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0x4514 >> 0x0) >> 0x2)\n\\]\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n\n1. **Right Shift by 0x0**: Shifting any number by 0 bits results in the same number. Therefore, \\(0x4514 >> 0x0\\) is simply \\(0x4514\\).\n\n2. **Right Shift by 0x2**: Now, we need to shift the result from step 1 by 2 bits to the right. This operation is equivalent to integer division by \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n\nLet's calculate the result of the right shift operation:\n\n```python\n# Initial value\nvalue = 0x4514\n\n# Perform the right shift operations\nresult = (value >> 0x0) >> 0x2\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final result in hexadecimal format.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the result of the bitwise operations is \\(0x1145\\). \n\nThe steps were as follows:\n- The initial value \\(0x4514\\) was right-shifted by 0 bits, resulting in the same value \\(0x4514\\).\n- Then, \\(0x4514\\) was right-shifted by 2 bits, which is equivalent to dividing by 4, resulting in \\(0x1145\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x1145>>>"
