    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, taking into account the hexadecimal values and the bitwise shift operation. Here's the breakdown of the operations:\n\n1. **Addition of Hexadecimal Numbers**: \n   - First, add `0xf9d2` and `0x7a2c`.\n   - Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal, perform the addition, and convert the result back to hexadecimal.\n\n2. **Bitwise Right Shift**:\n   - Perform a right shift on `0x118d` by `0x3` (which is 3 in decimal).\n   - Convert `0x118d` to decimal, perform the right shift, and convert the result back to hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Final Addition**:\n   - Add the result from step 1 to the result from step 2.\n   - Convert the final result to hexadecimal.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Addition of 0xf9d2 and 0x7a2c\nresult1 = 0xf9d2 + 0x7a2c\n\n# Step 2: Right shift 0x118d by 3\nresult2 = 0x118d >> 3\n\n# Step 3: Final addition\nfinal_result = result1 + result2\n\n# Convert the final result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(final_result)\n\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final hexadecimal value.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please solve this problem.
