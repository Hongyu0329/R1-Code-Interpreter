    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations on the given hexadecimal numbers. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n(0xe104 \\times 0x151e) + 0xa182\n\\]\n\n1. **Multiplication**: First, multiply \\(0xe104\\) by \\(0x151e\\).\n2. **Addition**: Then, add \\(0xa182\\) to the result of the multiplication.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy, especially given the potential for large numbers due to the multiplication.\n\n```python\n# Define the hexadecimal numbers\nhex1 = 0xe104\nhex2 = 0x151e\nhex3 = 0xa182\n\n# Perform the multiplication and addition\nresult = (hex1 * hex2) + hex3\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the result of the expression and print it in hexadecimal format.",
