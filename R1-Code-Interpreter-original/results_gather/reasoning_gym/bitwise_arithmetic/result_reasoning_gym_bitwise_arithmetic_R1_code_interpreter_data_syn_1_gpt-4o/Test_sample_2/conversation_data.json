    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform the arithmetic and bitwise operations step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0xe70d - 0x8a8) >> 0x0)\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: First, we need to subtract \\(0x8a8\\) from \\(0xe70d\\).\n\n2. **Bitwise Right Shift**: Then, we perform a right shift by \\(0x0\\) on the result of the subtraction. A right shift by 0 means the number remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Output**: Finally, we need to output the result in hexadecimal format. If the result is negative, it should be represented as a negative hexadecimal value.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Perform the subtraction\nresult = 0xe70d - 0x8a8\n\n# Perform the right shift by 0 (which does not change the value)\nshifted_result = result >> 0x0\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(shifted_result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\((0xe70d - 0x8a8) >> 0x0\\) is \\(0xde65\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0xde65>>>"
