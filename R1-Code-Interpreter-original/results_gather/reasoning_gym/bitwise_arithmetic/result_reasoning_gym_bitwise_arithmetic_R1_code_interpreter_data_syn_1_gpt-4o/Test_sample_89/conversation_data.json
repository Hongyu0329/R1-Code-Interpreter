    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of operations on hexadecimal numbers. The operations are as follows:\n\n1. Subtract 0xcd8f from 0x9e4e.\n2. Right shift the result by 0x3 (which is equivalent to 3 in decimal).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- First, convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal to perform the subtraction.\n- Then, perform the subtraction.\n- Finally, right shift the result by 3 bits and convert the final result back to hexadecimal.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert hexadecimal to decimal and perform subtraction\nresult = 0x9e4e - 0xcd8f\n\n# Step 2: Right shift the result by 3 bits\nshifted_result = result >> 3\n\n# Step 3: Convert the result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(shifted_result)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the operations as `-0x5e9`. This is the final hexadecimal value after performing the subtraction and right shift operations as specified in the problem.\n\n<<<-0x5e9>>>"
