    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate the bitwise operations step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0x58ed >> 0x3) << 0x0)\n\\]\n\n1. **Right Shift Operation (>>):**  \n   The right shift operation `0x58ed >> 0x3` means shifting the bits of `0x58ed` to the right by 3 positions. In hexadecimal, `0x58ed` is equivalent to `22765` in decimal.\n\n2. **Left Shift Operation (<<):**  \n   The left shift operation `<< 0x0` means shifting the bits to the left by 0 positions, which effectively means no change to the number.\n\nLet's perform these operations using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Initial value\nvalue = 0x58ed\n\n# Right shift by 3\nright_shifted = value >> 0x3\n\n# Left shift by 0 (no change)\nresult = right_shifted << 0x0\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final result in hexadecimal format.",
    "The code execution output `0xb1d` indicates that the operations were performed correctly. The right shift by 3 positions on `0x58ed` resulted in `0xb1d`, and the left shift by 0 positions did not change the value.\n\nTherefore, the final hexadecimal value is:\n\n<<<0xb1d>>>"
