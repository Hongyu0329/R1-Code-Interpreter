    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. The operations are subtraction and multiplication. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the first part: \\(0xb8c - 0x3241\\).\n2. Calculate the second part: \\(0xf281 \\times 0x4ab5\\).\n3. Subtract the result of the second part from the result of the first part.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the hexadecimal values\nfirst_part = 0xb8c - 0x3241\nsecond_part = 0xf281 * 0x4ab5\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = first_part - second_part\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the arithmetic operations in hexadecimal format. The final result of the expression \\(((0xb8c - 0x3241) - (0xf281 \\times 0x4ab5))\\) is:\n\n<<<-0x46c4e5ea>>>"
