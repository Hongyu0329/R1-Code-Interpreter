    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, taking into account the hexadecimal values and the operations specified.\n\n1. **Addition**: First, we add `0xf49b` and `0x182`.\n2. **Right Shift**: Then, we perform a right shift on `0x56ae` by 1 bit.\n3. **Multiplication**: Finally, we multiply the results of the addition and the right shift.\n\nLet's break down the steps using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Perform the addition\naddition_result = 0xf49b + 0x182\n\n# Step 2: Perform the right shift\nright_shift_result = 0x56ae >> 1\n\n# Step 3: Perform the multiplication\nfinal_result = addition_result * right_shift_result\n\n# Output the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the final result.",
