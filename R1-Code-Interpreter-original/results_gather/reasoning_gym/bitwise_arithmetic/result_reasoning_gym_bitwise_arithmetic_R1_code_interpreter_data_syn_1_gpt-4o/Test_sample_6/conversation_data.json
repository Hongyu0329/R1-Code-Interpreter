    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation given in the expression: \\((0x11f4 + 0x5ecc) << 0x1\\).\n\n1. **Addition**: First, we add the two hexadecimal numbers \\(0x11f4\\) and \\(0x5ecc\\).\n2. **Left Shift**: Then, we perform a left shift operation by 1 bit on the result of the addition. In binary arithmetic, a left shift by 1 bit is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the hexadecimal numbers\nnum1 = 0x11f4\nnum2 = 0x5ecc\n\n# Perform the addition\nsum_result = num1 + num2\n\n# Perform the left shift operation\nfinal_result = sum_result << 1\n\n# Print the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is the hexadecimal value of the computed expression. \n\nThe final result of the expression \\((0x11f4 + 0x5ecc) << 0x1\\) is:\n\n<<<0xe180>>>"
