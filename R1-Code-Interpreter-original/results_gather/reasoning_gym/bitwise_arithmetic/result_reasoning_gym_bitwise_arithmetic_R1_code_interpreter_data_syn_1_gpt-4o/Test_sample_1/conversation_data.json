    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform the arithmetic operations in the correct order, taking into account the hexadecimal values and the operations specified:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: Calculate \\(0x7b9d \\times 0xa7e0\\).\n2. **Right Shift**: Perform the right shift operation on \\(0xe9a8\\) by 1 bit.\n3. **Subtraction**: Subtract the result of the right shift from the result of the multiplication.\n\nLet's break down the steps and compute the result using Python:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Perform the multiplication\nmultiplication_result = 0x7b9d * 0xa7e0\n\n# Step 2: Perform the right shift\nright_shift_result = 0xe9a8 >> 1\n\n# Step 3: Subtract the right shift result from the multiplication result\nfinal_result = multiplication_result - right_shift_result\n\n# Output the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
