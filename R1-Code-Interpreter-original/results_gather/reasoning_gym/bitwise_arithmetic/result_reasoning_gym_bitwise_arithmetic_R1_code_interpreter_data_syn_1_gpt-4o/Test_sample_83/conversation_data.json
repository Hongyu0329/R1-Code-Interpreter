    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate the arithmetic operations step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0x1dbb >> 0x2) - (0xb0f4 * 0x57e4))\n\\]\n\n1. **Right Shift Operation**: \n   - The expression `0x1dbb >> 0x2` involves a right shift operation. In binary, this means shifting the bits of `0x1dbb` to the right by 2 positions.\n   - `0x1dbb` in decimal is `7611`. Shifting `7611` to the right by 2 bits is equivalent to integer division by 4.\n\n2. **Multiplication**:\n   - The expression `0xb0f4 * 0x57e4` involves multiplying two hexadecimal numbers.\n   - `0xb0f4` in decimal is `45300` and `0x57e4` in decimal is `22500`.\n\n3. **Subtraction**:\n   - After computing the above two operations, we subtract the result of the multiplication from the result of the right shift.\n\nLet's compute these values using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Right shift operation\nright_shift_result = 0x1dbb >> 0x2\n\n# Multiplication\nmultiplication_result = 0xb0f4 * 0x57e4\n\n# Subtraction\nfinal_result = right_shift_result - multiplication_result\n\n# Output the final result in hexadecimal\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression in hexadecimal form. The final result of the expression \\(((0x1dbb >> 0x2) - (0xb0f4 * 0x57e4))\\) is:\n\n<<<-0x3cc07de2>>>"
