    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation and then convert the result to hexadecimal format. The operation involves multiplying two hexadecimal numbers and then performing a bitwise right shift by 0, which effectively means no shift.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal.\n2. Perform the multiplication.\n3. Perform the right shift operation.\n4. Convert the result back to hexadecimal.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert hexadecimal to decimal\nnum1 = 0x558\nnum2 = 0x64f6\n\n# Step 2: Perform the multiplication\nresult = num1 * num2\n\n# Step 3: Perform the right shift operation\n# Since the shift is by 0, the result remains the same\nshifted_result = result >> 0x0\n\n# Step 4: Convert the result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(shifted_result)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(hex_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the operation is `0x21b8290`. Since the problem specifies that if the answer is negative, it should be represented as a negative value, and the result here is positive, we can directly provide the final answer.\n\n<<<0x21b8290>>>"
