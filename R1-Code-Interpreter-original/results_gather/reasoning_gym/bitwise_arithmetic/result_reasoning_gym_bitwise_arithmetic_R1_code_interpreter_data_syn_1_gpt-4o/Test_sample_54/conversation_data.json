    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform the arithmetic operations in the correct order, taking into account the bitwise operations and the hexadecimal values. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0xbf3f \\times 0x413) + (0xbe8c \\gg 0x2))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: Calculate \\(0xbf3f \\times 0x413\\).\n2. **Right Shift**: Calculate \\(0xbe8c \\gg 0x2\\). The right shift operation divides the number by \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n3. **Addition**: Add the results of the multiplication and the right shift.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the final result.\n\n```python\n# Define the hexadecimal values\na = 0xbf3f\nb = 0x413\nc = 0xbe8c\n\n# Perform the operations\nresult = (a * b) + (c >> 2)\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression is \\(0x30b5d50\\). \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x30b5d50>>>"
