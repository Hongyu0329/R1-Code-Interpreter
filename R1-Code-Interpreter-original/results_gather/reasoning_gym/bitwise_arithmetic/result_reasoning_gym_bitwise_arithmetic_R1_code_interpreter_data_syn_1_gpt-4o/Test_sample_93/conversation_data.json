    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression:\n\n\\[\n((0x4e0a >> 0x1) - (0x4f57 >> 0x0))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Right Shift Operations**:\n   - `0x4e0a >> 0x1`: This operation shifts the bits of `0x4e0a` one position to the right. In binary, this is equivalent to dividing the number by 2.\n   - `0x4f57 >> 0x0`: This operation shifts the bits of `0x4f57` zero positions to the right, which means the number remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Subtraction**:\n   - After performing the right shift operations, we subtract the result of the second operation from the first.\n\n3. **Handling Signed Integers**:\n   - Since the problem specifies signed integers, we need to ensure that if the result is negative, it is represented as a negative hexadecimal value.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial hexadecimal values\nvalue1 = 0x4e0a\nvalue2 = 0x4f57\n\n# Perform the right shift operations\nshifted_value1 = value1 >> 1\nshifted_value2 = value2 >> 0\n\n# Calculate the result of the subtraction\nresult = shifted_value1 - shifted_value2\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\n# If the result is negative, it will be displayed as a negative value\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the expression and print the result in hexadecimal format, taking into account the signed nature of the integers.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression in hexadecimal format. The final answer, considering the signed integer representation, is:\n\n<<<-0x2852>>>"
