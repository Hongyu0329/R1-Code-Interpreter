    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. The operations include subtraction and a bitwise right shift. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: We need to subtract `0x691a` from `0x8ffd`.\n2. **Bitwise Right Shift**: We need to perform a right shift on `0xf3a3` by 2 bits.\n3. **Final Subtraction**: Subtract the result of the right shift from the result of the first subtraction.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtract 0x691a from 0x8ffd\nresult1 = 0x8ffd - 0x691a\n\n# Step 2: Right shift 0xf3a3 by 2 bits\nshifted_value = 0xf3a3 >> 2\n\n# Step 3: Subtract the shifted value from the result of step 1\nfinal_result = result1 - shifted_value\n\n# Print the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the required operations and output the final result in hexadecimal format. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
