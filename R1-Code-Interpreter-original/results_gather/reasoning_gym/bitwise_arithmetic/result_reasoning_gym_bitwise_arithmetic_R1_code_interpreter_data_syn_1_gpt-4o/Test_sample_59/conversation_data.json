    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations in the correct order, taking into account the bitwise shift operation and the subtraction. The operations are as follows:\n\n1. Calculate \\(0x67f9 - 0xf3ff\\).\n2. Calculate \\(0x7827 << 0x2\\).\n3. Subtract the result of step 2 from the result of step 1.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: \\(0x67f9 - 0xf3ff\\)\n2. **Left Shift**: \\(0x7827 << 0x2\\) (This is equivalent to multiplying \\(0x7827\\) by \\(2^2 = 4\\))\n3. **Final Subtraction**: Subtract the result of the left shift from the result of the first subtraction.\n\nLet's compute these using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtraction\nresult1 = 0x67f9 - 0xf3ff\n\n# Step 2: Left Shift\nresult2 = 0x7827 << 2\n\n# Step 3: Final Subtraction\nfinal_result = result1 - result2\n\n# Output the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the arithmetic operations. The final result of the expression \\((0x67f9 - 0xf3ff) - (0x7827 << 0x2)\\) is \\(-0x26ca2\\).\n\n<<<-0x26ca2>>>"
