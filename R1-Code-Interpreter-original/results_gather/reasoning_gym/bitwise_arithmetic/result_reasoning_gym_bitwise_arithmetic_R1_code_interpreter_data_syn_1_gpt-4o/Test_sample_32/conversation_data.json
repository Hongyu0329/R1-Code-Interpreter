    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the following operations on the given hexadecimal numbers:\n\n1. Add the two hexadecimal numbers: \\(0x3519\\) and \\(0xfdd4\\).\n2. Right shift the result by 1 bit.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Addition of Hexadecimal Numbers:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal, perform the addition, and then convert the result back to hexadecimal.\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation:**\n   - Perform a right shift on the result of the addition. Since the numbers are signed integers, a right shift by 1 is equivalent to dividing the number by 2 and taking the floor of the result.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Add the two hexadecimal numbers\nsum_result = 0x3519 + 0xfdd4\n\n# Step 2: Right shift the result by 1\nfinal_result = sum_result >> 1\n\n# Output the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the operations is \\(0x9976\\). Therefore, the final hexadecimal value after performing the addition and right shift is:\n\n<<<0x9976>>>"
