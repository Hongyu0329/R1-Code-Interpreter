    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the given expression:\n\n\\[\n((0x9ce << 0x1) << 0x0)\n\\]\n\nThis expression involves bitwise left shifts. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Hexadecimal Value**: \n   - \\(0x9ce\\) is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\(9 \\times 256 + 12 \\times 16 + 14 = 2510\\).\n\n2. **Perform the Bitwise Left Shift**:\n   - The expression \\(0x9ce << 0x1\\) means shifting the bits of \\(0x9ce\\) one position to the left. This is equivalent to multiplying the number by \\(2\\).\n   - The expression \\((0x9ce << 0x1) << 0x0\\) means shifting the result of the previous operation by \\(0\\) positions to the left, which does not change the value.\n\n3. **Calculate the Result**:\n   - First, calculate \\(0x9ce << 0x1\\).\n   - Then, apply the second shift, which is effectively a no-op.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial hexadecimal value\nvalue = 0x9ce\n\n# Perform the left shift operations\nresult = (value << 0x1) << 0x0\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\((0x9ce << 0x1) << 0x0\\) is \\(0x139c\\).\n\nTherefore, the final hexadecimal value is:\n\n<<<0x139c>>>"
