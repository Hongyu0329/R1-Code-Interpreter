    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform the operations step by step, taking into account the bitwise and arithmetic operations involved. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n(0x1b28 >> 0x2) - (0xe27d * 0xb6bb)\n\\]\n\n1. **Right Shift Operation**: \n   - The right shift operation `0x1b28 >> 0x2` means shifting the bits of `0x1b28` two positions to the right. This is equivalent to dividing the number by \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**:\n   - The multiplication `0xe27d * 0xb6bb` involves multiplying two hexadecimal numbers.\n\n3. **Subtraction**:\n   - Finally, we subtract the result of the multiplication from the result of the right shift operation.\n\nLet's compute these steps using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Right shift operation\nright_shift_result = 0x1b28 >> 0x2\n\n# Step 2: Multiplication\nmultiplication_result = 0xe27d * 0xb6bb\n\n# Step 3: Subtraction\nfinal_result = right_shift_result - multiplication_result\n\n# Output the final result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(final_result))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression in hexadecimal format. The final result of the expression \\((0x1b28 >> 0x2) - (0xe27d * 0xb6bb)\\) is:\n\n<<<-0xa1aa4885>>>"
