    "To solve the given expression, we need to evaluate the bitwise operations and arithmetic operations step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0x4e60 >> 0x1) - (0x2b67 << 0x0))\n\\]\n\n1. **Right Shift Operation**: \n   - \\(0x4e60\\) is a hexadecimal number. In binary, it is \\(0100111001100000\\).\n   - Right shifting by 1 bit (\\(0x1\\)) means dividing the number by 2.\n   - \\(0x4e60 >> 0x1\\) results in \\(0x2730\\).\n\n2. **Left Shift Operation**:\n   - \\(0x2b67\\) is a hexadecimal number. In binary, it is \\(0010101101100111\\).\n   - Left shifting by 0 bits (\\(0x0\\)) means the number remains the same.\n   - \\(0x2b67 << 0x0\\) results in \\(0x2b67\\).\n\n3. **Subtraction**:\n   - Now, we subtract the result of the left shift from the result of the right shift.\n   - \\(0x2730 - 0x2b67\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the hexadecimal values\nright_shift_result = 0x4e60 >> 0x1\nleft_shift_result = 0x2b67 << 0x0\n\n# Perform the subtraction\nresult = right_shift_result - left_shift_result\n\n# Print the result in hexadecimal format\nprint(hex(result))\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the final result in hexadecimal format.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the expression in hexadecimal format. The subtraction of the two values resulted in a negative number, which is represented as \\(-0x437\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0x437>>>"
