    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation given in the expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0xe315 * 0x1e15) << 0x0)\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier multiplication.\n   - \\(0xe315\\) in decimal is \\(58133\\).\n   - \\(0x1e15\\) in decimal is \\(7701\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the two decimal numbers:\n     \\[\n     58133 \\times 7701 = 447646533\n     \\]\n\n3. **Left Shift Operation:**\n   - The expression includes a left shift by \\(0x0\\), which is equivalent to 0 in decimal.\n   - Shifting any number by 0 bits results in the same number, so:\n     \\[\n     447646533 << 0 = 447646533\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert the decimal result back to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     447646533 \\text{ in hexadecimal is } 0x1abf1f05\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of the expression is \\(0x1abf1f05\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n<<<0x1abf1f05>>>\n\\]"
