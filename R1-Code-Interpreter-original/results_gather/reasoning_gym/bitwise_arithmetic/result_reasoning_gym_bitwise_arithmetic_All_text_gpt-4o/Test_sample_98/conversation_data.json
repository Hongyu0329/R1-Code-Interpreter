    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform bitwise operations and arithmetic calculations step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Operations:**\n   - `0xa6b1 << 0x0`: This is a left shift operation. Shifting by 0 means the number remains unchanged.\n   - `0x57a0 >> 0x2`: This is a right shift operation. Shifting by 2 means dividing the number by 4 (since each shift to the right divides the number by 2).\n\n2. **Calculate Each Part:**\n   - **Left Shift Operation:**\n     - `0xa6b1` in decimal is `42673`.\n     - Shifting `42673` left by 0 bits results in `42673` (no change).\n\n   - **Right Shift Operation:**\n     - `0x57a0` in decimal is `22432`.\n     - Shifting `22432` right by 2 bits results in `22432 / 4 = 5608`.\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the results of the two operations: `42673 * 5608`.\n\n4. **Calculate the Product:**\n   - `42673 * 5608 = 239168584`.\n\n5. **Convert the Result to Hexadecimal:**\n   - The decimal number `239168584` converts to hexadecimal as `0xe43d3a8`.\n\n6. **Format the Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer should be formatted as requested.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0xe43d3a8>>>"
