    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The expression given is \\((0x558 \\times 0x64f6) \\gg 0x0\\). This involves a multiplication followed by a bitwise right shift.\n\n2. **Convert hexadecimal to decimal**:\n   - \\(0x558\\) in decimal is \\(1368\\).\n   - \\(0x64f6\\) in decimal is \\(25846\\).\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - Multiply the two decimal numbers: \\(1368 \\times 25846 = 35381208\\).\n\n4. **Convert the result back to hexadecimal**:\n   - The decimal number \\(35381208\\) is \\(0x21f5c8f8\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n5. **Perform the right shift operation**:\n   - The expression specifies a right shift by \\(0x0\\), which is \\(0\\) in decimal. A right shift by zero means the number remains unchanged.\n\n6. **Final result**:\n   - Since the right shift does not alter the number, the final result remains \\(0x21f5c8f8\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<0x21f5c8f8>>>"
