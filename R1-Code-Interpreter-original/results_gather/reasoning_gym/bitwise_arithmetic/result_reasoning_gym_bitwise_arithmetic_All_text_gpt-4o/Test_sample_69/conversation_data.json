    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform bitwise operations and arithmetic on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Operations:**\n   - We have two main operations: right shifts and subtraction.\n   - Right shift (`>>`) is a bitwise operation that shifts the bits of a number to the right. For signed integers, this is an arithmetic shift, meaning the sign bit is preserved.\n\n2. **Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal:**\n   - `0xed89` in hexadecimal is `60809` in decimal.\n   - `0x37ea` in hexadecimal is `14314` in decimal.\n\n3. **Perform Right Shift Operations:**\n   - `0xed89 >> 0x3`: \n     - `0x3` in hexadecimal is `3` in decimal.\n     - Right shifting `60809` by 3 bits: \n       - In binary, `60809` is `1110110110001001`.\n       - Right shift by 3 bits: `1110110110001` (which is `7601` in decimal).\n   - `0x37ea >> 0x1`: \n     - `0x1` in hexadecimal is `1` in decimal.\n     - Right shifting `14314` by 1 bit:\n       - In binary, `14314` is `11100111101010`.\n       - Right shift by 1 bit: `1110011110101` (which is `7157` in decimal).\n\n4. **Perform Subtraction:**\n   - Subtract the result of the second right shift from the first:\n     - `7601 - 7157 = 444`.\n\n5. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - `444` in decimal is `0x1bc` in hexadecimal.\n\n6. **Format the Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer should be formatted as requested.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x1bc>>>"
