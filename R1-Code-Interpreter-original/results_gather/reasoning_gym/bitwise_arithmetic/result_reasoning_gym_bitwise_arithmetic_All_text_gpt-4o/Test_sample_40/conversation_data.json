    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: We need to subtract 0xb3ec from 0x590f.\n\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier subtraction:\n     - 0x590f = 22799 in decimal\n     - 0xb3ec = 46060 in decimal\n\n   - Perform the subtraction in decimal:\n     - 22799 - 46060 = -23261\n\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - -23261 in decimal is -0x5bdd in hexadecimal\n\n2. **Right Shift**: Next, we need to perform a right shift operation on the result of the subtraction. The operation is a logical right shift by 0x1 (which is 1 in decimal).\n\n   - Right shifting a negative number in arithmetic right shift (which is typical for signed integers) means shifting the bits to the right and filling the leftmost bit with the sign bit (1 for negative numbers).\n\n   - For -0x5bdd, the arithmetic right shift by 1 bit will result in:\n     - -0x5bdd >> 1 = -0x2def\n\n3. **Final Result**: The final result after performing the right shift is -0x2def.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0x2def>>>"
