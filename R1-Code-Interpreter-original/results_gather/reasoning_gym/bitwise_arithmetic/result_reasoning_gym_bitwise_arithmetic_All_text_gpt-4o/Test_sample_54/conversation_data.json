    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to evaluate each part of the expression separately and then combine the results. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0xbf3f * 0x413) + (0xbe8c >> 0x2))\n\\]\n\n1. **Evaluate the Multiplication:**\n\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal:\n     - \\(0xbf3f\\) in decimal is \\(48959\\).\n     - \\(0x413\\) in decimal is \\(1043\\).\n\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     48959 \\times 1043 = 51047737\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the Right Shift:**\n\n   - Convert the hexadecimal number to decimal:\n     - \\(0xbe8c\\) in decimal is \\(48780\\).\n\n   - Perform the right shift by 2 bits:\n     - Right shifting is equivalent to integer division by \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n     \\[\n     48780 \\div 4 = 12195\n     \\]\n\n3. **Add the Results:**\n\n   - Add the results of the multiplication and the right shift:\n     \\[\n     51047737 + 12195 = 51059932\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert the Result to Hexadecimal:**\n\n   - Convert the decimal result back to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     51059932 \\text{ in hexadecimal is } 0x30f7f9c\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0x30f7f9c>>>}\n\\]"
