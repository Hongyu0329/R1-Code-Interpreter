    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: We start with the subtraction operation inside the parentheses:  \n   \\(0xb167 - 0x14fa\\).\n\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - \\(0xb167\\) in decimal is \\(45415\\).\n     - \\(0x14fa\\) in decimal is \\(5370\\).\n\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     \\[\n     45415 - 5370 = 40045\n     \\]\n\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(40045\\) in decimal is \\(0x9c6d\\).\n\n2. **Left Shift Operation**: Next, we perform the left shift operation on the result of the subtraction:\n   \\((0x9c6d << 0x3)\\).\n\n   - The left shift operation by \\(0x3\\) (which is \\(3\\) in decimal) means we multiply the number by \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     0x9c6d \\times 8 = 0x4e368\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Result**: The final result of the operation is \\(0x4e368\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<0x4e368>>>"
