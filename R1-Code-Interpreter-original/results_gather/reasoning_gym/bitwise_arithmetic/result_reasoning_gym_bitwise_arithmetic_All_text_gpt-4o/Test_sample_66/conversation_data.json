    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, taking into account the hexadecimal values and the operations specified.\n\n1. **Addition of Hexadecimal Numbers:**\n   - First, we need to add the two hexadecimal numbers: `0xf9d2` and `0x7a2c`.\n   - Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier addition:\n     - `0xf9d2` in decimal is `63954`.\n     - `0x7a2c` in decimal is `31276`.\n   - Add the decimal values: `63954 + 31276 = 95230`.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `95230` in decimal is `0x173fe`.\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation:**\n   - Next, we need to perform a right shift operation on `0x118d` by `0x3` (which is 3 in decimal).\n   - Convert `0x118d` to decimal: `0x118d` is `4493` in decimal.\n   - Perform the right shift by 3: `4493 >> 3` is equivalent to dividing `4493` by `2^3` (or 8).\n   - `4493 / 8 = 561` (integer division).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `561` in decimal is `0x231`.\n\n3. **Final Addition:**\n   - Now, add the results from the previous steps: `0x173fe` and `0x231`.\n   - Convert `0x173fe` to decimal: `0x173fe` is `95230`.\n   - Convert `0x231` to decimal: `0x231` is `561`.\n   - Add the decimal values: `95230 + 561 = 95791`.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `95791` in decimal is `0x1762f`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<0x1762f>>>"
