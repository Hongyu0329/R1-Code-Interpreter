    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform bitwise operations and arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Operations:**\n   - We have two main operations here: left shift (`<<`) and subtraction (`-`).\n   - The expression is: \\((0x94f3 << 0x2) - (0xdb1a << 0x0)\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the Left Shift Operations:**\n   - **Left Shift `0x94f3` by `0x2`:**\n     - The left shift operation `<<` shifts the bits of the number to the left by the specified number of positions, filling with zeros on the right.\n     - Shifting `0x94f3` by `0x2` (which is 2 in decimal) means multiplying the number by \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n     - Calculate: \\(0x94f3 \\times 4\\).\n     - Convert `0x94f3` to decimal: \\(0x94f3 = 38131\\).\n     - Multiply by 4: \\(38131 \\times 4 = 152524\\).\n     - Convert back to hexadecimal: \\(152524 = 0x254cc\\).\n\n   - **Left Shift `0xdb1a` by `0x0`:**\n     - Shifting by `0x0` (which is 0 in decimal) means the number remains unchanged.\n     - Therefore, \\(0xdb1a << 0x0 = 0xdb1a\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Subtraction:**\n   - Now, subtract the result of the second operation from the first.\n   - We have: \\(0x254cc - 0xdb1a\\).\n   - Convert `0xdb1a` to decimal: \\(0xdb1a = 56090\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction in decimal: \\(152524 - 56090 = 96434\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: \\(96434 = 0x178b2\\).\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of the expression is \\(0x178b2\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x178b2>>>"
