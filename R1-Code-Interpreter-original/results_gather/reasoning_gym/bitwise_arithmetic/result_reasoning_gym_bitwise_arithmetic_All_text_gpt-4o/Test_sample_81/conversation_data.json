    "To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step, taking into account the operations and the hexadecimal values involved.\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression is: \\((0x5a0c >> 0x3) * (0x4e38 + 0x2152)\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the Right Shift Operation:**\n   - The value \\(0x5a0c\\) is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\(23052\\).\n   - The right shift operation \\(>> 0x3\\) means shifting the bits of \\(0x5a0c\\) to the right by 3 positions.\n   - Shifting right by 3 is equivalent to integer division by \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n   - Perform the division: \\(23052 \\div 8 = 2881.5\\).\n   - Since we are dealing with integers, we take the floor of the division result: \\(2881\\).\n   - Convert \\(2881\\) back to hexadecimal: \\(0xb41\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the Addition:**\n   - The values \\(0x4e38\\) and \\(0x2152\\) are hexadecimal numbers.\n   - Convert them to decimal: \\(0x4e38 = 20024\\) and \\(0x2152 = 8530\\).\n   - Perform the addition: \\(20024 + 8530 = 28554\\).\n   - Convert \\(28554\\) back to hexadecimal: \\(0x6f8a\\).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Multiplication:**\n   - Now, multiply the results from the previous steps: \\(0xb41 \\times 0x6f8a\\).\n   - Convert both to decimal: \\(0xb41 = 2881\\) and \\(0x6f8a = 28554\\).\n   - Perform the multiplication: \\(2881 \\times 28554 = 82267374\\).\n   - Convert \\(82267374\\) back to hexadecimal: \\(0x4e1b3fe\\).\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of the expression is \\(0x4e1b3fe\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x4e1b3fe>>>"
