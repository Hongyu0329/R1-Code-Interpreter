    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression is: \\((0xb8c - 0x3241) - (0xf281 \\times 0x4ab5)\\).\n\n2. **Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal:**\n   - \\(0xb8c\\) in decimal is \\(2956\\).\n   - \\(0x3241\\) in decimal is \\(12865\\).\n   - \\(0xf281\\) in decimal is \\(62081\\).\n   - \\(0x4ab5\\) in decimal is \\(19125\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Subtraction:**\n   - Calculate \\(0xb8c - 0x3241\\):\n     \\[\n     2956 - 12865 = -9909\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Calculate \\(0xf281 \\times 0x4ab5\\):\n     \\[\n     62081 \\times 19125 = 1187645625\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Now, substitute back into the expression:\n     \\[\n     (-9909) - 1187645625\n     \\]\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     \\[\n     -9909 - 1187645625 = -1187655534\n     \\]\n\n6. **Convert the Result to Hexadecimal:**\n   - The decimal \\(-1187655534\\) converts to hexadecimal as \\(-0x46f3b1ee\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<-0x46f3b1ee>>>"
