    "To solve the problem, we need to perform bitwise operations on the given hexadecimal number. Let's break down the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: The given hexadecimal number is `0x4550`.\n\n2. **First Operation - Left Shift by 0x3**: \n   - The operation `0x4550 << 0x3` means we need to shift the bits of `0x4550` to the left by 3 positions.\n   - In binary, `0x4550` is `0100 0101 0101 0000`.\n   - Shifting left by 3 positions, we get: `0010 0010 1010 1000 0000`.\n   - Converting this back to hexadecimal, we get `0x22A80`.\n\n3. **Second Operation - Left Shift by 0x1**:\n   - Now, we take the result from the first operation, `0x22A80`, and shift it left by 1 position.\n   - In binary, `0x22A80` is `0010 0010 1010 1000 0000`.\n   - Shifting left by 1 position, we get: `0100 0101 0101 0000 0000`.\n   - Converting this back to hexadecimal, we get `0x45500`.\n\n4. **Final Result**:\n   - The final result after performing both left shift operations is `0x45500`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the specified format is:\n\n<<<0x45500>>>"
