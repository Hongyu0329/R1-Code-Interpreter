    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Addition**: Start by adding the two hexadecimal numbers.\n   - 0x708\n   - 0x8a3\n   - Add these two numbers together:\n     - 0x708 + 0x8a3 = 0xFAB\n\n2. **Right Shift**: Next, perform a right shift operation on the result of the addition.\n   - The result from the addition is 0xFAB.\n   - We need to right shift this result by 0x2 (which is 2 in decimal).\n   - Right shifting by 2 means dividing the number by 2^2 (or 4 in decimal).\n   - 0xFAB divided by 4 is 0x3EA (since 0xFAB is 4011 in decimal, and 4011 divided by 4 is 1002.75, which rounds down to 1002, and 1002 in hexadecimal is 0x3EA).\n\n3. **Final Result**: The final result after the right shift operation is 0x3EA.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x3ea>>>"
