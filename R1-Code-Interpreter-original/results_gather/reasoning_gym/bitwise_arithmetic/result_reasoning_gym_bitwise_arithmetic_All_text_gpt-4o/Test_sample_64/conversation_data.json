    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Addition**: Start by adding the two hexadecimal numbers.\n   - 0xd25b is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is 53,083.\n   - 0x5842 is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is 22,242.\n   - Add these two decimal numbers: 53,083 + 22,242 = 75,325.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: 75,325 in decimal is 0x12a9d in hexadecimal.\n\n2. **Left Shift**: Next, perform the left shift operation.\n   - The result from the addition is 0x12a9d.\n   - The operation specifies a left shift by 0x2, which is equivalent to a left shift by 2 in decimal.\n   - Left shifting a number by 2 is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2^2 (or 4).\n   - Multiply 0x12a9d by 4:\n     - In decimal, 0x12a9d is 75,325.\n     - 75,325 * 4 = 301,300.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: 301,300 in decimal is 0x4aa74 in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Final Result**: The final result after performing the addition and left shift is 0x4aa74.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x4aa74>>>"
