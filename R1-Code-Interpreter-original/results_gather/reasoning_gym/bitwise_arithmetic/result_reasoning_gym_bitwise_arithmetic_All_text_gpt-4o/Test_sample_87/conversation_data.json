    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step, taking into account the operations and the properties of signed integers.\n\n1. **Understand the Operations:**\n   - `>>` is the right shift operator.\n   - `<<` is the left shift operator.\n   - Both operations are performed on hexadecimal numbers.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Right Shift:**\n   - The expression `0xab53 >> 0x3` involves right shifting the hexadecimal number `0xab53` by `0x3` (which is 3 in decimal).\n   - Right shifting by 3 bits is equivalent to dividing the number by 2^3 (or 8).\n   - Convert `0xab53` to decimal: `0xab53` = 43859.\n   - Perform the division: 43859 / 8 = 5482.375.\n   - Since we are dealing with integers, we take the floor of the division result: 5482.\n   - Convert 5482 back to hexadecimal: 5482 = `0x156a`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Left Shift:**\n   - The expression `0xa273 << 0x1` involves left shifting the hexadecimal number `0xa273` by `0x1` (which is 1 in decimal).\n   - Left shifting by 1 bit is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2.\n   - Convert `0xa273` to decimal: `0xa273` = 41587.\n   - Perform the multiplication: 41587 * 2 = 83174.\n   - Convert 83174 back to hexadecimal: 83174 = `0x145e6`.\n\n4. **Subtract the Results:**\n   - Now, subtract the result of the left shift from the result of the right shift: `0x156a - 0x145e6`.\n   - Convert both hexadecimal numbers to decimal for subtraction:\n     - `0x156a` = 5482\n     - `0x145e6` = 83174\n   - Perform the subtraction: 5482 - 83174 = -77692.\n\n5. **Convert the Result to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert the decimal result -77692 to hexadecimal: -77692 = `-0x12f7c`.\n\nThe final answer, in the specified format, is:\n\n<<<-0x12f7c>>>"
