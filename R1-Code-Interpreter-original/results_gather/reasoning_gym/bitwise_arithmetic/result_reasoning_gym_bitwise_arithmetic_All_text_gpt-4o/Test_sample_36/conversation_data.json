    "To solve the problem, we need to perform bitwise right shifts on the given hexadecimal number. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: The given hexadecimal number is `0x3f4d`.\n\n2. **First Right Shift**: We need to perform a right shift by `0x3` (which is 3 in decimal) on `0x3f4d`.\n   - Convert `0x3f4d` to binary: `0x3f4d` is `0011 1111 0100 1101` in binary.\n   - Perform a right shift by 3 bits: \n     - Original: `0011 1111 0100 1101`\n     - After shifting 3 bits to the right: `0000 1111 1110 1001`\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `0000 1111 1110 1001` is `0x7e9`.\n\n3. **Second Right Shift**: Now, perform a right shift by `0x2` (which is 2 in decimal) on the result `0x7e9`.\n   - Convert `0x7e9` to binary: `0x7e9` is `0111 1110 1001` in binary.\n   - Perform a right shift by 2 bits:\n     - Original: `0111 1110 1001`\n     - After shifting 2 bits to the right: `0001 1111 1010`\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `0001 1111 1010` is `0x1fa`.\n\n4. **Final Result**: The final result after performing the two right shifts is `0x1fa`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x1fa>>>"
