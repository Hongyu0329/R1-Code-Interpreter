    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: Calculate \\(0xb24a - 0x7a21\\).\n   - Convert hexadecimal to decimal:\n     - \\(0xb24a = 45642\\)\n     - \\(0x7a21 = 31265\\)\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     - \\(45642 - 31265 = 14377\\)\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(14377 = 0x3825\\)\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Calculate \\(0x16ce \\times 0x8ada\\).\n   - Convert hexadecimal to decimal:\n     - \\(0x16ce = 5838\\)\n     - \\(0x8ada = 35546\\)\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     - \\(5838 \\times 35546 = 207438348\\)\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(207438348 = 0xc5b1c4c\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the results from steps 1 and 2.\n   - Multiply \\(0x3825\\) by \\(0xc5b1c4c\\):\n     - Convert both to decimal:\n       - \\(0x3825 = 14377\\)\n       - \\(0xc5b1c4c = 207438348\\)\n     - Perform the multiplication:\n       - \\(14377 \\times 207438348 = 2981863905396\\)\n     - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n       - \\(2981863905396 = 0x2b1f0b8b1c4\\)\n\nThe final answer in hexadecimal is:\n\n<<<0x2b1f0b8b1c4>>>"
