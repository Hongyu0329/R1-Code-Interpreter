    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction of Hexadecimal Numbers:**\n   - First, we need to subtract `0x691a` from `0x8ffd`.\n   - Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - `0x8ffd` in decimal is `36861`.\n     - `0x691a` in decimal is `26906`.\n   - Perform the subtraction: `36861 - 26906 = 9955`.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `9955` in decimal is `0x26e3`.\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation:**\n   - Next, we need to perform a right shift operation on `0xf3a3` by `0x2` (which is 2 in decimal).\n   - Convert `0xf3a3` to decimal: `0xf3a3` is `62371`.\n   - Perform the right shift operation: `62371 >> 2` means dividing by `2^2` or `4`.\n   - `62371 / 4 = 15592.75`. Since we are dealing with integers, we take the floor value, which is `15592`.\n   - Convert `15592` back to hexadecimal: `15592` in decimal is `0x3cf8`.\n\n3. **Final Subtraction:**\n   - Now, subtract the result of the right shift operation from the result of the first subtraction:\n   - `0x26e3 - 0x3cf8`.\n   - Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - `0x26e3` in decimal is `9955`.\n     - `0x3cf8` in decimal is `15592`.\n   - Perform the subtraction: `9955 - 15592 = -5637`.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `-5637` in decimal is `-0x1605`.\n\nThe final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<-0x1605>>>"
