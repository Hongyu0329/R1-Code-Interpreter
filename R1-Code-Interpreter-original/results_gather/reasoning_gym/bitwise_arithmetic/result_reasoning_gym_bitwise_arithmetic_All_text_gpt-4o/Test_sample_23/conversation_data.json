    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression given is:\n   \\[\n   (0xd85b \\times 0x1564) - (0x17a8 \\times 0x5b04)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal:**\n   - \\(0xd85b\\) in decimal is \\(55483\\).\n   - \\(0x1564\\) in decimal is \\(5476\\).\n   - \\(0x17a8\\) in decimal is \\(6056\\).\n   - \\(0x5b04\\) in decimal is \\(23300\\).\n\n3. **Perform Multiplications:**\n   - Calculate \\(0xd85b \\times 0x1564\\):\n     \\[\n     55483 \\times 5476 = 303760108\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(0x17a8 \\times 0x5b04\\):\n     \\[\n     6056 \\times 23300 = 141508800\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform Subtraction:**\n   - Subtract the second product from the first:\n     \\[\n     303760108 - 141508800 = 162251308\n     \\]\n\n5. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert \\(162251308\\) to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     162251308 = 0x9a2c5cc\n     \\]\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   The final result of the expression in hexadecimal is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{<<<0x9a2c5cc>>>}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<0x9a2c5cc>>>"
