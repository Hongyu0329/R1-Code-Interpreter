    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step, considering the operations and the hexadecimal values involved. The expression given is:\n\n\\[\n((0x635c >> 0x0) << 0x2)\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Hexadecimal Values:**\n   - `0x635c` is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\( 6 \\times 16^3 + 3 \\times 16^2 + 5 \\times 16^1 + 12 \\times 16^0 = 25600 + 768 + 80 + 12 = 25436 \\).\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation (`>>`):**\n   - The expression `0x635c >> 0x0` means we are right-shifting the bits of `0x635c` by `0x0` positions.\n   - Shifting by 0 positions means the number remains unchanged. Therefore, `0x635c >> 0x0` is still `0x635c`.\n\n3. **Left Shift Operation (`<<`):**\n   - Now, we take the result from the previous step, which is `0x635c`, and left-shift it by `0x2` positions.\n   - `0x2` in decimal is 2, so we are left-shifting by 2 positions.\n   - Left-shifting a number by 2 positions is equivalent to multiplying the number by \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n\n4. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - We need to multiply the decimal equivalent of `0x635c` (which is 25436) by 4.\n   - \\( 25436 \\times 4 = 101744 \\).\n\n5. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert 101744 to hexadecimal.\n   - 101744 in hexadecimal is `0x18d70`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0x18d70>>>}\n\\]"
