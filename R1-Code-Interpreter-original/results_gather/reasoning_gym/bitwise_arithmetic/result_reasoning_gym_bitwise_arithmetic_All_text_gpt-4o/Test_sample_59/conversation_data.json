    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, taking into account the hexadecimal values and the operations specified.\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression to evaluate is:\n   \\[\n   ((0x67f9 - 0xf3ff) - (0x7827 << 0x2))\n   \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the First Subtraction:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal values to decimal:\n     - \\(0x67f9 = 26617\\)\n     - \\(0xf3ff = 62463\\)\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     \\[\n     0x67f9 - 0xf3ff = 26617 - 62463 = -35846\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate the Left Shift Operation:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal value to decimal:\n     - \\(0x7827 = 30759\\)\n   - Perform the left shift by 2 bits:\n     - Left shifting by 2 bits is equivalent to multiplying by \\(2^2 = 4\\):\n     \\[\n     0x7827 << 0x2 = 30759 \\times 4 = 123036\n     \\]\n\n4. **Evaluate the Final Subtraction:**\n   - Subtract the result of the left shift from the result of the first subtraction:\n     \\[\n     -35846 - 123036 = -158882\n     \\]\n\n5. **Convert the Final Result to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert \\(-158882\\) to hexadecimal:\n     - The hexadecimal representation of \\(-158882\\) is \\(-0x26d42\\).\n\nThus, the final answer in the specified format is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<-0x26d42>>>}\n\\]"
