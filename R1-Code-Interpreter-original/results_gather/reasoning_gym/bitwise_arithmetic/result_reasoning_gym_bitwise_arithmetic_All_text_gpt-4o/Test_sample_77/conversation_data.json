    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation given in the expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0x1afb + 0x3b47) << 0x0)\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Hexadecimal Addition**: \n   - First, we need to add the two hexadecimal numbers: \\(0x1afb\\) and \\(0x3b47\\).\n   - Convert them to decimal for easier addition:\n     - \\(0x1afb = 1 \\times 16^3 + 10 \\times 16^2 + 15 \\times 16^1 + 11 \\times 16^0 = 6907\\)\n     - \\(0x3b47 = 3 \\times 16^3 + 11 \\times 16^2 + 4 \\times 16^1 + 7 \\times 16^0 = 15175\\)\n   - Add the decimal values: \\(6907 + 15175 = 22082\\).\n\n2. **Convert the Sum Back to Hexadecimal**:\n   - Convert the decimal sum back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(22082\\) in decimal is \\(0x5642\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Bitwise Left Shift**:\n   - The expression includes a left shift operation: \\((0x5642 << 0x0)\\).\n   - A left shift by 0 means the number remains unchanged. Therefore, \\(0x5642 << 0x0 = 0x5642\\).\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The final result of the expression is \\(0x5642\\).\n\nThus, the final answer in the required format is:\n\n\\[\n<<<0x5642>>>\n\\]"
