    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The expression is \\(((0xb7e1 \\times 0x6f4) \\ll 0x3)\\). This involves multiplication of two hexadecimal numbers followed by a left shift operation.\n\n2. **Convert hexadecimal to decimal for clarity**:\n   - \\(0xb7e1\\) in decimal is \\(47,041\\).\n   - \\(0x6f4\\) in decimal is \\(1,780\\).\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - Multiply \\(47,041\\) by \\(1,780\\).\n   - \\(47,041 \\times 1,780 = 83,764,980\\).\n\n4. **Convert the result back to hexadecimal**:\n   - \\(83,764,980\\) in hexadecimal is \\(0x4fcf8e4\\).\n\n5. **Perform the left shift operation**:\n   - The left shift operation \\(\\ll 0x3\\) is equivalent to multiplying the number by \\(2^3\\) (or 8 in decimal).\n   - \\(0x4fcf8e4 \\times 8 = 0x27e7c720\\).\n\n6. **Final result**:\n   - The final result in hexadecimal is \\(0x27e7c720\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x27e7c720>>>"
