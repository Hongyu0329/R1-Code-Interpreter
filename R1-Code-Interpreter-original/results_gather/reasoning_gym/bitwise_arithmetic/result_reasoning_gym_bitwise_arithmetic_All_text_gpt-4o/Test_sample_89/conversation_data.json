    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic and bitwise operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: We need to subtract two hexadecimal numbers: 0x9e4e and 0xcd8f.\n\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier subtraction:\n     - 0x9e4e = 40526 (in decimal)\n     - 0xcd8f = 52623 (in decimal)\n\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     - 40526 - 52623 = -12097\n\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - -12097 in decimal is equivalent to -0x2f41 in hexadecimal.\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation**: Next, we need to perform a right shift operation on the result of the subtraction. The operation is a logical right shift by 0x3 (which is 3 in decimal).\n\n   - Right shifting a negative number in arithmetic right shift (which is typical for signed integers) means shifting the bits to the right and filling the leftmost bits with the sign bit (1 for negative numbers).\n\n   - Start with the binary representation of -0x2f41:\n     - The binary representation of 0x2f41 is 0010 1111 0100 0001.\n     - For a negative number, the two's complement is used, which involves inverting the bits and adding 1:\n       - Invert the bits: 1101 0000 1011 1110\n       - Add 1: 1101 0000 1011 1111\n\n   - Perform the arithmetic right shift by 3:\n     - Shift the bits to the right by 3 positions: 1111 1010 0001 0111\n     - The leftmost bits are filled with 1s because the number is negative.\n\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - 1111 1010 0001 0111 in binary is equivalent to 0xfa17 in hexadecimal.\n\n   - Since the original number was negative, the result remains negative:\n     - The final result is -0xfa17.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0xfa17>>>"
