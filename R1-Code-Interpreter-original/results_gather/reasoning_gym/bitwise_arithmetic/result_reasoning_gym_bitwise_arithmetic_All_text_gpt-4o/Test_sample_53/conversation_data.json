    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, taking into account the properties of signed integers and bit manipulation. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Multiplication:**\n   - We have two hexadecimal numbers: `0xe8b9` and `0xf30e`.\n   - Convert them to decimal for easier multiplication:\n     - `0xe8b9` in decimal is `59577`.\n     - `0xf30e` in decimal is `62222`.\n\n2. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the two decimal numbers: `59577 * 62222 = 3705962094`.\n\n3. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - The result of the multiplication in decimal is `3705962094`.\n   - Convert `3705962094` to hexadecimal: `0xdcf8c7de`.\n\n4. **Right Shift the Result:**\n   - The operation specifies a right shift by `0x1`, which is `1` in decimal.\n   - Right shifting `0xdcf8c7de` by 1 bit is equivalent to dividing the number by 2.\n   - In binary, right shifting `0xdcf8c7de` by 1 bit gives `0x6e7c63ef`.\n\n5. **Consider the Sign:**\n   - Since the original numbers are signed integers, we need to consider the sign of the result.\n   - The multiplication of two positive numbers results in a positive number, so the right-shifted result remains positive.\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result after the right shift is `0x6e7c63ef`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<0x6e7c63ef>>>"
