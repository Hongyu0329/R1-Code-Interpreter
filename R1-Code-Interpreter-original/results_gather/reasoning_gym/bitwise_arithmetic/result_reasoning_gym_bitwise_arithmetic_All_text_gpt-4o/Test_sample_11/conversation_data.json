    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression given is:\n   \\[\n   (0xacf1 \\times 0xb3cc) - (0x9a4b \\ll 0x0)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(\\times\\) denotes multiplication, and \\(\\ll\\) denotes the left shift operation.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Left Shift Operation:**\n   The expression \\((0x9a4b \\ll 0x0)\\) involves a left shift by 0 bits. Shifting any number by 0 bits results in the number itself. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   0x9a4b \\ll 0x0 = 0x9a4b\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   Now, we need to multiply the two hexadecimal numbers:\n   \\[\n   0xacf1 \\times 0xb3cc\n   \\]\n   Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier multiplication:\n   - \\(0xacf1 = 44273\\)\n   - \\(0xb3cc = 46028\\)\n\n   Multiply the decimal values:\n   \\[\n   44273 \\times 46028 = 2037526844\n   \\]\n\n   Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n   \\[\n   2037526844 = 0x796b0c44\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Subtraction:**\n   Now, subtract the result of the left shift from the multiplication result:\n   \\[\n   0x796b0c44 - 0x9a4b\n   \\]\n\n   Convert \\(0x9a4b\\) to decimal:\n   \\[\n   0x9a4b = 39515\n   \\]\n\n   Subtract in decimal:\n   \\[\n   2037526844 - 39515 = 2037487329\n   \\]\n\n   Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n   \\[\n   2037487329 = 0x796a71f3\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   The final result of the expression is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0x796a71f3}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<0x796a71f3>>>"
