    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step, considering the operations and the properties of bit manipulation. The expression given is:\n\n\\[\n((0x7c86 << 0x2) >> 0x2)\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Value:**\n   - The initial value is `0x7c86`. In decimal, this is `31878`.\n\n2. **Left Shift Operation:**\n   - The expression `0x7c86 << 0x2` means shifting the bits of `0x7c86` to the left by 2 positions.\n   - In binary, `0x7c86` is `0111 1100 1000 0110`.\n   - Shifting left by 2 positions results in `1111 1001 0000 1100 00`, which is equivalent to `0x1f218` in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Right Shift Operation:**\n   - The expression `(0x1f218 >> 0x2)` means shifting the bits of `0x1f218` to the right by 2 positions.\n   - In binary, `0x1f218` is `1111 1001 0000 1100 00`.\n   - Shifting right by 2 positions results in `0111 1100 1000 0110`, which is equivalent to `0x7c86` in hexadecimal.\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - After performing the left shift followed by the right shift, the value returns to the original value `0x7c86`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0x7c86>>>}\n\\]"
