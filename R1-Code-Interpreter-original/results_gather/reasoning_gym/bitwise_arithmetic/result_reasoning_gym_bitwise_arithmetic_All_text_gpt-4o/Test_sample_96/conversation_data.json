    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the operations and numbers involved:**\n   - We have a multiplication: \\(0x2350 \\times 0x7cb2\\)\n   - We have a subtraction: \\(0x5290 - 0xa452\\)\n   - Finally, we subtract the result of the subtraction from the result of the multiplication.\n\n2. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - \\(0x2350\\) in decimal is \\(9040\\).\n     - \\(0x7cb2\\) in decimal is \\(31922\\).\n   - Multiply the decimal values: \\(9040 \\times 31922 = 288686080\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: \\(288686080\\) in decimal is \\(0x113c8c00\\).\n\n3. **Perform the subtraction:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal:\n     - \\(0x5290\\) in decimal is \\(21136\\).\n     - \\(0xa452\\) in decimal is \\(42066\\).\n   - Subtract the decimal values: \\(21136 - 42066 = -20930\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: \\(-20930\\) in decimal is \\(-0x51e2\\).\n\n4. **Combine the results:**\n   - We need to subtract the result of the subtraction from the result of the multiplication:\n     - \\(0x113c8c00 - (-0x51e2)\\).\n   - This is equivalent to adding the absolute value of the subtraction result:\n     - \\(0x113c8c00 + 0x51e2\\).\n   - Convert both numbers to decimal for addition:\n     - \\(0x113c8c00\\) in decimal is \\(288686080\\).\n     - \\(0x51e2\\) in decimal is \\(20930\\).\n   - Add the decimal values: \\(288686080 + 20930 = 288707010\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: \\(288707010\\) in decimal is \\(0x113cddE2\\).\n\n5. **Final result:**\n   - The final result in hexadecimal is \\(0x113cddE2\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x113cdde2>>>"
