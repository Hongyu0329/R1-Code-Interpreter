    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform the operations step by step, taking into account the hexadecimal arithmetic and bitwise operations. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: \n   - We need to multiply two hexadecimal numbers: 0x6f42 and 0xda47.\n   - Convert these to decimal for easier multiplication:\n     - 0x6f42 = 28482 (in decimal)\n     - 0xda47 = 55879 (in decimal)\n   - Multiply the decimal values: 28482 * 55879 = 1590912978\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: 1590912978 = 0x5edc1c12\n\n2. **Left Shift**:\n   - We need to left shift the hexadecimal number 0x5ff3 by 2 bits.\n   - Convert 0x5ff3 to decimal: 0x5ff3 = 24563 (in decimal)\n   - Perform the left shift: 24563 << 2 = 98252\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: 98252 = 0x17fcc\n\n3. **Addition**:\n   - Now, add the results from the multiplication and the left shift:\n   - 0x5edc1c12 (from multiplication) + 0x17fcc (from left shift)\n   - Convert 0x17fcc to decimal for addition: 0x17fcc = 98252 (in decimal)\n   - Add the decimal values: 1590912978 + 98252 = 1591011230\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: 1591011230 = 0x5edda6de\n\nThe final result of the expression is the hexadecimal value obtained from the addition.\n\n<<<0x5edda6de>>>"
