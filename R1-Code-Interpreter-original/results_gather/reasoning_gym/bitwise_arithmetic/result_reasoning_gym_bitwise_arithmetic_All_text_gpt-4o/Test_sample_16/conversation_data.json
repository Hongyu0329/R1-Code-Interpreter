    "To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step, taking into account the operations and the hexadecimal values involved. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0x4e60 >> 0x1) - (0x2b67 << 0x0))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Right Shift Operation**: \n   - The expression `0x4e60 >> 0x1` involves a right shift operation.\n   - `0x4e60` in decimal is `20064`.\n   - Right shifting by `1` bit is equivalent to dividing the number by `2`.\n   - Therefore, `0x4e60 >> 0x1` is `20064 / 2 = 10032`.\n   - In hexadecimal, `10032` is `0x2718`.\n\n2. **Left Shift Operation**:\n   - The expression `0x2b67 << 0x0` involves a left shift operation.\n   - `0x2b67` in decimal is `11111`.\n   - Left shifting by `0` bits means the number remains unchanged.\n   - Therefore, `0x2b67 << 0x0` is `11111`.\n   - In hexadecimal, `11111` is `0x2b67`.\n\n3. **Subtraction**:\n   - Now, we need to subtract the result of the left shift from the result of the right shift.\n   - We have `0x2718` (which is `10032` in decimal) and `0x2b67` (which is `11111` in decimal).\n   - Subtracting these gives: `10032 - 11111 = -1079`.\n\n4. **Convert to Hexadecimal**:\n   - The result `-1079` needs to be converted to hexadecimal.\n   - In hexadecimal, `-1079` is `-0x437`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<-0x437>>>}\n\\]"
