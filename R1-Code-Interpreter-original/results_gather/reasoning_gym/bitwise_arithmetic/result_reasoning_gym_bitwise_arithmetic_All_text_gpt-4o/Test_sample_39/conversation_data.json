    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Hexadecimal Values:**\n   - `0xfc9c` is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is `64668`.\n   - `0x28a0` is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is `10400`.\n\n2. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the two decimal values: `64668 * 10400`.\n   - The result of this multiplication is `672547200`.\n\n3. **Right Shift the Result:**\n   - The operation `>> 0x1` means we need to right shift the result by 1 bit.\n   - Right shifting by 1 bit is equivalent to dividing the number by 2.\n   - Divide `672547200` by `2` to get `336273600`.\n\n4. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert `336273600` from decimal to hexadecimal.\n   - The hexadecimal representation of `336273600` is `0x1404f800`.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer in the required format is `<<<0x1404f800>>>`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x1404f800>>>"
