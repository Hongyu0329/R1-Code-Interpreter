    "To solve the problem, we need to perform bitwise operations on the given hexadecimal number. Let's break down the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: The given hexadecimal number is `0x5f7b`.\n\n2. **Left Shift Operation**: The first operation is a left shift by `0x3` (which is 3 in decimal). In a left shift operation, the bits of the number are shifted to the left by the specified number of positions, and zeros are filled in from the right. This is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift amount.\n\n   - Calculate `0x5f7b << 0x3`:\n     - Convert `0x5f7b` to decimal: `0x5f7b` is `24443` in decimal.\n     - Perform the left shift: `24443 << 3` is equivalent to `24443 * 2^3 = 24443 * 8 = 195544`.\n     - Convert `195544` back to hexadecimal: `195544` is `0x2fbd8` in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Right Shift Operation**: The next operation is a right shift by `0x1` (which is 1 in decimal). In a right shift operation, the bits of the number are shifted to the right by the specified number of positions. For signed integers, the sign bit is preserved, meaning that the leftmost bit is filled with the sign bit (0 for positive numbers, 1 for negative numbers).\n\n   - Calculate `0x2fbd8 >> 0x1`:\n     - Convert `0x2fbd8` to decimal: `0x2fbd8` is `195544` in decimal.\n     - Perform the right shift: `195544 >> 1` is equivalent to `195544 / 2 = 97772`.\n     - Convert `97772` back to hexadecimal: `97772` is `0x17dec` in hexadecimal.\n\n4. **Final Result**: The final result after performing the left shift and right shift operations is `0x17dec`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<0x17dec>>>"
