    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**\n   - We are given a mathematical expression involving hexadecimal numbers and bitwise operations.\n   - The expression is: \\(((0xe82 \\times 0x6c09) \\ll 0x3)\\).\n\n2. **Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal:**\n   - \\(0xe82\\) in decimal is \\(3714\\).\n   - \\(0x6c09\\) in decimal is \\(27657\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the two decimal numbers: \\(3714 \\times 27657\\).\n   - The result of the multiplication is \\(102725298\\).\n\n4. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - \\(102725298\\) in hexadecimal is \\(0x61b5f12\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Left Shift Operation:**\n   - The expression specifies a left shift by \\(0x3\\), which is \\(3\\) in decimal.\n   - Left shifting a number by 3 is equivalent to multiplying it by \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the Final Result:**\n   - Multiply the hexadecimal result by 8: \\(0x61b5f12 \\times 8\\).\n   - This is equivalent to shifting the bits of \\(0x61b5f12\\) three positions to the left.\n   - The result of this operation is \\(0x30daf890\\).\n\n7. **Output the Final Answer:**\n   - The final result in hexadecimal is \\(0x30daf890\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x30daf890>>>"
