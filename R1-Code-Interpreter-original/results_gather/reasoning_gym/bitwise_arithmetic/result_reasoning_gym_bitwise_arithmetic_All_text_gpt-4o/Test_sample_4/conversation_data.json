    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, ensuring that we handle the hexadecimal values correctly. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have a multiplication and an addition operation to perform with hexadecimal numbers.\n   - The expression is: \\((0xe104 \\times 0x151e) + 0xa182\\).\n\n2. **Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal:**\n   - \\(0xe104\\) in decimal is \\(57604\\).\n   - \\(0x151e\\) in decimal is \\(5406\\).\n   - \\(0xa182\\) in decimal is \\(41346\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply \\(57604\\) by \\(5406\\).\n   - The result of the multiplication is \\(311566824\\).\n\n4. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - Add \\(41346\\) to \\(311566824\\).\n   - The result of the addition is \\(311608170\\).\n\n5. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert \\(311608170\\) to hexadecimal.\n   - The hexadecimal representation is \\(0x129b3c8a\\).\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer in hexadecimal format is \\(\\text{0x129b3c8a}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x129b3c8a>>>"
