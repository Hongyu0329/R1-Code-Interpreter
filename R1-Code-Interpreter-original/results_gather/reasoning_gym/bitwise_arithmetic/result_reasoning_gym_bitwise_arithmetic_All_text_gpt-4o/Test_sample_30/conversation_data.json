    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, taking into account the hexadecimal values and the operations specified.\n\n1. **Subtraction within the first parentheses:**\n   - We have \\(0xe577 - 0x77f9\\).\n   - Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - \\(0xe577\\) in decimal is \\(58743\\).\n     - \\(0x77f9\\) in decimal is \\(30713\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(58743 - 30713 = 28030\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: \\(28030\\) in decimal is \\(0x6d7e\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication within the second parentheses:**\n   - We have \\(0x2ccc \\times 0x830f\\).\n   - Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal:\n     - \\(0x2ccc\\) in decimal is \\(11468\\).\n     - \\(0x830f\\) in decimal is \\(33551\\).\n   - Perform the multiplication: \\(11468 \\times 33551 = 384733468\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: \\(384733468\\) in decimal is \\(0x16b5c8f4\\).\n\n3. **Final subtraction:**\n   - Now, we need to subtract the result of the multiplication from the result of the first subtraction:\n   - We have \\(0x6d7e - 0x16b5c8f4\\).\n   - Convert \\(0x6d7e\\) to decimal: \\(0x6d7e\\) is \\(28030\\).\n   - Convert \\(0x16b5c8f4\\) to decimal: \\(0x16b5c8f4\\) is \\(384733468\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(28030 - 384733468 = -384705438\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: \\(-384705438\\) in decimal is \\(-0x16b55b76\\).\n\nThe final answer, in the specified format, is:\n\n<<<-0x16b55b76>>>"
