    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Addition**: \n   - We start with the addition inside the parentheses: \\(0xf49b + 0x182\\).\n   - Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal:\n     - \\(0xf49b = 62619\\)\n     - \\(0x182 = 386\\)\n   - Perform the addition in decimal: \\(62619 + 386 = 63005\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: \\(63005 = 0xf61d\\).\n\n2. **Right Shift**:\n   - Next, we perform the right shift operation: \\(0x56ae >> 0x1\\).\n   - Convert \\(0x56ae\\) to decimal: \\(0x56ae = 22190\\).\n   - Right shift by 1 (equivalent to integer division by 2): \\(22190 >> 1 = 11095\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: \\(11095 = 0x2b57\\).\n\n3. **Multiplication**:\n   - Now, multiply the results from the previous steps: \\(0xf61d \\times 0x2b57\\).\n   - Convert both numbers to decimal:\n     - \\(0xf61d = 63005\\)\n     - \\(0x2b57 = 11095\\)\n   - Perform the multiplication in decimal: \\(63005 \\times 11095 = 699396475\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: \\(699396475 = 0x29b3c8b3\\).\n\nThe final result of the expression \\(((0xf49b + 0x182) * (0x56ae >> 0x1))\\) in hexadecimal is:\n\n<<<0x29b3c8b3>>>"
