    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, taking into account the hexadecimal values and the operations specified.\n\n1. **Understand the Hexadecimal Values:**\n   - `0xc18a` is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\( 49418 \\).\n   - `0x8eea` is another hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\( 36586 \\).\n\n2. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the two decimal values obtained from the hexadecimal numbers:\n     \\[\n     49418 \\times 36586 = 1807227748\n     \\]\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     1807227748 \\text{ in hexadecimal is } 0x6bbd1c44\n     \\]\n\n3. **Perform the Left Shift Operation:**\n   - The result from the multiplication is `0x6bbd1c44`.\n   - The operation specifies a left shift by 2 bits. In binary, a left shift by 2 bits is equivalent to multiplying by \\( 2^2 = 4 \\).\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     1807227748 \\times 4 = 7228910992\n     \\]\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     7228910992 \\text{ in hexadecimal is } 0x1aef47110\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result after performing all the operations is `0x1aef47110`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x1aef47110>>>"
