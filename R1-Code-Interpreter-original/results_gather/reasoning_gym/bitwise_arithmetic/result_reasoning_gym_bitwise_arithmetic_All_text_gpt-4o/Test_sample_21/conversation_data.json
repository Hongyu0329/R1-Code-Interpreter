    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of bitwise and arithmetic operations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operations involved:**\n   - We have a left shift operation `0xf0de << 0x2`.\n   - We have an addition operation within the parentheses: `0xdcb2 + 0xeed8`.\n   - Finally, we have a subtraction operation: the result of the left shift minus the result of the addition.\n\n2. **Perform the left shift operation:**\n   - The hexadecimal number `0xf0de` is equivalent to the decimal number `61662`.\n   - The operation `0xf0de << 0x2` means shifting the bits of `0xf0de` to the left by 2 positions.\n   - Shifting left by 2 positions is equivalent to multiplying the number by \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, `0xf0de << 0x2` is `61662 * 4 = 246648`.\n   - Convert `246648` back to hexadecimal: `0x3c378`.\n\n3. **Perform the addition operation:**\n   - The hexadecimal number `0xdcb2` is equivalent to the decimal number `56562`.\n   - The hexadecimal number `0xeed8` is equivalent to the decimal number `61144`.\n   - Add these two decimal numbers: `56562 + 61144 = 117706`.\n   - Convert `117706` back to hexadecimal: `0x1cb8a`.\n\n4. **Perform the subtraction operation:**\n   - We need to subtract the result of the addition from the result of the left shift.\n   - Subtract `0x1cb8a` from `0x3c378`.\n   - Convert both hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier subtraction:\n     - `0x3c378` is `246648` in decimal.\n     - `0x1cb8a` is `117706` in decimal.\n   - Perform the subtraction: `246648 - 117706 = 128942`.\n   - Convert `128942` back to hexadecimal: `0x1f7ee`.\n\n5. **Output the final answer:**\n   - The final result of the expression is `0x1f7ee`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x1f7ee>>>"
