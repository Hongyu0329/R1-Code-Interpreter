    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations involving hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Operations:**\n   - We have a left shift operation: \\(0xbb70 << 0x3\\).\n   - We have an addition operation: \\(0x4da8 + 0x37fe\\).\n   - Finally, we add the results of these two operations together.\n\n2. **Perform the Left Shift Operation:**\n   - The left shift operation \\(0xbb70 << 0x3\\) means shifting the bits of 0xbb70 three positions to the left.\n   - In binary, 0xbb70 is \\(1011101101110000\\).\n   - Shifting three positions to the left, we get: \\(1011101101110000000\\).\n   - Convert this back to hexadecimal: \\(0x5db80\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Addition Operation:**\n   - Add the two hexadecimal numbers: \\(0x4da8 + 0x37fe\\).\n   - Convert to decimal for easier addition:\n     - \\(0x4da8 = 19880\\)\n     - \\(0x37fe = 14334\\)\n   - Add them: \\(19880 + 14334 = 34214\\).\n   - Convert back to hexadecimal: \\(0x85a6\\).\n\n4. **Add the Results Together:**\n   - Now, add the results of the two operations: \\(0x5db80 + 0x85a6\\).\n   - Convert to decimal for easier addition:\n     - \\(0x5db80 = 384384\\)\n     - \\(0x85a6 = 34214\\)\n   - Add them: \\(384384 + 34214 = 418598\\).\n   - Convert back to hexadecimal: \\(0x66426\\).\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of the entire expression is \\(0x66426\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x66426>>>"
