    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform bitwise operations on hexadecimal numbers and then add the results. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Operations:**\n   - We have two operations to perform: a right shift (`>>`) and a left shift (`<<`).\n   - The expression is: `((0xff52 >> 0x2) + (0x80ac << 0x2))`.\n\n2. **Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal:**\n   - `0xff52` in decimal is `65362`.\n   - `0x80ac` in decimal is `32940`.\n   - `0x2` in decimal is `2`.\n\n3. **Perform the Right Shift:**\n   - `0xff52 >> 0x2` means shifting `65362` two bits to the right.\n   - In binary, `65362` is `1111 1111 0101 0010`.\n   - Shifting two bits to the right: `1111 1111 0101 0010` becomes `0011 1111 1101 0100`.\n   - The decimal value of `0011 1111 1101 0100` is `16340`.\n\n4. **Perform the Left Shift:**\n   - `0x80ac << 0x2` means shifting `32940` two bits to the left.\n   - In binary, `32940` is `1000 0000 1010 1100`.\n   - Shifting two bits to the left: `1000 0000 1010 1100` becomes `10 0000 0010 1011 0000`.\n   - The decimal value of `10 0000 0010 1011 0000` is `131760`.\n\n5. **Add the Results:**\n   - Add the results of the two operations: `16340 + 131760`.\n   - The sum is `148100`.\n\n6. **Convert the Result to Hexadecimal:**\n   - The decimal value `148100` in hexadecimal is `0x24264`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<0x24264>>>"
