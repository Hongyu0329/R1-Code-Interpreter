    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, taking into account the hexadecimal values and the operations specified.\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression given is:\n   \\[\n   (0x7ca7 \\times 0xe4cc) - (0x3910 \\ll 0x2)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Multiplication:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier multiplication:\n     - \\(0x7ca7\\) in decimal is \\(31911\\).\n     - \\(0xe4cc\\) in decimal is \\(58572\\).\n   - Multiply these two decimal numbers:\n     \\[\n     31911 \\times 58572 = 1869464892\n     \\]\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     1869464892 \\text{ in hexadecimal is } 0x6f7b5c44\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Left Shift:**\n   - Convert \\(0x3910\\) to decimal:\n     - \\(0x3910\\) in decimal is \\(14608\\).\n   - Perform the left shift by 2 bits:\n     \\[\n     14608 \\ll 2 = 14608 \\times 4 = 58432\n     \\]\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     58432 \\text{ in hexadecimal is } 0xe440\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Subtraction:**\n   - Subtract the result of the left shift from the result of the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     0x6f7b5c44 - 0xe440 = 0x6f7a7804\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   The final result of the expression in hexadecimal is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{<<<0x6f7a7804>>>}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<0x6f7a7804>>>"
