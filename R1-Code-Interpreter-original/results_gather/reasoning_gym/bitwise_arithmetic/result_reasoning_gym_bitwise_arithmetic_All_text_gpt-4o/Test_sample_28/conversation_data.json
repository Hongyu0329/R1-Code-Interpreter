    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression given is \\((0xcfd2 - 0x7cc7) >> 0x0\\).\n\n2. **Subtraction:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier subtraction:\n     - \\(0xcfd2\\) in decimal is \\(53202\\).\n     - \\(0x7cc7\\) in decimal is \\(31943\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     \\[\n     53202 - 31943 = 21259\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert \\(21259\\) back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(21259\\) in decimal is \\(0x531b\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n4. **Right Shift Operation:**\n   - The expression includes a right shift by \\(0x0\\), which is \\(0\\) in decimal.\n   - Shifting any number by \\(0\\) bits results in the same number.\n   - Therefore, \\(0x531b >> 0x0 = 0x531b\\).\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of the expression is \\(0x531b\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x531b>>>"
