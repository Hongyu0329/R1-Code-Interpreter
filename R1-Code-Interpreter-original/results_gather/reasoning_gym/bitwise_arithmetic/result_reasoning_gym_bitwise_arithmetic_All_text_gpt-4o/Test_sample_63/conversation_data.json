    "To solve the problem, we need to perform bitwise operations on the given hexadecimal number. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Value**:  \n   The initial value given is `0xc99b`. In binary, this is represented as:\n   - `0xc99b` = `1100 1001 1001 1011` in binary.\n\n2. **First Operation - Right Shift by 0x1**:  \n   The operation `>> 0x1` means we need to perform a right shift by 1 bit.  \n   - Shifting `1100 1001 1001 1011` to the right by 1 bit results in `0110 0100 1100 1101`.\n\n3. **Second Operation - Right Shift by 0x0**:  \n   The operation `>> 0x0` means we need to perform a right shift by 0 bits.  \n   - Shifting `0110 0100 1100 1101` to the right by 0 bits results in the same value: `0110 0100 1100 1101`.\n\n4. **Convert the Final Binary to Hexadecimal**:  \n   The final binary value `0110 0100 1100 1101` needs to be converted back to hexadecimal.  \n   - Group the binary into 4-bit sections: `0110`, `0100`, `1100`, `1101`.\n   - Convert each group to hexadecimal:\n     - `0110` = `6`\n     - `0100` = `4`\n     - `1100` = `C`\n     - `1101` = `D`\n   - Combine these to get the hexadecimal value: `0x64cd`.\n\n5. **Consider the Sign**:  \n   Since the original number `0xc99b` is a positive number and the operations performed do not change the sign, the final result remains positive.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<0x64cd>>>"
