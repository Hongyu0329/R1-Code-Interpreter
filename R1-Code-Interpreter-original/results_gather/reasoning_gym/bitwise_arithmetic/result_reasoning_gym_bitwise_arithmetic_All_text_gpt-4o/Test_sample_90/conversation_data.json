    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation and bit manipulation step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Hexadecimal Values:**\n   - `0xbbd0` is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\( 48080 \\).\n   - `0x5ed6` is another hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\( 24278 \\).\n\n2. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - Add the two decimal values: \\( 48080 + 24278 = 72358 \\).\n\n3. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert \\( 72358 \\) back to hexadecimal, which is `0x11aa6`.\n\n4. **Bitwise Right Shift Operation:**\n   - The operation specifies a right shift by `0x0`, which is `0` in decimal. A right shift by 0 means the number remains unchanged.\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - Since the right shift by 0 does not change the number, the final result remains `0x11aa6`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the specified format is:\n\n<<<0x11aa6>>>"
