    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The expression given is \\(((0x1fe0 \\times 0xcdcc) \\gg 0x3)\\). This involves multiplication of two hexadecimal numbers followed by a right bitwise shift.\n\n2. **Convert hexadecimal to decimal for clarity**:\n   - \\(0x1fe0\\) in decimal is \\(8160\\).\n   - \\(0xcdcc\\) in decimal is \\(52684\\).\n   - \\(0x3\\) in decimal is \\(3\\).\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - Multiply \\(8160\\) by \\(52684\\).\n   - The result of the multiplication is \\(8160 \\times 52684 = 429287040\\).\n\n4. **Convert the multiplication result back to hexadecimal**:\n   - \\(429287040\\) in decimal is \\(0x199b9b000\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n5. **Perform the right bitwise shift**:\n   - Right shift \\(0x199b9b000\\) by \\(3\\) bits.\n   - In binary, a right shift by 3 bits is equivalent to dividing the number by \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the result of the right shift**:\n   - Divide \\(429287040\\) by \\(8\\) to get \\(53660880\\).\n\n7. **Convert the final result back to hexadecimal**:\n   - \\(53660880\\) in decimal is \\(0x3337360\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n8. **Format the final answer**:\n   - The final result in hexadecimal is \\(0x3337360\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x3337360>>>"
