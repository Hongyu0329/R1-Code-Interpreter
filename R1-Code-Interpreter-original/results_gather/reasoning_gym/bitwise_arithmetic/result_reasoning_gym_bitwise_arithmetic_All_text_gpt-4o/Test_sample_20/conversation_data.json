    "To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step, taking into account the operations and the hexadecimal values involved. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression is: \n   \\[\n   ((0x7cde >> 0x2) + (0x29bd - 0xfc7e))\n   \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the Right Shift Operation:**\n   - The operation `0x7cde >> 0x2` means we are right-shifting the hexadecimal number `0x7cde` by 2 bits.\n   - In binary, `0x7cde` is `0111 1100 1101 1110`.\n   - Right-shifting by 2 bits gives us: `0001 1111 0011 0111`, which is `0x1f37` in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Subtraction:**\n   - The operation `0x29bd - 0xfc7e` involves subtracting `0xfc7e` from `0x29bd`.\n   - In decimal, `0x29bd` is `10685` and `0xfc7e` is `64638`.\n   - Subtracting these gives: `10685 - 64638 = -53953`.\n   - In hexadecimal, `-53953` is `-0xd2c1`.\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Now, we need to add the results from the two operations: `0x1f37` and `-0xd2c1`.\n   - In decimal, `0x1f37` is `7991`.\n   - Adding these gives: `7991 + (-53953) = -45962`.\n   - Converting `-45962` to hexadecimal gives us `-0xb376`.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of the expression is `-0xb376`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0xb376>>>"
