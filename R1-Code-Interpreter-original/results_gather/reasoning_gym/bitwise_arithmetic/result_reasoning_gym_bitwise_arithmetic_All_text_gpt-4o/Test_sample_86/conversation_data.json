    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression given is:\n   \\[\n   (0x4c3e \\times 0xc59f) - (0xe3c3 \\times 0x7bc)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal:**\n   - \\(0x4c3e\\) in decimal is \\(19518\\).\n   - \\(0xc59f\\) in decimal is \\(50591\\).\n   - \\(0xe3c3\\) in decimal is \\(58307\\).\n   - \\(0x7bc\\) in decimal is \\(1980\\).\n\n3. **Perform Multiplications:**\n   - Calculate \\(0x4c3e \\times 0xc59f\\):\n     \\[\n     19518 \\times 50591 = 987,927,738\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(0xe3c3 \\times 0x7bc\\):\n     \\[\n     58307 \\times 1980 = 115,445,860\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform Subtraction:**\n   - Subtract the second product from the first:\n     \\[\n     987,927,738 - 115,445,860 = 872,481,878\n     \\]\n\n5. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert \\(872,481,878\\) to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     872,481,878 = 0x33F0D1B6\n     \\]\n\n6. **Check for Sign:**\n   Since the result is positive, we do not need to convert it to a negative value.\n\nThe final answer in hexadecimal is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0x33F0D1B6>>>}\n\\]"
