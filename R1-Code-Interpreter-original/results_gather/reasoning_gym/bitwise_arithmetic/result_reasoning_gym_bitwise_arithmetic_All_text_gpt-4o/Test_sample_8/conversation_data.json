    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Hexadecimal Numbers:**\n   - `0xab20` is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\( 43808 \\).\n   - `0xf737` is another hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\( 63287 \\).\n\n2. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the two decimal numbers: \\( 43808 \\times 63287 \\).\n   - The result of this multiplication is \\( 2772362816 \\).\n\n3. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - The decimal number \\( 2772362816 \\) is equivalent to `0xa6b8c5c0` in hexadecimal.\n\n4. **Perform the Right Shift Operation:**\n   - The operation `>> 0x2` means we need to perform a right bitwise shift by 2 positions.\n   - In binary, shifting right by 2 is equivalent to dividing the number by \\( 2^2 = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Divide the Hexadecimal Result by 4:**\n   - Divide `0xa6b8c5c0` by 4.\n   - In decimal, \\( 2772362816 \\div 4 = 693090704 \\).\n\n6. **Convert the Final Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - The decimal number \\( 693090704 \\) is equivalent to `0x29ae3170` in hexadecimal.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<0x29ae3170>>>"
