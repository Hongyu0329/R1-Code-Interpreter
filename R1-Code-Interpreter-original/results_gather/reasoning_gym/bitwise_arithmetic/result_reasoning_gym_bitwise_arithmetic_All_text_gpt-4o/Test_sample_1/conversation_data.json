    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the expression:**\n   The expression is: \\((0x7b9d \\times 0xa7e0) - (0xe9a8 \\gg 0x1)\\).\n\n2. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier multiplication:\n     - \\(0x7b9d\\) in decimal is \\(31645\\).\n     - \\(0xa7e0\\) in decimal is \\(42976\\).\n   - Multiply the two decimal numbers:\n     \\[\n     31645 \\times 42976 = 1359449920\n     \\]\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     1359449920 \\text{ in hexadecimal is } 0x510b5c00\n     \\]\n\n3. **Perform the right shift operation:**\n   - Convert \\(0xe9a8\\) to decimal:\n     - \\(0xe9a8\\) in decimal is \\(59816\\).\n   - Perform the right shift by 1 (equivalent to integer division by 2):\n     \\[\n     59816 \\div 2 = 29908\n     \\]\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     29908 \\text{ in hexadecimal is } 0x74d4\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the subtraction:**\n   - Subtract the result of the right shift from the result of the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     0x510b5c00 - 0x74d4\n     \\]\n   - Convert \\(0x74d4\\) to decimal for easier subtraction:\n     - \\(0x74d4\\) in decimal is \\(29908\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction in decimal:\n     \\[\n     1359449920 - 29908 = 1359410012\n     \\]\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     1359410012 \\text{ in hexadecimal is } 0x510ae72c\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final result:**\n   The final result of the expression is \\(0x510ae72c\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x510ae72c>>>"
