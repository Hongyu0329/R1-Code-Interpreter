    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic and bitwise operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: We need to subtract `0xff5d` from `0xd33b`.\n\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - `0xd33b` in decimal is `54075`.\n     - `0xff5d` in decimal is `65373`.\n\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     - `54075 - 65373 = -11298`.\n\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - `-11298` in hexadecimal is `-0x2c22`.\n\n2. **Right Shift**: Next, we need to perform a right shift operation on the result of the subtraction. The operation is `(-0x2c22) >> 0x3`.\n\n   - `0x3` in decimal is `3`, so we are performing a right shift by 3 bits.\n\n   - Right shifting a negative number in two's complement form involves shifting the bits to the right and filling the leftmost bits with 1s to maintain the sign.\n\n   - Convert `-0x2c22` to binary:\n     - `-0x2c22` is `-11298` in decimal.\n     - The binary representation of `11298` is `1011000100010`.\n     - The two's complement of `11298` (to represent `-11298`) is obtained by inverting the bits and adding 1:\n       - Invert the bits: `0100111011101`\n       - Add 1: `0100111011110`\n\n   - Perform the right shift by 3 bits:\n     - Original two's complement: `1111111111111111111110100111011110` (assuming 32-bit representation for clarity)\n     - Right shift by 3: `1111111111111111111111110100111011`\n\n   - Convert the result back to decimal:\n     - The binary `1111111111111111111111110100111011` is `-1413` in decimal.\n\n   - Convert `-1413` to hexadecimal:\n     - `-1413` in hexadecimal is `-0x585`.\n\n3. **Final Answer**: The final result of the operation is `-0x585`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0x585>>>"
