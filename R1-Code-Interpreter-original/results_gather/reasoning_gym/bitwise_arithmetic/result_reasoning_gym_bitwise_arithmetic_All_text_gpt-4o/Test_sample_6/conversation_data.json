    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, ensuring that we handle hexadecimal values correctly and consider the bitwise operations involved.\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We are given two hexadecimal numbers: `0x11f4` and `0x5ecc`.\n   - We need to add these two numbers.\n   - After adding, we need to perform a left shift operation by `0x1` (which is equivalent to shifting by 1 bit).\n\n2. **Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal (for clarity):**\n   - `0x11f4` in decimal is `4596`.\n   - `0x5ecc` in decimal is `24268`.\n\n3. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - Add the two decimal numbers: `4596 + 24268 = 28864`.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `28864` in decimal is `0x70c0`.\n\n4. **Perform the Left Shift Operation:**\n   - Left shift `0x70c0` by 1 bit.\n   - In binary, `0x70c0` is `0111 0000 1100 0000`.\n   - Shifting left by 1 bit results in: `1110 0001 1000 0000 0`.\n   - This is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2.\n   - In hexadecimal, the result is `0xe180`.\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result after performing the addition and left shift is `0xe180`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the specified format is:\n\n<<<0xe180>>>"
