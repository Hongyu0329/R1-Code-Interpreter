    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal (if needed for understanding):**\n   - 0x800a in decimal is 32778.\n   - 0x739 in decimal is 1849.\n   - 0x5420 in decimal is 21536.\n   - 0x8349 in decimal is 33609.\n\n2. **Perform the Subtraction and Addition:**\n   - First, calculate the subtraction in the first part: \\(0x800a - 0x739\\).\n     - 0x800a - 0x739 = 0x800a - 0x0739 = 0x78d1.\n   - Next, calculate the addition in the second part: \\(0x5420 + 0x8349\\).\n     - 0x5420 + 0x8349 = 0xd769.\n\n3. **Subtract the Results:**\n   - Now, subtract the result of the addition from the result of the subtraction:\n     - 0x78d1 - 0xd769.\n\n4. **Calculate the Final Result:**\n   - Perform the subtraction: 0x78d1 - 0xd769.\n   - Since 0x78d1 is less than 0xd769, the result will be negative.\n   - Calculate the difference: \n     - Convert to decimal for easier calculation if needed:\n       - 0x78d1 = 30929\n       - 0xd769 = 55145\n     - 30929 - 55145 = -24216.\n   - Convert -24216 back to hexadecimal:\n     - -24216 in hexadecimal is -0x5e98.\n\n5. **Format the Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer in the required format is: <<<-0x5e98>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0x5e98>>>"
