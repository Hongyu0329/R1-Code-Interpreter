    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression `((0xe7fa << 0x1) >> 0x1)` step by step, considering the operations and the properties of signed integers.\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Value:**\n   - The initial value is `0xe7fa`, which is a hexadecimal representation of a signed integer. In decimal, `0xe7fa` is `59354`.\n\n2. **Left Shift Operation:**\n   - The expression `0xe7fa << 0x1` means shifting the bits of `0xe7fa` to the left by 1 position.\n   - In binary, `0xe7fa` is `1110011111111010`.\n   - Shifting left by 1 bit results in `11100111111110100`, which is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2.\n   - The new value in decimal is `118708`, and in hexadecimal, it is `0x1cff4`.\n\n3. **Right Shift Operation:**\n   - The expression `(0x1cff4 >> 0x1)` means shifting the bits of `0x1cff4` to the right by 1 position.\n   - In binary, `0x1cff4` is `11100111111110100`.\n   - Shifting right by 1 bit results in `1110011111111010`, which is equivalent to dividing the number by 2.\n   - The new value in decimal is `59354`, and in hexadecimal, it is `0xe7fa`.\n\n4. **Consideration of Signed Integers:**\n   - Since the operations are performed on signed integers, and the left and right shifts are balanced (shift left by 1 and then right by 1), the final result should be the same as the original value.\n   - The operations do not change the sign or the value of the original number in this case.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - After performing the left and right shifts, the final result is the same as the initial value, `0xe7fa`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0xe7fa>>>"
