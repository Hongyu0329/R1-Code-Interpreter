    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, ensuring that we handle the hexadecimal values correctly and consider the signed integer nature of the numbers.\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression given is:\n   \\[\n   ((0x7cfb \\times 0xa9e9) \\times (0x144f + 0xa9cf))\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal:**\n   - \\(0x7cfb\\) in decimal is \\(31995\\).\n   - \\(0xa9e9\\) in decimal is \\(43497\\).\n   - \\(0x144f\\) in decimal is \\(5199\\).\n   - \\(0xa9cf\\) in decimal is \\(43471\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - Calculate \\(0x144f + 0xa9cf\\):\n     \\[\n     5199 + 43471 = 48670\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - First, calculate \\(0x7cfb \\times 0xa9e9\\):\n     \\[\n     31995 \\times 43497 = 1390914315\n     \\]\n\n5. **Multiply the Results:**\n   - Now, multiply the result of the first multiplication by the result of the addition:\n     \\[\n     1390914315 \\times 48670 = 67659697890550\n     \\]\n\n6. **Convert the Final Result to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert \\(67659697890550\\) to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     0x3d0c7b8b1e96\n     \\]\n\n7. **Check for Signed Integer:**\n   - Since the problem states to assume arbitrary bit depth and signed integers, we need to ensure the result is interpreted correctly. However, the result is positive, so it remains as is.\n\nThe final hexadecimal value is:\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0x3d0c7b8b1e96>>>}\n\\]"
