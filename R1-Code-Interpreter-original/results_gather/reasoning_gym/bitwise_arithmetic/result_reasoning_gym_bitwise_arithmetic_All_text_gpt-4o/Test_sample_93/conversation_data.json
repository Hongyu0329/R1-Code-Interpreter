    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step, taking into account the operations and the properties of signed integers.\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression is: \\((0x4e0a >> 0x1) - (0x4f57 >> 0x0)\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the Right Shift Operations:**\n   - **Right Shift 0x4e0a by 0x1:**\n     - 0x4e0a in binary is 0100111000001010.\n     - Right shifting by 1 bit (0x1) means removing the least significant bit and adding a 0 at the most significant bit.\n     - Result: 0010011100000101, which is 0x2705 in hexadecimal.\n\n   - **Right Shift 0x4f57 by 0x0:**\n     - 0x4f57 in binary is 0100111101010111.\n     - Right shifting by 0 bits (0x0) means the number remains unchanged.\n     - Result: 0x4f57.\n\n3. **Subtraction:**\n   - Now, subtract the results of the right shifts:\n     - 0x2705 - 0x4f57.\n\n4. **Perform the Subtraction:**\n   - Convert both hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier subtraction:\n     - 0x2705 = 9989 in decimal.\n     - 0x4f57 = 20311 in decimal.\n   - Subtract: 9989 - 20311 = -10322.\n\n5. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert -10322 to hexadecimal:\n     - -10322 in decimal is -0x2852 in hexadecimal.\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer, in the required format, is: <<<-0x2852>>>."
