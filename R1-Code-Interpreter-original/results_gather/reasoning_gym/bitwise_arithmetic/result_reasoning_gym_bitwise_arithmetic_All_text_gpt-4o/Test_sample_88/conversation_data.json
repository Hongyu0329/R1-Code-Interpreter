    "To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the expression:**\n   The expression is: \\((0xacc3 >> 0x3) - (0x3a20 - 0xdc9b)\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the right shift operation:**\n   - The operation \\(0xacc3 >> 0x3\\) is a right shift by 3 bits.\n   - In hexadecimal, \\(0xacc3\\) is equivalent to \\(43971\\) in decimal.\n   - Right shifting by 3 bits is equivalent to integer division by \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n   - Perform the division: \\(43971 \\div 8 = 5496\\).\n   - Convert back to hexadecimal: \\(5496\\) is \\(0x1578\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the subtraction inside the parentheses:**\n   - Calculate \\(0x3a20 - 0xdc9b\\).\n   - Convert both to decimal: \\(0x3a20 = 14880\\) and \\(0xdc9b = 56475\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(14880 - 56475 = -41595\\).\n   - Convert back to hexadecimal: \\(-41595\\) is \\(-0xa27b\\).\n\n4. **Evaluate the final subtraction:**\n   - Now, subtract the results from steps 2 and 3: \\(0x1578 - (-0xa27b)\\).\n   - This is equivalent to adding the absolute value of the negative number: \\(0x1578 + 0xa27b\\).\n   - Convert both to decimal: \\(0x1578 = 5496\\) and \\(0xa27b = 41595\\).\n   - Perform the addition: \\(5496 + 41595 = 47091\\).\n   - Convert back to hexadecimal: \\(47091\\) is \\(0xb7f3\\).\n\n5. **Final answer:**\n   The final result of the expression is \\(0xb7f3\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0xb7f3>>>"
