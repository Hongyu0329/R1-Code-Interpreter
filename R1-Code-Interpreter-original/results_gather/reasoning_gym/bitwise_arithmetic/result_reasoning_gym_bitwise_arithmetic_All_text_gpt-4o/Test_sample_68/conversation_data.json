    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation given in the expression step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression is: \\((0xb59c - 0x659d) << 0x0\\).\n\n2. **Subtraction:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier subtraction:\n     - \\(0xb59c\\) in decimal is \\(46492\\).\n     - \\(0x659d\\) in decimal is \\(26013\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     \\[\n     46492 - 26013 = 20479\n     \\]\n\n3. **Left Shift Operation:**\n   - The result from the subtraction is \\(20479\\).\n   - The expression specifies a left shift by \\(0x0\\), which is \\(0\\) in decimal.\n   - Shifting any number by 0 bits results in the same number, so:\n     \\[\n     20479 << 0 = 20479\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert \\(20479\\) from decimal back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(20479\\) in hexadecimal is \\(0x4fff\\).\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of the expression is \\(0x4fff\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x4fff>>>"
