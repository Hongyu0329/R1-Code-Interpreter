    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression given is \\((0x2e39 + 0x622b) >> 0x0\\).\n\n2. **Hexadecimal Addition:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier addition:\n     - \\(0x2e39\\) in decimal is \\(11833\\).\n     - \\(0x622b\\) in decimal is \\(25131\\).\n   - Add the decimal values:\n     - \\(11833 + 25131 = 36964\\).\n\n3. **Convert the Sum Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert \\(36964\\) back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(36964\\) in decimal is \\(0x9064\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n4. **Right Shift Operation:**\n   - The expression includes a right shift by \\(0x0\\), which is \\(0\\) in decimal.\n   - Shifting any number by \\(0\\) bits results in the same number.\n   - Therefore, \\(0x9064 >> 0x0\\) is still \\(0x9064\\).\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of the expression is \\(0x9064\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x9064>>>"
