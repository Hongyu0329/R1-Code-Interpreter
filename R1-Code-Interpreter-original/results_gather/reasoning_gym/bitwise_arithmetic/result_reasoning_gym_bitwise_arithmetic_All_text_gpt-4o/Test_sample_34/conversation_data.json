    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step, considering the operations and the properties of bit manipulation.\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression given is `((0x4c46 << 0x0) << 0x0)`. This involves bitwise left shifts.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Inner Shift:**\n   - The inner part of the expression is `(0x4c46 << 0x0)`.\n   - Shifting a number by 0 bits to the left means the number remains unchanged.\n   - Therefore, `0x4c46 << 0x0` results in `0x4c46`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Outer Shift:**\n   - Now, we have `(0x4c46 << 0x0)`, which simplifies to `0x4c46`.\n   - Again, shifting by 0 bits to the left means the number remains unchanged.\n   - Therefore, `0x4c46 << 0x0` results in `0x4c46`.\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - After evaluating both shifts, the final result of the expression is `0x4c46`.\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - The result is already in hexadecimal form, and since it is not negative, we simply output it as is.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0x4c46>>>"
