    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the components of the expression:**\n   - `0xa12` is a hexadecimal number.\n   - `0x2` is a hexadecimal number representing the shift amount.\n   - `0xfc85` and `0xafd5` are hexadecimal numbers to be added.\n\n2. **Perform the right shift operation:**\n   - `0xa12` in binary is `101000010010`.\n   - Right shifting by `0x2` (which is 2 in decimal) means removing the last two bits.\n   - `101000010010` becomes `001010000100` after shifting, which is `0x284` in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Add the hexadecimal numbers:**\n   - First, add `0xfc85` and `0xafd5`.\n   - Convert to decimal for easier addition:\n     - `0xfc85` is `64645` in decimal.\n     - `0xafd5` is `45013` in decimal.\n   - Add these two decimal numbers: `64645 + 45013 = 109658`.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `109658` is `0x1ab5a`.\n\n4. **Add the result of the shift to the sum:**\n   - Add `0x284` (result of the shift) to `0x1ab5a`.\n   - Convert to decimal for easier addition:\n     - `0x284` is `644` in decimal.\n     - `0x1ab5a` is `109658` in decimal.\n   - Add these two decimal numbers: `644 + 109658 = 110302`.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `110302` is `0x1add6`.\n\n5. **Final result:**\n   - The final result of the expression is `0x1add6`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x1add6>>>"
