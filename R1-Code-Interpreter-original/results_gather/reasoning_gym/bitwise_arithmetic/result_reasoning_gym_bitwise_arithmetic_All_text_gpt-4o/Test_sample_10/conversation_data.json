    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to evaluate each part of the expression separately and then combine the results. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0x3a24 - 0x24b8) + (0x1741 >> 0x3))\n\\]\n\n1. **Evaluate the subtraction: \\(0x3a24 - 0x24b8\\)**\n\n   - Convert hexadecimal to decimal:\n     - \\(0x3a24\\) in decimal is \\(14884\\).\n     - \\(0x24b8\\) in decimal is \\(9400\\).\n\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     \\[\n     14884 - 9400 = 5484\n     \\]\n\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     5484 \\text{ in hexadecimal is } 0x156c\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the right shift: \\(0x1741 >> 0x3\\)**\n\n   - Convert hexadecimal to decimal:\n     - \\(0x1741\\) in decimal is \\(5953\\).\n\n   - Right shift by 3 bits:\n     - Right shifting by 3 bits is equivalent to integer division by \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n     \\[\n     5953 \\div 8 = 744\n     \\]\n\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     744 \\text{ in hexadecimal is } 0x2e8\n     \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n\n   - Add the results from the subtraction and the right shift:\n     \\[\n     0x156c + 0x2e8\n     \\]\n\n   - Convert both to decimal and add:\n     - \\(0x156c\\) in decimal is \\(5484\\).\n     - \\(0x2e8\\) in decimal is \\(744\\).\n\n     \\[\n     5484 + 744 = 6228\n     \\]\n\n   - Convert the final result back to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     6228 \\text{ in hexadecimal is } 0x1854\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0x1854>>>}\n\\]"
