    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step. The expression given is:\n\n\\[\n((0x57b7 * 0x687) << 0x0)\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion:**\n   - \\(0x57b7\\) in decimal is \\(22455\\).\n   - \\(0x687\\) in decimal is \\(1671\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the two decimal numbers: \\(22455 \\times 1671\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - \\(22455 \\times 1671 = 37520905\\).\n\n4. **Left Shift Operation:**\n   - The expression includes a left shift by \\(0x0\\), which is \\(0\\) in decimal.\n   - Shifting a number by 0 bits means the number remains unchanged.\n\n5. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert \\(37520905\\) to hexadecimal.\n\n6. **Final Conversion:**\n   - \\(37520905\\) in hexadecimal is \\(0x23b8d5f\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0x23b8d5f>>>}\n\\]"
