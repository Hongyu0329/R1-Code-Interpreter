    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step, considering the operations and the properties of bit manipulation. The expression given is:\n\n\\[\n((0xdd1a >> 0x1) << 0x0)\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Hexadecimal Value:**\n   - The hexadecimal value `0xdd1a` is a 16-bit number. In binary, it is represented as `1101110100011010`.\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation (`>>`):**\n   - The operation `0xdd1a >> 0x1` means we are performing a right shift by 1 bit.\n   - Right shifting by 1 bit divides the number by 2, discarding the least significant bit.\n   - Binary representation of `0xdd1a` is `1101110100011010`.\n   - After right shifting by 1 bit, it becomes `0110111010001101`.\n\n3. **Convert the Result to Hexadecimal:**\n   - The binary `0110111010001101` converts to hexadecimal as `0x6e8d`.\n\n4. **Left Shift Operation (`<<`):**\n   - The operation `<< 0x0` means we are performing a left shift by 0 bits.\n   - Left shifting by 0 bits means the number remains unchanged.\n   - Therefore, `0x6e8d << 0x0` is still `0x6e8d`.\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the expression is `0x6e8d`.\n\nThus, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0x6e8d>>>}\n\\]"
