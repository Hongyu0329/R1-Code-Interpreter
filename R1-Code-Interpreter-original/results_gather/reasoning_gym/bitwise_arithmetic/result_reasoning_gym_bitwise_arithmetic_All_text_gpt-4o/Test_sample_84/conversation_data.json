    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Hexadecimal Values:**\n   - `0x33c` is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\(3 \\times 16^2 + 3 \\times 16^1 + 12 \\times 16^0 = 768 + 48 + 12 = 828\\).\n   - `0xc1ba` is another hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\(12 \\times 16^3 + 1 \\times 16^2 + 11 \\times 16^1 + 10 \\times 16^0 = 49152 + 256 + 176 + 10 = 49594\\).\n\n2. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the decimal equivalents of the hexadecimal numbers: \\(828 \\times 49594\\).\n   - Calculate the product: \\(828 \\times 49594 = 41055132\\).\n\n3. **Right Shift Operation:**\n   - The problem specifies a right shift by `0x3`, which is 3 in decimal.\n   - Right shifting a number by 3 is equivalent to dividing the number by \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n   - Perform the division: \\(41055132 \\div 8 = 5131891.5\\).\n\n4. **Consider the Result:**\n   - Since we are dealing with integers, the result of the division should be an integer. In most programming languages, a right shift operation on integers truncates towards zero, so we take the floor of the division result: \\(5131891\\).\n\n5. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert the integer result back to hexadecimal: \\(5131891\\) in decimal is \\(0x4e1f43\\) in hexadecimal.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<0x4e1f43>>>"
