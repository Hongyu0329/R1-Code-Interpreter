    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform the operations step by step, taking into account the properties of hexadecimal arithmetic and signed integers.\n\n1. **Subtraction**: \n   - First, we need to subtract `0xf18d` from `0xd393`.\n   - Convert both numbers to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - `0xd393` in decimal is `54163`.\n     - `0xf18d` in decimal is `61837`.\n   - Perform the subtraction: `54163 - 61837 = -7674`.\n   - Convert `-7674` back to hexadecimal: `-7674` in decimal is `-0x1df2` in hexadecimal.\n\n2. **Left Shift**:\n   - Next, we need to perform a left shift on `0xf4fa` by `0x1` (which is 1 in decimal).\n   - Convert `0xf4fa` to decimal: `0xf4fa` in decimal is `62714`.\n   - Perform the left shift: `62714 << 1` is equivalent to multiplying by 2, resulting in `125428`.\n   - Convert `125428` back to hexadecimal: `125428` in decimal is `0x1e9f4` in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Multiplication**:\n   - Now, multiply the results from the subtraction and the left shift:\n   - Multiply `-0x1df2` by `0x1e9f4`.\n   - Convert both numbers to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - `-0x1df2` in decimal is `-7674`.\n     - `0x1e9f4` in decimal is `125428`.\n   - Perform the multiplication: `-7674 * 125428 = -962394072`.\n   - Convert `-962394072` back to hexadecimal: `-962394072` in decimal is `-0x395b1c28` in hexadecimal.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0x395b1c28>>>"
