    "To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step, considering the operations and the hexadecimal values involved. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0x9ce << 0x1) << 0x0)\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Hexadecimal Value:**\n   - \\(0x9ce\\) is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\(9 \\times 16^2 + 12 \\times 16^1 + 14 \\times 16^0 = 2302\\).\n\n2. **First Shift Operation:**\n   - The expression \\(0x9ce << 0x1\\) means shifting the bits of \\(0x9ce\\) to the left by 1 position.\n   - Shifting left by 1 bit is equivalent to multiplying the number by \\(2\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(2302 \\times 2 = 4604\\).\n\n3. **Second Shift Operation:**\n   - The expression \\((4604) << 0x0\\) means shifting the bits of \\(4604\\) to the left by 0 positions.\n   - Shifting left by 0 bits means the number remains unchanged.\n   - Therefore, the result is still \\(4604\\).\n\n4. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert \\(4604\\) from decimal to hexadecimal.\n   - \\(4604\\) in hexadecimal is \\(0x11c4\\).\n\nThus, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0x11c4>>>}\n\\]"
