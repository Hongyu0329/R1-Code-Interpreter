    "To solve the problem, we need to perform bitwise right shift operations on the given hexadecimal number. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: The given hexadecimal number is `0xb766`.\n\n2. **First Right Shift**: \n   - We need to perform a right shift by 1 bit on `0xb766`.\n   - In binary, `0xb766` is `1011011101100110`.\n   - Right shifting by 1 bit means removing the least significant bit and adding a 0 at the most significant bit position.\n   - After shifting, the binary becomes `0101101110110011`.\n   - Converting this back to hexadecimal, we get `0x5bb3`.\n\n3. **Second Right Shift**:\n   - Now, we perform another right shift by 1 bit on `0x5bb3`.\n   - In binary, `0x5bb3` is `0101101110110011`.\n   - Right shifting by 1 bit again, we get `0010110111011001`.\n   - Converting this back to hexadecimal, we get `0x2dd9`.\n\n4. **Final Result**:\n   - The final result after performing the two right shifts is `0x2dd9`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x2dd9>>>"
