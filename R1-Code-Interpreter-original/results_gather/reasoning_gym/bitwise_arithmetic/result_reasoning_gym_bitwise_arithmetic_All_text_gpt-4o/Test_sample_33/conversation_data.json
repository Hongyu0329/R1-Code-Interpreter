    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: Calculate \\(0x729a - 0x765d\\).\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal:\n     - \\(0x729a = 29338\\)\n     - \\(0x765d = 30301\\)\n   - Perform the subtraction in decimal:\n     - \\(29338 - 30301 = -963\\)\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(-963\\) in decimal is \\(-0x3c3\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n2. **Right Shift**: Calculate \\(0xee43 >> 0x3\\).\n   - Convert the hexadecimal number to decimal:\n     - \\(0xee43 = 61059\\)\n   - Perform the right shift by 3 bits:\n     - \\(61059 >> 3 = 7632\\)\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(7632\\) in decimal is \\(0x1dd0\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Multiplication**: Multiply the results from the previous steps.\n   - Multiply \\(-0x3c3\\) by \\(0x1dd0\\):\n     - Convert both numbers to decimal:\n       - \\(-0x3c3 = -963\\)\n       - \\(0x1dd0 = 7632\\)\n     - Perform the multiplication in decimal:\n       - \\(-963 \\times 7632 = -7348416\\)\n     - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n       - \\(-7348416\\) in decimal is \\(-0x700c80\\) in hexadecimal.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0x700c80>>>"
