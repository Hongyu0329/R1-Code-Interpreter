    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a bitwise right shift operation on the given hexadecimal number. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Operation**: The operation given is `(0xf387 >> 0x0)`. This means we are right-shifting the hexadecimal number `0xf387` by `0x0` positions.\n\n2. **Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion**: \n   - The hexadecimal number `0xf387` is equivalent to the decimal number `62343`.\n   - The hexadecimal number `0x0` is equivalent to the decimal number `0`.\n\n3. **Right Shift Operation**: \n   - A right shift operation by `0` positions means the number remains unchanged. \n   - Therefore, `0xf387` right-shifted by `0` positions is still `0xf387`.\n\n4. **Final Result**: \n   - Since the right shift by `0` does not alter the number, the final result remains `0xf387`.\n\n5. **Output Format**: \n   - The problem specifies that if the answer is negative, it should be represented as a negative value. However, in this case, the result is positive.\n   - The final answer should be presented in the format `<<<answer>>>`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0xf387>>>"
