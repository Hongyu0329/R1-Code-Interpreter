    "To solve the problem, we need to perform bitwise operations on the given hexadecimal number. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: We start with the hexadecimal number `0x4e17`.\n\n2. **First Operation - Right Shift by 0x3**: \n   - The operation `0x4e17 >> 0x3` means we need to right shift the binary representation of `0x4e17` by 3 bits.\n   - Convert `0x4e17` to binary: `0x4e17` is `0100 1110 0001 0111` in binary.\n   - Right shift by 3 bits: \n     - Original: `0100 1110 0001 0111`\n     - Shifted:  `0000 1001 1100 0010`\n   - The binary `0000 1001 1100 0010` converts back to hexadecimal as `0x9c2`.\n\n3. **Second Operation - Right Shift by 0x0**:\n   - The operation `(0x9c2 >> 0x0)` means we need to right shift the result by 0 bits.\n   - Since shifting by 0 bits does not change the number, the result remains `0x9c2`.\n\n4. **Final Result**: The final result after performing the operations is `0x9c2`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x9c2>>>"
