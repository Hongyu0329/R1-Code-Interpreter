    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform bitwise right shifts on hexadecimal numbers and then add the results. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Right Shift Operation**: \n   - The right shift operation (`>>`) moves the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions. For signed integers, the right shift operation fills the leftmost bits with the sign bit (arithmetic shift).\n\n2. **Perform Right Shift on Each Number**:\n   - **0x970c >> 0x2**: \n     - Convert `0x2` to decimal: `0x2` is `2` in decimal.\n     - Right shift `0x970c` by 2 positions.\n     - `0x970c` in binary is `1001011100001100`.\n     - Right shifting by 2 positions gives `0010010111000011`, which is `0x25c3` in hexadecimal.\n\n   - **0xe46c >> 0x2**:\n     - Convert `0x2` to decimal: `0x2` is `2` in decimal.\n     - Right shift `0xe46c` by 2 positions.\n     - `0xe46c` in binary is `1110010001101100`.\n     - Right shifting by 2 positions gives `0011100100011011`, which is `0x391b` in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Add the Results**:\n   - Add the two results from the right shifts: `0x25c3 + 0x391b`.\n   - Perform the addition:\n     - `0x25c3` in decimal is `9667`.\n     - `0x391b` in decimal is `14619`.\n     - Adding these gives `24286` in decimal.\n     - Convert `24286` back to hexadecimal: `0x5ede`.\n\n4. **Output the Final Answer**:\n   - The final result of the addition in hexadecimal is `0x5ede`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x5ede>>>"
