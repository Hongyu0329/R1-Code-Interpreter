    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operations involved:**\n   - Right shift (`>>`): This operation shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions. For signed integers, the sign bit is preserved.\n   - Subtraction (`-`): This operation subtracts one number from another.\n   - Multiplication (`*`): This operation multiplies two numbers.\n\n2. **Evaluate the right shift operation:**\n   - The expression `0x1b28 >> 0x2` involves a right shift of the hexadecimal number `0x1b28` by `0x2` positions.\n   - Convert `0x1b28` to decimal: `0x1b28` is `6952` in decimal.\n   - Convert `0x2` to decimal: `0x2` is `2` in decimal.\n   - Perform the right shift: `6952 >> 2` is equivalent to dividing `6952` by `2^2` (or `4`), which results in `1738`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the multiplication operation:**\n   - The expression `0xe27d * 0xb6bb` involves multiplying two hexadecimal numbers.\n   - Convert `0xe27d` to decimal: `0xe27d` is `57981` in decimal.\n   - Convert `0xb6bb` to decimal: `0xb6bb` is `46779` in decimal.\n   - Perform the multiplication: `57981 * 46779` equals `2711685399`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the subtraction operation:**\n   - The expression is now `1738 - 2711685399`.\n   - Perform the subtraction: `1738 - 2711685399` equals `-2711683661`.\n\n5. **Convert the final result to hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert `-2711683661` to hexadecimal: The result is `-0xa1b8e3ed`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the specified format is:\n\n<<<-0xa1b8e3ed>>>"
