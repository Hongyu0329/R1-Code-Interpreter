    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform bitwise operations on the hexadecimal number 0x406d. The operations include a right shift followed by a left shift. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Value:**\n   - The initial value is 0x406d, which is a hexadecimal representation of a signed integer.\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation:**\n   - The operation `0x406d >> 0x3` means we need to right shift the binary representation of 0x406d by 3 bits.\n   - In binary, 0x406d is represented as 0100 0000 0110 1101.\n   - Right shifting by 3 bits: \n     - Original: 0100 0000 0110 1101\n     - After shifting: 0000 1000 0000 1101\n   - The result of the right shift is 0x80d in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Left Shift Operation:**\n   - The operation `(0x80d << 0x2)` means we need to left shift the result of the previous operation by 2 bits.\n   - In binary, 0x80d is represented as 0000 1000 0000 1101.\n   - Left shifting by 2 bits:\n     - Original: 0000 1000 0000 1101\n     - After shifting: 0010 0000 0011 0100\n   - The result of the left shift is 0x20134 in hexadecimal.\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result after performing the specified bitwise operations is 0x20134.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x20134>>>"
