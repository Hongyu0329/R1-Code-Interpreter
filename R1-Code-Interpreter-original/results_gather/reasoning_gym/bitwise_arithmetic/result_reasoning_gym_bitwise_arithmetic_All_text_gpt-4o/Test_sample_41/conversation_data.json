    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic and bitwise operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: \n   - We start with the subtraction of two hexadecimal numbers: 0x7701 and 0x4d33.\n   - Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - 0x7701 in decimal is 30465.\n     - 0x4d33 in decimal is 19763.\n   - Perform the subtraction: 30465 - 19763 = 10702.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: 10702 in decimal is 0x29CE in hexadecimal.\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation**:\n   - Next, we perform a right shift operation on the result of the subtraction.\n   - The operation is (0x29CE >> 0x3).\n   - 0x3 in decimal is 3, so we are shifting the bits of 0x29CE to the right by 3 positions.\n   - In binary, 0x29CE is 0010 1001 1100 1110.\n   - Shifting right by 3 positions, we get: 0000 0101 0011 1001, which is 0x539 in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Final Result**:\n   - The result of the right shift operation is 0x539.\n   - Since the problem specifies that if the answer is negative, it should be represented as a negative value, we need to check if the result is negative. In this case, the result is positive, so we do not need to convert it to a negative form.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal is:\n\n<<<0x539>>>"
