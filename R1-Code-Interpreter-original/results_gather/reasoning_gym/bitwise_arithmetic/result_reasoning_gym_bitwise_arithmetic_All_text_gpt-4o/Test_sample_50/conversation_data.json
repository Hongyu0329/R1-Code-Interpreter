    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Hexadecimal Numbers:**\n   - `0xf906` is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\( 63750 \\).\n   - `0xd416` is another hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\( 54358 \\).\n\n2. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the two decimal numbers: \\( 63750 \\times 54358 \\).\n   - The result of this multiplication is \\( 3462439500 \\).\n\n3. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - The decimal number \\( 3462439500 \\) converts to hexadecimal as `0xce9b1c4c`.\n\n4. **Perform the Left Shift Operation:**\n   - The operation `<< 0x1` means shifting the bits of the number one position to the left.\n   - In binary, this is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2.\n   - Therefore, multiply `0xce9b1c4c` by 2.\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Result:**\n   - Multiply the hexadecimal number `0xce9b1c4c` by 2.\n   - The result is `0x19d363898`.\n\n6. **Check for Sign:**\n   - Since the problem states that the integers are signed and we are dealing with arbitrary bit depth, we need to ensure the result is interpreted correctly.\n   - The result `0x19d363898` is positive, so no conversion to a negative value is needed.\n\n7. **Format the Final Answer:**\n   - The final result in hexadecimal is `0x19d363898`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x19d363898>>>"
