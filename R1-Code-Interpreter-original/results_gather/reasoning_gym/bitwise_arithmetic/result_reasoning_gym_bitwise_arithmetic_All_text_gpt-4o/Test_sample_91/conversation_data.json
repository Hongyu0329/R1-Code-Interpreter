    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Hexadecimal Multiplication:**\n   - First, multiply the two hexadecimal numbers: 0x1c92 and 0xd7a8.\n   - Convert them to decimal for easier multiplication:\n     - 0x1c92 = 7314 (in decimal)\n     - 0xd7a8 = 55208 (in decimal)\n   - Multiply the decimal values: 7314 * 55208 = 403,867,712\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: 403,867,712 = 0x181b8f20\n\n2. **Hexadecimal Addition:**\n   - Add the two hexadecimal numbers: 0x620e and 0x8a44.\n   - Convert them to decimal for easier addition:\n     - 0x620e = 25,166 (in decimal)\n     - 0x8a44 = 35,460 (in decimal)\n   - Add the decimal values: 25,166 + 35,460 = 60,626\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: 60,626 = 0xec52\n\n3. **Final Addition:**\n   - Add the results from the multiplication and addition:\n     - 0x181b8f20 (from multiplication) + 0xec52 (from addition)\n   - Convert them to decimal for easier addition:\n     - 0x181b8f20 = 403,867,712 (in decimal)\n     - 0xec52 = 60,626 (in decimal)\n   - Add the decimal values: 403,867,712 + 60,626 = 403,928,338\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: 403,928,338 = 0x181c7b72\n\nThe final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<0x181c7b72>>>"
