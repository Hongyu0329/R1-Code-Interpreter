    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction in the first part:**\n   - Calculate \\(0x4099 - 0x231c\\).\n   - Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - \\(0x4099 = 16537\\)\n     - \\(0x231c = 8988\\)\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(16537 - 8988 = 7549\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: \\(7549 = 0x1d7d\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication in the second part:**\n   - Calculate \\(0xbba1 \\times 0x6310\\).\n   - Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal:\n     - \\(0xbba1 = 48033\\)\n     - \\(0x6310 = 25360\\)\n   - Perform the multiplication: \\(48033 \\times 25360 = 1217846880\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: \\(1217846880 = 0x48f8e360\\).\n\n3. **Final subtraction:**\n   - Now, subtract the result of the multiplication from the result of the first subtraction:\n   - \\(0x1d7d - 0x48f8e360\\).\n   - Convert \\(0x1d7d\\) to decimal: \\(7549\\).\n   - Convert \\(0x48f8e360\\) to decimal: \\(1217846880\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(7549 - 1217846880 = -1217849331\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: \\(-1217849331 = -0x48f8fb83\\).\n\nThe final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<-0x48f8fb83>>>"
