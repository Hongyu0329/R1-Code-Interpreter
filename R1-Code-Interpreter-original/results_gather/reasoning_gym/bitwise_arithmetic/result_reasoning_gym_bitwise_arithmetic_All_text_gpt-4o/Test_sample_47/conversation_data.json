    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction in the first set of parentheses:**\n   - Calculate \\(0x3ff2 - 0xba45\\).\n   - Convert hexadecimal to decimal:\n     - \\(0x3ff2 = 16370\\)\n     - \\(0xba45 = 47685\\)\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     - \\(16370 - 47685 = -31315\\)\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(-31315\\) in decimal is \\(-0x7a53\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n2. **Subtraction in the second set of parentheses:**\n   - Calculate \\(0x11ef - 0x5ad5\\).\n   - Convert hexadecimal to decimal:\n     - \\(0x11ef = 4591\\)\n     - \\(0x5ad5 = 23253\\)\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     - \\(4591 - 23253 = -18662\\)\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(-18662\\) in decimal is \\(-0x48e6\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Multiplication of the results from the two subtractions:**\n   - Multiply the two results: \\((-0x7a53) \\times (-0x48e6)\\).\n   - Convert the hexadecimal values to decimal:\n     - \\(-0x7a53 = -31315\\)\n     - \\(-0x48e6 = -18662\\)\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     - \\((-31315) \\times (-18662) = 584186930\\)\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(584186930\\) in decimal is \\(0x22e1b7f2\\) in hexadecimal.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x22e1b7f2>>>"
