    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic and bitwise operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: \n   - We start with the subtraction of two hexadecimal numbers: 0x849d and 0x533b.\n   - Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - 0x849d = 33949 (in decimal)\n     - 0x533b = 21307 (in decimal)\n   - Perform the subtraction: 33949 - 21307 = 12642 (in decimal)\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: 12642 = 0x3162\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation**:\n   - The result from the subtraction is 0x3162.\n   - We need to perform a right shift operation by 0x3 (which is 3 in decimal).\n   - Right shifting a number by 3 is equivalent to dividing the number by 2^3 (or 8).\n   - Perform the division: 12642 / 8 = 1580.25\n   - Since we are dealing with integers, we take the floor of the division result: 1580\n\n3. **Convert the Final Result to Hexadecimal**:\n   - Convert the final integer result back to hexadecimal: 1580 = 0x62c\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<0x62c>>>"
