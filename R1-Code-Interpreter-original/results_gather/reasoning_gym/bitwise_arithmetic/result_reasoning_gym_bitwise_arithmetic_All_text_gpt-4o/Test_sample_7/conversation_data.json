    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, taking into account the properties of signed integers and bit manipulation. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: \n   - We start with the expression \\(0x6646 - 0xbb94\\).\n   - Convert the hexadecimal values to decimal for easier subtraction:\n     - \\(0x6646\\) in decimal is \\(26182\\).\n     - \\(0xbb94\\) in decimal is \\(48020\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(26182 - 48020 = -21838\\).\n\n2. **Left Shift**:\n   - The result of the subtraction is \\(-21838\\).\n   - We need to left shift this result by 1 bit: \\((-21838) << 1\\).\n   - In binary, left shifting a number by 1 bit is equivalent to multiplying it by 2.\n   - Therefore, \\(-21838 \\times 2 = -43676\\).\n\n3. **Convert to Hexadecimal**:\n   - Convert the final result \\(-43676\\) to hexadecimal.\n   - The decimal number \\(-43676\\) in hexadecimal is \\(-0xaaec\\).\n\nThus, the final answer in the required format is:\n\n<<<-0xaaec>>>"
