    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction of Hexadecimal Numbers:**\n   - First, we need to subtract `0x6f85` from `0x4a31`.\n   - Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - `0x4a31` in decimal is `18993`.\n     - `0x6f85` in decimal is `28549`.\n   - Perform the subtraction: `18993 - 28549 = -9556`.\n   - Convert `-9556` back to hexadecimal: `-9556` in decimal is `-0x2554` in hexadecimal.\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation:**\n   - Next, we need to perform a right shift operation on `0x10d2` by `0x2` (which is 2 in decimal).\n   - Convert `0x10d2` to decimal: `0x10d2` is `4306` in decimal.\n   - Perform the right shift operation: `4306 >> 2` is equivalent to dividing `4306` by `2^2` (or 4).\n   - `4306 / 4 = 1076.5`, but since we are dealing with integers, we take the floor value, which is `1076`.\n   - Convert `1076` back to hexadecimal: `1076` in decimal is `0x434` in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Final Subtraction:**\n   - Now, we need to subtract the result of the right shift operation from the result of the first subtraction.\n   - We have `-0x2554` from the first subtraction and `0x434` from the right shift operation.\n   - Convert `0x434` to decimal for subtraction: `0x434` is `1076` in decimal.\n   - Perform the subtraction: `-9556 - 1076 = -10632`.\n   - Convert `-10632` back to hexadecimal: `-10632` in decimal is `-0x2988` in hexadecimal.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0x2988>>>"
