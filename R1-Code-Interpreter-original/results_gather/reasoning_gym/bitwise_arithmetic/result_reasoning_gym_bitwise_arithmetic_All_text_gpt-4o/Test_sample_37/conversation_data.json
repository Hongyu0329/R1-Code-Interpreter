    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Addition of Hexadecimal Numbers:**\n   - First, we need to add `0x9be9` and `0x5938`.\n   - Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier addition:\n     - `0x9be9` in decimal is `39913`.\n     - `0x5938` in decimal is `22840`.\n   - Add the decimal values: `39913 + 22840 = 62753`.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `62753` in decimal is `0xf121`.\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation:**\n   - Next, we need to perform a right shift operation on `0x6b1e` by `0x3` (which is 3 in decimal).\n   - Convert `0x6b1e` to decimal: `0x6b1e` is `27422`.\n   - Perform the right shift operation: `27422 >> 3` is equivalent to dividing `27422` by `2^3` (or 8).\n   - `27422 / 8 = 3427.75`. Since we are dealing with integers, we take the floor value, which is `3427`.\n   - Convert `3427` back to hexadecimal: `3427` in decimal is `0xd63`.\n\n3. **Final Addition:**\n   - Now, add the results from the previous steps: `0xf121` and `0xd63`.\n   - Convert `0xf121` to decimal: `0xf121` is `61729`.\n   - Convert `0xd63` to decimal: `0xd63` is `3427`.\n   - Add the decimal values: `61729 + 3427 = 65156`.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `65156` in decimal is `0xfe84`.\n\nTherefore, the final hexadecimal value is:\n\n<<<0xfe84>>>"
