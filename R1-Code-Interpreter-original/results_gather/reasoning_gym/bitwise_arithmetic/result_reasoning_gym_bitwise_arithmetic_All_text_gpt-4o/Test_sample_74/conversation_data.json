    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step. The expression given is:\n\n\\[\n((0xd32d >> 0x0) << 0x1)\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Hexadecimal Values:**\n   - \\(0xd32d\\) is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\(54061\\).\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation:**\n   - The expression \\(0xd32d >> 0x0\\) involves a right shift by \\(0x0\\) bits.\n   - Shifting by \\(0x0\\) (which is \\(0\\) in decimal) means no shift occurs. Therefore, the value remains \\(0xd32d\\).\n\n3. **Left Shift Operation:**\n   - Now, take the result from the previous step, which is still \\(0xd32d\\), and apply the left shift operation: \\((0xd32d << 0x1)\\).\n   - Shifting left by \\(0x1\\) (which is \\(1\\) in decimal) means multiplying the number by \\(2\\).\n   - In binary, a left shift by one position effectively doubles the number.\n\n4. **Calculate the Result:**\n   - \\(0xd32d\\) in binary is \\(1101001100101101\\).\n   - Shifting left by one bit, we get \\(11010011001011010\\).\n   - Convert this binary number back to hexadecimal:\n     - The binary \\(11010011001011010\\) is \\(0x1a65a\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of the expression is \\(0x1a65a\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0x1a65a>>>}\n\\]"
