    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression given is \\((0xe70d - 0x8a8) >> 0x0\\).\n\n2. **Subtraction:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - \\(0xe70d\\) in decimal is \\(59149\\).\n     - \\(0x8a8\\) in decimal is \\(2216\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     \\[\n     59149 - 2216 = 56933\n     \\]\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(56933\\) in hexadecimal is \\(0xde65\\).\n\n3. **Right Shift Operation:**\n   - The expression includes a right shift operation by \\(0x0\\), which is \\(0\\) in decimal.\n   - Shifting any number by \\(0\\) bits results in the same number.\n   - Therefore, \\(0xde65 >> 0\\) is still \\(0xde65\\).\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the expression is \\(0xde65\\).\n\nThus, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<0xde65>>>"
