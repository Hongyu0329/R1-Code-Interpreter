    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Hexadecimal Numbers:**\n   - 0x3519 is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\(3 \\times 16^3 + 5 \\times 16^2 + 1 \\times 16^1 + 9 \\times 16^0 = 13593\\).\n   - 0xfdd4 is another hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\(15 \\times 16^3 + 13 \\times 16^2 + 13 \\times 16^1 + 4 \\times 16^0 = 64980\\).\n\n2. **Addition of Hexadecimal Numbers:**\n   - Add the two decimal values: 13593 + 64980 = 78573.\n   - Convert the sum back to hexadecimal: 78573 in decimal is 0x133ed in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Right Shift Operation:**\n   - The problem specifies a right shift by 0x1, which is equivalent to a right shift by 1 in decimal.\n   - Right shifting a number by 1 is equivalent to dividing the number by 2.\n   - Perform the division: 78573 / 2 = 39286.5.\n   - Since we are dealing with integers, we take the floor of the division result: 39286.\n\n4. **Convert the Result to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert 39286 to hexadecimal: 39286 in decimal is 0x9996 in hexadecimal.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of the operation is 0x9996.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x9996>>>"
