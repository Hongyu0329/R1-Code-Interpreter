    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the operations and numbers:**\n   - We have a multiplication: \\(0xbf4f \\times 0x6e6f\\)\n   - We have a subtraction: \\(0xe39c - 0xa7c5\\)\n   - Finally, we add the results of the multiplication and subtraction.\n\n2. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - \\(0xbf4f\\) in decimal is \\(48975\\).\n     - \\(0x6e6f\\) in decimal is \\(28271\\).\n   - Multiply the decimal values:\n     - \\(48975 \\times 28271 = 1384282725\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(1384282725\\) in hexadecimal is \\(0x528d1d45\\).\n\n3. **Perform the subtraction:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal:\n     - \\(0xe39c\\) in decimal is \\(58268\\).\n     - \\(0xa7c5\\) in decimal is \\(42949\\).\n   - Subtract the decimal values:\n     - \\(58268 - 42949 = 15319\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(15319\\) in hexadecimal is \\(0x3bd7\\).\n\n4. **Add the results of the multiplication and subtraction:**\n   - Add the hexadecimal results:\n     - \\(0x528d1d45 + 0x3bd7\\).\n   - Convert \\(0x3bd7\\) to decimal for addition:\n     - \\(0x3bd7\\) in decimal is \\(15319\\).\n   - Add the decimal values:\n     - \\(1384282725 + 15319 = 1384298044\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(1384298044\\) in hexadecimal is \\(0x528d58bc\\).\n\n5. **Final result:**\n   - The final result of the expression is \\(0x528d58bc\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x528d58bc>>>"
