    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, taking into account the hexadecimal values and the signed integer context.\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:**\n   The expression given is:\n   \\[\n   ((0xa123 - 0x4b0) - (0xdb3c + 0x5864))\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the First Part:**\n   - Subtract \\(0x4b0\\) from \\(0xa123\\):\n     \\[\n     0xa123 - 0x4b0 = 0xa123 - 0x04b0\n     \\]\n   - Convert to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - \\(0xa123 = 41251\\)\n     - \\(0x4b0 = 1200\\)\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     \\[\n     41251 - 1200 = 40051\n     \\]\n   - Convert back to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     40051 = 0x9c73\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Second Part:**\n   - Add \\(0xdb3c\\) and \\(0x5864\\):\n     \\[\n     0xdb3c + 0x5864\n     \\]\n   - Convert to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - \\(0xdb3c = 56124\\)\n     - \\(0x5864 = 22628\\)\n   - Perform the addition:\n     \\[\n     56124 + 22628 = 78752\n     \\]\n   - Convert back to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     78752 = 0x133a0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Subtract the result of the second part from the result of the first part:\n     \\[\n     0x9c73 - 0x133a0\n     \\]\n   - Convert to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - \\(0x9c73 = 40051\\)\n     - \\(0x133a0 = 78752\\)\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     \\[\n     40051 - 78752 = -38701\n     \\]\n   - Convert back to hexadecimal:\n     \\[\n     -38701 = -0x974d\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   The final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{<<<-0x974d>>>}\n   \\]"
