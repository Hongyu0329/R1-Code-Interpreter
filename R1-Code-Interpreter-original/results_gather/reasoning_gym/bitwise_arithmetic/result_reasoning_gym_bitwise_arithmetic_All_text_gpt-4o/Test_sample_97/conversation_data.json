    "To solve the problem, we need to perform bitwise operations on the given hexadecimal number. Let's break down the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: We start with the hexadecimal number `0xa280`.\n\n2. **Left Shift Operation**: The first operation is a left shift by `0x2` (which is 2 in decimal). In a left shift operation, the bits of the number are shifted to the left by the specified number of positions, and zeros are filled in from the right. \n\n   - Shifting `0xa280` (which is `1010001010000000` in binary) to the left by 2 positions results in `101000101000000000` in binary.\n   - In hexadecimal, this is `0x28a000`.\n\n3. **Right Shift Operation**: The next operation is a right shift by `0x1` (which is 1 in decimal). In a right shift operation, the bits of the number are shifted to the right by the specified number of positions. For signed integers, the sign bit is typically extended to preserve the sign of the number (arithmetic shift).\n\n   - Shifting `0x28a000` (which is `101000101000000000` in binary) to the right by 1 position results in `10100010100000000` in binary.\n   - In hexadecimal, this is `0x145000`.\n\n4. **Final Result**: The result of the operations is `0x145000`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<0x145000>>>"
