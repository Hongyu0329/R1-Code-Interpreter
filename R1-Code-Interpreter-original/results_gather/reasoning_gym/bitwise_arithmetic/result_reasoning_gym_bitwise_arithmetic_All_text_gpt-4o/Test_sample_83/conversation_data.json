    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations involving bit shifting and multiplication. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Bitwise Right Shift Operation:**\n   - We have the expression `0x1dbb >> 0x2`.\n   - The hexadecimal number `0x1dbb` is equivalent to the decimal number `7611`.\n   - The right shift operation `>> 0x2` means shifting the bits of `0x1dbb` to the right by 2 positions.\n   - Shifting `7611` to the right by 2 bits is equivalent to integer division by 4.\n   - Therefore, `7611 >> 2` equals `1902` in decimal, which is `0x76e` in hexadecimal.\n\n2. **Multiplication Operation:**\n   - We have the expression `0xb0f4 * 0x57e4`.\n   - The hexadecimal number `0xb0f4` is equivalent to the decimal number `45300`.\n   - The hexadecimal number `0x57e4` is equivalent to the decimal number `22500`.\n   - Multiplying these two decimal numbers: `45300 * 22500 = 1019250000`.\n   - The result `1019250000` in decimal is `0x3ccf5c80` in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Subtraction Operation:**\n   - Now, we need to subtract the result of the multiplication from the result of the bitwise shift.\n   - We have `0x76e - 0x3ccf5c80`.\n   - In decimal, this is `1902 - 1019250000`.\n   - Performing the subtraction gives `-1019248098`.\n\n4. **Convert the Result to Hexadecimal:**\n   - The decimal number `-1019248098` needs to be converted to hexadecimal.\n   - The hexadecimal representation of `-1019248098` is `-0x3ccf5512`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the problem is:\n\n<<<-0x3ccf5512>>>"
