    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of bitwise and arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Operations:**\n   - We have a left shift operation `0x23e8 << 0x0`.\n   - We have a right shift operation `0x386e >> 0x3`.\n   - We need to multiply the results of these two operations.\n\n2. **Perform the Left Shift Operation:**\n   - `0x23e8` is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is `9192`.\n   - The operation `0x23e8 << 0x0` means shifting the bits of `0x23e8` to the left by `0` positions.\n   - Shifting by `0` positions means the number remains unchanged.\n   - Therefore, `0x23e8 << 0x0` results in `0x23e8`.\n\n3. **Perform the Right Shift Operation:**\n   - `0x386e` is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is `14446`.\n   - The operation `0x386e >> 0x3` means shifting the bits of `0x386e` to the right by `3` positions.\n   - Right shifting by `3` positions is equivalent to integer division by `2^3` or `8`.\n   - `14446 / 8 = 1805.75`. Since we are dealing with integers, we take the floor of this division, which is `1805`.\n   - In hexadecimal, `1805` is `0x70d`.\n\n4. **Multiply the Results:**\n   - Now, we multiply the results of the two operations: `0x23e8 * 0x70d`.\n   - In decimal, this is `9192 * 1805`.\n   - Performing the multiplication: `9192 * 1805 = 16601060`.\n   - Convert `16601060` to hexadecimal: `0xfdc1c4`.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of the expression is `0xfdc1c4`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0xfdc1c4>>>"
