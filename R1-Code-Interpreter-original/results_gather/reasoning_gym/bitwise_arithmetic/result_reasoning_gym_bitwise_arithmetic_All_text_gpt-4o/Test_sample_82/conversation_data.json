    "To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0xa154 - 0xa0cf) + (0xfc16 >> 0x2))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Evaluate the subtraction: \\(0xa154 - 0xa0cf\\)**\n\n   - Convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal:\n     - \\(0xa154\\) in decimal is \\(41268\\).\n     - \\(0xa0cf\\) in decimal is \\(41167\\).\n\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     \\[\n     41268 - 41167 = 101\n     \\]\n\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(101\\) in decimal is \\(0x65\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n2. **Evaluate the right shift: \\(0xfc16 >> 0x2\\)**\n\n   - Convert the hexadecimal number to decimal:\n     - \\(0xfc16\\) in decimal is \\(64534\\).\n\n   - Perform the right shift by 2 bits:\n     - Right shifting \\(64534\\) by 2 bits is equivalent to integer division by \\(4\\):\n     \\[\n     64534 \\div 4 = 16133\n     \\]\n\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(16133\\) in decimal is \\(0x3f05\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Add the results from steps 1 and 2:**\n\n   - Add the hexadecimal results:\n     \\[\n     0x65 + 0x3f05\n     \\]\n\n   - Convert to decimal to perform the addition:\n     - \\(0x65\\) in decimal is \\(101\\).\n     - \\(0x3f05\\) in decimal is \\(16133\\).\n\n   - Perform the addition:\n     \\[\n     101 + 16133 = 16234\n     \\]\n\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(16234\\) in decimal is \\(0x3f6a\\) in hexadecimal.\n\nThus, the final answer in hexadecimal is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0x3f6a>>>}\n\\]"
