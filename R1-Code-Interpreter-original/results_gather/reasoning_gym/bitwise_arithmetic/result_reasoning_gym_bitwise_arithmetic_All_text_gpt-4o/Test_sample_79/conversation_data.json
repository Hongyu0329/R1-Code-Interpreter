    "To solve the given problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Hexadecimal Multiplication:**\n   - We need to multiply `0x7f71` by `0x32b7`.\n   - Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal for easier multiplication:\n     - `0x7f71` in decimal is `32625`.\n     - `0x32b7` in decimal is `12983`.\n   - Multiply the decimal values: `32625 * 12983 = 423764175`.\n\n2. **Hexadecimal Right Shift:**\n   - We need to perform a right shift on `0xd0c9` by `0x1`.\n   - Convert `0xd0c9` to decimal: `0xd0c9` is `53449` in decimal.\n   - Right shift by 1 (equivalent to integer division by 2): `53449 >> 1 = 26724`.\n\n3. **Subtraction:**\n   - Subtract the result of the right shift from the result of the multiplication:\n     - `423764175 - 26724 = 423737451`.\n\n4. **Convert the Result Back to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Convert the final result `423737451` back to hexadecimal.\n   - `423737451` in hexadecimal is `0x193f3f3b`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<0x193f3f3b>>>"
