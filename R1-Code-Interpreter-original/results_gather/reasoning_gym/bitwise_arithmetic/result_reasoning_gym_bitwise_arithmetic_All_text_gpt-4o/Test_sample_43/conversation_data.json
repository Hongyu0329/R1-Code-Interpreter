    "To solve the problem, we need to perform bitwise operations on the given hexadecimal number. Let's break down the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: The given hexadecimal number is `0xad67`.\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation**: \n   - The operation `0xad67 >> 0x3` means we need to right shift the binary representation of `0xad67` by 3 bits.\n   - Convert `0xad67` to binary: `0xad67` is `1010110101100111` in binary.\n   - Right shift by 3 bits: `1010110101100111` becomes `0001010110101101` after shifting 3 bits to the right.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `0001010110101101` in binary is `0x15ad` in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Left Shift Operation**:\n   - The operation `0x15ad << 0x2` means we need to left shift the binary representation of `0x15ad` by 2 bits.\n   - Convert `0x15ad` to binary: `0x15ad` is `0001010110101101` in binary.\n   - Left shift by 2 bits: `0001010110101101` becomes `0101011010110100` after shifting 2 bits to the left.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `0101011010110100` in binary is `0x56b4` in hexadecimal.\n\n4. **Final Result**:\n   - The final result after performing the operations is `0x56b4`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal format is:\n\n<<<0x56b4>>>"
