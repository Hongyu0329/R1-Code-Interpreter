    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operation**: The expression given is \\(((0x4c17 \\times 0x532a) \\gg 0x2)\\). This involves a multiplication of two hexadecimal numbers followed by a right bitwise shift.\n\n2. **Convert hexadecimal to decimal**:\n   - \\(0x4c17\\) in decimal is \\(19479\\).\n   - \\(0x532a\\) in decimal is \\(21290\\).\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - Multiply the two decimal numbers: \\(19479 \\times 21290 = 414596910\\).\n\n4. **Convert the result back to hexadecimal**:\n   - \\(414596910\\) in decimal is \\(0x18b3b8ee\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n5. **Perform the right bitwise shift**:\n   - The operation \\(\\gg 0x2\\) means shifting the bits to the right by 2 positions.\n   - In decimal, this is equivalent to dividing by \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n   - \\(414596910 \\div 4 = 103649227.5\\).\n\n6. **Handle the result of the division**:\n   - Since we are dealing with integers, we take the floor of the division result: \\(103649227\\).\n\n7. **Convert the final result back to hexadecimal**:\n   - \\(103649227\\) in decimal is \\(0x62ceee5\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n8. **Format the final answer**:\n   - The final answer in the required format is: <<<0x62ceee5>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x62ceee5>>>"
