    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic and bitwise operations on hexadecimal numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Subtraction**: We start with the subtraction of two hexadecimal numbers: `0xa627` and `0x2dde`.\n\n   - Convert `0xa627` to decimal:  \n     \\( 0xa627 = 10 \\times 16^3 + 6 \\times 16^2 + 2 \\times 16^1 + 7 \\times 16^0 = 40960 + 1536 + 32 + 7 = 42535 \\)\n\n   - Convert `0x2dde` to decimal:  \n     \\( 0x2dde = 2 \\times 16^3 + 13 \\times 16^2 + 13 \\times 16^1 + 14 \\times 16^0 = 8192 + 3328 + 208 + 14 = 11742 \\)\n\n   - Subtract the two decimal values:  \n     \\( 42535 - 11742 = 30793 \\)\n\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal:  \n     \\( 30793_{10} = 0x7839 \\)\n\n2. **Right Shift**: Next, we perform a right shift operation on the result of the subtraction. The operation is `>> 0x3`, which means we shift the bits to the right by 3 positions.\n\n   - Convert `0x3` to decimal:  \n     \\( 0x3 = 3 \\)\n\n   - Perform the right shift on `0x7839`:  \n     - In binary, `0x7839` is `0111 1000 0011 1001`.\n     - Right shift by 3 positions: `0000 1111 0000 0111` (the three rightmost bits are discarded).\n\n   - Convert the shifted binary back to hexadecimal:  \n     - `0000 1111 0000 0111` in binary is `0x0f07` in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Final Answer**: The final result after performing the subtraction and right shift operations is `0x0f07`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0xf07>>>"
