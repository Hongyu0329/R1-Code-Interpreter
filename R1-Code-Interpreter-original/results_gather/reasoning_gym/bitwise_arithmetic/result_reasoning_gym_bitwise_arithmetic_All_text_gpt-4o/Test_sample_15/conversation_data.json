    "To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step, considering the operations and the hexadecimal values involved. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((0x58ed >> 0x3) << 0x0)\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Hexadecimal Value:**\n   - The hexadecimal value `0x58ed` is a positive integer. In decimal, it is equivalent to \\(22765\\).\n\n2. **Right Shift Operation (`>>`):**\n   - The expression `0x58ed >> 0x3` involves a right shift operation.\n   - The right shift by `0x3` means shifting the bits of `0x58ed` to the right by 3 positions.\n   - In binary, `0x58ed` is `0101 1000 1110 1101`.\n   - Shifting this right by 3 positions results in `0000 1011 0001 1101`, which is `0xB1D` in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Left Shift Operation (`<<`):**\n   - The expression `0xB1D << 0x0` involves a left shift operation.\n   - The left shift by `0x0` means shifting the bits of `0xB1D` to the left by 0 positions, which effectively means no change.\n   - Therefore, the result remains `0xB1D`.\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result of the expression is `0xB1D`.\n\nThus, the final hexadecimal value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0xB1D>>>}\n\\]"
