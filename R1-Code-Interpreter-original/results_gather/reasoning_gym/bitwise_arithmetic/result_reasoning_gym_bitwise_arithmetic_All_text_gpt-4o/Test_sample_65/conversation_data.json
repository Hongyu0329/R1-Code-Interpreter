    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, ensuring that we handle hexadecimal values correctly and consider the possibility of signed integers.\n\n1. **Addition of Hexadecimal Numbers:**\n   - First, add `0x9408` and `0x6a2`.\n   - Convert to decimal for easier addition:\n     - `0x9408` in decimal is `37896`.\n     - `0x6a2` in decimal is `1698`.\n   - Perform the addition: `37896 + 1698 = 39594`.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `39594` in decimal is `0x9eaa`.\n\n2. **Addition of Hexadecimal Numbers:**\n   - Next, add `0x53d` and `0xe463`.\n   - Convert to decimal for easier addition:\n     - `0x53d` in decimal is `1341`.\n     - `0xe463` in decimal is `58467`.\n   - Perform the addition: `1341 + 58467 = 59808`.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `59808` in decimal is `0xe9a0`.\n\n3. **Multiplication of Hexadecimal Numbers:**\n   - Now, multiply the results of the two additions: `0x9eaa * 0xe9a0`.\n   - Convert to decimal for easier multiplication:\n     - `0x9eaa` in decimal is `39594`.\n     - `0xe9a0` in decimal is `59808`.\n   - Perform the multiplication: `39594 * 59808 = 2368129152`.\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: `2368129152` in decimal is `0x8d3c8c00`.\n\n4. **Consideration of Signed Integers:**\n   - Since the problem states that there are signed integers and arbitrary bit depth, we need to consider if the result should be negative.\n   - The result `0x8d3c8c00` is a positive value in hexadecimal, and there is no indication that it should be negative based on the operations performed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in hexadecimal is:\n\n<<<0x8d3c8c00>>>"
