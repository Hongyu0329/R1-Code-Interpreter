    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Hexadecimal Values:**\n   - `0x24fd` is a hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\(2 \\times 16^3 + 4 \\times 16^2 + 15 \\times 16^1 + 13 \\times 16^0 = 9213\\).\n   - `0x5922` is another hexadecimal number. In decimal, it is \\(5 \\times 16^3 + 9 \\times 16^2 + 2 \\times 16^1 + 2 \\times 16^0 = 22818\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the Two Numbers:**\n   - Multiply the decimal equivalents: \\(9213 \\times 22818\\).\n   - The result of this multiplication is \\(210246834\\).\n\n3. **Right Shift the Result:**\n   - The operation `>> 0x2` means we need to perform a right bitwise shift by 2 positions.\n   - In decimal, shifting right by 2 is equivalent to dividing by \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n   - Divide \\(210246834\\) by 4 to get \\(52561708.5\\).\n\n4. **Convert the Result to Hexadecimal:**\n   - Since we are dealing with integers, we take the floor of the division result, which is \\(52561708\\).\n   - Convert \\(52561708\\) to hexadecimal: \n     - Divide \\(52561708\\) by 16 repeatedly and record the remainders.\n     - The hexadecimal representation is `0x322f7fc`.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final result in hexadecimal is `0x322f7fc`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0x322f7fc>>>"
