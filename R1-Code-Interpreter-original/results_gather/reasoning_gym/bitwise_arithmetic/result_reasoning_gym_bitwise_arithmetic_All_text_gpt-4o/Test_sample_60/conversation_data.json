    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression step by step. The expression given is:\n\n\\[\n((0x4514 >> 0x0) >> 0x2)\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Value:**\n   - The initial value is given in hexadecimal: \\(0x4514\\).\n   - Convert \\(0x4514\\) to binary for better understanding:\n     - \\(0x4514\\) in binary is \\(0100\\ 0101\\ 0001\\ 0100\\).\n\n2. **First Right Shift Operation:**\n   - The first operation is \\(0x4514 >> 0x0\\).\n   - Shifting by 0 bits means the value remains unchanged.\n   - Therefore, the result of this operation is still \\(0x4514\\).\n\n3. **Second Right Shift Operation:**\n   - Now, take the result from the first operation and perform the second shift: \\((0x4514) >> 0x2\\).\n   - Shifting right by 2 bits means we remove the two least significant bits.\n   - In binary, \\(0100\\ 0101\\ 0001\\ 0100\\) becomes \\(0001\\ 0001\\ 0100\\ 0101\\) after shifting right by 2 bits.\n   - Convert the binary result back to hexadecimal:\n     - \\(0001\\ 0001\\ 0100\\ 0101\\) in binary is \\(0x1145\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The final result after performing the operations is \\(0x1145\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the required format is:\n\n\\[\n<<<0x1145>>>\n\\]"
