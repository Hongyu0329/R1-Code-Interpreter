    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step, ensuring that we handle the hexadecimal values correctly and account for signed integers.\n\n1. **Subtraction of Hexadecimal Values:**\n   - Start with the first part of the expression: \\(0x651a - 0x55a4\\).\n   - Convert the hexadecimal values to decimal for easier calculation:\n     - \\(0x651a\\) in decimal is \\(25882\\).\n     - \\(0x55a4\\) in decimal is \\(21924\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(25882 - 21924 = 3958\\).\n   - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: \\(3958\\) in decimal is \\(0xF76\\).\n\n2. **Subtraction of the Next Hexadecimal Value:**\n   - Now, take the result from the first subtraction and subtract \\(0x2107\\) from it.\n   - Convert \\(0x2107\\) to decimal: \\(0x2107\\) is \\(8455\\) in decimal.\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(3958 - 8455 = -4497\\).\n   - Since the result is negative, convert \\(-4497\\) to hexadecimal:\n     - The positive value \\(4497\\) in decimal is \\(0x1191\\) in hexadecimal.\n     - Therefore, \\(-4497\\) is \\(-0x1191\\) in hexadecimal.\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of the expression \\(((0x651a - 0x55a4) - 0x2107)\\) is \\(-0x1191\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0x1191>>>"
