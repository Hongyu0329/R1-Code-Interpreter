    "\nassistant > The expression given is \\(((0xc99b >> 0x1) >> 0x0)\\).\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. \\(0xc99b\\) is a hexadecimal number.\n2. The operation \\(>> 0x1\\) is a right bitwise shift by 1.\n3. The operation \\(>> 0x0\\) is a right bitwise shift by 0, which means the number remains unchanged.\n\nLet's perform the calculation.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial value\nvalue = 0xc99b\n\n# Perform the right bitwise shift by 1\nresult = value >> 0x1\n\n# Perform the right bitwise shift by 0 (no change)\nfinal_result = result >> 0x0\n\n# Convert the result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(final_result)\nhex_result\nassistant > <<<0x64cd>>>"
