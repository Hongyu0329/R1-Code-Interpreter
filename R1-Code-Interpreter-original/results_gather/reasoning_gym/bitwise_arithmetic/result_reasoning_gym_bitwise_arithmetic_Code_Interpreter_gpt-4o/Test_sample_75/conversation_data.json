    "\nassistant > To solve the given expression \\(((0x7c86 << 0x2) >> 0x2)\\), we need to perform bitwise operations. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Left Shift (<<):** The left shift operation \\((0x7c86 << 0x2)\\) shifts the bits of \\(0x7c86\\) to the left by 2 positions.\n2. **Right Shift (>>):** The right shift operation \\(((result) >> 0x2)\\) shifts the bits of the result from the left shift back to the right by 2 positions.\n\nLet's calculate the result step by step.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial value\nvalue = 0x7c86\n\n# Perform left shift by 2\nleft_shifted = value << 2\n\n# Perform right shift by 2\nresult = left_shifted >> 2\n\n# Convert result to hexadecimal\nhex_result = hex(result)\nhex_result\nassistant > The final hexadecimal value is <<<0x7c86>>>."
