    "\nassistant > To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white and black knights, we need to analyze the board and the possible moves for each knight. The goal is to move the white knights to the positions currently occupied by the black knights and vice versa.\n\nLet's start by identifying the initial positions of the knights:\n\n- White Knights: A3, C1\n- Black Knights: D2, D1\n\nThe target positions are:\n- White Knights should move to D2, D1\n- Black Knights should move to A3, C1\n\nWe'll attempt to find a sequence of valid knight moves to achieve this swap.
