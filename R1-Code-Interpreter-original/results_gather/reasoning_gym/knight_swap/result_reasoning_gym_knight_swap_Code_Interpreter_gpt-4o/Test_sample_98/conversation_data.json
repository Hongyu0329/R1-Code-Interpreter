    "\nassistant > To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the possible moves for each knight. Let's start by identifying the initial positions of the knights:\n\n- White Knights (w): C3, C1\n- Black Knights (B): A1, B1\n\nThe target positions are:\n- White Knights should move to A1, B1\n- Black Knights should move to C3, C1\n\nLet's try to find a sequence of moves that accomplishes this swap. We'll simulate the moves step by step, ensuring that each move is valid according to the knight's movement rules. \n\nWe'll start with the white knights, as they move first.
