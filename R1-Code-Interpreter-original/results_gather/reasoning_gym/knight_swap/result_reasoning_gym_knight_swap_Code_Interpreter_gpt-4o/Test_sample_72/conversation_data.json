    "\nassistant > To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white and black knights, we need to analyze the board and see if we can achieve the swap through valid knight moves.\n\nLet's start by identifying the initial positions of the knights:\n\n- White Knights (w): D3, A2\n- Black Knights (B): B2, D1\n\nThe target positions for the swap are:\n\n- White Knights (w) should move to: B2, D1\n- Black Knights (B) should move to: D3, A2\n\nWe will attempt to find a sequence of moves that achieves this swap.
