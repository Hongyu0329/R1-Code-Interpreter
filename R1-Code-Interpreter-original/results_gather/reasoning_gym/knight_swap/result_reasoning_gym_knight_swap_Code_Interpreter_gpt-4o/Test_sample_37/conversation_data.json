    "\nassistant > To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the possible moves for each knight. The goal is to move the white knights to the initial positions of the black knights and vice versa.\n\nLet's start by identifying the initial positions of the knights:\n\n- White Knights (w): A3, D3\n- Black Knights (B): A1, B3\n\nThe target positions are:\n\n- White Knights (w) should move to: A1, B3\n- Black Knights (B) should move to: A3, D3\n\nWe will attempt to find a sequence of valid knight moves to achieve this swap.
