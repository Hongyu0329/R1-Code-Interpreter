    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 |   | . | w | . |\n   ----------------\n2 | w |   |   |   |\n   ----------------\n1 | B |   | B |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights ('w') with the black knights ('B').\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White knights move first, then alternate with black knights.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **White Knights' Initial Positions:**\n   - C3\n   - A2\n\n2. **Black Knights' Initial Positions:**\n   - A1\n   - C1\n\n3. **Target Positions:**\n   - White knights need to move to A1 and C1.\n   - Black knights need to move to C3 and A2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **First Move (White):**\n   - Move white knight from C3 to B1 (valid L-shape move).\n\n2. **Second Move (Black):**\n   - Move black knight from A1 to C2 (valid L-shape move).\n\n3. **Third Move (White):**\n   - Move white knight from A2 to C3 (valid L-shape move).\n\n4. **Fourth Move (Black):**\n   - Move black knight from C1 to A2 (valid L-shape move).\n\n5. **Fifth Move (White):**\n   - Move white knight from B1 to C1 (valid L-shape move).\n\n6. **Sixth Move (Black):**\n   - Move black knight from C2 to A1 (valid L-shape move).\n\n### Final Board Configuration:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 |   | . | B | . |\n   ----------------\n2 | B |   |   |   |\n   ----------------\n1 | w |   | w |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe swap is possible with the following sequence of moves:\n1. \"w,C3,B1\"\n2. \"B,A1,C2\"\n3. \"w,A2,C3\"\n4. \"B,C1,A2\"\n5. \"w,B1,C1\"\n6. \"B,C2,A1\"\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"w,C3,B1\", \"B,A1,C2\", \"w,A2,C3\", \"B,C1,A2\", \"w,B1,C1\", \"B,C2,A1\"]>>>"
