    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white and black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C\n   ------------\n3 |   | w | . |\n   ------------\n2 | . |   | B |\n   ------------\n1 | B |   | w |\n   ------------\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights ('w') with the black knights ('B').\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White moves first, then alternate turns.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - White knights: B3, C1\n   - Black knights: A1, C2\n\n2. **Target Positions:**\n   - White knights should move to A1, C2\n   - Black knights should move to B3, C1\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From B3, a white knight can move to A1 or C1.\n   - From C1, a white knight can move to A1 or B3.\n   - From A1, a black knight can move to B3 or C2.\n   - From C2, a black knight can move to A1 or B3.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - **Move 1 (w):** Move white knight from B3 to A1.\n   - **Move 2 (B):** Move black knight from A1 to B3.\n   - **Move 3 (w):** Move white knight from C1 to C2.\n   - **Move 4 (B):** Move black knight from C2 to C1.\n\n5. **Final Positions:**\n   - White knights: A1, C2\n   - Black knights: B3, C1\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe swap is possible with the following sequence of moves:\n\n1. White knight moves from B3 to A1.\n2. Black knight moves from A1 to B3.\n3. White knight moves from C1 to C2.\n4. Black knight moves from C2 to C1.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe sequence of moves to achieve the swap is:\n\n<<<[\"w,B3,A1\", \"B,A1,B3\", \"w,C1,C2\", \"B,C2,C1\"]>>>"
