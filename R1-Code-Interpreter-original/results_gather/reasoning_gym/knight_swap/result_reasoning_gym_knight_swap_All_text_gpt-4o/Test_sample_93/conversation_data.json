    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 |   | B | . |   |\n   ----------------\n2 | w |   | . | . |\n   ----------------\n1 | B | w |   |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at A2 and B1.\n- Black Knights (B) are at B3 and A1.\n- Empty squares are at C3, C2, and D2.\n\n### Objective:\nSwap the positions of all white knights with all black knights.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White moves first, then alternate with black.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Moves:**\n   - White knight at A2 can move to C3 (A2 → C3).\n   - Black knight at B3 can move to C2 (B3 → C2).\n\n2. **Board after Initial Moves:**\n   ```\n       A   B   C   D\n      ----------------\n   3 |   |   | w |   |\n      ----------------\n   2 | w |   | B | . |\n      ----------------\n   1 | B | w |   |   |\n      ----------------\n   ```\n\n3. **Next Moves:**\n   - White knight at B1 can move to D2 (B1 → D2).\n   - Black knight at A1 can move to B3 (A1 → B3).\n\n4. **Board after Next Moves:**\n   ```\n       A   B   C   D\n      ----------------\n   3 |   | B | w |   |\n      ----------------\n   2 | w |   | B | w |\n      ----------------\n   1 |   |   |   |   |\n      ----------------\n   ```\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - White knight at C3 can move to A1 (C3 → A1).\n   - Black knight at C2 can move to A2 (C2 → A2).\n\n6. **Final Board Configuration:**\n   ```\n       A   B   C   D\n      ----------------\n   3 |   | B |   |   |\n      ----------------\n   2 | B |   |   | w |\n      ----------------\n   1 | w |   |   |   |\n      ----------------\n   ```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe positions of the white and black knights have been successfully swapped. The sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n- \"w,A2,C3\"\n- \"B,B3,C2\"\n- \"w,B1,D2\"\n- \"B,A1,B3\"\n- \"w,C3,A1\"\n- \"B,C2,A2\"\n\nThus, it is possible to swap the knights' positions.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<[\"w,A2,C3\", \"B,B3,C2\", \"w,B1,D2\", \"B,A1,B3\", \"w,C3,A1\", \"B,C2,A2\"]>>>"
