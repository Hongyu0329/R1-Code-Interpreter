    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules carefully. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | . | . | . |   |\n   ----------------\n2 | B |   | w | w |\n   ----------------\n1 | . | B |   |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at C2 and D2.\n- Black Knights (B) are at A2 and B1.\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. Black moves first, then alternate with white.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Initial Moves for Black Knights:**\n   - B at A2 can move to C1 (L-shape: two squares right, one square down).\n   - B at B1 can move to D2 (L-shape: two squares right, one square up).\n\n2. **Initial Moves for White Knights:**\n   - w at C2 can move to A1 (L-shape: two squares left, one square down).\n   - w at D2 can move to B3 (L-shape: two squares left, one square up).\n\n3. **Subsequent Moves:**\n   - After the initial moves, the board looks like this:\n     ```\n         A   B   C   D\n        ----------------\n     3 | . | w | . |   |\n        ----------------\n     2 | . |   | B | B |\n        ----------------\n     1 | w | . |   |   |\n        ----------------\n     ```\n   - Now, continue moving the knights to their target positions:\n     - B at C2 can move to A2.\n     - B at D2 can move to B1.\n     - w at A1 can move to C2.\n     - w at B3 can move to D2.\n\n4. **Final Board Configuration:**\n   - After all moves, the board should look like this:\n     ```\n         A   B   C   D\n        ----------------\n     3 | . | . | . |   |\n        ----------------\n     2 | w |   | B | B |\n        ----------------\n     1 | . | w |   |   |\n        ----------------\n     ```\n\n### Conclusion:\n- It is possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights.\n- The sequence of moves is as follows:\n  1. \"B,A2,C1\"\n  2. \"B,B1,D2\"\n  3. \"w,C2,A1\"\n  4. \"w,D2,B3\"\n  5. \"B,C1,A2\"\n  6. \"B,D2,B1\"\n  7. \"w,A1,C2\"\n  8. \"w,B3,D2\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<[\"B,A2,C1\", \"B,B1,D2\", \"w,C2,A1\", \"w,D2,B3\", \"B,C1,A2\", \"B,D2,B1\", \"w,A1,C2\", \"w,B3,D2\"]>>>"
