    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | . | . | B | w |\n   ----------------\n2 |   |   | w | B |\n   ----------------\n1 | . | . | . |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at positions D3 and C2.\n- Black Knights (B) are at positions C3 and D2.\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights.\n\n### Knight Movement:\n- Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n- Knights can only move to empty squares.\n\n### Steps to Analyze:\n\n1. **Identify Possible Moves:**\n   - From D3 (w), possible moves are:\n     - B4 (out of bounds)\n     - C5 (out of bounds)\n     - E4 (out of bounds)\n     - F2 (out of bounds)\n     - E2 (out of bounds)\n     - C1 (valid, but occupied)\n     - B2 (valid, but occupied)\n     - C4 (out of bounds)\n   - From C2 (w), possible moves are:\n     - A3 (valid, but occupied)\n     - B4 (out of bounds)\n     - D4 (out of bounds)\n     - E3 (out of bounds)\n     - E1 (out of bounds)\n     - D1 (valid, but occupied)\n     - B1 (valid, but occupied)\n     - A1 (valid, but occupied)\n\n2. **Check for Valid Moves:**\n   - Both white knights are blocked by the black knights or the edge of the board.\n   - No valid moves are available for the white knights to start the swap.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the white knights cannot make any valid moves to start the swap, it is impossible to swap the positions of the white and black knights under the given rules.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe puzzle is impossible to solve given the current board setup and rules.\n\n<<<No>>>"
