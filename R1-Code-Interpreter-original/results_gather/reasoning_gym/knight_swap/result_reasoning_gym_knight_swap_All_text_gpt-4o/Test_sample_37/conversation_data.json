    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | w | B | . | w |\n   ----------------\n2 |   |   |   | . |\n   ----------------\n1 | B | . | . |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at positions A3 and D3.\n- Black Knights (B) are at positions B3 and A1.\n- Empty squares are at C3, D2, B1, and C1.\n\n### Objective:\nSwap the positions of all white knights with all black knights.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White moves first, then alternate with black.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **White Knight at A3**: Possible moves are to B1 or C2.\n2. **White Knight at D3**: Possible moves are to C1 or B2.\n3. **Black Knight at B3**: Possible moves are to A1 or C1.\n4. **Black Knight at A1**: Possible moves are to B3 or C2.\n\n### Strategy:\n- We need to find a sequence of moves that allows the knights to swap positions without blocking each other.\n- The key is to use the empty squares effectively to facilitate the swap.\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\n1. **w, A3 to B1**: Move the white knight from A3 to B1.\n2. **B, B3 to A1**: Move the black knight from B3 to A1.\n3. **w, D3 to C1**: Move the white knight from D3 to C1.\n4. **B, A1 to C2**: Move the black knight from A1 to C2.\n5. **w, B1 to A3**: Move the white knight from B1 to A3.\n6. **B, C2 to D3**: Move the black knight from C2 to D3.\n7. **w, C1 to B3**: Move the white knight from C1 to B3.\n\n### Final Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | B | w | . | B |\n   ----------------\n2 |   |   |   | . |\n   ----------------\n1 | w | . | . |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights are now at B3 and A1.\n- Black Knights are now at A3 and D3.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe swap is possible with the sequence of moves listed above.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<[\"w,A3,B1\", \"B,B3,A1\", \"w,D3,C1\", \"B,A1,C2\", \"w,B1,A3\", \"B,C2,D3\", \"w,C1,B3\"]>>>"
