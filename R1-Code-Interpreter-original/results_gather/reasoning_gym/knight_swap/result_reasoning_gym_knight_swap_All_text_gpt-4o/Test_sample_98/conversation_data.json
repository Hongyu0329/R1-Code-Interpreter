    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | . | . | w | . |\n   ----------------\n2 | . |   | . |   |\n   ----------------\n1 | B | B | w |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at C3 and C1.\n- Black Knights (B) are at A1 and B1.\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White moves first, then alternate moves between white and black.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **White Knight at C3**:\n   - Possible moves: A4, B5, D5, E4, E2, D1, B1, A2.\n   - Only valid move on the board: A2 (since others are off the board or occupied).\n\n2. **White Knight at C1**:\n   - Possible moves: A2, B3, D3, E2, E0, D-1, B-1, A0.\n   - Only valid move on the board: B3 (since others are off the board or occupied).\n\n3. **Black Knight at A1**:\n   - Possible moves: B3, C2, C0, B-1, A-2, C-2, D0, D2.\n   - Only valid move on the board: C2 (since others are off the board or occupied).\n\n4. **Black Knight at B1**:\n   - Possible moves: A3, C3, D2, D0, C-1, A-1, C1, A0.\n   - Only valid move on the board: D2 (since others are off the board or occupied).\n\n### Attempting the Swap:\n- **Move 1 (White):** Move C3 to A2.\n- **Move 2 (Black):** Move A1 to C2.\n- **Move 3 (White):** Move C1 to B3.\n- **Move 4 (Black):** Move B1 to D2.\n\nAfter these moves, the board looks like this:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | . | w | . | . |\n   ----------------\n2 | w |   | B | B |\n   ----------------\n1 | . | . | . |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- **Move 5 (White):** Move A2 to C1.\n- **Move 6 (Black):** Move C2 to A1.\n- **Move 7 (White):** Move B3 to C3.\n- **Move 8 (Black):** Move D2 to B1.\n\nFinal board:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | . | . | B | . |\n   ----------------\n2 | . |   | . |   |\n   ----------------\n1 | w | w | B |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe swap is possible with the following sequence of moves:\n1. \"w,C3,A2\"\n2. \"B,A1,C2\"\n3. \"w,C1,B3\"\n4. \"B,B1,D2\"\n5. \"w,A2,C1\"\n6. \"B,C2,A1\"\n7. \"w,B3,C3\"\n8. \"B,D2,B1\"\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"w,C3,A2\", \"B,A1,C2\", \"w,C1,B3\", \"B,B1,D2\", \"w,A2,C1\", \"B,C2,A1\", \"w,B3,C3\", \"B,D2,B1\"]>>>"
