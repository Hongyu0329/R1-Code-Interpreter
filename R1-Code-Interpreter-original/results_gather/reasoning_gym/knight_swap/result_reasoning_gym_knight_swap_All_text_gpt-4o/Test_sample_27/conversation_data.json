    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 |   | B |   | . |\n   ----------------\n2 | . | . |   | B |\n   ----------------\n1 | w |   | w |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of all white knights ('w') with all black knights ('B').\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White knights move first, then alternate with black knights.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **White Knights Initial Positions:**\n   - w1 at A1\n   - w2 at C1\n\n2. **Black Knights Initial Positions:**\n   - B1 at B3\n   - B2 at D2\n\n3. **Target Positions:**\n   - White knights need to move to B3 and D2.\n   - Black knights need to move to A1 and C1.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **First Move (White):**\n   - w1 (A1) can move to B3 (L-shape: A1 to B3).\n   - w2 (C1) can move to D2 (L-shape: C1 to D2).\n\n2. **Second Move (Black):**\n   - B1 (B3) can move to A1 (L-shape: B3 to A1).\n   - B2 (D2) can move to C1 (L-shape: D2 to C1).\n\n3. **Result:**\n   - After these moves, the white knights are at B3 and D2, and the black knights are at A1 and C1, achieving the swap.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe swap is possible with the following moves:\n- White moves: w1 from A1 to B3, w2 from C1 to D2.\n- Black moves: B1 from B3 to A1, B2 from D2 to C1.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe sequence of moves to achieve the swap is:\n- [\"w,A1,B3\", \"w,C1,D2\", \"B,B3,A1\", \"B,D2,C1\"]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<<<[\"w,A1,B3\", \"w,C1,D2\", \"B,B3,A1\", \"B,D2,C1\"]>>>"
