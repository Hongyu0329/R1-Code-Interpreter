    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | B |   | . | B |\n   ----------------\n2 | . |   | w | w |\n   ----------------\n1 | . | . | . |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at C2 and D2.\n- Black Knights (B) are at A3 and D3.\n- Empty squares are at B3, A2, A1, B1, C1, and D1.\n\n### Objective:\nSwap the positions of all white knights with all black knights.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White moves first, then alternate with black.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Moves for White Knights:**\n   - C2 can move to B4, A3, or D1.\n   - D2 can move to B3, C4, or E1.\n\n2. **Initial Moves for Black Knights:**\n   - A3 can move to B1, C2, or C4.\n   - D3 can move to B4, C1, or E2.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to find a sequence of moves that allows each knight to reach its target position without blocking the other knights.\n   - The key is to use the empty squares effectively to allow knights to leapfrog over each other.\n\n4. **Possible Moves:**\n   - Start by moving a white knight to an empty square that allows a black knight to move closer to its target.\n   - Alternate moves between white and black knights, ensuring that each move opens up new possibilities for the other color.\n\n5. **Checking Feasibility:**\n   - Given the constraints and the limited number of empty squares, it is challenging to find a sequence that allows all knights to swap positions without getting stuck.\n   - The board is small, and the number of moves required to swap positions is significant, making it difficult to achieve the objective without violating the rules.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter analyzing the board and considering the possible moves, it becomes apparent that the configuration and the rules make it impossible to swap the positions of all knights without getting stuck. The limited number of empty squares and the alternating move requirement create a situation where knights cannot reach their target positions without blocking each other.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
