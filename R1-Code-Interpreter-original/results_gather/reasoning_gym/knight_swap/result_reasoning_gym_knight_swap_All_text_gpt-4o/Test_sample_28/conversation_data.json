    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | . | . | B |   |\n   ----------------\n2 | w |   |   | . |\n   ----------------\n1 | . | w |   | B |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at positions A2 and B1.\n- Black Knights (B) are at positions C3 and D1.\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights.\n\n### Knight Movement:\n- Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and two squares perpendicular.\n- Knights can only move to empty squares.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Identify Possible Moves for White Knights:**\n   - From A2, possible moves are:\n     - B4 (off the board, not possible)\n     - C3 (occupied by B)\n     - C1 (empty)\n     - B0 (off the board, not possible)\n   - From B1, possible moves are:\n     - A3 (empty)\n     - C2 (empty)\n     - D3 (off the board, not possible)\n     - D1 (occupied by B)\n\n2. **Identify Possible Moves for Black Knights:**\n   - From C3, possible moves are:\n     - B5 (off the board, not possible)\n     - D5 (off the board, not possible)\n     - E4 (off the board, not possible)\n     - E2 (off the board, not possible)\n     - D1 (occupied by B)\n     - B1 (occupied by w)\n     - A2 (occupied by w)\n     - C1 (empty)\n   - From D1, possible moves are:\n     - C3 (occupied by B)\n     - E3 (off the board, not possible)\n     - F2 (off the board, not possible)\n     - F0 (off the board, not possible)\n     - C2 (empty)\n     - B1 (occupied by w)\n     - A0 (off the board, not possible)\n     - E1 (off the board, not possible)\n\n3. **Plan Moves:**\n   - Start with white knight at B1 moving to C2 (empty).\n   - Black knight at D1 can move to C2 (now occupied by w), so instead move to C1 (empty).\n   - White knight at A2 can move to C3 (occupied by B), so instead move to C1 (now occupied by B), so move to C3.\n   - Black knight at C3 can move to A2 (now empty).\n   - White knight at C2 can move to D1 (now empty).\n   - Black knight at C1 can move to B1 (now empty).\n\n4. **Sequence of Moves:**\n   - w, B1, C2\n   - B, D1, C2\n   - w, A2, C3\n   - B, C3, A2\n   - w, C2, D1\n   - B, C1, B1\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe sequence of moves successfully swaps the positions of the white and black knights. Therefore, it is possible to achieve the objective.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<[\"w,B1,C2\", \"B,D1,C2\", \"w,A2,C3\", \"B,C3,A2\", \"w,C2,D1\", \"B,C1,B1\"]>>>"
