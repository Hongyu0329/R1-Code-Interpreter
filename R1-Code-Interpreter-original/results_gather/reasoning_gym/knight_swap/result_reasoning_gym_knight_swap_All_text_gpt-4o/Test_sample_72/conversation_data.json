    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 |   |   | . | w |\n   ----------------\n2 | w | B |   |   |\n   ----------------\n1 |   |   | . | B |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at positions D3 and A2.\n- Black Knights (B) are at positions B2 and D1.\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White moves first, then alternate with black.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **White Knight at D3**:\n   - Possible moves: B2, C1\n   - B2 is occupied by a black knight, so it can only move to C1.\n\n2. **White Knight at A2**:\n   - Possible moves: B4, C3, C1\n   - C1 is occupied by the other white knight, so it can only move to C3.\n\n3. **Black Knight at B2**:\n   - Possible moves: A4, C4, D3\n   - D3 is occupied by a white knight, so it can only move to C4.\n\n4. **Black Knight at D1**:\n   - Possible moves: B2, C3\n   - C3 is occupied by a white knight, so it can only move to B2.\n\n### Attempting the Swap:\n1. **Move 1 (White):** Move white knight from D3 to C1.\n2. **Move 2 (Black):** Move black knight from B2 to D3.\n3. **Move 3 (White):** Move white knight from A2 to C3.\n4. **Move 4 (Black):** Move black knight from D1 to B2.\n5. **Move 5 (White):** Move white knight from C1 to D1.\n6. **Move 6 (Black):** Move black knight from C4 to A2.\n\n### Final Board:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 |   |   | . | B |\n   ----------------\n2 | B |   |   |   |\n   ----------------\n1 |   |   | . | w |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights are now at D1 and C3.\n- Black Knights are now at B2 and D3.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe swap is possible with the following moves:\n1. \"w,D3,C1\"\n2. \"B,B2,D3\"\n3. \"w,A2,C3\"\n4. \"B,D1,B2\"\n5. \"w,C1,D1\"\n6. \"B,C4,A2\"\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[\"w,D3,C1\", \"B,B2,D3\", \"w,A2,C3\", \"B,D1,B2\", \"w,C1,D1\", \"B,C4,A2\"]>>>"
