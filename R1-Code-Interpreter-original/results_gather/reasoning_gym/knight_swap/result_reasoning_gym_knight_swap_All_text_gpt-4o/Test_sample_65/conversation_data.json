    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules step by step.\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | w |   | B |   |\n   ----------------\n2 | . |   |   | B |\n   ----------------\n1 |   | w | . | . |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights ('w') with the black knights ('B').\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. Black knights move first, then players alternate.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **White Knights' Initial Positions**: A3, B1\n- **Black Knights' Initial Positions**: C3, D2\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **Black's First Move**: \n   - C3 can move to A2 (L-shape: two squares left, one down).\n   - D2 can move to B3 (L-shape: two squares left, one up).\n\n2. **White's Response**:\n   - A3 can move to C2 (L-shape: two squares right, one down).\n   - B1 can move to D2 (L-shape: two squares right, one up).\n\n3. **Black's Next Move**:\n   - A2 can move to C1 (L-shape: two squares right, one down).\n   - B3 can move to D1 (L-shape: two squares right, one down).\n\n4. **White's Next Move**:\n   - C2 can move to A3 (L-shape: two squares left, one up).\n   - D2 can move to B1 (L-shape: two squares left, one down).\n\n### Final Positions:\n- **White Knights**: C3, D2\n- **Black Knights**: A3, B1\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe swap is possible with the following sequence of moves:\n\n1. \"B,C3,A2\"\n2. \"B,D2,B3\"\n3. \"w,A3,C2\"\n4. \"w,B1,D2\"\n5. \"B,A2,C1\"\n6. \"B,B3,D1\"\n7. \"w,C2,A3\"\n8. \"w,D2,B1\"\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"B,C3,A2\", \"B,D2,B3\", \"w,A3,C2\", \"w,B1,D2\", \"B,A2,C1\", \"B,B3,D1\", \"w,C2,A3\", \"w,D2,B1\"]>>>"
