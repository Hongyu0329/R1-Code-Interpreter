    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | B |   | . |   |\n   ----------------\n2 | . |   | w | . |\n   ----------------\n1 |   | B | w | . |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at C2 and C1.\n- Black Knights (B) are at A3 and B1.\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights.\n\n### Knight Movement:\n- Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and two squares perpendicular.\n- Knights can only move to empty squares.\n\n### Steps to Analyze:\n\n1. **Identify Possible Moves for White Knights:**\n   - From C2, a white knight can move to:\n     - A3 (occupied by B)\n     - B4 (out of bounds)\n     - D4 (out of bounds)\n     - E3 (out of bounds)\n     - E1 (out of bounds)\n     - D0 (out of bounds)\n     - B0 (out of bounds)\n     - A1 (empty)\n   - From C1, a white knight can move to:\n     - A2 (empty)\n     - B3 (empty)\n     - D3 (out of bounds)\n     - E2 (out of bounds)\n     - E0 (out of bounds)\n     - D-1 (out of bounds)\n     - B-1 (out of bounds)\n     - A0 (out of bounds)\n\n2. **Identify Possible Moves for Black Knights:**\n   - From A3, a black knight can move to:\n     - C4 (out of bounds)\n     - D2 (empty)\n     - C2 (occupied by w)\n     - B1 (occupied by B)\n     - C0 (out of bounds)\n     - D0 (out of bounds)\n     - B5 (out of bounds)\n     - C6 (out of bounds)\n   - From B1, a black knight can move to:\n     - D2 (empty)\n     - C3 (empty)\n     - A3 (occupied by B)\n     - A1 (empty)\n     - C-1 (out of bounds)\n     - D0 (out of bounds)\n     - A-1 (out of bounds)\n     - C0 (out of bounds)\n\n3. **Evaluate the Possibility of Swapping:**\n   - The white knight at C2 can move to A1.\n   - The white knight at C1 can move to A2 or B3.\n   - The black knight at A3 can move to D2.\n   - The black knight at B1 can move to D2 or C3.\n\n4. **Attempt to Swap:**\n   - The white knight at C2 moves to A1.\n   - The black knight at A3 moves to C2.\n   - The white knight at C1 moves to B3.\n   - The black knight at B1 moves to C1.\n\n5. **Check Final Positions:**\n   - After these moves, the white knights are at A3 and B1, and the black knights are at C2 and C1, which is the desired swap.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe swap is possible with the following moves:\n1. \"w,C2,A1\"\n2. \"B,A3,C2\"\n3. \"w,C1,B3\"\n4. \"B,B1,C1\"\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"w,C2,A1\", \"B,A3,C2\", \"w,C1,B3\", \"B,B1,C1\"]>>>"
