    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white and black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C\n   ------------\n3 |   | w | B |\n   ------------\n2 | B |   | . |\n   ------------\n1 | . |   | w |\n   ------------\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights ('w') with the black knights ('B').\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White knights move first, then alternate with black knights.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - White knights are at B3 and C1.\n   - Black knights are at A2 and C3.\n\n2. **Target Positions:**\n   - White knights need to move to A2 and C3.\n   - Black knights need to move to B3 and C1.\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From B3, a white knight can move to A1, C1, or D2 (if D2 were on the board).\n   - From C1, a white knight can move to A2, B3, or D2 (if D2 were on the board).\n   - From A2, a black knight can move to B4, C3, or C1.\n   - From C3, a black knight can move to A2, B1, or D2 (if D2 were on the board).\n\n4. **Move Sequence:**\n   - Start with white knight at B3:\n     - Move w from B3 to A2 (B3→A2).\n   - Black knight at A2 moves to B3 (A2→B3).\n   - White knight at C1 moves to C3 (C1→C3).\n   - Black knight at C3 moves to C1 (C3→C1).\n\n5. **Final Positions:**\n   - White knights are now at A2 and C3.\n   - Black knights are now at B3 and C1.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe swap is possible with the following sequence of moves:\n1. \"w,B3,A2\"\n2. \"B,A2,B3\"\n3. \"w,C1,C3\"\n4. \"B,C3,C1\"\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"w,B3,A2\", \"B,A2,B3\", \"w,C1,C3\", \"B,C3,C1\"]>>>"
