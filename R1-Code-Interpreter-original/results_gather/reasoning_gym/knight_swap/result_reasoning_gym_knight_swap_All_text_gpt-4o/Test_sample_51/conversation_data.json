    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | . | . |   | B |\n   ----------------\n2 | w | . | w | . |\n   ----------------\n1 | . |   | B |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights ('w') with the black knights ('B').\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White knights move first, then alternate with black knights.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **White Knights Initial Positions:** A2, C2\n- **Black Knights Initial Positions:** D3, C1\n- **Target Positions for White Knights:** D3, C1\n- **Target Positions for Black Knights:** A2, C2\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **White Knight Moves:**\n   - From A2, a white knight can move to B4, C3, or C1.\n   - From C2, a white knight can move to A3, B4, D1, or D3.\n\n2. **Black Knight Moves:**\n   - From D3, a black knight can move to B4, C1, or E2.\n   - From C1, a black knight can move to A2, B3, or D2.\n\n3. **Initial Moves:**\n   - White knight at A2 can move to C1 (a target position for white).\n   - Black knight at C1 can move to A2 (a target position for black).\n\n4. **Subsequent Moves:**\n   - White knight at C2 can move to D3 (a target position for white).\n   - Black knight at D3 can move to C2 (a target position for black).\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy following the above moves, we can successfully swap the positions of the white and black knights. The sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n1. \"w,A2,C1\"\n2. \"B,C1,A2\"\n3. \"w,C2,D3\"\n4. \"B,D3,C2\"\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe puzzle is possible, and the moves are:\n\n<<<[\"w,A2,C1\", \"B,C1,A2\", \"w,C2,D3\", \"B,D3,C2\"]>>>"
