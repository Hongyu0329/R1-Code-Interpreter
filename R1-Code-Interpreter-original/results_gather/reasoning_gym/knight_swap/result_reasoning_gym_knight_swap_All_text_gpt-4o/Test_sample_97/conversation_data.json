    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 |   | . | B | . |\n   ----------------\n2 |   | w |   |   |\n   ----------------\n1 | . | . | B | w |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at B2 and D1.\n- Black Knights (B) are at C3 and C1.\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White moves first, then alternate with black.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Possible Moves for White Knights:**\n   - White Knight at B2 can move to:\n     - A4 (out of bounds)\n     - C4 (out of bounds)\n     - D3 (empty)\n     - D1 (occupied by white)\n     - A1 (empty)\n     - C1 (occupied by black)\n   - White Knight at D1 can move to:\n     - C3 (occupied by black)\n     - B2 (occupied by white)\n     - B1 (empty)\n     - F2 (out of bounds)\n     - F0 (out of bounds)\n     - C0 (out of bounds)\n\n2. **Identify Possible Moves for Black Knights:**\n   - Black Knight at C3 can move to:\n     - A4 (out of bounds)\n     - E4 (out of bounds)\n     - D5 (out of bounds)\n     - D1 (occupied by white)\n     - B1 (empty)\n     - A2 (empty)\n   - Black Knight at C1 can move to:\n     - A2 (empty)\n     - E2 (out of bounds)\n     - D3 (empty)\n     - D1 (occupied by white)\n     - B3 (empty)\n     - A0 (out of bounds)\n\n3. **Attempt to Swap Positions:**\n   - Start with White Knight at B2:\n     - Move B2 to D3 (empty)\n   - Black Knight at C3:\n     - Move C3 to B1 (empty)\n   - White Knight at D1:\n     - Move D1 to C3 (now empty)\n   - Black Knight at C1:\n     - Move C1 to D1 (now empty)\n   - White Knight at D3:\n     - Move D3 to C1 (now empty)\n   - Black Knight at B1:\n     - Move B1 to B2 (now empty)\n\n### Final Board Configuration:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 |   | . | w | . |\n   ----------------\n2 |   | B |   |   |\n   ----------------\n1 | . | . |   | B |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights are now at C3 and C1.\n- Black Knights are now at B2 and D1.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe swap is possible with the following moves:\n1. \"w,B2,D3\"\n2. \"B,C3,B1\"\n3. \"w,D1,C3\"\n4. \"B,C1,D1\"\n5. \"w,D3,C1\"\n6. \"B,B1,B2\"\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"w,B2,D3\", \"B,C3,B1\", \"w,D1,C3\", \"B,C1,D1\", \"w,D3,C1\", \"B,B1,B2\"]>>>"
