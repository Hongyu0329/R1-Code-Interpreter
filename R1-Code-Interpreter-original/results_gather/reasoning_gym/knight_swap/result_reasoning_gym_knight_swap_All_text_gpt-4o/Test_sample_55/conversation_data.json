    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white and black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 |   |   | w | . |\n   ----------------\n2 | . | . |   | w |\n   ----------------\n1 |   | B | . | B |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at C3 and D2.\n- Black Knights (B) are at B1 and D1.\n- Empty squares are at A3, B3, A2, C2, and C1.\n\n### Objective:\nSwap the positions of all white knights with all black knights.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White moves first, then alternate with black.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **White Knight at C3**:\n   - Possible moves: A2, B1, D1\n   - A2 and B1 are empty, D1 is occupied by a black knight.\n\n2. **White Knight at D2**:\n   - Possible moves: B1, C1, B3\n   - B1 and C1 are empty, B3 is empty.\n\n3. **Black Knight at B1**:\n   - Possible moves: A3, C3, D2\n   - A3 is empty, C3 and D2 are occupied by white knights.\n\n4. **Black Knight at D1**:\n   - Possible moves: B2, C3\n   - B2 is empty, C3 is occupied by a white knight.\n\n### Strategy:\n- We need to find a sequence of moves that allows the knights to swap positions without blocking each other.\n- The key is to use the empty squares strategically to facilitate the swap.\n\n### Attempting Moves:\n1. **Move 1**: White knight from C3 to B1 (C3→B1)\n2. **Move 2**: Black knight from D1 to C3 (D1→C3)\n3. **Move 3**: White knight from D2 to D1 (D2→D1)\n4. **Move 4**: Black knight from B1 to D2 (B1→D2)\n\n### Final Board:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 |   |   | B | . |\n   ----------------\n2 | . | . |   | B |\n   ----------------\n1 |   | w | . | w |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe positions of the white and black knights have been successfully swapped. Therefore, it is possible to achieve the objective.\n\n### Answer:\nThe sequence of moves is:\n1. \"w,C3,B1\"\n2. \"B,D1,C3\"\n3. \"w,D2,D1\"\n4. \"B,B1,D2\"\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<[\"w,C3,B1\", \"B,D1,C3\", \"w,D2,D1\", \"B,B1,D2\"]>>>"
