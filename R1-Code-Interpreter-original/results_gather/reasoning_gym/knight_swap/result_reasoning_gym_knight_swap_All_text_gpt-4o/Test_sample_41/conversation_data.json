    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 |   | B | . |   |\n   ----------------\n2 | . |   |   | w |\n   ----------------\n1 | B | w | . | . |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights ('w') are at B1 and D2.\n- Black Knights ('B') are at A1 and B3.\n- The goal is to swap the positions of the white and black knights.\n\n### Knight Movement:\n- Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n- Knights can only move to empty squares.\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Initial Moves:**\n   - White knight at B1 can move to C3.\n   - White knight at D2 can move to B3.\n   - Black knight at A1 can move to C2.\n\n2. **Subsequent Moves:**\n   - After the initial moves, we need to continue moving the knights to achieve the swap.\n   - The white knight that moved to C3 can move to A1.\n   - The black knight that moved to C2 can move to D2.\n   - The white knight that moved to B3 can move to B1.\n   - The black knight that moved to D2 can move to D2.\n\n3. **Final Moves:**\n   - The white knight at A1 can move to B3.\n   - The black knight at D2 can move to C3.\n   - The white knight at B1 can move to A1.\n   - The black knight at C3 can move to B1.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter analyzing the possible moves, it becomes clear that the knights can be swapped by following a sequence of valid knight moves. The sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n1. \"w,B1,C3\"\n2. \"w,D2,B3\"\n3. \"B,A1,C2\"\n4. \"w,C3,A1\"\n5. \"B,C2,D2\"\n6. \"w,B3,B1\"\n7. \"B,D2,C3\"\n8. \"w,A1,B3\"\n9. \"B,C3,A1\"\n10. \"w,B1,C2\"\n11. \"B,A1,B1\"\n\nThis sequence successfully swaps the positions of the white and black knights.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<[\"w,B1,C3\", \"w,D2,B3\", \"B,A1,C2\", \"w,C3,A1\", \"B,C2,D2\", \"w,B3,B1\", \"B,D2,C3\", \"w,A1,B3\", \"B,C3,A1\", \"w,B1,C2\", \"B,A1,B1\"]>>>"
