    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | B | B | . | . |\n   ----------------\n2 | w |   | . | w |\n   ----------------\n1 |   | . | . |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at A2 and D2.\n- Black Knights (B) are at A3 and B3.\n- The goal is to swap the positions of the white and black knights.\n\n### Knight Movement:\n- Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n- Knights can only move to empty squares.\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Initial Moves for White Knights:**\n   - The white knight at A2 can move to B4, C3, or C1.\n   - The white knight at D2 can move to C4, B3, or B1.\n\n2. **Initial Moves for Black Knights:**\n   - The black knight at A3 can move to B1, C2, or C4.\n   - The black knight at B3 can move to A1, C1, or D2.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to find a sequence of moves that allows the knights to swap positions without blocking each other.\n   - The board is small, and the knights have limited movement options, making it challenging to find a sequence that allows for a complete swap.\n\n4. **Attempting a Solution:**\n   - Start by moving a white knight to an empty square, then alternate moves with black knights.\n   - Try to create a path that allows knights to move to their target positions.\n\n5. **Challenges:**\n   - The board's limited size and the specific starting positions make it difficult to find a sequence of moves that allows for a complete swap.\n   - The knights' movement restrictions and the need to alternate moves further complicate the process.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter analyzing the board and considering the movement possibilities, it becomes apparent that the constraints of the board and the rules make it impossible to swap the positions of the knights without violating the movement rules or blocking each other.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
