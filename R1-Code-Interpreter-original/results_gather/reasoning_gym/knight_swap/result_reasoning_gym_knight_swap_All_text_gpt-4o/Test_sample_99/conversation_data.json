    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C\n   ------------\n3 | w | . | . |\n   ------------\n2 | B |   | . |\n   ------------\n1 | w | B | . |\n   ------------\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights ('w') with the black knights ('B').\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White moves first, then alternate with black.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **White Knights Initial Positions:**\n   - w1 at A3\n   - w2 at A1\n\n2. **Black Knights Initial Positions:**\n   - B1 at A2\n   - B2 at B1\n\n3. **Target Positions:**\n   - White knights should end up at A2 and B1.\n   - Black knights should end up at A3 and A1.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Move 1 (White's Turn):**\n   - w1 at A3 can move to B1 (L-shape move).\n   - Board after move:\n     ```\n         A   B   C\n        ------------\n     3 | . | w | . |\n        ------------\n     2 | B |   | . |\n        ------------\n     1 | w | B | . |\n        ------------\n     ```\n\n2. **Move 2 (Black's Turn):**\n   - B1 at A2 can move to C3 (L-shape move).\n   - Board after move:\n     ```\n         A   B   C\n        ------------\n     3 | . | w | B |\n        ------------\n     2 | . |   | . |\n        ------------\n     1 | w | B | . |\n        ------------\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 3 (White's Turn):**\n   - w2 at A1 can move to C2 (L-shape move).\n   - Board after move:\n     ```\n         A   B   C\n        ------------\n     3 | . | w | B |\n        ------------\n     2 | . |   | w |\n        ------------\n     1 | . | B | . |\n        ------------\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 4 (Black's Turn):**\n   - B2 at B1 can move to A3 (L-shape move).\n   - Board after move:\n     ```\n         A   B   C\n        ------------\n     3 | B | w | B |\n        ------------\n     2 | . |   | w |\n        ------------\n     1 | . | . | . |\n        ------------\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 5 (White's Turn):**\n   - w1 at B3 can move to A2 (L-shape move).\n   - Board after move:\n     ```\n         A   B   C\n        ------------\n     3 | B | . | B |\n        ------------\n     2 | w |   | w |\n        ------------\n     1 | . | . | . |\n        ------------\n     ```\n\n6. **Move 6 (Black's Turn):**\n   - B1 at C3 can move to A1 (L-shape move).\n   - Board after move:\n     ```\n         A   B   C\n        ------------\n     3 | B | . | . |\n        ------------\n     2 | w |   | w |\n        ------------\n     1 | B | . | . |\n        ------------\n     ```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe positions of the white and black knights have been successfully swapped. Therefore, it is possible to achieve the objective.\n\n### Moves List:\n- [\"w,A3,B1\", \"B,A2,C3\", \"w,A1,C2\", \"B,B1,A3\", \"w,B3,A2\", \"B,C3,A1\"]\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<[\"w,A3,B1\", \"B,A2,C3\", \"w,A1,C2\", \"B,B1,A3\", \"w,B3,A2\", \"B,C3,A1\"]>>>"
