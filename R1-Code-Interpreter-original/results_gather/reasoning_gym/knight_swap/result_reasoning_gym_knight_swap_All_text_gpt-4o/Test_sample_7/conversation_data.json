    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | . | B |   |   |\n   ----------------\n2 | . |   | w | w |\n   ----------------\n1 |   | . | B |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at C2 and D2.\n- Black Knights (B) are at B3 and C1.\n- Empty squares are at A3, A2, and B1.\n\n### Objective:\nSwap the positions of all white knights with all black knights.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White moves first, then alternate with black.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **White Knight Moves:**\n   - C2 can move to A3, B4, D4, E3, E1, D1, B1, A1.\n   - D2 can move to B3, C4, E4, F3, F1, E1, C1, B1.\n\n2. **Black Knight Moves:**\n   - B3 can move to A5, C5, D4, D2, C1, A1.\n   - C1 can move to A2, B3, D3, E2, E0, D0, B0, A0.\n\n### Strategy:\n- We need to find a sequence of moves that allows the knights to swap positions without violating the rules.\n- The challenge is to ensure that each move is valid and that the knights do not block each other.\n\n### Attempting Moves:\n1. **Move 1 (White):** Move w from C2 to B3.\n   - New Board:\n     ```\n         A   B   C   D\n        ----------------\n     3 | . | w |   |   |\n        ----------------\n     2 | . |   |   | w |\n        ----------------\n     1 |   | . | B |   |\n     ```\n\n2. **Move 2 (Black):** Move B from B3 to C2.\n   - New Board:\n     ```\n         A   B   C   D\n        ----------------\n     3 | . |   |   |   |\n        ----------------\n     2 | . |   | B | w |\n        ----------------\n     1 |   | . | B |   |\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 3 (White):** Move w from D2 to C1.\n   - New Board:\n     ```\n         A   B   C   D\n        ----------------\n     3 | . |   |   |   |\n        ----------------\n     2 | . |   | B |   |\n        ----------------\n     1 |   | . | w |   |\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 4 (Black):** Move B from C1 to D2.\n   - New Board:\n     ```\n         A   B   C   D\n        ----------------\n     3 | . |   |   |   |\n        ----------------\n     2 | . |   | B | B |\n        ----------------\n     1 |   | . | w |   |\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 5 (White):** Move w from C1 to C2.\n   - New Board:\n     ```\n         A   B   C   D\n        ----------------\n     3 | . |   |   |   |\n        ----------------\n     2 | . |   | w | B |\n        ----------------\n     1 |   | . |   |   |\n     ```\n\n6. **Move 6 (Black):** Move B from D2 to C1.\n   - New Board:\n     ```\n         A   B   C   D\n        ----------------\n     3 | . |   |   |   |\n        ----------------\n     2 | . |   | w |   |\n        ----------------\n     1 |   | . | B |   |\n     ```\n\n7. **Move 7 (White):** Move w from C2 to D2.\n   - New Board:\n     ```\n         A   B   C   D\n        ----------------\n     3 | . |   |   |   |\n        ----------------\n     2 | . |   |   | w |\n        ----------------\n     1 |   | . | B |   |\n     ```\n\n8. **Move 8 (Black):** Move B from C1 to C2.\n   - New Board:\n     ```\n         A   B   C   D\n        ----------------\n     3 | . |   |   |   |\n        ----------------\n     2 | . |   | B | w |\n        ----------------\n     1 |   | . |   |   |\n     ```\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter analyzing the moves, it becomes clear that the knights cannot swap positions without violating the rules or getting stuck. The board configuration and the rules of movement make it impossible to achieve the objective.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
