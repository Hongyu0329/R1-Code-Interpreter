    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | . | w | w |   |\n   ----------------\n2 |   |   |   | B |\n   ----------------\n1 | . | . | B | . |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at B3 and C3.\n- Black Knights (B) are at C2 and C1.\n- The goal is to swap the positions of the white and black knights.\n\n### Knight Movement:\n- Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n- Knights can only move to empty squares.\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Initial Moves for White Knights:**\n   - B3 (w) can move to A1 or D2.\n   - C3 (w) can move to A2 or D1.\n\n2. **Initial Moves for Black Knights:**\n   - C2 (B) can move to A1 or D3.\n   - C1 (B) can move to A2 or D3.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to find a sequence of moves that allows the knights to swap positions without blocking each other.\n   - Since knights can only move to empty squares, we must carefully plan each move to ensure that the destination square is empty.\n\n### Attempting the Swap:\n1. **Move 1 (w):** Move B3 (w) to D2.\n2. **Move 2 (B):** Move C2 (B) to A1.\n3. **Move 3 (w):** Move C3 (w) to A2.\n4. **Move 4 (B):** Move C1 (B) to D3.\n5. **Move 5 (w):** Move D2 (w) to C1.\n6. **Move 6 (B):** Move A1 (B) to B3.\n7. **Move 7 (w):** Move A2 (w) to C2.\n8. **Move 8 (B):** Move D3 (B) to C3.\n\n### Final Board Configuration:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | . | B | B |   |\n   ----------------\n2 |   |   | w |   |\n   ----------------\n1 | . | . | w | . |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- The white knights have moved to the original positions of the black knights, and vice versa.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe swap is possible with the following sequence of moves:\n\n- [\"w,B3,D2\", \"B,C2,A1\", \"w,C3,A2\", \"B,C1,D3\", \"w,D2,C1\", \"B,A1,B3\", \"w,A2,C2\", \"B,D3,C3\"]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[\"w,B3,D2\", \"B,C2,A1\", \"w,C3,A2\", \"B,C1,D3\", \"w,D2,C1\", \"B,A1,B3\", \"w,A2,C2\", \"B,D3,C3\"]>>>"
