    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - White Knights (w) are at positions A3 and C3.\n   - Black Knights (B) are at positions B1 and C1.\n   - The board has empty squares at D3, A2, B2, C2, and D1.\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights.\n   - White knights should end up at B1 and C1.\n   - Black knights should end up at A3 and C3.\n\n3. **Knight Movement:**\n   - Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n   - Knights can only move to empty squares.\n\n4. **Move Analysis:**\n   - White moves first, then players alternate.\n   - We need to find a sequence of moves that allows the knights to swap positions.\n\n5. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From A3, a white knight can move to B1 or C2.\n   - From C3, a white knight can move to A2, B1, or D1.\n   - From B1, a black knight can move to A3 or C2.\n   - From C1, a black knight can move to A2, B2, or D3.\n\n6. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving a white knight to an empty square that allows further movement.\n   - Alternate moves between white and black knights, ensuring each move opens up new possibilities.\n   - Aim to gradually move each knight closer to its target position.\n\n7. **Solution:**\n   - After analyzing possible moves and sequences, it becomes apparent that the board is too constrained to allow a complete swap of positions without violating the rules of knight movement.\n   - The limited number of empty squares and the specific starting positions make it impossible to achieve the objective.\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
