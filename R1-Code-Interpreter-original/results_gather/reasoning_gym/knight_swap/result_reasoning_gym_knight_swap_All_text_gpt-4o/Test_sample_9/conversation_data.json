    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | . | B | . |   |\n   ----------------\n2 | . |   | . | w |\n   ----------------\n1 | . | w | B |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at positions D2 and B1.\n- Black Knights (B) are at positions B3 and C1.\n\n### Objective:\nSwap the positions of all white knights with all black knights.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White moves first, then alternate with black.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Possible Moves for White Knights:**\n   - **D2 (w):** Can move to B3 (currently occupied by B) or C4 (out of bounds).\n   - **B1 (w):** Can move to A3 (empty) or C3 (empty).\n\n2. **Identify Possible Moves for Black Knights:**\n   - **B3 (B):** Can move to A1 (empty) or C1 (occupied by B).\n   - **C1 (B):** Can move to A2 (empty) or B3 (occupied by B).\n\n3. **Initial Moves:**\n   - White moves B1 to A3: [\"w,B1,A3\"]\n   - Black moves B3 to A1: [\"B,B3,A1\"]\n\n4. **Subsequent Moves:**\n   - White moves D2 to B3: [\"w,D2,B3\"]\n   - Black moves C1 to A2: [\"B,C1,A2\"]\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - White moves A3 to C1: [\"w,A3,C1\"]\n   - Black moves A1 to B1: [\"B,A1,B1\"]\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy following the above sequence of moves, all white knights and black knights can successfully swap their positions. Therefore, it is possible to achieve the objective.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe sequence of moves to swap the knights is as follows:\n```\n[\"w,B1,A3\", \"B,B3,A1\", \"w,D2,B3\", \"B,C1,A2\", \"w,A3,C1\", \"B,A1,B1\"]\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<[\"w,B1,A3\", \"B,B3,A1\", \"w,D2,B3\", \"B,C1,A2\", \"w,A3,C1\", \"B,A1,B1\"]>>>"
