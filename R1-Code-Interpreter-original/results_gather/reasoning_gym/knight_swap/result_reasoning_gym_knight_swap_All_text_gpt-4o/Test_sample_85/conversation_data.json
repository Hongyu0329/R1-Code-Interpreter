    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | w |   | w | . |\n   ----------------\n2 | . |   |   | B |\n   ----------------\n1 |   | B | . | . |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at positions A3 and C3.\n- Black Knights (B) are at positions B1 and D2.\n- The goal is to swap the positions of the white and black knights.\n\n### Knight Movement:\n- Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n- Knights can only move to empty squares.\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Initial Moves for White Knights:**\n   - White knight at A3 can move to B1 (since B1 is empty after the black knight moves).\n   - White knight at C3 can move to D2 (since D2 is empty after the black knight moves).\n\n2. **Initial Moves for Black Knights:**\n   - Black knight at B1 can move to A3 (since A3 is empty after the white knight moves).\n   - Black knight at D2 can move to C3 (since C3 is empty after the white knight moves).\n\n3. **Sequence of Moves:**\n   - Move 1: White knight from A3 to B1.\n   - Move 2: Black knight from B1 to A3.\n   - Move 3: White knight from C3 to D2.\n   - Move 4: Black knight from D2 to C3.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe sequence of moves allows the knights to swap positions successfully. Therefore, it is possible to swap all knights' positions.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe moves required to achieve the swap are as follows:\n- \"w,A3,B1\"\n- \"B,B1,A3\"\n- \"w,C3,D2\"\n- \"B,D2,C3\"\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[\"w,A3,B1\", \"B,B1,A3\", \"w,C3,D2\", \"B,D2,C3\"]>>>"
