    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | . |   | . |   |\n   ----------------\n2 | . |   | w | B |\n   ----------------\n1 | B | . |   | w |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at positions C2 and D1.\n- Black Knights (B) are at positions A1 and D2.\n\n### Objective:\nSwap the positions of the white knights with the black knights.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White moves first, then alternate with black.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Moves for White Knights:**\n   - White knight at C2 can move to A1 or B3.\n   - White knight at D1 can move to B2 or C3.\n\n2. **Initial Moves for Black Knights:**\n   - Black knight at A1 can move to B3 or C2.\n   - Black knight at D2 can move to B1 or C3.\n\n3. **Possible Strategy:**\n   - Move white knight from C2 to A1.\n   - Move black knight from A1 to C2.\n   - Move white knight from D1 to B3.\n   - Move black knight from D2 to D1.\n   - Move white knight from B3 to D2.\n   - Move black knight from C2 to B3.\n\n4. **Checking Feasibility:**\n   - Each move is valid according to knight movement rules.\n   - Each move alternates between white and black.\n   - All knights end up in the opposite starting positions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe swap is possible with the following sequence of moves:\n\n1. \"w,C2,A1\"\n2. \"B,A1,C2\"\n3. \"w,D1,B3\"\n4. \"B,D2,D1\"\n5. \"w,B3,D2\"\n6. \"B,C2,B3\"\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[\"w,C2,A1\", \"B,A1,C2\", \"w,D1,B3\", \"B,D2,D1\", \"w,B3,D2\", \"B,C2,B3\"]>>>"
