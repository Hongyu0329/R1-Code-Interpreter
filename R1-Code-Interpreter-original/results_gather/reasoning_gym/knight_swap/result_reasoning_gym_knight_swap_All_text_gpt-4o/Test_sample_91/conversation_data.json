    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | . | B | . | B |\n   ----------------\n2 | . |   | . | . |\n   ----------------\n1 | w |   | w |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights ('w') with the black knights ('B').\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White knights move first, then alternate with black knights.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **White Knights' Initial Positions:**\n   - w1 at A1\n   - w2 at C1\n\n2. **Black Knights' Initial Positions:**\n   - B1 at B3\n   - B2 at D3\n\n3. **Target Positions:**\n   - White knights need to move to B3 and D3.\n   - Black knights need to move to A1 and C1.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **First Move (White):**\n   - w1 at A1 can move to B3 (L-shape move: 2 up, 1 right).\n\n2. **Second Move (Black):**\n   - B1 at B3 can move to A1 (L-shape move: 2 down, 1 left).\n\n3. **Third Move (White):**\n   - w2 at C1 can move to D3 (L-shape move: 2 up, 1 right).\n\n4. **Fourth Move (Black):**\n   - B2 at D3 can move to C1 (L-shape move: 2 down, 1 left).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The moves are possible and follow the rules of knight movement.\n- The sequence of moves successfully swaps the positions of the white and black knights.\n\n### List of Moves:\n1. \"w,A1,B3\"\n2. \"B,B3,A1\"\n3. \"w,C1,D3\"\n4. \"B,D3,C1\"\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe puzzle is possible, and the moves are as follows:\n\n<<<[\"w,A1,B3\", \"B,B3,A1\", \"w,C1,D3\", \"B,D3,C1\"]>>>"
