    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white and black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 |   | . | B | . |\n   ----------------\n2 |   | . |   | . |\n   ----------------\n1 | . | B | w | w |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights (w) are at C1 and D1.\n- Black Knights (B) are at B1 and C3.\n\n### Objective:\nSwap the positions of all white knights with all black knights.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White moves first, then alternate with black.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Moves for White Knights:**\n   - White knight at C1 can move to B3 (L-shape: 2 squares up, 1 square left).\n   - White knight at D1 can move to B2 (L-shape: 2 squares up, 1 square left).\n\n2. **Initial Moves for Black Knights:**\n   - Black knight at B1 can move to C3 (L-shape: 2 squares up, 1 square right).\n   - Black knight at C3 can move to D1 (L-shape: 2 squares down, 1 square right).\n\n3. **Subsequent Moves:**\n   - After the initial moves, the board looks like this:\n     ```\n         A   B   C   D\n        ----------------\n     3 |   | w | B | . |\n        ----------------\n     2 |   | w |   | . |\n        ----------------\n     1 | . | B |   | B |\n        ----------------\n     ```\n   - White knight at B3 can move to C1.\n   - White knight at B2 can move to B1.\n   - Black knight at C3 can move to D2.\n   - Black knight at D1 can move to C3.\n\n4. **Final Moves:**\n   - After these moves, the board will be:\n     ```\n         A   B   C   D\n        ----------------\n     3 |   | B |   | B |\n        ----------------\n     2 |   |   |   | w |\n        ----------------\n     1 | . | w | w |   |\n        ----------------\n     ```\n   - White knight at C1 can move to D3.\n   - White knight at B1 can move to C3.\n   - Black knight at D2 can move to C1.\n   - Black knight at C3 can move to B1.\n\n5. **Final Board Configuration:**\n   - The final configuration will be:\n     ```\n         A   B   C   D\n        ----------------\n     3 |   | B | w |   |\n        ----------------\n     2 |   |   |   | B |\n        ----------------\n     1 | . | w |   | w |\n        ----------------\n     ```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe sequence of moves allows the knights to swap positions. Therefore, it is possible to swap all knights' positions.\n\n### Answer:\n<<<[\"w,C1,B3\", \"w,D1,B2\", \"B,B1,C3\", \"B,C3,D1\", \"w,B3,C1\", \"w,B2,B1\", \"B,C3,D2\", \"B,D1,C3\", \"w,C1,D3\", \"w,B1,C3\", \"B,D2,C1\", \"B,C3,B1\"]>>>"
