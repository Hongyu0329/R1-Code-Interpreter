    "To determine if it's possible to swap the positions of all white knights with all black knights, we need to analyze the board and the rules of knight movement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Board Setup:\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | . | . | w | . |\n   ----------------\n2 |   | B |   | . |\n   ----------------\n1 |   | w | B |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights: C3, B1\n- Black Knights: B2, C1\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap positions of white knights with black knights.\n\n### Knight Movement:\n- Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and two squares perpendicular.\n- Knights can only move to empty squares.\n\n### Steps to Analyze:\n\n1. **Identify Possible Moves:**\n   - From C3 (w): Possible moves are A2, B1, D1, D2.\n   - From B1 (w): Possible moves are A3, C3, D2.\n   - From B2 (B): Possible moves are A4, C4, D3, D1.\n   - From C1 (B): Possible moves are A2, B3, D2.\n\n2. **Initial Moves:**\n   - White moves first. Let's consider moving the white knight from C3 to D1 (C3 → D1).\n\n3. **Subsequent Moves:**\n   - Black moves next. Move the black knight from B2 to C3 (B2 → C3).\n   - White moves next. Move the white knight from B1 to B2 (B1 → B2).\n   - Black moves next. Move the black knight from C1 to B1 (C1 → B1).\n   - White moves next. Move the white knight from D1 to C1 (D1 → C1).\n\n4. **Final Board Configuration:**\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | . | . | B | . |\n   ----------------\n2 |   | w |   | . |\n   ----------------\n1 |   | B | w |   |\n   ----------------\n```\n\n- White Knights: B2, C1\n- Black Knights: C3, B1\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe positions of the white and black knights have been successfully swapped through valid knight moves. Therefore, it is possible to achieve the objective.\n\n### List of Moves:\n1. \"w,C3,D1\"\n2. \"B,B2,C3\"\n3. \"w,B1,B2\"\n4. \"B,C1,B1\"\n5. \"w,D1,C1\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<[\"w,C3,D1\", \"B,B2,C3\", \"w,B1,B2\", \"B,C1,B1\", \"w,D1,C1\"]>>>"
