    "To solve the Knight Swap Challenge, we need to determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights ('w') with the black knights ('B') using valid knight moves. The board is a 4x3 grid, and the knights move in an L-shape, which means they can move two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that direction.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - White Knights ('w'): C3, A2\n   - Black Knights ('B'): A1, C1\n\n2. **Target Positions:**\n   - White Knights should move to A1, C1\n   - Black Knights should move to C3, A2\n\n3. **Valid Moves:**\n   - Knights can only move to empty squares.\n   - The move sequence must alternate between white and black knights.\n\n4. **Objective:**\n   - Determine if a sequence of valid moves exists to swap the positions of the knights.\n\nTo solve this, we can simulate the moves and check if a sequence exists that satisfies the conditions. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible moves and check if we can reach the target configuration.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the board and initial positions\ninitial_positions = {\n    'w': [(2, 0), (0, 2)],  # C3, A2\n    'B': [(0, 0), (2, 2)]   # A1, C1\n}\n\n# Target positions\ntarget_positions = {\n    'w': [(0, 0), (2, 2)],  # A1, C1\n    'B': [(2, 0), (0, 2)]   # C3, A2\n}\n\n# Possible knight moves (L-shape)\nknight_moves = [\n    (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),\n    (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)\n]\n\n# Convert position to board notation\ndef pos_to_notation(pos):\n    col = chr(ord('A') + pos[1])\n    row = str(pos[0] + 1)\n    return col + row\n\n# Check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(pos):\n    return 0 <= pos[0] < 3 and 0 <= pos[1] < 4\n\n# BFS to find the sequence of moves\ndef find_moves():\n    queue = deque()\n    visited = set()\n    \n    # Initial state\n    initial_state = (tuple(initial_positions['w']), tuple(initial_positions['B']), 'w')\n    queue.append((initial_state, []))\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (w_pos, b_pos, turn), moves = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the target\n        if (w_pos == tuple(target_positions['w']) and\n            b_pos == tuple(target_positions['B'])):\n            return moves\n        \n        # Determine current positions and next turn\n        current_positions = w_pos if turn == 'w' else b_pos\n        next_turn = 'B' if turn == 'w' else 'w'\n        \n        # Try all possible moves for the current knight\n        for i, knight_pos in enumerate(current_positions):\n            for move in knight_moves:\n                new_pos = (knight_pos[0] + move[0], knight_pos[1] + move[1])\n                \n                if is_within_board(new_pos) and new_pos not in w_pos and new_pos not in b_pos:\n                    # Create new positions\n                    new_positions = list(current_positions)\n                    new_positions[i] = new_pos\n                    new_positions = tuple(new_positions)\n                    \n                    # Create new state\n                    if turn == 'w':\n                        new_state = (new_positions, b_pos, next_turn)\n                    else:\n                        new_state = (w_pos, new_positions, next_turn)\n                    \n                    if new_state not in visited:\n                        visited.add(new_state)\n                        new_move = f\"{turn},{pos_to_notation(knight_pos)},{pos_to_notation(new_pos)}\"\n                        queue.append((new_state, moves + [new_move]))\n    \n    return \"No\"\n\n# Find the sequence of moves\nresult = find_moves()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a sequence of moves that swaps the positions of the knights. If it's possible, it will return the list of moves; otherwise, it will return \"No\". Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code successfully found a sequence of moves to swap the positions of the white and black knights. The sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n1. White knight moves from A3 to B1\n2.
