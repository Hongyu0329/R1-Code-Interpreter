    "To solve the Knight Swap Challenge, we need to determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white and black knights by following the rules of knight movement in chess. The board is a 4x3 grid, and the knights can only move in an L-shape to empty squares.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - White Knights: A3, B1\n   - Black Knights: C3, D2\n\n2. **Target Positions:**\n   - White Knights: C3, D2\n   - Black Knights: A3, B1\n\n3. **Movement Rules:**\n   - Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n   - Knights can only move to empty squares.\n   - Black moves first, then alternate with white.\n\n4. **Objective:**\n   - Swap the positions of the white and black knights.\n\nTo determine if the swap is possible, we need to simulate the moves. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible moves and check if we can reach the target configuration.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the sequence of moves:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the board and initial positions\ninitial_positions = {\n    'w': [(0, 2), (1, 0)],  # A3, B1\n    'B': [(2, 2), (3, 1)]   # C3, D2\n}\n\n# Target positions\ntarget_positions = {\n    'w': [(2, 2), (3, 1)],  # C3, D2\n    'B': [(0, 2), (1, 0)]   # A3, B1\n}\n\n# Possible knight moves (L-shape)\nknight_moves = [\n    (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),\n    (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)\n]\n\n# Convert board coordinates to chess notation\ndef to_chess_notation(x, y):\n    return chr(ord('A') + x) + str(y + 1)\n\n# Check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(x, y):\n    return 0 <= x < 4 and 0 <= y < 3\n\n# BFS to find the sequence of moves\ndef bfs_knight_swap():\n    queue = deque([(initial_positions, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((tuple(initial_positions['w']), tuple(initial_positions['B'])))\n    \n    while queue:\n        positions, moves = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the target positions\n        if positions == target_positions:\n            return moves\n        \n        # Determine whose turn it is\n        current_color = 'B' if len(moves) % 2 == 0 else 'w'\n        \n        # Try all possible moves for the current color\n        for i, (x, y) in enumerate(positions[current_color]):\n            for dx, dy in knight_moves:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if is_within_board(nx, ny) and (nx, ny) not in positions['w'] and (nx, ny) not in positions['B']:\n                    # Make the move\n                    new_positions = {color: list(pos) for color, pos in positions.items()}\n                    new_positions[current_color][i] = (nx, ny)\n                    new_positions_tuple = (tuple(new_positions['w']), tuple(new_positions['B']))\n                    \n                    if new_positions_tuple not in visited:\n                        visited.add(new_positions_tuple)\n                        move_notation = f\"{current_color},{to_chess_notation(x, y)},{to_chess_notation(nx, ny)}\"\n                        queue.append((new_positions, moves + [move_notation]))\n    \n    return \"No\"\n\n# Execute the BFS to find the solution\nresult = bfs_knight_swap()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a sequence of moves that swaps the positions of the white and black knights. If it's possible, it will return the list of moves; otherwise, it will return \"No\". Let's execute the code to see the result.",
