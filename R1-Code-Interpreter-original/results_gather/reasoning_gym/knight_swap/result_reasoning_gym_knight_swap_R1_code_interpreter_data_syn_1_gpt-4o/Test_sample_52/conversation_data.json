    "To solve the Knight Swap Challenge, we need to determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights using valid knight moves. The board is a 4x3 grid, and the knights move in an L-shape, which means they can move two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that direction.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - White Knights: C3, B1\n   - Black Knights: A3, D1\n\n2. **Target Positions:**\n   - White Knights: A3, D1\n   - Black Knights: C3, B1\n\n3. **Rules:**\n   - Knights can only move to empty squares.\n   - White moves first, then alternate with black.\n   - We need to find a sequence of moves that results in the swap of positions.\n\n4. **Constraints:**\n   - The board is small, so the number of possible moves is limited.\n   - We need to ensure that each move is valid and leads towards the goal.\n\nTo determine if the swap is possible, we can simulate the moves. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible sequences of moves. This will help us find the shortest path to the solution if it exists.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to explore the possible moves and check if the swap is possible.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the board and initial positions\ninitial_positions = {\n    'w1': (2, 2),  # C3\n    'w2': (1, 1),  # B1\n    'b1': (0, 2),  # A3\n    'b2': (3, 0)   # D1\n}\n\n# Target positions\ntarget_positions = {\n    'w1': (0, 2),  # A3\n    'w2': (3, 0),  # D1\n    'b1': (2, 2),  # C3\n    'b2': (1, 1)   # B1\n}\n\n# Possible knight moves\nknight_moves = [\n    (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),\n    (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)\n]\n\n# Check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(x, y):\n    return 0 <= x < 4 and 0 <= y < 3\n\n# BFS to find the sequence of moves\ndef bfs_knight_swap():\n    queue = deque([(initial_positions, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(tuple(initial_positions.values()))\n\n    while queue:\n        current_positions, moves = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if current positions match target positions\n        if current_positions == target_positions:\n            return moves\n\n        # Determine whose turn it is\n        turn = 'w' if len(moves) % 2 == 0 else 'b'\n\n        # Try all possible moves for the current player's knights\n        for knight, pos in current_positions.items():\n            if knight.startswith(turn):\n                x, y = pos\n                for dx, dy in knight_moves:\n                    new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy\n                    if is_within_board(new_x, new_y) and (new_x, new_y) not in current_positions.values():\n                        new_positions = current_positions.copy()\n                        new_positions[knight] = (new_x, new_y)\n                        new_positions_tuple = tuple(new_positions.values())\n                        if new_positions_tuple not in visited:\n                            visited.add(new_positions_tuple)\n                            move_str = f\"{turn},{chr(65 + x)}{3 - y},{chr(65 + new_x)}{3 - new_y}\"\n                            queue.append((new_positions, moves + [move_str]))\n\n    return \"No\"\n\n# Execute the BFS to find the solution\nresult = bfs_knight_swap()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and determine if the swap is possible, and if so, it will list the sequence of moves. Let's see the result.",
