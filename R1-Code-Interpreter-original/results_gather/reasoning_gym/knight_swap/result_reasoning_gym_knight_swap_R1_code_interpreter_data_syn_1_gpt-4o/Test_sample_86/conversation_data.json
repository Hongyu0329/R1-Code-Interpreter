    "To solve the Knight Swap Challenge, we need to determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights using valid knight moves. The board is a 4x3 grid, and the knights move in an L-shape, which means they can move two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that direction.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - White Knights (w) are at B3 and C3.\n   - Black Knights (B) are at A3 and B1.\n\n2. **Target Positions:**\n   - White Knights need to move to A3 and B1.\n   - Black Knights need to move to B3 and C3.\n\n3. **Rules:**\n   - Knights can only move to empty squares.\n   - Moves alternate between white and black knights.\n   - We need to find a sequence of moves that achieves the swap.\n\n4. **Approach:**\n   - We will simulate the moves of the knights, ensuring that each move is valid and alternates between white and black knights.\n   - We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore possible sequences of moves.\n   - We will track the positions of the knights and the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's implement a Python script to simulate the moves and determine if a solution exists.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the board and initial positions\ninitial_positions = {\n    'w': [(1, 2), (2, 2)],  # B3, C3\n    'B': [(0, 2), (1, 0)]   # A3, B1\n}\n\n# Target positions for the swap\ntarget_positions = {\n    'w': [(0, 2), (1, 0)],  # A3, B1\n    'B': [(1, 2), (2, 2)]   # B3, C3\n}\n\n# Possible knight moves (L-shape)\nknight_moves = [\n    (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),\n    (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)\n]\n\n# Check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(x, y):\n    return 0 <= x < 4 and 0 <= y < 3\n\n# BFS to find the sequence of moves\ndef find_moves():\n    queue = deque([(initial_positions, [])])  # (positions, moves)\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        positions, moves = queue.popleft()\n        current_positions = (tuple(positions['w']), tuple(positions['B']))\n\n        if current_positions in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add(current_positions)\n\n        # Check if the current positions match the target positions\n        if positions['w'] == target_positions['w'] and positions['B'] == target_positions['B']:\n            return moves\n\n        # Alternate moves between white and black knights\n        for color in ['w', 'B']:\n            for i, (x, y) in enumerate(positions[color]):\n                for dx, dy in knight_moves:\n                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                    if is_within_board(nx, ny) and (nx, ny) not in positions['w'] and (nx, ny) not in positions['B']:\n                        new_positions = {k: v[:] for k, v in positions.items()}\n                        new_positions[color][i] = (nx, ny)\n                        new_moves = moves + [f\"{color},{chr(65+x)}{3-y},{chr(65+nx)}{3-ny}\"]\n                        queue.append((new_positions, new_moves))\n\n    return \"No\"\n\n# Find and print the sequence of moves\nresult = find_moves()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a sequence of moves that swaps the positions of the white and black knights. If a solution is found, it will print the sequence of moves; otherwise, it will print \"No\". Let's execute the code to see the result.",
