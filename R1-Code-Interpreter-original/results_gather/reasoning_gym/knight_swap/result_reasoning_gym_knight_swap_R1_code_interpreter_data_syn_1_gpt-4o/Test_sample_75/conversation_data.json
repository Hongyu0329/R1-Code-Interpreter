    "To solve the Knight Swap Challenge, we need to determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights using valid knight moves. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - White Knights: A1, B1\n   - Black Knights: C3, D2\n\n2. **Target Positions:**\n   - White Knights should move to C3, D2\n   - Black Knights should move to A1, B1\n\n3. **Knight Moves:**\n   - Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and two squares perpendicular.\n\n4. **Constraints:**\n   - Knights can only move to empty squares.\n   - Moves alternate between white and black knights.\n\n5. **Objective:**\n   - Determine if a sequence of valid moves exists to swap the positions of the knights.\n\nTo solve this, we can simulate the moves using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, where each state represents a configuration of the board. We will explore all possible moves for each knight and check if we can reach the target configuration.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to check if the swap is possible and, if so, find the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the board and initial positions\ninitial_positions = {\n    'w': [(0, 0), (1, 0)],  # A1, B1\n    'B': [(2, 2), (3, 1)]   # C3, D2\n}\n\n# Target positions\ntarget_positions = {\n    'w': [(2, 2), (3, 1)],  # C3, D2\n    'B': [(0, 0), (1, 0)]   # A1, B1\n}\n\n# Possible knight moves\nknight_moves = [\n    (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),\n    (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)\n]\n\n# Convert board positions to a tuple for easy comparison\ndef board_to_tuple(positions):\n    return tuple(sorted(positions['w'] + positions['B']))\n\n# Check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(x, y):\n    return 0 <= x < 4 and 0 <= y < 3\n\n# BFS to find the sequence of moves\ndef find_moves():\n    initial_state = board_to_tuple(initial_positions)\n    target_state = board_to_tuple(target_positions)\n    \n    queue = deque([(initial_positions, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_positions, moves = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the target state\n        if board_to_tuple(current_positions) == target_state:\n            return moves\n        \n        # Determine whose turn it is\n        turn = 'w' if len(moves) % 2 == 0 else 'B'\n        \n        # Try all possible moves for the current player's knights\n        for i, (x, y) in enumerate(current_positions[turn]):\n            for dx, dy in knight_moves:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if is_within_board(nx, ny) and (nx, ny) not in current_positions['w'] and (nx, ny) not in current_positions['B']:\n                    # Make the move\n                    new_positions = { 'w': current_positions['w'][:], 'B': current_positions['B'][:] }\n                    new_positions[turn][i] = (nx, ny)\n                    new_state = board_to_tuple(new_positions)\n                    \n                    if new_state not in visited:\n                        visited.add(new_state)\n                        new_move = f\"{turn},{chr(65+x)}{3-y},{chr(65+nx)}{3-ny}\"\n                        queue.append((new_positions, moves + [new_move]))\n    \n    return \"No\"\n\n# Find and print the moves\nresult = find_moves()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will determine if it's possible to swap the knights and, if so, provide the sequence of moves.
