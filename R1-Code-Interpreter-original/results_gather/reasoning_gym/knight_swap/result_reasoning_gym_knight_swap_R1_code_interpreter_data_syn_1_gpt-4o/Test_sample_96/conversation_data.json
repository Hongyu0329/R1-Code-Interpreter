    "To solve the Knight Swap Challenge, we need to determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights using valid knight moves. The board is a 4x3 grid, and the knights move in an L-shape, which means they can move two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that direction.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - White Knights: w at B2 and w at D1\n   - Black Knights: B at B3 and B at C3\n\n2. **Target Positions:**\n   - White Knights should move to B3 and C3\n   - Black Knights should move to B2 and D1\n\n3. **Valid Moves:**\n   - Knights can only move to empty squares.\n   - The move sequence must alternate between white and black knights.\n\n4. **Objective:**\n   - Determine if a sequence of valid moves exists to swap the positions of the knights.\n\nTo solve this, we can simulate the moves and check if a valid sequence exists. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible moves and check if we can reach the target configuration.\n\nLet's implement the solution using Python code to simulate the moves and check for a valid sequence.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the board and initial positions\ninitial_positions = {\n    'w': [(1, 1), (3, 0)],  # B2, D1\n    'B': [(1, 2), (2, 2)]   # B3, C3\n}\n\n# Target positions\ntarget_positions = {\n    'w': [(1, 2), (2, 2)],  # B3, C3\n    'B': [(1, 1), (3, 0)]   # B2, D1\n}\n\n# Possible knight moves (L-shape)\nknight_moves = [\n    (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),\n    (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)\n]\n\n# Convert board positions to coordinates\ndef pos_to_coord(pos):\n    col, row = pos\n    return (ord(col) - ord('A'), int(row) - 1)\n\n# Convert coordinates to board positions\ndef coord_to_pos(coord):\n    x, y = coord\n    return (chr(x + ord('A')), y + 1)\n\n# Check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(x, y):\n    return 0 <= x < 4 and 0 <= y < 3\n\n# BFS to find the sequence of moves\ndef find_moves():\n    queue = deque([(initial_positions, [])])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        positions, moves = queue.popleft()\n        if positions == target_positions:\n            return moves\n\n        # Alternate moves between white and black\n        for color in ['w', 'B']:\n            for i, (x, y) in enumerate(positions[color]):\n                for dx, dy in knight_moves:\n                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                    if is_within_board(nx, ny) and (nx, ny) not in positions['w'] and (nx, ny) not in positions['B']:\n                        new_positions = {k: v[:] for k, v in positions.items()}\n                        new_positions[color][i] = (nx, ny)\n                        new_moves = moves + [f\"{color},{coord_to_pos((x, y))},{coord_to_pos((nx, ny))}\"]\n                        state = (tuple(new_positions['w']), tuple(new_positions['B']))\n                        if state not in visited:\n                            visited.add(state)\n                            queue.append((new_positions, new_moves))\n    return \"No\"\n\n# Find and print the moves\nresult = find_moves()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the moves using a BFS approach and determine if a valid sequence of moves exists to swap the knights' positions. If a solution is found, it will print the sequence of moves; otherwise, it will print \"No\".",
    "The code output indicates that a sequence of moves was found to swap the positions of the knights. However, the output format is not as expected. The positions are represented as tuples instead of the required string format.
