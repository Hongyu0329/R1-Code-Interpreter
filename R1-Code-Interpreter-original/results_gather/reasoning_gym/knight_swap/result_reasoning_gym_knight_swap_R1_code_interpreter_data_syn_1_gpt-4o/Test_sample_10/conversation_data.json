    "To solve the Knight Swap Challenge, we need to determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights using valid knight moves. The board is a 4x3 grid, and the knights move in an L-shape, which means they can move two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that direction.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - White Knights: B2, D1\n   - Black Knights: A2, C1\n\n2. **Target Positions:**\n   - White Knights: A2, C1\n   - Black Knights: B2, D1\n\n3. **Valid Moves:**\n   - Knights can only move to empty squares.\n   - The move sequence must alternate between white and black knights.\n\n4. **Objective:**\n   - Determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the knights and, if so, list the sequence of moves.\n\nTo solve this, we can simulate the moves of the knights and check if we can reach the target configuration. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible moves and configurations.\n\nLet's implement the solution using Python to simulate the moves and check for a valid sequence.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the board and initial positions\ninitial_positions = {\n    'w1': (1, 1),  # B2\n    'w2': (3, 0),  # D1\n    'b1': (0, 1),  # A2\n    'b2': (2, 0)   # C1\n}\n\n# Target positions\ntarget_positions = {\n    'w1': (0, 1),  # A2\n    'w2': (2, 0),  # C1\n    'b1': (1, 1),  # B2\n    'b2': (3, 0)   # D1\n}\n\n# Possible knight moves (L-shape)\nknight_moves = [\n    (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),\n    (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)\n]\n\n# Convert position to board notation\ndef pos_to_notation(pos):\n    col = chr(pos[0] + ord('A'))\n    row = str(pos[1] + 1)\n    return col + row\n\n# Check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(pos):\n    return 0 <= pos[0] < 4 and 0 <= pos[1] < 3\n\n# BFS to find the sequence of moves\ndef find_moves():\n    queue = deque([(initial_positions, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(tuple(initial_positions.values()))\n\n    while queue:\n        positions, moves = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if we reached the target configuration\n        if positions == target_positions:\n            return moves\n\n        # Determine whose turn it is\n        turn = 'w' if len(moves) % 2 == 0 else 'b'\n\n        # Try all possible moves for the current player's knights\n        for knight in positions:\n            if knight.startswith(turn):\n                current_pos = positions[knight]\n                for move in knight_moves:\n                    new_pos = (current_pos[0] + move[0], current_pos[1] + move[1])\n                    if is_within_board(new_pos) and new_pos not in positions.values():\n                        new_positions = positions.copy()\n                        new_positions[knight] = new_pos\n                        new_moves = moves + [f\"{turn},{pos_to_notation(current_pos)},{pos_to_notation(new_pos)}\"]\n                        new_positions_tuple = tuple(new_positions.values())\n                        if new_positions_tuple not in visited:\n                            visited.add(new_positions_tuple)\n                            queue.append((new_positions, new_moves))\n\n    return \"No\"\n\n# Find the sequence of moves\nresult = find_moves()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the moves of the knights using a BFS approach to explore all possible configurations. It will output the sequence of moves if a solution is found or \"No\" if it's impossible to swap the knights' positions.",
    "The code successfully found a sequence of moves to swap the positions of the white and black knights. The sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n1. White knight moves from B2 to D3.\n2.
