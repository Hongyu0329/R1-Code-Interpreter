    "To solve the Knight Swap Challenge, we need to determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights using valid knight moves. The board is a 4x3 grid, and the knights move in an L-shape, which means they can move two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that direction.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - White Knights: A3, C3\n   - Black Knights: B1, D2\n\n2. **Target Positions:**\n   - White Knights: B1, D2\n   - Black Knights: A3, C3\n\n3. **Valid Moves:**\n   - Knights can only move to empty squares.\n   - The move sequence must alternate between white and black knights.\n\n4. **Objective:**\n   - Determine if a sequence of valid moves exists to swap the positions of the knights.\n\nTo solve this, we can simulate the moves and check if a sequence exists that satisfies the conditions. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible moves and check if we can reach the target configuration.\n\nLet's implement the solution using Python code to simulate the moves and check for a valid sequence.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the board and initial positions\ninitial_positions = {\n    'w': [(0, 2), (2, 2)],  # A3, C3\n    'B': [(1, 0), (3, 1)]   # B1, D2\n}\n\n# Target positions\ntarget_positions = {\n    'w': [(1, 0), (3, 1)],  # B1, D2\n    'B': [(0, 2), (2, 2)]   # A3, C3\n}\n\n# Knight moves (L-shape)\nknight_moves = [\n    (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),\n    (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)\n]\n\n# Convert position to board coordinates\ndef pos_to_coord(pos):\n    return (ord(pos[0]) - ord('A'), int(pos[1]) - 1)\n\n# Convert board coordinates to position\ndef coord_to_pos(coord):\n    return chr(coord[0] + ord('A')) + str(coord[1] + 1)\n\n# Check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(x, y):\n    return 0 <= x < 4 and 0 <= y < 3\n\n# BFS to find the sequence of moves\ndef bfs_knight_swap():\n    queue = deque([(initial_positions, [])])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_positions, moves = queue.popleft()\n        if current_positions == target_positions:\n            return moves\n\n        # Alternate moves between white and black\n        for color in ['w', 'B']:\n            for i, (x, y) in enumerate(current_positions[color]):\n                for dx, dy in knight_moves:\n                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                    if is_within_board(nx, ny):\n                        # Check if the new position is empty\n                        if (nx, ny) not in current_positions['w'] and (nx, ny) not in current_positions['B']:\n                            # Create new positions\n                            new_positions = {k: v[:] for k, v in current_positions.items()}\n                            new_positions[color][i] = (nx, ny)\n                            new_positions_tuple = (tuple(new_positions['w']), tuple(new_positions['B']))\n                            if new_positions_tuple not in visited:\n                                visited.add(new_positions_tuple)\n                                new_move = f\"{color},{coord_to_pos((x, y))},{coord_to_pos((nx, ny))}\"\n                                queue.append((new_positions, moves + [new_move]))\n\n    return \"No\"\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = bfs_knight_swap()\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the moves using a BFS approach and determine if a valid sequence of moves exists to swap the knights. If a solution is found, it will list the moves; otherwise, it will return \"No\".",
