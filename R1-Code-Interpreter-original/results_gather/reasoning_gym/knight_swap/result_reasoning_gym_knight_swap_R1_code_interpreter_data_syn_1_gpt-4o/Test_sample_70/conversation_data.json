    "To solve the Knight Swap Challenge, we need to determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights ('w') with the black knights ('B') using valid knight moves. The board is a 4x3 grid, and the knights move in an L-shape, which means they can move two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that direction.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - White Knights: A2, A1\n   - Black Knights: D3, D1\n\n2. **Target Positions:**\n   - White Knights should move to D3, D1\n   - Black Knights should move to A2, A1\n\n3. **Valid Moves:**\n   - Knights can only move to empty squares.\n   - The move sequence must alternate between white and black knights.\n\n4. **Objective:**\n   - Determine if a sequence of valid moves exists to swap the positions of the knights.\n\nTo solve this, we can simulate the moves and check if a sequence exists that satisfies the conditions. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible moves and check if we can reach the target configuration.\n\nLet's implement the solution using Python code to simulate the moves and determine if the swap is possible.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the board and initial positions\ninitial_positions = {\n    'w': [(0, 1), (0, 0)],  # A2, A1\n    'B': [(3, 2), (3, 0)]   # D3, D1\n}\n\n# Target positions\ntarget_positions = {\n    'w': [(3, 2), (3, 0)],  # D3, D1\n    'B': [(0, 1), (0, 0)]   # A2, A1\n}\n\n# Knight moves (L-shape)\nknight_moves = [\n    (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),\n    (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)\n]\n\n# Convert position to board notation\ndef pos_to_notation(pos):\n    return chr(pos[0] + ord('A')) + str(pos[1] + 1)\n\n# Check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(pos):\n    return 0 <= pos[0] < 4 and 0 <= pos[1] < 3\n\n# BFS to find the sequence of moves\ndef bfs_knight_swap():\n    queue = deque([(initial_positions, [])])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        positions, moves = queue.popleft()\n        if positions == target_positions:\n            return moves\n\n        # Alternate moves between white and black\n        for color in ['w', 'B']:\n            for i, pos in enumerate(positions[color]):\n                for move in knight_moves:\n                    new_pos = (pos[0] + move[0], pos[1] + move[1])\n                    if is_within_board(new_pos) and new_pos not in positions['w'] and new_pos not in positions['B']:\n                        new_positions = {k: v[:] for k, v in positions.items()}\n                        new_positions[color][i] = new_pos\n                        new_moves = moves + [f\"{color},{pos_to_notation(pos)},{pos_to_notation(new_pos)}\"]\n                        state = (tuple(new_positions['w']), tuple(new_positions['B']))\n                        if state not in visited:\n                            visited.add(state)\n                            queue.append((new_positions, new_moves))\n    return \"No\"\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = bfs_knight_swap()\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the moves using a BFS approach and determine if it's possible to swap the knights' positions. If a solution exists, it will return the sequence of moves; otherwise, it will return \"No\".",
    "The code output indicates that a sequence of moves exists to swap the positions of the white and black knights. The sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n1. White knight moves from A2 to C3\n2. White knight moves from A1 to C2\n3. White knight moves from C2 to A3\n4. White knight moves from A3 to B1\n5. Black knight moves from D3 to C1\n6. Black knight moves from C1 to A2\n7. Black knight moves from D1 to B2\n8. White knight moves from C3 to D1\n9. White knight moves from B1 to C3\n10. Black knight moves from B2 to D3\n11. White knight moves from D1 to B2\n12.
