    "To solve the Knight Swap Challenge, we need to determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights ('w') with the black knights ('B') using valid knight moves. The board is a 4x3 grid, and the knights move in an L-shape, which means they can move two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that direction.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - White Knights ('w'): B3, D3\n   - Black Knights ('B'): A2, C1\n\n2. **Target Positions:**\n   - White Knights need to move to A2, C1\n   - Black Knights need to move to B3, D3\n\n3. **Rules:**\n   - Knights can only move to empty squares.\n   - Moves alternate between white and black knights.\n   - We need to find a sequence of moves that achieves the swap.\n\n4. **Approach:**\n   - Use a breadth-first search (BFS) or backtracking to explore possible moves.\n   - Keep track of the board state after each move.\n   - Ensure that moves alternate between white and black knights.\n   - Check if the target configuration is reached.\n\nLet's implement a solution using a backtracking approach to explore possible moves and determine if a valid sequence exists.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the board and initial positions\ninitial_positions = {\n    'w': [(1, 2), (3, 2)],  # B3, D3\n    'B': [(0, 1), (2, 0)]   # A2, C1\n}\n\n# Target positions for the swap\ntarget_positions = {\n    'w': [(0, 1), (2, 0)],  # A2, C1\n    'B': [(1, 2), (3, 2)]   # B3, D3\n}\n\n# Possible knight moves (L-shape)\nknight_moves = [\n    (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),\n    (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)\n]\n\n# Convert board positions to a string for easy comparison\ndef board_to_string(positions):\n    board = [['.' for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(3)]\n    for color, pos_list in positions.items():\n        for x, y in pos_list:\n            board[y][x] = color\n    return ''.join(''.join(row) for row in board)\n\n# Check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(x, y):\n    return 0 <= x < 4 and 0 <= y < 3\n\n# Perform BFS to find the sequence of moves\ndef find_moves():\n    initial_state = board_to_string(initial_positions)\n    target_state = board_to_string(target_positions)\n    \n    queue = deque([(initial_positions, [], 'w')])  # (current positions, moves, next color)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_positions, moves, next_color = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the target state\n        if board_to_string(current_positions) == target_state:\n            return moves\n        \n        # Get the positions of the knights of the current color\n        for i, (x, y) in enumerate(current_positions[next_color]):\n            for dx, dy in knight_moves:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if is_within_board(nx, ny) and (nx, ny) not in current_positions['w'] and (nx, ny) not in current_positions['B']:\n                    # Create a new state with the knight moved\n                    new_positions = {color: list(pos_list) for color, pos_list in current_positions.items()}\n                    new_positions[next_color][i] = (nx, ny)\n                    \n                    # Convert to string to check if visited\n                    new_state = board_to_string(new_positions)\n                    if new_state not in visited:\n                        visited.add(new_state)\n                        new_moves = moves + [f\"{next_color},{chr(x + 65)}{3 - y},{chr(nx + 65)}{3 - ny}\"]\n                        queue.append((new_positions, new_moves, 'B' if next_color == 'w' else 'w'))\n    \n    return \"No\"\n\n# Find the sequence of moves\nresult = find_moves()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible sequences of moves. It alternates between moving white and black knights and checks if the target configuration is reached. If a valid sequence is found, it returns the list of moves; otherwise, it returns \"No\".",
