    "To solve the Knight Swap Challenge, we need to determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights using valid knight moves. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - White Knights: C3, C1\n   - Black Knights: D2, A1\n\n2. **Target Positions:**\n   - White Knights should move to D2, A1\n   - Black Knights should move to C3, C1\n\n3. **Knight Moves:**\n   - Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and two squares perpendicular.\n\n4. **Constraints:**\n   - Knights can only move to empty squares.\n   - Moves alternate between white and black knights.\n\n5. **Objective:**\n   - Determine if a sequence of valid moves exists to swap the positions of the knights.\n\nTo solve this, we can simulate the moves and check if a sequence exists that satisfies the conditions. Let's write a Python script to explore the possible moves and determine if a solution exists.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the board and initial positions\nboard = {\n    'A1': 'B', 'B1': '.', 'C1': 'w', 'D1': '.',\n    'A2': '.', 'B2': '.', 'C2': '.', 'D2': 'B',\n    'A3': '.', 'B3': '.', 'C3': 'w', 'D3': '.'\n}\n\n# Define the target positions\ntarget_positions = {\n    'w': ['D2', 'A1'],\n    'B': ['C3', 'C1']\n}\n\n# Define knight moves\nknight_moves = [\n    (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),\n    (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)\n]\n\n# Convert board position to coordinates\ndef pos_to_coord(pos):\n    col, row = pos\n    return ord(col) - ord('A'), int(row) - 1\n\n# Convert coordinates to board position\ndef coord_to_pos(x, y):\n    return chr(x + ord('A')) + str(y + 1)\n\n# Check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(x, y):\n    return 0 <= x < 4 and 0 <= y < 3\n\n# BFS to find the sequence of moves\ndef bfs():\n    queue = deque([(board, [], 'w')])  # (current board, moves, current player)\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_board, moves, current_player = queue.popleft()\n        board_tuple = tuple(current_board.items())\n\n        if board_tuple in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add(board_tuple)\n\n        # Check if the current board matches the target positions\n        if all(current_board[pos] == 'w' for pos in target_positions['w']) and \\\n           all(current_board[pos] == 'B' for pos in target_positions['B']):\n            return moves\n\n        # Get current player's knights\n        for pos, knight in current_board.items():\n            if knight == current_player:\n                x, y = pos_to_coord(pos)\n\n                # Try all possible knight moves\n                for dx, dy in knight_moves:\n                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                    new_pos = coord_to_pos(nx, ny)\n\n                    if is_within_board(nx, ny) and current_board[new_pos] == '.':\n                        # Make the move\n                        new_board = current_board.copy()\n                        new_board[new_pos] = current_player\n                        new_board[pos] = '.'\n\n                        # Add the move to the list\n                        new_moves = moves + [f\"{current_player},{pos},{new_pos}\"]\n\n                        # Alternate player\n                        next_player = 'B' if current_player == 'w' else 'w'\n\n                        # Add to queue\n                        queue.append((new_board, new_moves, next_player))\n\n    return \"No\"\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = bfs()\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible sequences of moves. It checks if the current board configuration matches the target configuration and returns the sequence of moves if a solution is found. If no solution exists, it returns \"No\".
