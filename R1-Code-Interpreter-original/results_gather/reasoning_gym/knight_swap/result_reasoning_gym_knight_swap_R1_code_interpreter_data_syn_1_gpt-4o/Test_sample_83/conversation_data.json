    "To solve the Knight Swap Challenge, we need to determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white knights ('w') and black knights ('B') using valid knight moves. The board is a 4x3 grid, and the knights can only move in an L-shape to empty squares.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - White Knights ('w'): B3, C3\n   - Black Knights ('B'): D2, C1\n\n2. **Target Positions:**\n   - White Knights should move to: D2, C1\n   - Black Knights should move to: B3, C3\n\n3. **Knight Moves:**\n   - A knight moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and two squares perpendicular.\n\n4. **Constraints:**\n   - Knights can only move to empty squares.\n   - Moves alternate between white and black knights.\n\n5. **Objective:**\n   - Determine if a sequence of valid moves exists to swap the positions of the knights.\n\nTo solve this, we can simulate the moves and check if a sequence exists that satisfies the conditions. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible moves, alternating between white and black knights.\n\nLet's implement the solution using Python to simulate the moves and check for a valid sequence.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the board and initial positions\ninitial_positions = {\n    'w': [(1, 2), (2, 2)],  # B3, C3\n    'B': [(3, 1), (2, 0)]   # D2, C1\n}\n\n# Target positions for the swap\ntarget_positions = {\n    'w': [(3, 1), (2, 0)],  # D2, C1\n    'B': [(1, 2), (2, 2)]   # B3, C3\n}\n\n# Possible knight moves (L-shape)\nknight_moves = [\n    (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),\n    (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)\n]\n\n# Convert board positions to coordinates\ndef pos_to_coord(pos):\n    return (ord(pos[0]) - ord('A'), int(pos[1]) - 1)\n\n# Convert coordinates to board positions\ndef coord_to_pos(coord):\n    return chr(coord[0] + ord('A')) + str(coord[1] + 1)\n\n# Check if a position is within the board\ndef is_within_board(x, y):\n    return 0 <= x < 4 and 0 <= y < 3\n\n# BFS to find the sequence of moves\ndef find_moves():\n    queue = deque([(initial_positions, [], 'w')])  # (positions, moves, current_turn)\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        positions, moves, turn = queue.popleft()\n        if positions == target_positions:\n            return moves\n\n        # Generate possible moves for the current turn\n        for i, (x, y) in enumerate(positions[turn]):\n            for dx, dy in knight_moves:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if is_within_board(nx, ny) and (nx, ny) not in positions['w'] and (nx, ny) not in positions['B']:\n                    new_positions = { 'w': positions['w'][:], 'B': positions['B'][:] }\n                    new_positions[turn][i] = (nx, ny)\n                    new_positions_tuple = (tuple(new_positions['w']), tuple(new_positions['B']))\n                    if new_positions_tuple not in visited:\n                        visited.add(new_positions_tuple)\n                        new_moves = moves + [f\"{turn},{coord_to_pos((x, y))},{coord_to_pos((nx, ny))}\"]\n                        queue.append((new_positions, new_moves, 'B' if turn == 'w' else 'w'))\n\n    return \"No\"\n\n# Find and print the sequence of moves\nresult = find_moves()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and determine if a sequence of moves exists to swap the knights' positions. If a solution is found, it will list the moves; otherwise, it will return \"No\".",
    "The code successfully found a sequence of moves to swap the positions of the white and black knights.
