    "To solve the Knight Swap Challenge, we need to determine if it's possible to swap the positions of the white and black knights using valid knight moves. Let's break down the problem and analyze the possible moves.\n\n### Initial Setup:\n- White Knights (w) are at positions D3 and D1.\n- Black Knights (B) are at positions C3 and C1.\n- Empty squares are at A2 and B1.\n\n### Objective:\n- Swap the positions of the white knights with the black knights.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares.\n3. White moves first, then alternate with black.\n4. All knights must reach their target positions.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. Identify all possible moves for the white knights.\n2. Alternate moves with black knights.\n3. Check if the final positions can be achieved.\n\n### Analysis:\n- White Knight at D3 can move to B2 or C1.\n- White Knight at D1 can move to B2 or C3.\n- Black Knight at C3 can move to A2 or D1.\n- Black Knight at C1 can move to A2 or D3.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move white knight from D3 to C1.\n2. Move black knight from C3 to D1.\n3. Move white knight from D1 to C3.\n4. Move black knight from C1 to D3.\n\nLet's simulate these moves using Python to ensure they are valid and achieve the swap.\n\n```python\n# Define the initial positions of the knights\nwhite_knights = {'D3': 'w', 'D1': 'w'}\nblack_knights = {'C3': 'B', 'C1': 'B'}\nempty_squares = ['A2', 'B1']\n\n# Define the moves\nmoves = [\n    (\"w\", \"D3\", \"C1\"),  # White knight moves from D3 to C1\n    (\"B\", \"C3\", \"D1\"),  # Black knight moves from C3 to D1\n    (\"w\", \"D1\", \"C3\"),  # White knight moves from D1 to C3\n    (\"B\", \"C1\", \"D3\")   # Black knight moves from C1 to D3\n]\n\n# Function to apply moves and check the final positions\ndef apply_moves(moves, white_knights, black_knights):\n    for move in moves:\n        color, from_pos, to_pos = move\n        if color == 'w':\n            # Move white knight\n            white_knights[to_pos] = white_knights.pop(from_pos)\n        else:\n            # Move black knight\n            black_knights[to_pos] = black_knights.pop(from_pos)\n    \n    # Check if the swap is successful\n    final_white_positions = set(black_knights.keys())\n    final_black_positions = set(white_knights.keys())\n    \n    return final_white_positions == set(['C3', 'C1']) and final_black_positions == set(['D3', 'D1'])\n\n# Check if the moves achieve the swap\nis_possible = apply_moves(moves, white_knights, black_knights)\nprint(\"Yes\" if is_possible else \"No\")\nif is_possible:\n    print(moves)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify if the swap is possible and list the moves.",
