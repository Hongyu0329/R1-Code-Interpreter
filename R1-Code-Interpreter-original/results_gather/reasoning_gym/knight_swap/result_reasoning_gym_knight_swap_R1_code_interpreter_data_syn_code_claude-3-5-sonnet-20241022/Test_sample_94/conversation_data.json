    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Knight Swap Challenge:\n\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 | B | . | w |   |\n   ----------------\n2 | . |   | . |   |\n   ----------------\n1 |   | w | B | . |\n   ----------------\n```\n\nLegend:\n- 'w' = White Knight\n- 'B' = Black Knight\n- Empty squares are marked with '.'\n\nObjective:\nSwap the positions of all white knights with all black knights through valid moves.\n\nRules:\n1. Knights move in L-shape (2 squares + 1 square perpendicular)\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares\n3. w moves first, then players alternate\n4. All knights must reach their target positions (white ↔ black)\n\nQuestion:\nIs it possible to swap all knights' positions? If yes, list the moves.\n\nAnswer Format:\n- For impossible puzzles: \"No\"\n- For possible puzzles: List moves as [\"color,from,to\", ...]\n  Example: [\"w,A1,B3\"] means white knight moves A1→B3\n- Output final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
