    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player and boxes to achieve a state where all boxes are placed on goals. Let's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ - - - - +  \n+ - X - - +  \n+ @ @ - - +  \n+ % @ X $ +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player is represented by `%` and is currently on a goal.\n- There are three boxes (`@`) and one box on a goal (`$`).\n- There are two goals (`X`), one of which is occupied by the player.\n\nThe objective is to move the boxes onto the goals. Let's find a sequence of moves to solve this puzzle.\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the box into the goal.\n2. Move the player around to push the remaining boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Move the player right to push the box into the goal.\n2. Move the player around to push the remaining boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Move Right (R) to push the box into the goal.\n- Move Down (D) to get around the box.\n- Move Left (L) to position the player to push the next box.\n- Move Up (U) to push the box up.\n- Move Right (R) to push the box into the goal.\n- Move Down (D) to get around the box.\n- Move Left (L) to position the player to push the last box.\n- Move Up (U) to push the box up.\n- Move Right (R) to push the box into the goal.\n\nLet's write the solution as a string of moves.\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is as follows:\n\n1. Move Right (R) to push the first box into the goal.\n2. Move Down (D) to get around the box.\n3. Move Left (L) to position the player to push the next box.\n4. Move Up (U) to push the box up.\n5. Move Right (R) to push the box into the goal.\n6. Move Down (D) to get around the box.\n7. Move Left (L) to position the player to push the last box.\n8. Move Up (U) to push the box up.\n9. Move Right (R) to push the box into the goal.\n\nThe solution in string format is:\n\n<<<RDLURDLUR>>>"
