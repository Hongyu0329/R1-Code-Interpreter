    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ - - - - +  \n+ @ - $ X +  \n+ - - @ - +  \n+ - X * - +  \n+ - - - - +  \n+ X - @ - +  \n+ $ - - - +  \n+ X @ - + +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is located at row 4, column 4. The boxes (@) are located at:\n- Row 2, column 2\n- Row 3, column 4\n- Row 6, column 3\n- Row 8, column 2\n- Row 9, column 3\n\nThe goals (X) are located at:\n- Row 2, column 4\n- Row 3, column 5\n- Row 5, column 3\n- Row 7, column 2\n- Row 9, column 2\n\nLet's find a sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to push the box at (3, 4) onto the goal at (3, 5).\n2. Move the player to push the box at (2, 2) onto the goal at (2, 4).\n3. Move the player to push the box at (6, 3) onto the goal at (5, 3).\n4. Move the player to push the box at (8, 2) onto the goal at (7, 2).\n5. Move the player to push the box at (9, 3) onto the goal at (9, 2).\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the sequence of moves.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player to the left of the box at (3, 4) and push it right onto the goal at (3, 5).\n2. Move the player to the left of the box at (2, 2) and push it right onto the goal at (2, 4).\n3. Move the player to the right of the box at (6, 3) and push it left onto the goal at (5, 3).\n4. Move the player to the right of the box at (8, 2) and push it left onto the goal at (7, 2).\n5. Move the player to the right of the box at (9, 3) and push it left onto the goal at (9, 2).\n\nLet's translate these steps into a sequence of moves:\n\n- Move the player to the left of the box at (3, 4): UUL\n- Push the box right onto the goal: R\n- Move the player to the left of the box at (2, 2): DDL\n- Push the box right onto the goal: R\n- Move the player to the right of the box at (6, 3): DDDRR\n- Push the box left onto the goal: L\n- Move the player to the right of the box at (8, 2): DDL\n- Push the box left onto the goal: L\n- Move the player to the right of the box at (9, 3): DDL\n- Push the box left onto the goal: L\n\nCombining these moves, we get the solution:\n\n<<<UULRDDLDRRLDLLDL>>>"
