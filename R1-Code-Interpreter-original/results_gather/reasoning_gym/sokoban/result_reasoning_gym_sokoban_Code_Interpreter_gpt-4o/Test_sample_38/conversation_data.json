    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ + X @ * +  \n+ + + $ @ +  \n+ + + + - +  \n+ + $ + - +  \n+ + + + - +  \n+ + $ + X +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is initially located at position (1, 4).\n- There are three boxes (@) initially located at positions (1, 3), (2, 4), and (4, 2).\n- There are two goals (X) located at positions (1, 2) and (6, 4).\n\nThe goal is to move the boxes onto the goals. Let's find a sequence of moves to achieve this.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the left to push the box at (1, 3) onto the goal at (1, 2).\n2. Move the player down to push the box at (2, 4) onto the goal at (6, 4).\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move left (L) to push the box at (1, 3) onto the goal at (1, 2).\n2. Move down (D) to position the player below the box at (2, 4).\n3. Move right (R) to push the box at (2, 4) down.\n4. Move down (D) to push the box further down.\n5. Move right (R) to push the box onto the goal at (6, 4).\n\nLet's write the solution as a sequence of moves: <<<LDRDR>>>."
