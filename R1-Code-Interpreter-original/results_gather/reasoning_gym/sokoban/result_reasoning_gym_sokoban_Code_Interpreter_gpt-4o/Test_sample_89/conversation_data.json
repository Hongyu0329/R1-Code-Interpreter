    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player and boxes to achieve the goal state where all boxes are placed on the goals. Let's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ - - @ X +  \n+ % @ - - +  \n+ - - $ - +  \n+ - - - - +  \n+ + X @ - +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player is currently on a goal (`%`).\n- There are three boxes (`@`) and one box on a goal (`$`).\n- There are two goals (`X`).\n\nThe goal is to move all boxes onto the goals. Let's find a sequence of moves to achieve this. \n\nI'll work through the puzzle step by step to find a solution.\nassistant > Let's break down the puzzle and find a sequence of moves to solve it:\n\n1. The player is currently on a goal (`%`) at position (2, 2).\n2. There are three boxes (`@`) at positions (1, 3), (2, 3), and (5, 4).\n3. There are two goals (`X`) at positions (1, 4) and (5, 3).\n4. There is one box on a goal (`$`) at position (3, 4).\n\nThe player needs to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's start by moving the player to a position where they can push the boxes.\n\n### Plan:\n- Move the player to push the box at (1, 3) to the goal at (1, 4).\n- Move the player to push the box at (2, 3) to the goal at (5, 3).\n- Ensure the box at (5, 4) is moved to a goal if needed.\n\nLet's execute this plan step by step:\n\n1. Move the player down to (3, 2).\n2. Move right to (3, 3) to push the box at (2, 3) down.\n3. Move the player to push the box at (1, 3) to the right onto the goal at (1, 4).\n4. Move the player to push the box at (5, 4) up to the goal at (5, 3).\n\nLet's find the sequence of moves to achieve this.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, let's execute the plan step by step:\n\n1. **Move the player to push the box at (1, 3) to the goal at (1, 4):**\n   - Move the player down to (3, 2): `D`\n   - Move right to (3, 3): `R`\n   - Move up to (2, 3): `U`\n   - Move left to (2, 2): `L`\n   - Move up to (1, 2): `U`\n   - Move right to (1, 3): `R`\n   - Push the box right to (1, 4): `R`\n\n2. **Move the player to push the box at (2, 3) to the goal at (5, 3):**\n   - Move down to (2, 3): `D`\n   - Move down to (3, 3): `D`\n   - Move down to (4, 3): `D`\n   - Move right to (4, 4): `R`\n   - Move down to (5, 4): `D`\n   - Move left to (5, 3): `L`\n   - Push the box up to (5, 3): `U`\n\n3. **Ensure the box at (5, 4) is moved to a goal if needed:**\n   - The box at (5, 4) is already on a goal, so no further moves are needed.\n\nLet's combine these moves into a single sequence:\n\n```\nD R U L U R R D D D R D L U\n```\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<DRULURRDDDRDLU>>>"
