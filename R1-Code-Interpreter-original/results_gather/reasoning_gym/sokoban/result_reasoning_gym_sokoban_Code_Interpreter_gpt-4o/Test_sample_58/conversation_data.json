    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ * - - - - +  \n+ X @ @ - - +  \n+ X - $ - - +  \n+ - @ X - - +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is at position (1, 1).\n- There are three boxes (@) and one box on a goal ($).\n- There are three goals (X).\n\nThe goal is to move all boxes onto the goals. Let's find a sequence of moves to achieve this.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Navigate the player to push the remaining boxes onto the other goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move right (R) to position the player next to the first box.\n2. Push the first box down (D) onto the goal.\n3. Move the player around to push the second box onto the next goal.\n4. Finally, push the last box onto the remaining goal.\n\nLet's write out the sequence of moves to achieve this.\nassistant > Here's a sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move right (R) to position the player next to the first box.\n2. Push the first box down (D) onto the goal.\n3. Move right (R) to position the player next to the second box.\n4. Push the second box down (D) onto the goal.\n5. Move left (L) to position the player next to the third box.\n6. Push the third box right (R) onto the goal.\n\nThe sequence of moves is: `RDDRRDLDR`.\n\nLet's format this solution as required:\n\n<<<RDDRRDLDR>>>"
