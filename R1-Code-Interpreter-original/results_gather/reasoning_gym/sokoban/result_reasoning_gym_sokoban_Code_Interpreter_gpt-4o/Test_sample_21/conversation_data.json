    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle and find a solution. \n\nHere's the initial layout:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ * @ X + + - - + +  \n+ $ - + + - @ - + +  \n+ $ - $ X - - - + +  \n+ $ - @ - - X - - +  \n+ - - - - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's solve it step by step:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Navigate the player to push the other boxes onto their respective goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step solution to the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player right to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Move the player down and then right to push the second box onto the goal.\n3. Move the player down, left, and then up to push the third box onto the goal.\n4. Finally, move the player right to push the last box onto the goal.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n- R (Right)\n- D (Down)\n- R (Right)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- U (Up)\n- R (Right)\n\nLet's represent this solution as a string of characters enclosed within triple angle brackets. \n\nThe solution is:\n\n<<<RDRDLUR>>>"
