    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The player can only push one box at a time and cannot move through walls (+) or boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + + X @ - $ +  \n+ * - - @ - - +  \n+ - @ X - - X +  \n+ - $ - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nWe need to find a sequence of moves that will push all the boxes onto the goals. Let's work through the solution step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player (*) to the right to push the first box (@) onto the goal (X).\n2. Navigate the player to push the second box (@) onto the goal (X).\n3. Finally, push the third box (@) onto the remaining goal (X).\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move Right (R) to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Move Down (D), Right (R), and Up (U) to position the player to push the second box.\n3. Move Right (R) to push the second box onto the goal.\n4. Move Down (D), Left (L), and Up (U) to position the player to push the third box.\n5. Move Right (R) to push the third box onto the goal.\n\nLet's write the sequence of moves:\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is as follows:\n\n1.
