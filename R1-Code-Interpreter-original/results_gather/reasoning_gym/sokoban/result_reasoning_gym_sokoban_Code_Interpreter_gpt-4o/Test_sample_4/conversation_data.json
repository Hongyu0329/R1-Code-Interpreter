    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ X + - - - - +  \n+ * $ - - @ @ +  \n+ - @ @ + X X +  \n+ - - X + + + +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is at position (2, 2).\n- There are three boxes (@) and one box on a goal ($).\n- There are three goals (X).\n\nThe goal is to move all boxes onto the goals. Let's find a sequence of moves to achieve this.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to a position where they can push the boxes.\n2. Push the boxes onto the goals one by one.\n\nHere's a possible sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the box on the goal ($) to the right.\n2. Push the box down to align it with the goal.\n3. Move the player to push the other boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n- Move right (R) to push the box on the goal to the right.\n- Move down (D) to align the box with the goal.\n- Move right (R) to push the box onto the goal.\n- Move up (U) and left (L) to position the player to push the next box.\n- Push the next box onto the goal.\n- Repeat for the remaining boxes.\n\nLet's write out the sequence of moves.\nassistant > Here's a sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1.
