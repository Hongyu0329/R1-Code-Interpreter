    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The player can only push one box at a time and cannot move through walls (+) or boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ X X @ - +  \n+ - X - - +  \n+ @ - @ - +  \n+ % @ - - +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player is currently on a goal, represented by `%`.\n- There are three boxes (@) and three goals (X).\n- The player needs to push each box onto a goal.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to plan a sequence of moves that will push all the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the position where they can push the first box onto a goal.\n2. Push the first box onto a goal.\n3. Repeat the process for the remaining boxes.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the box in the second row onto the goal.\n2. Move the player down to push the box in the fourth row onto the goal.\n3. Finally, move the player to push the last box onto the remaining goal.\n\nLet's write out the sequence of moves.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step solution to the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player right to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Move the player down and then right to push the second box onto the goal.\n3. Move the player up and then right to push the third box onto the goal.\n\nLet's translate these steps into a sequence of moves:\n\n- Start by moving right (R) to push the first box onto the goal.\n- Move down (D) and then right (R) to push the second box onto the goal.\n- Move up (U) and then right (R) to push the third box onto the goal.\n\nThe sequence of moves is: `RDDRRUUR`.\n\nLet's verify this solution by visualizing the moves.\nassistant > Let's execute the moves step by step to ensure they solve the puzzle:\n\n1.
