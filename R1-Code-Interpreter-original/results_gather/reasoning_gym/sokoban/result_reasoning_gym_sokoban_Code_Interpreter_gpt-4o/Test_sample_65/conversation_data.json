    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ + + X $ + +  \n+ + - - - - +  \n+ X - @ @ - +  \n+ X - - - - +  \n+ X - @ - - +  \n+ @ - @ - - +  \n+ X - - * - +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is located at position (7, 5). The goal is to move the boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the box at (6, 2) onto the goal at (5, 2).\n2. Move the player to the left and then up to push the box at (4, 3) onto the goal at (3, 2).\n3. Move the player to the right and then up to push the box at (4, 4) onto the goal at (2, 3).\n4. Finally, move the player to the right to push the box at (6, 4) onto the goal at (5, 3).\n\nLet's execute these moves:\n\n- R (right)\n- U (up)\n- L (left)\n- U (up)\n- R (right)\n- U (up)\n- R (right)\n\nThe solution in string format is: <<<RULURUR>>>."
