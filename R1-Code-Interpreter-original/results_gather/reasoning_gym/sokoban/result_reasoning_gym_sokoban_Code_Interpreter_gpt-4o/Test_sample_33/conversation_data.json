    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals, represented by ($).\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle and find a solution. \n\nHere's the initial layout for reference:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + +  \n+ - - - - - - - +  \n+ X - @ X - @ - +  \n+ @ X @ - @ @ X +  \n+ - - - - X - - +  \n+ - * @ X - - - +  \n+ - - - X - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's work through the solution step by step.\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that all boxes are placed on the goals.
