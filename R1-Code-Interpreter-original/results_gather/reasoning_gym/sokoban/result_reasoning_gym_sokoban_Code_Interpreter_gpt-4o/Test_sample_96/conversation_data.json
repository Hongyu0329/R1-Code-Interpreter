    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player and boxes to achieve a state where all boxes are placed on goals. Let's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ + $ % @ - +  \n+ + + @ $ - +  \n+ $ + - - - +  \n+ + - - - - +  \n+ + - - - - +  \n+ + - - @ X +  \n+ X - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player is currently on a goal (`%`), and there are several boxes (`@`) and goals (`X`) on the board. The objective is to move the boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the box onto the goal.\n2. Move the player down to push the next box.\n3. Continue moving the player and boxes until all boxes are on goals.\n\nI'll now compute the solution.\nassistant > After analyzing the puzzle, here is a step-by-step solution to move all the boxes onto the goals:\n\n1. Move the player right to push the box onto the goal.\n2. Move the player down to push the next box.\n3. Continue moving the player and boxes until all boxes are on goals.\n\nHere's the solution in terms of moves:\n\n- R: Right\n- L: Left\n- U: Up\n- D: Down\n\nLet's execute the moves:\n\n1. R (Right)\n2. D (Down)\n3. L (Left)\n4. D (Down)\n5. R (Right)\n6. U (Up)\n7. R (Right)\n8. D (Down)\n9. L (Left)\n10. D (Down)\n11. R (Right)\n12. U (Up)\n13.
