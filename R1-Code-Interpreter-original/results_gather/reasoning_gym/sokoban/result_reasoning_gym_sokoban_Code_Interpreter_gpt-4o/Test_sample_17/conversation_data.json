    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The player can only push one box at a time and cannot move through walls (+) or boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ + - - - +  \n+ - - - $ +  \n+ X @ - + +  \n+ - - - + +  \n+ @ - - + +  \n+ % $ $ + +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player is currently on a goal (%), and there are three boxes (@) and three goals (X). The objective is to move the boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to move the player and push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the position where they can push the first box.\n2. Push the first box onto a goal.\n3. Repeat the process for the remaining boxes.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Move the player to the left to push the box in the bottom row to the left goal.\n2. Move the player to the top to push the box in the middle row to the top goal.\n3. Finally, move the player to push the last box to the remaining goal.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step solution to the puzzle:\n\n1.

Finally, move the player to push the last box to the remaining goal.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution:\n\n1. Move left (L) to push the bottom box left.\n2. Move up (U) to push the middle box up.\n3. Move right (R) to push the last box right.\n\nLet's put these steps together to form the solution string.\nassistant > Here's a possible solution to the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player left to push the bottom box to the left goal.\n2. Move the player up to push the middle box to the top goal.\n3. Move the player right to push the last box to the remaining goal.\n\nThe sequence of moves can be represented as a string of characters. Let's construct the solution string:\n\n- Move left (L) to push the bottom box left.\n- Move up (U) to push the middle box up.\n- Move right (R) to push the last box right.\n\nThe solution string is: <<<LUURRDD>>>."
