    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). Let's analyze the given puzzle and find a solution.\n\nHere's the initial layout of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + $ + + + + +  \n+ + + - X - - +  \n+ - - - - $ - +  \n+ - - @ @ * - +  \n+ X - - $ - - +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the box (@) onto the goal (X).\n2. Move the player to the left to push the other box (@) onto the goal (X).\n3. Move the player to the right to push the last box (@) onto the goal (X).\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > Upon closer inspection, I realize that the initial analysis was incorrect.
