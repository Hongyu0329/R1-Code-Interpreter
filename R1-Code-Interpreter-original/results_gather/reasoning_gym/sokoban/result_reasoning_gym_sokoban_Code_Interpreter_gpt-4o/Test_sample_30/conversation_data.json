    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player and push the boxes onto the goals. The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The goal is to have all boxes placed on the goal positions.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ % @ X - - - +  \n+ @ - @ @ - - +  \n+ - - - - - - +  \n+ - - X X - - +  \n+ - - - @ X - +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player is currently on a goal position, denoted by `%`.\n- There are four boxes (`@`) and four goals (`X`).\n- The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to a position where they can start pushing the boxes.\n2. Push the boxes one by one onto the goal positions.\n3. Ensure that the player doesn't get stuck or push a box into a corner where it can't be moved.\n\nLet's start by moving the player to the right to push the first box onto the goal. Then, we'll continue with the subsequent moves to solve the puzzle.\n\nHere's a possible solution:\n\n1. Move Right (R) to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Move Down (D) to position the player to push the next box.\n3. Move Right (R) to push the second box.\n4. Move Up (U) to reposition the player.\n5. Move Right (R) to push the third box.\n6. Move Down (D) to reposition the player.\n7. Move Right (R) to push the fourth box.\n\nLet's execute these moves and see if they solve the puzzle.\nassistant > Upon further inspection, the initial plan needs to be adjusted to ensure all boxes are placed on the goals without getting stuck. Let's carefully plan the moves:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Reposition the player to push the next box.\n3. Continue this process until all boxes are on the goals.\n\nLet's execute the moves step by step:\n\n1. Move Right (R) to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Move Down (D) to reposition the player.\n3. Move Right (R) to push the second box.\n4. Move Up (U) to reposition the player.\n5. Move Right (R) to push the third box.\n6. Move Down (D) to reposition the player.\n7. Move Right (R) to push the fourth box.\n\nLet's try this sequence and see if it solves the puzzle.\nassistant > Let's carefully plan the moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1.
