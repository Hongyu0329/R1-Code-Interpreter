    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals, represented by ($).\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ - @ - - X +  \n+ - - X @ - +  \n+ - X - @ * +  \n+ - - - $ - +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\nWe need to find a sequence of moves that will solve the puzzle. Let's work through the solution step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player (*) to a position where they can push the boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n2. Ensure that each box is pushed onto a goal without blocking access to other boxes or goals.\n\nLet's start by moving the player to push the first box. Here's a possible sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move the player left (L) to position them to push the box.\n2. Push the box up (U) onto the goal.\n3. Move the player to the next box and repeat the process.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step solution to the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player left (L) to position them to push the first box.\n2. Push the first box up (U) onto the goal.\n3. Move the player right (R) to position them to push the second box.\n4. Push the second box up (U) onto the goal.\n5. Move the player down (D) and left (L) to position them to push the third box.\n6. Push the third box right (R) onto the goal.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sequence of moves is: LURURDLR.\n\nLet's represent this solution in the required format: \n\n<<<LURURDLR>>>"
