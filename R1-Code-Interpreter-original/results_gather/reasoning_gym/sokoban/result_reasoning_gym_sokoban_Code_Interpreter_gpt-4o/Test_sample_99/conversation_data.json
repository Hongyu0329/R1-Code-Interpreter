    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + + $ X @ % +  \n+ + $ + + @ @ +  \n+ + + + - - - +  \n+ + + $ - - + +  \n+ + + + + X + +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player is currently on a goal (%), and there are several boxes (@) and goals (X) on the board. We need to find a sequence of moves that will place all the boxes on the goals.\n\nLet's work through the solution step by step.\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that all boxes are placed on the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to a position where they can start pushing the boxes.\n2. Push the boxes towards the goals while ensuring that no box gets stuck in a corner or against a wall.\n3.

Move down (D) to push the next box (@) onto the goal (X).\n5. Continue this process until all boxes are on the goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > Upon closer inspection, let's outline a more detailed plan to solve the puzzle:\n\n1.
