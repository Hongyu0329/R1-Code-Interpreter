    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ + + X @ * +  \n+ + + + @ @ +  \n+ + + X - - +  \n+ $ + + + X +  \n+ + + $ + + +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is initially located at position (1, 5). The boxes (@) need to be moved onto the goals (X).\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to plan a sequence of moves that will push all the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the box at (1, 4) onto the goal at (1, 3).\n2. Move the player down to push the box at (2, 4) onto the goal at (3, 3).\n3. Move the player to the left to push the box at (2, 3) onto the goal at (4, 3).\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > Upon closer inspection, I realize that the initial plan needs to be adjusted to account for the correct sequence of moves. Let's carefully plan the moves:\n\n1. Move the player right to push the box at (1, 4) onto the goal at (1, 3).\n2. Move the player down to push the box at (2, 4) onto the goal at (3, 3).\n3.
