    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals, represented by ($).\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + - X - - - +  \n+ X - @ X @ * +  \n+ X @ - - - - +  \n+ + - - - @ - +  \n+ - - - - @ - +  \n+ X @ X - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is initially located at row 2, column 6. We need to plan a sequence of moves to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\nLet's work through the solution step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to a position where they can start pushing the boxes.\n2. Push the boxes one by one onto the goals.\n3. Ensure that the player doesn't get stuck and that all boxes are eventually placed on the goals.\n\nLet's start by moving the player to a position where they can push the first box:\n\n1. Move Left (L) to position the player next to the first box.\n2. Push the first box down (D) onto the goal.\n3. Move the player to the next box and repeat the process.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move Left (L) to position the player next to the first box.\n2. Push the first box Down (D) onto the goal.\n3. Move Right (R) to position the player next to the second box.\n4. Push the second box Down (D) onto the goal.\n5. Move Left (L) to position the player next to the third box.\n6. Push the third box Down (D) onto the goal.\n7. Move Down (D) to position the player next to the fourth box.\n8. Push the fourth box Right (R) onto the goal.\n9. Move Up (U) to position the player next to the fifth box.\n10. Push the fifth box Right (R) onto the goal.\n\nLet's execute these moves in sequence:\n\n- LDDRDLDRUR\n\nThis sequence should solve the puzzle. Let's represent it in the required format:\n\n<<<LDDRDLDRUR>>>"
