    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals, represented by ($).\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle and find a solution:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ - - - - - X +  \n+ - @ X @ - - +  \n+ X - * X - - +  \n+ - @ X X @ - +  \n+ @ - - @ - - +  \n+ - - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is initially located at row 3, column 4. We need to plan a sequence of moves to push all the boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's work through the solution step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Move the player to the left to push the box at (3, 3) onto the goal at (3, 2).\n2. Move the player down to push the box at (5, 2) onto the goal at (4, 2).\n3. Move the player to the right to push the box at (5, 4) onto the goal at (5, 5).\n4. Move the player up to push the box at (2, 4) onto the goal at (1, 5).\n5. Finally, move the player to the left to push the box at (2, 2) onto the goal at (2, 3).\n\nLet's execute these moves in sequence:\n\n- L: Move left\n- D: Move down\n- R: Move right\n- U: Move up\n\nThe sequence of moves is: LDRURDL\n\nLet's represent this solution as a string enclosed within triple angle brackets.\nassistant > The solution to the Sokoban puzzle is:\n\n<<<LDRURDL>>>"
