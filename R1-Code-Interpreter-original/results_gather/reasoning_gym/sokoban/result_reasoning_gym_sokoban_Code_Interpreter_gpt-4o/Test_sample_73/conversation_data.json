    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle and find a solution. \n\nHere's the initial layout:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ - - - - - - - - +  \n+ - $ @ - - @ + + +  \n+ + + X + - X + + +  \n+ + + - - - - $ X +  \n+ + + - - - - @ @ +  \n+ + + $ X + + $ * +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's solve this step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that all boxes are placed on the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the left to push the box on the goal.\n2. Navigate around to push the other boxes onto their respective goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the puzzle:\n\n1.
