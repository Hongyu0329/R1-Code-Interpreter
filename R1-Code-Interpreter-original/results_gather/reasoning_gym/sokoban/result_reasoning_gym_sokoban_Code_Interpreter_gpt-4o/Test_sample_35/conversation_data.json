    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ * $ - - +  \n+ @ @ - - +  \n+ X X + - +  \n+ + + $ - +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is at position (1, 1).\n- There are three boxes: one on a goal ($) at (1, 2), and two at (2, 1) and (2, 2).\n- There are two goals (X) at (3, 1) and (3, 2).\n\nThe goal is to move the boxes onto the goals. Let's find a sequence of moves to achieve this.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the position where it can push the boxes.\n2. Push the boxes onto the goals.\n\nHere's a possible sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move the player right to position (1, 2).\n2. Push the box at (1, 2) down to (2, 2).\n3. Move the player left to position (1, 1).\n4. Move the player down to position (2, 1).\n5. Push the box at (2, 1) down to (3, 1).\n6. Move the player right to position (2, 2).\n7. Push the box at (2, 2) down to (3, 2).\n\nLet's translate these steps into a sequence of moves: RDLDRD.\n\nNow, let's represent this solution as a string of characters enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<RDLDRD>>>"
