    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals, represented by ($).\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ - - - * +  \n+ @ @ @ @ +  \n+ X - - - +  \n+ - - - X +  \n+ X - $ X +  \n+ + - - - +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is initially located at position (1, 4). The boxes (@) are located at positions (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), and (2, 5). The goals (X) are located at positions (3, 1), (5, 1), (5, 5), and (6, 1).\n\nLet's find a sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push each box onto a goal. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to a position where they can start pushing the boxes.\n2. Push each box onto a goal, ensuring that no box gets stuck in a corner or against a wall where it can't be moved further.\n\nHere's a possible sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player to the left of the first box.\n2. Push the first box down onto the goal.\n3. Repeat the process for the remaining boxes.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move left to position (1, 3).\n2. Move left to position (1, 2).\n3. Move down to position (2, 2).\n4. Push the first box down to position (3, 2).\n5. Move down to position (4, 2).\n6. Move right to position (4, 3).\n7. Move up to position (3, 3).\n8. Push the second box down to position (4, 3).\n9. Move down to position (5, 3).\n10. Move right to position (5, 4).\n11. Move up to position (4, 4).\n12. Push the third box down to position (5, 4).\n13. Move down to position (6, 4).\n14. Move right to position (6, 5).\n15. Move up to position (5, 5).\n16. Push the fourth box left to position (5, 4).\n\nNow, let's translate these steps into a sequence of moves: LLDLDRURDDRUURDL.\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n<<<LLDLDRURDDRUURDL>>>"
