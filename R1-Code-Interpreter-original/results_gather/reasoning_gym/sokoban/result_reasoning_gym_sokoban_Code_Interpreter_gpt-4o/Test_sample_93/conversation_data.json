    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The player can only push one box at a time and cannot move through walls (+) or boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ + $ - - - +  \n+ - - - @ - +  \n+ - X - - - +  \n+ @ @ - - - +  \n+ % $ X + + +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player is currently on a goal at position (5, 2). The boxes are at positions (1, 2), (3, 4), and (4, 1), and the goals are at positions (3, 2), (5, 2), and (5, 3).\n\nLet's find a sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to a position where they can push the box at (1, 2) down to the goal at (3, 2).\n2. Move the player to push the box at (4, 1) to the right onto the goal at (5, 2).\n3. Finally, move the player to push the box at (3, 4) down onto the goal at (5, 3).\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move the player to (1, 3) to push the box at (1, 2) down:\n   - Move Up (U) to (4, 2)\n   - Move Up (U) to (3, 2)\n   - Move Up (U) to (2, 2)\n   - Move Left (L) to (2, 1)\n   - Move Up (U) to (1, 1)\n   - Move Right (R) to (1, 2)\n   - Move Down (D) to push the box to (2, 2)\n   - Move Down (D) to push the box to (3, 2)\n\n2. Move the player to (4, 2) to push the box at (4, 1) to the right:\n   - Move Down (D) to (4, 2)\n   - Move Left (L) to (4, 1)\n   - Move Right (R) to push the box to (4, 2)\n   - Move Right (R) to push the box to (4, 3)\n   - Move Down (D) to push the box to (5, 3)\n\n3. Move the player to (3, 4) to push the box at (3, 4) down:\n   - Move Up (U) to (3, 3)\n   - Move Right (R) to (3, 4)\n   - Move Down (D) to push the box to (4, 4)\n   - Move Down (D) to push the box to (5, 4)\n\nLet's compile these moves into a single sequence.\nassistant > Here's the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player to push the box at (1, 2) down to the goal at (3, 2):\n   - UUU\n   - L\n   - U\n   - R\n   - DD\n\n2. Move the player to push the box at (4, 1) to the right onto the goal at (5, 2):\n   - D\n   - L\n   - RR\n   - D\n\n3. Move the player to push the box at (3, 4) down onto the goal at (5, 3):\n   - U\n   - R\n   - DD\n\nCombining these moves, we get the solution:\n\n<<<UUULURDDDLRRDUURDD>>>"
