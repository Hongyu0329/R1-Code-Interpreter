    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ * $ - - - +  \n+ @ - @ X - +  \n+ - - - - - +  \n+ X + - @ X +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is at position (1, 1).\n- There are three boxes (@) at positions (1, 2), (2, 1), and (3, 4).\n- There are three goals (X) at positions (2, 3), (4, 1), and (4, 4).\n\nThe goal is to move the boxes onto the goals. Let's find a sequence of moves to achieve this.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to push the box at (1, 2) onto the goal at (2, 3).\n2. Move the player to push the box at (2, 1) onto the goal at (4, 1).\n3. Move the player to push the box at (3, 4) onto the goal at (4, 4).\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move the player right (R) to (1, 2), then down (D) to (2, 2), and right (R) to push the box onto the goal at (2, 3).\n2. Move the player left (L) to (2, 2), up (U) to (1, 2), left (L) to (1, 1), down (D) to (2, 1), and down (D) to push the box onto the goal at (4, 1).\n3. Move the player up (U) to (3, 1), right (R) to (3, 2), right (R) to (3, 3), down (D) to (4, 3), and right (R) to push the box onto the goal at (4, 4).\n\nLet's write the sequence of moves:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle\nmoves = \"RDRULDDURRRDR\"\n\n# Output the solution in the required format\nsolution = f\"<<<{moves}>>>\"\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the Sokoban puzzle is: <<<RDRULDDURRRDR>>>. \n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully push all the boxes onto their respective goals."
