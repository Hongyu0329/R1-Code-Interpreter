    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ * @ X - - - +  \n+ @ @ $ - - - +  \n+ X - $ - + + +  \n+ + X + + + + +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + + $ $ + + +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is at position (1, 1). The goals (X) are at positions (1, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 3). The boxes (@) are at positions (1, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 2). There are also boxes on goals ($) at positions (2, 3) and (3, 3).\n\nLet's find a sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals without getting stuck. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the box at (1, 2) onto the goal at (1, 3).\n2. Move the player down to push the box at (2, 1) onto the goal at (3, 1).\n3. Finally, move the player to push the remaining box onto the goal at (3, 3).\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move right (R) to push the box at (1, 2) to (1, 3).\n2. Move down (D) to (2, 3).\n3. Move left (L) to (2, 2).\n4. Move down (D) to (3, 2).\n5. Move right (R) to push the box at (3, 2) to (3, 3).\n\nLet's write the solution as a sequence of moves.\nassistant > Here's the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1.
