    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle and find a solution:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ - X - - @ - + + +  \n+ - @ X - - - + + +  \n+ - - - - - - + + +  \n+ - $ - X + - + + +  \n+ - - @ $ + - + + +  \n+ - $ * @ X - $ + +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is located at the bottom row, and there are several boxes (@) and goals (X) scattered throughout the grid. We need to push the boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's work through the solution step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the left to push the box at the bottom row onto the goal.\n2. Navigate the player to push the other boxes onto their respective goals.\n\nHere's a possible sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move left to push the box onto the goal: `L`\n2. Move up to position the player to push the next box: `U`\n3. Move left to push the box onto the goal: `L`\n4. Move down to position the player to push the next box: `D`\n5. Move left to push the box onto the goal: `L`\n6. Move up to position the player to push the next box: `U`\n7. Move left to push the box onto the goal: `L`\n8. Move down to position the player to push the next box: `D`\n9. Move left to push the box onto the goal: `L`\n\nLet's put these moves together into a solution string.\nassistant > After analyzing the puzzle, here is a sequence of moves that should solve it:\n\n1. Move left to push the box onto the goal: `L`\n2. Move up to position the player to push the next box: `U`\n3. Move left to push the box onto the goal: `L`\n4. Move down to position the player to push the next box: `D`\n5. Move left to push the box onto the goal: `L`\n6. Move up to position the player to push the next box: `U`\n7. Move left to push the box onto the goal: `L`\n8. Move down to position the player to push the next box: `D`\n9. Move left to push the box onto the goal: `L`\n\nThe solution string is:\n\n<<<LUULDLULDL>>>"
