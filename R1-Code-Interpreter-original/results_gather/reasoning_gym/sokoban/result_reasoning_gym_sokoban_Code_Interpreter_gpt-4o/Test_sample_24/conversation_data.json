    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the initial state of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ X - @ - $ * + + +  \n+ - @ X - - @ - + +  \n+ - X - @ - - - + +  \n+ - X - - @ - X + +  \n+ - @ - - - - + + +  \n+ - @ X - @ - - - +  \n+ + X - $ - - - - +  \n+ + + + + X - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is located at position (1, 6). The goal is to move the boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that all boxes are placed on the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the left to push the box at (1, 3) onto the goal at (1, 1).\n2. Move the player to the right to push the box at (1, 5) onto the goal at (1, 4).\n3. Move the player down to push the box at (2, 2) onto the goal at (3, 2).\n4. Move the player to the right to push the box at (2, 6) onto the goal at (4, 6).\n5. Move the player down to push the box at (5, 2) onto the goal at (6, 2).\n6. Move the player to the right to push the box at (6, 4) onto the goal at (7, 4).\n7. Move the player down to push the box at (7, 5) onto the goal at (8, 5).\n\nLet's execute these moves and find the solution.\nassistant > Upon further inspection, it seems I need to adjust the approach to solve the puzzle. Let's try a different strategy to find the correct sequence of moves.\n\n1. Move the player to the left to push the box at (1, 3) onto the goal at (1, 1).\n2.
