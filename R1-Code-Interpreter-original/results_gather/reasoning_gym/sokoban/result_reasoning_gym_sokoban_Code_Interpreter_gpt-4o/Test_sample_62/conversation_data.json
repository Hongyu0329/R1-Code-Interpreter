    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the initial configuration:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ - * - - - - - X +  \n+ @ @ @ @ - - @ - +  \n+ - - - - X - $ - +  \n+ X - - - $ X - - +  \n+ X - - - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is at position (1, 2). The goals (X) are at positions (1, 8), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 6), and (5, 1). The boxes (@) are at positions (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), and (3, 6) (which is already on a goal).\n\nLet's find a sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to strategically move the player to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the first box towards the goal.\n2. Continue moving the player to push the boxes one by one onto the goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move right to push the first box: R\n2. Move down and then right to push the second box: DRR\n3. Move up and then right to push the third box: URR\n4. Move down and then left to push the fourth box: DLL\n5.
