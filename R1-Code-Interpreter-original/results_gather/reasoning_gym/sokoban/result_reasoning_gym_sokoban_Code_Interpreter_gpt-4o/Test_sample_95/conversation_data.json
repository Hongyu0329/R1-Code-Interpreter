    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle and find a solution. \n\nHere's the initial layout:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ - + $ + +  \n+ - - - - +  \n+ + - - - +  \n+ + - X $ +  \n+ X @ @ X +  \n+ + + - - +  \n+ X - @ @ +  \n+ + - - * +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's solve this step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to move the player (*) strategically to push the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the position where it can start pushing the boxes.\n2. Push the boxes onto the goals one by one.\n\nLet's start by moving the player to a position where it can push the first box. The player is currently at the bottom of the board. We need to move it up to start pushing the boxes.\n\nHere's a possible sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move the player up to the row with the first box.\n2. Push the first box onto the goal.\n3. Repeat the process for the remaining boxes.\n\nLet's execute these steps.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step solution to the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player up to the row with the first box.\n2. Push the first box onto the goal.\n3. Move to the next box and repeat the process.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n- Move Up (U) to reach the row with the first box.\n- Move Left (L) to position the player to push the box.\n- Push the box Right (R) onto the goal.\n- Move Down (D) to reach the next box.\n- Repeat the process for the remaining boxes.\n\nHere's a possible sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n```\nUURRULDDRRUULLDDRRUURRDDLLUU\n```\n\nLet's format this solution as required:\n\n<<<UURRULDDRRUULLDDRRUURRDDLLUU>>>"
