    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle and find a solution. \n\nHere's the initial layout:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ - - - - - - - - +  \n+ - @ X X - - @ - +  \n+ - $ - @ X - - - +  \n+ - - X - - - - - +  \n+ - $ @ + - - + - +  \n+ - - - X + - - - +  \n+ $ @ @ X - - @ - +  \n+ * - - - - - + X +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's work through the puzzle step by step to find a solution.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that all boxes are placed on the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the nearest box that can be pushed towards a goal.\n2. Push the box onto the goal.\n3. Repeat the process for the remaining boxes.\n\nLet's start by moving the player (*) to the first box and pushing it onto a goal. We'll then continue with the other boxes. \n\nHere's a possible sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the box at (8, 3) onto the goal at (8, 8).\n2. Move the player to the next box and push it onto a goal.\n3. Continue this process until all boxes are on goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find a solution.\nassistant > Let's break down the moves step by step:\n\n1.
