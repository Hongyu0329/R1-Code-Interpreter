    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals, represented by ($).\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle and find a solution step by step.\n\nHere's the initial layout of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ - $ $ X - - @ - +  \n+ - - - - - X @ - +  \n+ - @ X @ @ - X - +  \n+ - @ - - - - - - +  \n+ - @ - X - - $ - +  \n+ - * X - - - - - +  \n+ - - - - - X - - +  \n+ - - - - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's work through the solution.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that all boxes are placed on the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the nearest box that can be pushed towards a goal.\n2. Push the box onto the goal.\n3. Repeat the process for the remaining boxes.\n\nLet's start by moving the player (*) to push the boxes onto the goals (X). I'll provide a sequence of moves to achieve this. \n\nHere's a possible solution:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the box onto the goal.\n2. Move the player to the next box and push it onto the goal.\n3. Continue this process until all boxes are on the goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step solution for the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player right to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Move the player to the next box and push it onto the goal.\n3. Continue this process for the remaining boxes.\n\nLet's translate these steps into a sequence of moves:\n\n- Move right (R) to push the first box onto the goal.\n- Move up (U) and right (R) to position the player to push the next box.\n- Push the box down (D) onto the goal.\n- Move to the next box and push it onto the goal.\n- Repeat until all boxes are on the goals.\n\nHere's the sequence of moves:\n\n```\nRURRDDLLURRDDLURR\n```\n\nLet's format this solution as requested:\n\n<<<RURRDDLLURRDDLURR>>>"
