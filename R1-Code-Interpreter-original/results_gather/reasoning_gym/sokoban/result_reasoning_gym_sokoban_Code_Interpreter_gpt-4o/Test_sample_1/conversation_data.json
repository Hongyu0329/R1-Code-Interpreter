    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). Let's analyze the given puzzle and find a solution.\n\nHere's the initial layout of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ X - - + - - - $ +  \n+ - @ - - - - - + +  \n+ - - X - - X % + +  \n+ - @ - - $ @ @ $ +  \n+ - - - - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player to a position where they can push the boxes onto the goals.\n2. Push the boxes onto the goals in a sequence that doesn't block other boxes or the player.\n3. Ensure all boxes are placed on the goals.\n\nLet's find a solution for this puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that all boxes are placed on the goals without getting stuck. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Move the player to the first box and push it onto the goal.\n2. Navigate around the boxes and walls to reach other boxes.\n3. Push each box onto a goal, ensuring that no box gets stuck in a corner or against a wall.\n\nLet's execute the solution:\n\n1. Move right to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Navigate to the next box and push it onto the goal.\n3. Repeat until all boxes are on goals.\n\nHere's a possible sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n```\nRURRDDLLURRURRDDLLURR\n```\n\nLet's format this solution as required:\n\n<<<RURRDDLLURRURRDDLLURR>>>"
