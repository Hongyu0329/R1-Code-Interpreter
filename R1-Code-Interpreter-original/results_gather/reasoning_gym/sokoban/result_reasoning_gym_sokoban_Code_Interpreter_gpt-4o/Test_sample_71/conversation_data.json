    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). Let's analyze the given puzzle and find a solution.\n\nHere's the initial layout of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ - - - - - +  \n+ - - @ - - +  \n+ - - - - X +  \n+ X @ - X - +  \n+ - @ * @ - +  \n+ - - X @ X +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push all the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player (*) to the right to push the box (@) onto the goal (X).\n2. Navigate the player to push the remaining boxes onto their respective goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find a solution.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player right (R) to push the box onto the goal.\n2. Move the player down (D) to position for the next box.\n3. Move the player left (L) to push the next box.\n4. Move the player up (U) to position for the next box.\n5. Move the player right (R) to push the box onto the goal.\n6. Move the player down (D) to position for the next box.\n7. Move the player right (R) to push the box onto the goal.\n8. Move the player up (U) to position for the next box.\n9. Move the player left (L) to push the box onto the goal.\n\nLet's execute these moves and see if they solve the puzzle.\nassistant > Let's execute the moves step by step to solve the puzzle:\n\n1.

L (Left)\n\nLet's see if this sequence solves the puzzle.\nassistant > Upon reviewing the puzzle, I realize that the initial plan needs to be adjusted to ensure all boxes are placed on the goals correctly. Let's carefully plan the moves again:\n\n1. Move the player right (R) to push the box onto the goal.\n2. Move the player down (D) to position for the next box.\n3. Move the player left (L) to push the next box.\n4. Move the player up (U) to position for the next box.\n5. Move the player right (R) to push the box onto the goal.\n6.

We need to carefully plan the moves to ensure all boxes are placed on the goals correctly. Here's a revised plan:\n\n1. Move the player left (L) to position for the first box.\n2. Move the player up (U) to push the first box onto the goal.\n3. Move the player right (R) to position for the next box.\n4. Move the player down (D) to push the next box onto the goal.\n5.
