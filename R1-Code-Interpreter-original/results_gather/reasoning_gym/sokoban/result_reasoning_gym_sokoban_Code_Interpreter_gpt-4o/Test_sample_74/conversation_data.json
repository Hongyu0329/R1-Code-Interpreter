    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player and boxes to achieve a state where all boxes are placed on goals. Let's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + +  \n+ - X - - - @ % +  \n+ - - - - - @ @ +  \n+ - - @ - - + X +  \n+ + + X $ - + + +  \n+ + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player is currently on a goal (`%`).\n- There are three boxes (`@`) and one box on a goal (`$`).\n- There are two goals (`X`).\n\nThe goal is to move all boxes onto the goals. Let's find a sequence of moves to achieve this. \n\nI'll work through the puzzle step by step to find a solution.\nassistant > Let's break down the puzzle and find a solution step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player is on a goal (`%`) at position (1, 7).\n   - There are three boxes (`@`) at positions (1, 6), (2, 6), and (2, 7).\n   - There is one box on a goal (`$`) at position (3, 4).\n   - There are two goals (`X`) at positions (1, 2) and (3, 3).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move the player to push the boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's execute the plan:\n\n- Move the player to the left to push the box at (1, 6) to the left.\n- Move the player down to push the box at (2, 6) down.\n- Move the player to the right to push the box at (2, 7) to the right.\n- Finally, move the player to push the box at (3, 4) onto the goal.\n\nLet's find the sequence of moves to achieve this.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, let's outline the sequence of moves:\n\n1. **Move the player to the left to push the box at (1, 6) to the left:**\n   - Move left (L) to position (1, 6).\n   - Push the box left (L) to position (1, 5).\n\n2. **Move the player down to push the box at (2, 6) down:**\n   - Move down (D) to position (2, 6).\n   - Push the box down (D) to position (3, 6).\n\n3. **Move the player to the right to push the box at (2, 7) to the right:**\n   - Move right (R) to position (2, 7).\n   - Push the box right (R) to position (2, 8).\n\n4. **Move the player to push the box at (3, 4) onto the goal:**\n   - Move left (L) to position (3, 4).\n   - Push the box left (L) to position (3, 3).\n\nLet's compile these moves into a single sequence.\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is as follows:\n\n1. Move left (L) to push the box at (1, 6) to the left.\n2. Move down (D) to push the box at (2, 6) down.\n3. Move right (R) to push the box at (2, 7) to the right.\n4. Move left (L) to push the box at (3, 4) onto the goal.\n\nThe complete sequence of moves is:\n\n<<<LLDRRLL>>>"
