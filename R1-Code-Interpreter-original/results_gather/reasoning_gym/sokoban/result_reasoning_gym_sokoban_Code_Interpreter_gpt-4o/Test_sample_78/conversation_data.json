    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + +  \n+ X - * - - - - +  \n+ - - @ X - @ @ +  \n+ - - - + + - - +  \n+ + + $ $ X @ - +  \n+ + + + + + - X +  \n+ + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is initially located at position (1, 3).\n- There are four boxes (@) located at positions (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 7), and (4, 7).\n- There are four goals (X) located at positions (1, 1), (2, 4), (4, 5), and (5, 7).\n\nLet's find a sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that all boxes are placed on the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the first box at (2, 3) and push it to the goal at (2, 4).\n2. Move the player to the second box at (2, 6) and push it to the goal at (1, 1).\n3. Move the player to the third box at (2, 7) and push it to the goal at (4, 5).\n4. Finally, move the player to the fourth box at (4, 7) and push it to the goal at (5, 7).\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the sequence of moves.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player to the first box at (2, 3) and push it to the goal at (2, 4):\n   - Move Right (R) to (1, 4)\n   - Move Down (D) to (2, 4)\n   - Move Left (L) to (2, 3)\n   - Push Right (R) to (2, 4)\n\n2. Move the player to the second box at (2, 6) and push it to the goal at (1, 1):\n   - Move Right (R) to (2, 5)\n   - Move Right (R) to (2, 6)\n   - Move Up (U) to (1, 6)\n   - Move Left (L) to (1, 5)\n   - Move Left (L) to (1, 4)\n   - Move Left (L) to (1, 3)\n   - Move Left (L) to (1, 2)\n   - Move Down (D) to (2, 2)\n   - Move Right (R) to (2, 3)\n   - Move Right (R) to (2, 4)\n   - Move Right (R) to (2, 5)\n   - Move Right (R) to (2, 6)\n   - Push Up (U) to (1, 6)\n   - Move Left (L) to (1, 5)\n   - Move Left (L) to (1, 4)\n   - Move Left (L) to (1, 3)\n   - Move Left (L) to (1, 2)\n   - Move Left (L) to (1, 1)\n\n3. Move the player to the third box at (2, 7) and push it to the goal at (4, 5):\n   - Move Down (D) to (2, 1)\n   - Move Right (R) to (2, 2)\n   - Move Right (R) to (2, 3)\n   - Move Right (R) to (2, 4)\n   - Move Right (R) to (2, 5)\n   - Move Right (R) to (2, 6)\n   - Move Right (R) to (2, 7)\n   - Push Down (D) to (3, 7)\n   - Move Down (D) to (4, 7)\n   - Move Left (L) to (4, 6)\n   - Move Left (L) to (4, 5)\n\n4. Finally, move the player to the fourth box at (4, 7) and push it to the goal at (5, 7):\n   - Move Right (R) to (4, 6)\n   - Move Right (R) to (4, 7)\n   - Push Down (D) to (5, 7)\n\nLet's compile these moves into a single sequence.\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is as follows:\n\n1. RDRL (to push the first box to the goal at (2, 4))\n2. RRRULLLLDRRRRRULLLL (to push the second box to the goal at (1, 1))\n3. DRRRRRDLD (to push the third box to the goal at (4, 5))\n4. RR (to push the fourth box to the goal at (5, 7))\n\nCombining these moves, we get the complete solution:\n\n<<<RDRLRRRULLLLDRRRRRULLLLDRRRRRDLDRR>>>"
