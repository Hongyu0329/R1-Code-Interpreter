    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The player can only push one box at a time and cannot move through walls (+) or boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle and find a solution:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ - - X @ - +  \n+ - - @ - - +  \n+ X @ $ - - +  \n+ - - - - - +  \n+ - * @ X X +  \n+ - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is located at position (5, 3). The goal is to move the boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the left to position (5, 2).\n2. Push the box at (5, 3) to the right onto the goal at (5, 4).\n3. Move the player around to push the other boxes onto their respective goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step solution to the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player left to position (5, 2).\n2. Move the player up to position (4, 2).\n3. Move the player left to position (4, 1).\n4. Move the player down to position (5, 1).\n5. Move the player right to position (5, 2).\n6. Push the box at (5, 3) to the right onto the goal at (5, 4).\n7. Move the player up to position (4, 3).\n8. Move the player right to position (4, 4).\n9. Push the box at (4, 3) down to position (5, 3).\n10. Move the player left to position (5, 2).\n11. Move the player up to position (4, 2).\n12. Move the player right to position (4, 3).\n13. Push the box at (4, 4) right to position (4, 5).\n14. Move the player down to position (5, 5).\n15. Move the player right to position (5, 6).\n16. Push the box at (5, 5) up to position (4, 5).\n\nLet's translate these steps into a sequence of moves:\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is as follows:\n\n- L (Left)\n- U (Up)\n- L (Left)\n- D (Down)\n- R (Right)\n- R (Right)\n- U (Up)\n- R (Right)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- U (Up)\n- R (Right)\n- R (Right)\n- D (Down)\n- R (Right)\n- U (Up)\n\nThus, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LULDRRURDLURRDRU>>>"
