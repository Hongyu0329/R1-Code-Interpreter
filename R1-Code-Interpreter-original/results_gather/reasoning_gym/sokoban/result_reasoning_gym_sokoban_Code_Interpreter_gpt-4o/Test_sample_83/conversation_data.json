    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. Let's analyze the given puzzle and find a solution.\n\nHere's the initial layout of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + + $ * $ + +  \n+ - - - @ - + +  \n+ - @ - X - $ +  \n+ - - + + + + +  \n+ - - X + + + +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's solve this step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push all the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the box onto the goal.\n2. Move the player down to push the next box.\n3. Continue moving the player to push the remaining boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step solution to the puzzle:\n\n1. Move Right (R) to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Move Down (D) to position the player to push the next box.\n3. Move Left (L) to push the second box.\n4. Move Down (D) to position the player to push the third box.\n5. Move Right (R) to push the third box onto the goal.\n6. Move Up (U) to position the player to push the last box.\n7.
