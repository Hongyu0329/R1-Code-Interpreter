    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ * - - - +  \n+ - @ - $ +  \n+ - @ X X +  \n+ - @ - X +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is at position (1, 1).\n- There are three boxes (@) at positions (2, 2), (3, 2), and (4, 2).\n- There are three goals (X) at positions (3, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 4).\n- One box is already on a goal ($) at position (2, 4).\n\nThe player needs to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's find a sequence of moves to solve this puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals without getting stuck. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Move the player to the position where it can push the box at (2, 2) to the right.\n2. Push the box at (2, 2) to the right onto the goal at (3, 3).\n3. Move the player to the position where it can push the box at (3, 2) to the right.\n4. Push the box at (3, 2) to the right onto the goal at (3, 4).\n5. Move the player to the position where it can push the box at (4, 2) to the right.\n6. Push the box at (4, 2) to the right onto the goal at (4, 4).\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the sequence of moves.\nassistant > Here's a possible sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player down to (2, 1).\n2. Move the player right to (2, 2).\n3. Push the box at (2, 2) right to (2, 3).\n4. Move the player right to (2, 3).\n5. Push the box at (2, 3) right to (2, 4).\n6. Move the player down to (3, 3).\n7. Move the player left to (3, 2).\n8. Push the box at (3, 2) right to (3, 3).\n9. Move the player down to (4, 2).\n10. Push the box at (4, 2) right to (4, 3).\n11. Move the player right to (4, 3).\n12. Push the box at (4, 3) right to (4, 4).\n\nThe sequence of moves is: DRRURRDDLLDRR.\n\nLet's represent this sequence in the required format: \n\n<<<DRRURRDDLLDRR>>>"
