    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ - - - - - - - - +  \n+ - X - $ $ - @ - +  \n+ - - - X X X - - +  \n+ + X - @ @ @ @ * +  \n+ + - - - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is located at the bottom right corner. There are several boxes (@) and goals (X) scattered throughout the puzzle. The boxes on goals are represented by ($).\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that all boxes are placed on the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the left to position them behind the first box.\n2. Push the box onto the goal.\n3. Repeat the process for the remaining boxes, ensuring that each box is pushed onto a goal.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move left to position the player behind the first box.\n2.
