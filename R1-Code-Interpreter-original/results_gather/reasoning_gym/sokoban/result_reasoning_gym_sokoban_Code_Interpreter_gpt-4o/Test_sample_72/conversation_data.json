    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + +  \n+ - - - - - - X +  \n+ @ - - - X $ - +  \n+ % @ - - - @ - +  \n+ @ - - - @ X - +  \n+ - @ - - - X X +  \n+ X + - - - - @ +  \n+ - - - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player is currently on a goal (%), and there are several boxes (@) and goals (X) scattered throughout the grid. The objective is to move the player and push the boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that all boxes are placed on the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to a position where they can start pushing the boxes.\n2. Push the boxes towards the goals, ensuring that no box gets stuck in a corner or against a wall where it cannot be moved further.\n3. Continue moving and pushing until all boxes are on the goals.\n\nLet's start by moving the player to a position where they can begin pushing the boxes. The player is currently on a goal, so we need to move them off the goal to start pushing the boxes.\n\nHere's a possible sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player down (D) to get off the goal.\n2. Move right (R) to position the player to push the first box.\n3. Push the first box down (D) onto the goal.\n4. Move the player to push the next box.\n5. Continue this process until all boxes are on the goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step solution to the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player down (D) to get off the goal.\n2. Move right (R) to position the player to push the first box.\n3. Push the first box down (D) onto the goal.\n4. Move left (L) and up (U) to position the player to push the next box.\n5. Push the second box right (R) onto the goal.\n6. Move down (D) and right (R) to position the player to push the third box.\n7. Push the third box up (U) onto the goal.\n8. Move left (L) and down (D) to position the player to push the fourth box.\n9. Push the fourth box right (R) onto the goal.\n10. Move up (U) and right (R) to position the player to push the fifth box.\n11. Push the fifth box down (D) onto the goal.\n12. Move left (L) and up (U) to position the player to push the sixth box.\n13. Push the sixth box right (R) onto the goal.\n\nThe sequence of moves is: DRDLURRULDRURDLUR.\n\nLet's represent this solution as a string of characters enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<DRDLURRULDRURDLUR>>>"
