    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The player can only push one box at a time and cannot move through walls (+).\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ X + $ X @ * +  \n+ - - - - - @ +  \n+ @ - $ - - - +  \n+ - - - - - X +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is initially at position (1, 6).\n- There are three boxes (@) at positions (1, 5), (2, 6), and (3, 1).\n- There are three goals (X) at positions (1, 1), (1, 4), and (4, 6).\n\nThe goal is to move all boxes onto the goals. Let's find a sequence of moves to achieve this.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that each box is pushed onto a goal without getting stuck. Let's outline a possible sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the box at (1, 5) onto the goal at (1, 4).\n2. Move the player down to push the box at (2, 6) onto the goal at (1, 1).\n3. Move the player to the left to push the box at (3, 1) onto the goal at (4, 6).\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move Right (R) to push the box at (1, 5) onto the goal at (1, 4).\n2. Move Down (D) to push the box at (2, 6) onto the goal at (1, 1).\n3. Move Left (L) to push the box at (3, 1) onto the goal at (4, 6).\n\nLet's translate these steps into a sequence of moves.\nassistant > Upon further analysis, the initial plan needs adjustment to ensure all boxes are placed on goals without getting stuck. Let's break down the steps more carefully:\n\n1. Move the player to the left to push the box at (1, 5) onto the goal at (1, 4).\n2. Move the player down and around to push the box at (2, 6) onto the goal at (1, 1).\n3. Finally, move the player to push the box at (3, 1) onto the goal at (4, 6).\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move Left (L) to push the box at (1, 5) onto the goal at (1, 4).\n2. Move Down (D), Left (L), Up (U), Right (R), and Down (D) to push the box at (2, 6) onto the goal at (1, 1).\n3. Move Down (D), Left (L), Up (U), Right (R), and Down (D) to push the box at (3, 1) onto the goal at (4, 6).\n\nLet's translate these steps into a sequence of moves.\nassistant > Let's carefully plan the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move Left (L) to push the box at (1, 5) onto the goal at (1, 4).\n2. Move Down (D) to position the player below the box at (2, 6).\n3. Move Right (R) to push the box at (2, 6) onto the goal at (1, 1).\n4. Move Down (D) to position the player below the box at (3, 1).\n5. Move Left (L) to push the box at (3, 1) onto the goal at (4, 6).\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. L (Left)\n2. D (Down)\n3. R (Right)\n4. D (Down)\n5.
