    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle and find a solution. \n\nHere's the initial layout:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ $ + + + X - @ - +  \n+ + + + + X @ @ - +  \n+ X + + X - - X - +  \n+ - + X @ - - X - +  \n+ @ - - X @ - - - +  \n+ - - - @ - @ - - +  \n+ - - - - - - * - +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's work through the puzzle step by step to find a solution.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that all boxes are placed on the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the nearest box that can be pushed towards a goal.\n2. Push the box onto the goal.\n3. Repeat the process for the remaining boxes.\n\nLet's start by moving the player (*) to the first box (@) that can be pushed onto a goal (X). We'll then continue with the other boxes. \n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Move the player right (R) to position the player next to the box.\n2. Push the box up (U) onto the goal.\n3. Move the player down (D) and left (L) to reach the next box.\n4. Push the box right (R) onto the goal.\n5. Continue this process for the remaining boxes.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the sequence of moves.\nassistant > After analyzing the puzzle, here's a sequence of moves that should solve it:\n\n1.
