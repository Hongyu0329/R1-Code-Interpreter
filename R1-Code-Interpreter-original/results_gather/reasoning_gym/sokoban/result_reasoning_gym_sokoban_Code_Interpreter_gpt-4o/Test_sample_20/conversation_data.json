    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ X X @ - @ - +  \n+ - - X X @ - +  \n+ - - - $ @ - +  \n+ - * - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nWe need to move the player (*) to push the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). Let's find a solution step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player (*) to the right to push the box (@) into the goal (X).\n2. Continue moving the player to push the remaining boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move right (R) to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Move up (U) to position the player to push the next box.\n3. Move right (R) to push the second box onto the goal.\n4. Move down (D) to position the player to push the next box.\n5. Move right (R) to push the third box onto the goal.\n6. Move up (U) to position the player to push the last box.\n7. Move right (R) to push the last box onto the goal.\n\nLet's write down the sequence of moves: \n\n- RURDRUR\n\nNow, let's format the solution as required:\n\n<<<RURDRUR>>>"
