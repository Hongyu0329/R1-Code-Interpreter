    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ X - - X + + +  \n+ - - - X @ - +  \n+ @ @ @ X $ - +  \n+ * - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is located at (4, 1).\n- There are four boxes (@) and one box on a goal ($).\n- There are four goals (X) in total.\n\nThe goal is to move all boxes onto the goals. Let's find a solution step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to position (4, 2).\n2. Move the player up to position (3, 2).\n3. Push the box at (3, 3) to the right onto the goal at (3, 4).\n4. Move the player down to position (4, 3).\n5. Move the player left to position (4, 2).\n6. Move the player up to position (3, 2).\n7. Move the player up to position (2, 2).\n8. Push the box at (2, 3) to the right onto the goal at (2, 4).\n9. Move the player down to position (3, 3).\n10. Move the player down to position (4, 3).\n11. Move the player right to position (4, 4).\n12. Move the player up to position (3, 4).\n13. Push the box at (3, 5) to the right onto the goal at (3, 6).\n14. Move the player down to position (4, 5).\n15. Move the player left to position (4, 4).\n16. Move the player up to position (3, 4).\n17. Move the player up to position (2, 4).\n18. Push the box at (2, 5) to the right onto the goal at (2, 6).\n\nLet's translate these steps into a sequence of moves:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the sequence of moves based on the plan\nmoves = \"RURRDLUURRDDLURRULURR\"\n\n# Output the solution in the required format\nsolution = f\"<<<{moves}>>>\"\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the Sokoban puzzle is: <<<RURRDLUURRDDLURRULURR>>>. \n\nThis sequence of moves will guide the player to push all the boxes onto the goals."
