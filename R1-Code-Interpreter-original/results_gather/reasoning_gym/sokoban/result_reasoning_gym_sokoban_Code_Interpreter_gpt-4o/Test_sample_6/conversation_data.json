    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle and find a solution step by step. \n\nHere's the initial layout:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + +  \n+ $ + + - X - * +  \n+ + + + - - - - +  \n+ - - X - @ X - +  \n+ - - X - @ @ - +  \n+ - - $ - - - - +  \n+ - $ $ - @ - - +  \n+ - - - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's work through the solution.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that all boxes are placed on the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the box on the goal to the right.\n2. Move the player down to push the box below onto the goal.\n3. Continue moving the player to push the remaining boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step solution to the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player right (R) to push the box on the goal to the right.\n2. Move down (D) to position the player to push the next box.\n3. Move left (L) to push the box onto the goal.\n4. Move down (D) to position the player to push the next box.\n5. Move right (R) to push the box onto the goal.\n6. Move up (U) to position the player to push the next box.\n7. Move right (R) to push the box onto the goal.\n8. Move down (D) to position the player to push the next box.\n9. Move left (L) to push the box onto the goal.\n\nLet's put these moves together into a solution string.\nassistant > The solution to the puzzle, represented as a sequence of moves, is as follows:\n\n<<<RDLDRURDL>>>"
