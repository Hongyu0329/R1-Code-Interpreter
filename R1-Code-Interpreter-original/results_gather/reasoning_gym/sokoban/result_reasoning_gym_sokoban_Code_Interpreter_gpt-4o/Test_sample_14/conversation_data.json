    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ X - - - +  \n+ + - - - +  \n+ - - @ - +  \n+ - - - - +  \n+ - X @ - +  \n+ $ $ - - +  \n+ * @ X - +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is located at the bottom row, second from the left. There are three boxes (@) and three goals (X). The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's find a solution for this puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the box onto the goal.\n2. Move the player up to position the player to push the next box.\n3. Push the second box onto the goal.\n4. Move the player to the left and up to push the third box onto the goal.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move Right (R) to push the box onto the goal.\n2. Move Up (U) to position the player.\n3. Move Left (L) to push the second box onto the goal.\n4. Move Up (U) to position the player.\n5. Move Right (R) to push the third box onto the goal.\n\nThe sequence of moves is: RULUR\n\nLet's represent this solution in the required format: \n\n<<<RULUR>>>"
