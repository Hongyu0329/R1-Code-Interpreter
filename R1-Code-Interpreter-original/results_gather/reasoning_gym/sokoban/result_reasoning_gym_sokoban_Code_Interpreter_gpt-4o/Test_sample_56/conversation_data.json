    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + +  \n+ - - - + X - $ +  \n+ X - - + $ - * +  \n+ - - @ - - X - +  \n+ @ $ - - - @ - +  \n+ - - - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is initially at position (2, 6).\n- There are three boxes (@) and one box already on a goal ($).\n- There are three goals (X) and one goal already occupied by a box ($).\n\nThe strategy is to move the player to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's find a solution step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the position where they can push the box at (3, 3) to the goal at (1, 5).\n2. Move the player to push the box at (4, 2) to the goal at (2, 1).\n3. Finally, move the player to push the box at (4, 6) to the goal at (3, 6).\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move the player to (3, 3) and push the box to (1, 5):\n   - Move left (L) to (2, 5)\n   - Move up (U) to (2, 4)\n   - Move left (L) to (2, 3)\n   - Move down (D) to (3, 3)\n   - Push the box up (U) to (2, 3)\n   - Move up (U) to (1, 3)\n   - Push the box right (R) to (1, 4)\n   - Push the box right (R) to (1, 5)\n\n2. Move the player to (4, 2) and push the box to (2, 1):\n   - Move down (D) to (2, 3)\n   - Move left (L) to (2, 2)\n   - Move down (D) to (3, 2)\n   - Move down (D) to (4, 2)\n   - Push the box up (U) to (3, 2)\n   - Move up (U) to (2, 2)\n   - Push the box left (L) to (2, 1)\n\n3. Move the player to (4, 6) and push the box to (3, 6):\n   - Move right (R) to (2, 2)\n   - Move right (R) to (2, 3)\n   - Move right (R) to (2, 4)\n   - Move right (R) to (2, 5)\n   - Move down (D) to (3, 5)\n   - Move down (D) to (4, 5)\n   - Move right (R) to (4, 6)\n   - Push the box up (U) to (3, 6)\n\nLet's compile these moves into a single string of characters.\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is as follows:\n\n1. Move the player to push the first box to the goal:\n   - LUUURR\n\n2. Move the player to push the second box to the goal:\n   - DDDLU\n\n3. Move the player to push the third box to the goal:\n   - RRRRDDRU\n\nCombining these moves, the complete solution is:\n\n<<<LUUURRDDDLURRRRDDRU>>>"
