    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ X - - - +  \n+ - @ - $ +  \n+ - $ + + +  \n+ - @ X - +  \n+ - * $ - +  \n+ - - - - +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is at position (5, 3).\n- There are three boxes (@) at positions (2, 2), (3, 2), and (4, 2).\n- There are three goals (X) at positions (1, 1), (4, 3), and (5, 4).\n\nLet's find a sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to position (4, 2) to push the box at (3, 2) down to (4, 2).\n2. Push the box at (4, 2) to the right onto the goal at (4, 3).\n3. Move the player to position (2, 2) to push the box at (2, 2) down to (3, 2).\n4. Push the box at (3, 2) down to (4, 2).\n5. Push the box at (4, 2) down to (5, 2).\n6. Push the box at (5, 2) to the right onto the goal at (5, 3).\n7. Move the player to position (1, 2) to push the box at (1, 2) to the right onto the goal at (1, 1).\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the sequence of moves.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step solution to the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player down to push the box at (3, 2) down to (4, 2).\n2. Move the player right to push the box at (4, 2) onto the goal at (4, 3).\n3. Move the player up to push the box at (2, 2) down to (3, 2).\n4. Move the player down to push the box at (3, 2) down to (4, 2).\n5. Move the player down to push the box at (4, 2) down to (5, 2).\n6. Move the player right to push the box at (5, 2) onto the goal at (5, 3).\n7. Move the player up to push the box at (1, 2) right onto the goal at (1, 1).\n\nThe sequence of moves is: DRRULDDRRUUL.\n\nLet's write this sequence in the required format: \n\n<<<DRRULDDRRUUL>>>"
