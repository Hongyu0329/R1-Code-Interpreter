    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). Let's analyze the given puzzle and find a solution.\n\nHere's the initial layout of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ - X - - X +  \n+ - @ @ - - +  \n+ X @ - X - +  \n+ - - - - + +  \n+ - - - - $ +  \n+ - @ - - + +  \n+ - - - - $ +  \n+ - X - @ * +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's work through the puzzle step by step to find a solution.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push all the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player (*) to a position where it can start pushing the boxes.\n2. Push the boxes (@) onto the goals (X) one by one.\n3. Ensure that no box is pushed into a corner or a position where it cannot be moved further.\n\nLet's start by moving the player to the first box and begin solving the puzzle. I'll provide a sequence of moves to achieve this.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step solution to the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player to the first box.\n2. Push the boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move the player left to the first box: L\n2. Push the first box up onto the goal: U\n3. Move the player right and then up to the next box: RRU\n4. Push the second box left onto the goal: L\n5. Move the player down and then left to the next box: DDL\n6. Push the third box up onto the goal: U\n7. Move the player right and then down to the next box: RRD\n8. Push the fourth box left onto the goal: L\n9. Move the player down and then right to the last box: DDR\n10. Push the last box up onto the goal: U\n\nLet's compile these moves into a single string.\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is as follows:\n\n1. Move left to the first box: L\n2. Push the first box up onto the goal: U\n3. Move right and then up to the next box: RRU\n4. Push the second box left onto the goal: L\n5. Move down and then left to the next box: DDL\n6. Push the third box up onto the goal: U\n7. Move right and then down to the next box: RRD\n8. Push the fourth box left onto the goal: L\n9. Move down and then right to the last box: DDR\n10. Push the last box up onto the goal: U\n\nCombining these moves, the solution is:\n\n<<<LUURRULDDLUURRDLDDRU>>>"
