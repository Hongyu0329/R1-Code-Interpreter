    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle and find a solution step by step.\n\nHere's the initial layout of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + +  \n+ - - - - X + + +  \n+ - - - - @ X + +  \n+ + - - @ X $ + +  \n+ + - + - - + + +  \n+ + - $ + @ $ X +  \n+ + + + - - + @ +  \n+ + + X - - @ * +  \n+ + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's solve this puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push all the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the left to push the box into the goal.\n2. Navigate around the boxes and walls to position the player to push the remaining boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move left (L) to push the box into the goal.\n2. Move up (U) and left (L) to position the player to push the next box.\n3. Continue moving and pushing boxes until all are on goals.\n\nLet's find the sequence of moves.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step solution to the puzzle:\n\n1. Move left (L) to push the box into the goal.\n2. Move up (U) to get around the box.\n3. Move left (L) to position the player.\n4. Move down (D) to push the next box.\n5. Move right (R) to get around the box.\n6. Move down (D) to position the player.\n7. Move left (L) to push the box into the goal.\n8. Move up (U) to get around the box.\n9. Move left (L) to position the player.\n10. Move down (D) to push the next box.\n11. Move right (R) to get around the box.\n12. Move down (D) to position the player.\n13.
