    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. Let's analyze the given puzzle and find a solution.\n\nHere's the initial layout of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + + + $ + + +  \n+ + X + + $ + +  \n+ X - $ + + + +  \n+ - @ + + + + +  \n+ - - - $ + + +  \n+ @ - - - - + +  \n+ * @ - X + + +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push all the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player (*) to the right to push the box (@) onto the goal (X).\n2. Navigate the player to push the remaining boxes onto their respective goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player down (D) to position the player to push the box.\n2. Move right (R) to push the box onto the goal.\n3. Move up (U) to reposition the player.\n4. Move left (L) to get behind the next box.\n5. Move down (D) to push the box.\n6. Move right (R) to push the box onto the goal.\n7. Repeat similar steps for the remaining boxes.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > Let's execute the plan and find the solution to the puzzle. I'll simulate the moves and provide the sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle.\nassistant > After analyzing the puzzle, here's a sequence of moves that should solve it:\n\n1. Move the player down (D) to get behind the first box.\n2. Move right (R) to push the first box onto the goal.\n3. Move up (U) to reposition the player.\n4. Move left (L) to get behind the second box.\n5. Move down (D) to push the second box.\n6. Move right (R) to push the second box onto the goal.\n7. Move up (U) to reposition the player.\n8. Move left (L) to get behind the third box.\n9. Move down (D) to push the third box.\n10. Move right (R) to push the third box onto the goal.\n\nLet's write this sequence of moves in the required format:\n\n<<<DRULDRURDLDR>>>"
