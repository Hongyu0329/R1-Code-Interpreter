    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The player can only push one box at a time and cannot move through walls (+) or boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ - - - @ X +  \n+ - - - @ - +  \n+ - @ - X - +  \n+ - X - @ - +  \n+ - - % $ + +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player is currently on a goal, represented by `%`. The goal is to move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that all boxes are placed on the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to a position where they can start pushing the boxes.\n2. Push the boxes onto the goals one by one, ensuring that no box gets stuck in a corner or against a wall where it cannot be moved further.\n\nLet's execute the solution step by step:\n\n1. Move the player to the left to get off the goal: `L`\n2. Move up to push the box down: `U`\n3. Move right to push the box onto the goal: `R`\n4. Move down to push the next box up: `D`\n5. Move left to push the box onto the goal: `L`\n6. Move up to push the next box down: `U`\n7. Move right to push the box onto the goal: `R`\n8. Move down to push the last box up: `D`\n9. Move left to push the box onto the goal: `L`\n\nLet's see if this sequence of moves solves the puzzle.\nassistant > Upon reviewing the puzzle, it seems I made an error in the initial analysis. Let's re-evaluate the puzzle and find a correct sequence of moves to solve it.\n\nThe player is currently on a goal, represented by `%`. The goal is to move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. Move the player to the left to get off the goal: `L`\n2. Move up to push the box down: `U`\n3.
