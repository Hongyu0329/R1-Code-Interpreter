    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ + + X @ * +  \n+ + X X @ - +  \n+ + + + @ - +  \n+ + $ + - - +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is located at position (1, 5). The goals (X) are at positions (1, 3), (2, 3), and (2, 4). The boxes (@) are at positions (1, 4), (2, 5), and (3, 4). One box is already on a goal ($) at position (4, 3).\n\nLet's find a sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the left to push the box at (1, 4) onto the goal at (1, 3).\n2. Move the player down to push the box at (2, 5) onto the goal at (2, 4).\n3. Finally, move the player to push the remaining box at (3, 4) onto the goal at (2, 3).\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move left (L) to push the box at (1, 4) onto the goal at (1, 3).\n2. Move down (D) to push the box at (2, 5) onto the goal at (2, 4).\n3. Move left (L) to position the player to push the box at (3, 4).\n4. Move up (U) to push the box at (3, 4) onto the goal at (2, 3).\n\nLet's write the solution as a sequence of moves.\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is as follows:\n\n1. Move left (L) to push the box at (1, 4) onto the goal at (1, 3).\n2. Move down (D) to push the box at (2, 5) onto the goal at (2, 4).\n3. Move left (L) to position the player to push the box at (3, 4).\n4. Move up (U) to push the box at (3, 4) onto the goal at (2, 3).\n\nThe solution in terms of moves is:\n\n<<<LDLU>>>"
