    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle and find a solution. \n\nHere's the initial layout:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ - - - X - - - $ +  \n+ - - @ - @ - - + +  \n+ - X - - X - @ X +  \n+ - - - - - - $ @ +  \n+ - - - - - - $ * +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is located at the bottom right corner. We need to move the player to push the boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\nLet's find a sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Move the player left to get behind the box in the bottom row.\n2. Push the box up onto the goal.\n3. Move around to push the other boxes onto their respective goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move left (L) to get behind the box.\n2. Move up (U) to push the box onto the goal.\n3. Move right (R) and up (U) to get behind the next box.\n4. Push the box left (L) onto the goal.\n5. Move down (D) and left (L) to get behind the next box.\n6. Push the box up (U) onto the goal.\n7. Move right (R) and up (U) to get behind the last box.\n8. Push the box left (L) onto the goal.\n\nLet's write the sequence of moves: \n\n- LUUURULDLUURUL\n\nNow, let's format the solution as required:\n\n<<<LUUURULDLUURUL>>>"
