    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The player can only push one box at a time and cannot move through walls (+).\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ - @ - X +  \n+ - $ - + +  \n+ X @ X - +  \n+ - @ - - +  \n+ - @ X * +  \n+ - - - - +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is located at the bottom right corner. We need to find a sequence of moves to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the left to position them to push the box.\n2. Push the box onto the goal.\n3. Repeat the process for the remaining boxes.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move the player left to position them to push the box:\n   - Move left (L) to get next to the box.\n\n2. Push the box onto the goal:\n   - Move left (L) to push the box onto the goal.\n\n3.
