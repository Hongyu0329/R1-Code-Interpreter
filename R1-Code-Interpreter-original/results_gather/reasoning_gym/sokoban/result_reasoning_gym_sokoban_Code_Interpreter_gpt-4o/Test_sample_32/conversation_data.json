    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The solution will be a sequence of these moves.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + +  \n+ - X - * - - - +  \n+ $ @ - - + $ - +  \n+ - - - - + $ - +  \n+ - - - X @ - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is initially located at (1, 4).\n- There are three boxes (@) located at (2, 2), (2, 6), and (3, 6).\n- There are two goals (X) located at (1, 2) and (4, 4).\n\nThe objective is to move the boxes onto the goals. Let's find a sequence of moves to achieve this.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the first box at (2, 2) and push it onto the goal at (1, 2).\n2. Move the player to the second box at (2, 6) and push it down to (3, 6).\n3. Move the player to the third box at (3, 6) and push it left to (3, 5).\n4. Push the box at (3, 5) down to (4, 5).\n5. Finally, push the box at (4, 5) left onto the goal at (4, 4).\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the sequence of moves.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player left to (1, 3).\n2. Move the player left to (1, 2).\n3. Move the player down to (2, 2).\n4. Push the box at (2, 2) up to (1, 2) (onto the goal).\n5. Move the player right to (1, 3).\n6. Move the player right to (1, 4).\n7. Move the player down to (2, 4).\n8. Move the player right to (2, 5).\n9. Move the player right to (2, 6).\n10. Push the box at (2, 6) down to (3, 6).\n11. Move the player down to (3, 6).\n12. Push the box at (3, 6) left to (3, 5).\n13. Move the player left to (3, 5).\n14. Push the box at (3, 5) down to (4, 5).\n15. Move the player down to (4, 5).\n16. Push the box at (4, 5) left to (4, 4) (onto the goal).\n\nLet's translate these steps into a sequence of moves:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the sequence of moves based on the plan\nmoves = \"LLDDRUURRDDLLDDLL\"\n\n# Output the solution in the required format\nsolution = f\"<<<{moves}>>>\"\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the Sokoban puzzle is: <<<LLDDRUURRDDLLDDLL>>>. This sequence of moves will successfully push all the boxes onto the goals."
