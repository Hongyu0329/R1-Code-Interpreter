    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals, represented by ($).\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle and find a solution step by step. \n\n1. The player (*) is initially located at position (1, 8).\n2. The goals (X) are located at positions (1, 3), (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 5), (5, 2), and (5, 8).\n3. The boxes (@) are located at positions (1, 7), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), and (6, 3).\n\nLet's find a sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the first box at (1, 7) and push it to the goal at (1, 3).\n2. Move the player to the next box at (2, 4) and push it to the goal at (3, 4).\n3. Move the player to the box at (2, 6) and push it to the goal at (3, 7).\n4. Move the player to the box at (2, 7) and push it to the goal at (4, 5).\n5. Move the player to the box at (2, 8) and push it to the goal at (5, 8).\n6. Finally, move the player to the box at (6, 3) and push it to the goal at (5, 2).\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the sequence of moves.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, let's outline the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move the player to the first box at (1, 7) and push it to the goal at (1, 3).\n   - Move left (L) to (1, 6)\n   - Move left (L) to (1, 5)\n   - Move left (L) to (1, 4)\n   - Move left (L) to (1, 3) and push the box to the goal\n\n2. Move the player to the next box at (2, 4) and push it to the goal at (3, 4).\n   - Move down (D) to (2, 3)\n   - Move right (R) to (2, 4) and push the box down to (3, 4)\n\n3. Move the player to the box at (2, 6) and push it to the goal at (3, 7).\n   - Move right (R) to (2, 5)\n   - Move right (R) to (2, 6) and push the box down to (3, 6)\n   - Move down (D) to (3, 6)\n   - Move right (R) to (3, 7) and push the box to the goal\n\n4. Move the player to the box at (2, 7) and push it to the goal at (4, 5).\n   - Move up (U) to (2, 7)\n   - Move down (D) to (3, 7)\n   - Move down (D) to (4, 7)\n   - Move left (L) to (4, 6)\n   - Move left (L) to (4, 5) and push the box to the goal\n\n5. Move the player to the box at (2, 8) and push it to the goal at (5, 8).\n   - Move up (U) to (3, 8)\n   - Move up (U) to (2, 8) and push the box down to (3, 8)\n   - Move down (D) to (4, 8)\n   - Move down (D) to (5, 8) and push the box to the goal\n\n6. Finally, move the player to the box at (6, 3) and push it to the goal at (5, 2).\n   - Move down (D) to (6, 3)\n   - Move left (L) to (6, 2)\n   - Move up (U) to (5, 2) and push the box to the goal\n\nLet's compile these moves into a single sequence.\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is as follows:\n\n1. Move left (L) three times to push the first box to the goal.\n2. Move down (D), right (R) to push the second box to the goal.\n3. Move right (R) twice, down (D), right (R) to push the third box to the goal.\n4. Move up (U), down (D) twice, left (L) twice to push the fourth box to the goal.\n5. Move up (U) twice, down (D) twice to push the fifth box to the goal.\n6. Move down (D), left (L), up (U) to push the sixth box to the goal.\n\nCombining these moves, the solution is:\n\n<<<LLLDRRDRRDDLLUUUDDD>>>"
