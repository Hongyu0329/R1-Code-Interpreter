    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The player can only push one box at a time and cannot move through walls (+) or boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ - - - - - - +  \n+ - $ @ - $ - +  \n+ - X - @ $ - +  \n+ - - - X * - +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is located at the bottom row, second from the right. There are three boxes (@) and two goals (X). The objective is to move the boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to plan a sequence of moves that will push all the boxes onto the goals. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Move the player to the left to push the box (@) onto the goal (X) in the third row.\n2. Move the player to the right to push the second box (@) onto the goal (X) in the fourth row.\n3. Finally, move the player to push the remaining box onto the goal.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move left (L) to push the box onto the goal.\n2. Move right (R) to push the second box onto the goal.\n3. Move up (U) and then left (L) to push the last box onto the goal.\n\nLet's write down the sequence of moves and check if it solves the puzzle.\nassistant > Upon closer inspection, I realize that the initial plan needs to be adjusted to account for the correct sequence of moves. Let's break it down more carefully:\n\n1. Move the player up to position them to push the first box.\n2. Push the first box onto the goal.\n3. Move the player to push the second box onto the goal.\n4. Finally, move the player to push the last box onto the goal.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move up (U) to position the player.\n2. Move left (L) to push the first box onto the goal.\n3. Move right (R) to position the player for the second box.\n4. Move up (U) and then left (L) to push the second box onto the goal.\n5. Move down (D) and then right (R) to position the player for the last box.\n6. Move up (U) and then left (L) to push the last box onto the goal.\n\nLet's write down the sequence of moves and check if it solves the puzzle.\nassistant > Let's try to solve the puzzle with a more detailed plan:\n\n1. Move the player up to align with the first box.\n2. Push the first box onto the goal.\n3. Move the player to the right to align with the second box.\n4. Push the second box onto the goal.\n5. Move the player to the left to align with the third box.\n6. Push the third box onto the goal.\n\nHere's the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move up (U) to position the player.\n2.
