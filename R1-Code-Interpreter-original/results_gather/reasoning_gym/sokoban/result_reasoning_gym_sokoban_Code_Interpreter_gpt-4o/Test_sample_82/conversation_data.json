    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The solution will be a sequence of moves: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D).\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle and find a solution:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ + $ + + + +  \n+ X + + + $ +  \n+ - + + + + +  \n+ - - - + $ +  \n+ - - @ + $ +  \n+ - - X + + +  \n+ @ - - + + +  \n+ * @ - X + +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is at position (8, 2). The goal is to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\nLet's find a sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push the boxes onto the goals. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Move the player down to push the box at (8, 3) onto the goal at (8, 4).\n2. Move the player to the left to push the box at (7, 1) onto the goal at (6, 3).\n3. Move the player to the right to push the box at (5, 4) onto the goal at (3, 1).\n4. Finally, move the player to push the remaining boxes onto their respective goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move Down (D) to push the box at (8, 3) onto the goal at (8, 4).\n2. Move Left (L) to push the box at (7, 1) onto the goal at (6, 3).\n3. Move Right (R) to push the box at (5, 4) onto the goal at (3, 1).\n\nThe sequence of moves is: DLDLRR\n\nLet's write the solution in the required format: <<<DLDLRR>>>."
