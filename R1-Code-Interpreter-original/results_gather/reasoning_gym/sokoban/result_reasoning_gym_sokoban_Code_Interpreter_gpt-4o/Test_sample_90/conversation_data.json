    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the initial configuration:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ - - - - - - - + +  \n+ - - @ - - - - + +  \n+ - - - X X @ - - +  \n+ - $ $ $ - @ - @ +  \n+ - - - - - - X % +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player is currently on a goal, represented by `%`. The player needs to move the boxes onto the goals. Let's find a sequence of moves to solve this puzzle.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that all boxes are placed on the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to a position where they can start pushing the boxes.\n2. Push the boxes towards the goals while ensuring that no box gets stuck in a corner or against a wall.\n3. Continue moving the player and boxes until all boxes are on the goals.\n\nLet's start by moving the player to a position where they can begin pushing the boxes. The player is currently on a goal, so we need to move them off the goal and towards the boxes.\n\nHere's a possible sequence of moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player left to get off the goal.\n2. Move the player up to position them to push the first box.\n3. Push the first box down onto the goal.\n4. Move the player to push the remaining boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps and find the solution.\nassistant > Here's a step-by-step solution to the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player left (L) to get off the goal.\n2. Move the player up (U) to position them to push the first box.\n3. Push the first box down (D) onto the goal.\n4. Move the player right (R) to position them to push the next box.\n5. Push the next box down (D) onto the goal.\n6. Move the player left (L) to position them to push the next box.\n7. Push the next box down (D) onto the goal.\n8. Move the player right (R) to position them to push the last box.\n9. Push the last box down (D) onto the goal.\n\nThe sequence of moves is: LURDRDLDRD\n\nLet's represent this solution in the required format:\n\n<<<LURDRDLDRD>>>"
