    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals, represented by ($).\n\nLet's analyze the initial configuration:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ * @ - - X X X - +  \n+ @ $ @ - @ - @ - +  \n+ X X - - - - @ - +  \n+ + + @ - X + - - +  \n+ + + X - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is at position (1, 1).
