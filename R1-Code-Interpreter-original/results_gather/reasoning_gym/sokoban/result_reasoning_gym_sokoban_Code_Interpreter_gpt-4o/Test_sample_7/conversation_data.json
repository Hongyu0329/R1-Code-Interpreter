    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ - - % - - +  \n+ - X @ @ - +  \n+ - - - - - +  \n+ - - - @ X +  \n+ + + - @ - +  \n+ + X $ - - +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player is currently on a goal (%), and there are several boxes (@) and goals (X) on the board. We need to find a sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.\n\nLet's work through the solution step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that all boxes are placed on the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the first box (@) onto the goal (X).\n2. Navigate the player to push the remaining boxes onto their respective goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move Right (R) to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Move Down (D) to position the player to push the next box.\n3. Move Right (R) to push the second box.\n4. Move Up (U) to position the player to push the third box.\n5. Move Right (R) to push the third box onto the goal.\n6. Move Down (D) to position the player to push the last box.\n7. Move Right (R) to push the last box onto the goal.\n\nLet's write the sequence of moves: \n\n- R (Right)\n- D (Down)\n- R (Right)\n- U (Up)\n- R (Right)\n- D (Down)\n- R (Right)\n\nThe solution sequence is: <<<RDRURDR>>>."
