    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). Let's analyze the given puzzle and find a solution.\n\nHere's the initial layout of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ + X @ * +  \n+ + - - @ +  \n+ $ - - X +  \n+ + + + + +  \n+ + + + $ +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. Move the player right (R) to push the box onto the goal.\n2. Move the player down (D) to get closer to the next box.\n3. Move the player left (L) to push the box left.\n4. Move the player up (U) to get closer to the next box.\n5. Move the player left (L) to push the box onto the goal.\n6. Move the player down (D) to get closer to the last box.\n7. Move the player right (R) to push the box onto the goal.\n\nLet's execute these steps and see if they solve the puzzle.\nassistant > Upon closer inspection, I realize that the initial plan needs adjustment. Let's carefully plan the moves to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player left (L) to position the player to push the first box.\n2. Move the player right (R) to push the first box onto the goal.\n3. Move the player down (D) to get closer to the second box.\n4. Move the player right (R) to push the second box down.\n5. Move the player down (D) to position the player to push the second box onto the goal.\n6. Move the player left (L) to push the second box onto the goal.\n7. Move the player up (U) to get closer to the third box.\n8. Move the player right (R) to push the third box onto the goal.\n\nLet's execute these steps to solve the puzzle.\nassistant > After reviewing the puzzle layout again, I realize that the solution requires a more strategic approach. Let's break down the steps to ensure all boxes are placed on the goals:\n\n1. Move the player left (L) to position the player to push the first box.\n2. Move the player right (R) to push the first box onto the goal.\n3. Move the player down (D) to get closer to the second box.\n4. Move the player right (R) to push the second box down.\n5.
