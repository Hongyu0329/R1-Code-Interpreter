    "\nassistant > To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). Let's analyze the given puzzle and find a solution.\n\nHere's the initial layout of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ * @ - X +  \n+ @ @ $ + +  \n+ X - $ + +  \n+ + - + $ +  \n+ - - + + +  \n+ - - X + +  \n+ - + + + +  \n+ + + + + +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > To solve the puzzle, we need to carefully plan the moves to push all the boxes onto the goals. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the first box (@) onto the goal (X).\n2. Navigate the player to push the remaining boxes onto their respective goals.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move Right (R) to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Move Down (D) to navigate around the boxes.\n3. Move Right (R) to position the player to push the next box.\n4. Move Up (U) to push the box onto the goal.\n5. Continue navigating and pushing the remaining boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's implement this solution.\nassistant > Upon closer inspection, the puzzle requires a more strategic approach to ensure all boxes are placed on the goals without getting stuck. Let's outline a more detailed plan:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Navigate around the boxes to position the player for subsequent pushes.\n3. Carefully push each box onto a goal, ensuring no box gets stuck in a corner or against a wall.\n\nLet's execute the solution step by step:\n\n1. Move Right (R) to push the first box onto the goal.\n2. Move Down (D) to navigate around the boxes.\n3. Move Right (R) to position the player to push the next box.\n4. Move Up (U) to push the box onto the goal.\n5.
