    "Let me solve this Sokoban puzzle through systematic reasoning and code implementation.\n\n1) First, let's analyze the puzzle:\n   - We have a 6x6 grid\n   - Player (*) is at position (3,1)\n   - There are boxes (@) at (3,2) and (2,3)\n   - Goals (X) are at (2,1) and (3,4)\n   - One box is already on a goal ($) at (4,4)\n   - Player on goal (%) at (4,1)\n\n2) Let's write code to solve this using a breadth-first search algorithm, which will help us find the shortest solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nimport copy\n\ndef is_valid(x, y, width, height):\n    return 0 <= x < height and 0 <= y < width\n\ndef get_next_states(state):\n    directions = [('U', -1, 0), ('D', 1, 0), ('L', 0, -1), ('R', 0, 1)]\n    next_states = []\n    height = len(state['board'])\n    width = len(state['board'][0])\n    px, py = state['player']\n    \n    for direction, dx, dy in directions:\n        new_x, new_y = px + dx, py + dy\n        \n        if not is_valid(new_x, new_y, width, height) or state['board'][new_x][new_y] == '+':\n            continue\n            \n        new_state = {'board': [row[:] for row in state['board']], 'player': (new_x, new_y), 'path': state['path'] + direction}\n        \n        # If moving to empty space or goal\n        if state['board'][new_x][new_y] in '-X':\n            new_state['board'][px][py] = '-' if state['board'][px][py] in '*%' else 'X'\n            new_state['board'][new_x][new_y] = '*' if state['board'][new_x][new_y] == '-' else '%'\n            next_states.append(new_state)\n            \n        # If moving a box\n        elif state['board'][new_x][new_y] in '@$':\n            push_x, push_y = new_x + dx, new_y + dy\n            if is_valid(push_x, push_y, width, height) and state['board'][push_x][push_y] in '-X':\n                new_state['board'][px][py] = '-' if state['board'][px][py] in '*%' else 'X'\n                new_state['board'][new_x][new_y] = '*' if state['board'][new_x][new_y] == '@' else '%'\n                new_state['board'][push_x][push_y] = '@' if state['board'][push_x][push_y] == '-' else '$'\n                next_states.append(new_state)\n                \n    return next_states\n\ndef is_solved(board):\n    for row in board:\n        for cell in row:\n            if cell == '@' or cell == 'X':\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_sokoban():\n    initial_board = [\n        ['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+'],\n        ['+', '-', '-', '-', '-', '+'],\n        ['+', '-', 'X', '-', '-', '+'],\n        ['+', '@', '@', '-', '-', '+'],\n        ['+', '%', '@', 'X', '$', '+'],\n        ['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+']\n    ]\n    \n    initial_state = {\n        'board': initial_board,\n        'player': (4, 1),\n        'path': ''\n    }\n    \n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque([initial_state])\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state = queue.popleft()\n        board_tuple = tuple(tuple(row) for row in current_state['board'])\n        player_pos = current_state['player']\n        state_key = (board_tuple, player_pos)\n        \n        if state_key in visited:\n            continue\n            \n        visited.add(state_key)\n        \n        if is_solved(current_state['board']):\n            return current_state['path']\n            \n        next_states = get_next_states(current_state)\n        queue.extend(next_states)\n    \n    return None\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban()\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThe code implements a BFS algorithm that:\n1. Represents the board state and player position\n2. Generates valid moves considering walls, boxes, and goals\n3. Tracks visited states to avoid cycles\n4.

    "Let me analyze why the code didn't find a solution and modify it to handle the specific puzzle rules more accurately.\n\nThe main issue might be in how we're interpreting the symbols and handling the player-on-goal state.

More precise handling of player-on-goal (%) states\n2. Better state representation for visited positions\n3. Clearer distinction between box-on-goal ($) and regular box (@)\n4. More accurate movement rules considering all symbol transitions\n\nLet's see what solution this revised version finds. If it still doesn't work, we might need to adjust our goal condition or movement rules further.\n\nBased on my analysis of the puzzle, a valid solution should exist. The boxes need to be pushed onto the goals, and there appears to be enough space to maneuver. Let me try one more version if this doesn't produce the expected result.\n\nLet's wait for the code output before proceeding further or providing the final answer.",
    "Great! The code has found a valid solution. Let me verify this sequence of moves:\n\nR - Move right from initial position\nU - Move up\nR - Move right\nU - Move up\nU - Move up\nL - Move left\nL - Move left\nD - Move down\nD - Move down\n\nLet's verify this solution:\n1. Starting position: Player (%) at (4,1), boxes at (3,1), (3,2), and (4,4)[$], goals at (2,1) and (3,4)\n2. After RURU: Player gets into position to push the rightmost box\n3. After ULLDD: Player pushes boxes into their goal positions\n\nThis is indeed a valid solution that will get all boxes onto the goals in an efficient manner.\n\n<<<RURUULLDD>>>"
