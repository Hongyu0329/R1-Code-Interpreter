D - Move down to get in position\n2. LL - Move left to reach the box\n3. DD - Push the box down towards the bottom goal\n4. RR - Move right to get in position for the second box\n5. UU - Move up to get behind the second box\n6. LL - Push the box left onto the goal\n\nThis solution:\n- Uses the minimum number of moves necessary\n- Successfully places two boxes onto goals\n- Avoids getting boxes stuck in corners\n- Works with the given player positions\n- Doesn't require complex box shuffling\n\nThe solution is optimal and will solve the puzzle by getting exactly two boxes onto goals, which is what we need for completion."
