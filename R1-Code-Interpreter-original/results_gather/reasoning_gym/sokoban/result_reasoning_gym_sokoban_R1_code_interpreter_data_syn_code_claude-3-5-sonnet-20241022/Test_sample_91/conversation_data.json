Push the box right onto the goal",
    "I notice the solver is still not finding a solution.

We need to focus on the box ($) in row 2\n2. The most efficient path would be to use the player in row 3\n3. The goal is to push the box to one of the X positions\n\nLooking at the puzzle structure and the positions of the players, box, and goals, I can determine the solution manually:\n\n<<<ULDRRU>>>\n\nThis sequence will:\n1. U - Move up to get behind the box\n2. L - Push the box left\n3. D - Move down to reposition\n4. R - Move right to get behind the box\n5. R - Push the box right\n6. U - Push the box up to the goal\n\nThis solution should successfully move the box to a goal position using the most efficient path."
