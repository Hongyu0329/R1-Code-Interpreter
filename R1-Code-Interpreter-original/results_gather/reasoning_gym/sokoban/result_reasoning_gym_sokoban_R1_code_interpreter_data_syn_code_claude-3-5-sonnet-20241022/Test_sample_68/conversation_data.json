    "Let me solve this Sokoban puzzle step by step.\n\n1) First, let's analyze the puzzle:\n- We need to move boxes (@) onto goals (X)\n- The player (*) can only push boxes, not pull them\n- We need to find a sequence of moves (U, D, L, R) that solves the puzzle\n- We need to be careful not to get boxes stuck in corners or against walls\n\n2) Let's write a program to solve this using a breadth-first search algorithm, which will:\n- Represent the board state\n- Track visited states to avoid loops\n- Find valid moves at each state\n- Search for the solution path\n\nHere's the code to solve it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nimport copy\n\ndef is_valid_pos(x, y, rows, cols):\n    return 0 <= x < rows and 0 <= y < cols\n\ndef get_moves(state):\n    rows = len(state)\n    cols = len(state[0])\n    \n    # Find player position\n    player_pos = None\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if state[i][j] in ['*', '%']:\n                player_pos = (i, j)\n                break\n        if player_pos:\n            break\n    \n    moves = []\n    directions = [(-1, 0, 'U'), (1, 0, 'D'), (0, -1, 'L'), (0, 1, 'R')]\n    \n    for dx, dy, move in directions:\n        new_x, new_y = player_pos[0] + dx, player_pos[1] + dy\n        \n        if not is_valid_pos(new_x, new_y, rows, cols) or state[new_x][new_y] == '+':\n            continue\n            \n        if state[new_x][new_y] in ['@', '$']:\n            box_x, box_y = new_x + dx, new_y + dy\n            if (is_valid_pos(box_x, box_y, rows, cols) and \n                state[box_x][box_y] not in ['+', '@', '$']):\n                moves.append((move, (new_x, new_y), (box_x, box_y)))\n        elif state[new_x][new_y] in ['-', 'X']:\n            moves.append((move, (new_x, new_y), None))\n            \n    return moves\n\ndef make_move(state, player_pos, box_move, box_pos):\n    new_state = [list(row) for row in state]\n    px, py = player_pos\n    \n    # Update player position\n    if new_state[px][py] == '*':\n        new_state[px][py] = 'X'\n    else:\n        new_state[px][py] = '-'\n        \n    old_px, old_py = None, None\n    for i in range(len(state)):\n        for j in range(len(state[0])):\n            if state[i][j] in ['*', '%']:\n                old_px, old_py = i, j\n                break\n        if old_px is not None:\n            break\n    \n    if state[old_px][old_py] == '%':\n        new_state[old_px][old_py] = 'X'\n    else:\n        new_state[old_px][old_py] = '-'\n    \n    # Update box position if there is one\n    if box_move:\n        bx, by = box_pos\n        if new_state[bx][by] == 'X':\n            new_state[bx][by] = '$'\n        else:\n            new_state[bx][by] = '@'\n            \n        if state[px][py] == 'X':\n            new_state[px][py] = '%'\n        else:\n            new_state[px][py] = '*'\n    else:\n        if state[px][py] == 'X':\n            new_state[px][py] = '%'\n        else:\n            new_state[px][py] = '*'\n            \n    return [''.join(row) for row in new_state]\n\ndef is_solved(state):\n    for row in state:\n        for cell in row:\n            if cell in ['@', 'X']:  # If there's either an unpaired box or goal\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = {tuple(initial_state)}\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved(current_state):\n            return path\n            \n        moves = get_moves(current_state)\n        for move, player_pos, box_pos in moves:\n            new_state = make_move(current_state, player_pos, box_pos is not None, box_pos)\n            state_tuple = tuple(new_state)\n            \n            if state_tuple not in visited:\n                visited.add(state_tuple)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Initial state\ninitial_state = [\n    \"+++++++++\",\n    \"+++++X+++\",\n    \"+----@X++\",\n    \"++-@@X$++\",\n    \"++-+--+++\",\n    \"++-$+@$X+\",\n    \"++++-+@+\",\n    \"+++X--@*+\",\n    \"+++++++++\"\n]\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution if solution else \"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThe code uses a breadth-first search algorithm to explore all possible moves and find the shortest solution path.
