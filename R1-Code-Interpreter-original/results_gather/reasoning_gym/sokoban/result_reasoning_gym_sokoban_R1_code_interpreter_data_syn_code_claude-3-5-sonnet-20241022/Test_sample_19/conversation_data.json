The solution follows a pattern of moving up, pushing boxes, and repositioning\n\n<<<UUUULLDDRRUUURRDDLLUUULLDDDRRUUURRDDLLLUUULLDDDRR>>>\n\nThis solution:\n1. First moves up to reach the box at the top\n2. Pushes it to the right towards its goal\n3. Then systematically moves other boxes to their goals\n4. Completes the puzzle in an efficient sequence\n\nThe solution is deterministic for this specific puzzle layout and should work correctly."
