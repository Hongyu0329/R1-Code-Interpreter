    "I see the issue now. The problem was in the goal state checking. Let me fix the code with a more precise state tracking and goal checking:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef get_state(board):\n    return ''.join(''.join(row) for row in board)\n\ndef find_player(board):\n    for i, row in enumerate(board):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell in ['*', '%']:\n                return i, j\n    return None\n\ndef try_move(board, move):\n    board = [list(row) for row in board]\n    px, py = find_player(board)\n    \n    # Define move directions\n    if move == 'U': dx, dy = -1, 0\n    elif move == 'D': dx, dy = 1, 0\n    elif move == 'L': dx, dy = 0, -1\n    elif move == 'R': dx, dy = 0, 1\n    \n    # New position\n    nx, ny = px + dx, py + dy\n    \n    # Check bounds and walls\n    if nx < 0 or ny < 0 or nx >= len(board) or ny >= len(board[0]) or board[nx][ny] == '+':\n        return None\n    \n    # Moving to empty space or goal\n    if board[nx][ny] in ['-', 'X']:\n        # Update player position\n        new_player = '*' if board[nx][ny] == '-' else '%'\n        old_space = '-' if board[px][py] == '*' else 'X'\n        board[nx][ny] = new_player\n        board[px][py] = old_space\n        return board\n    \n    # Moving box\n    if board[nx][ny] in ['@', '$']:\n        # Check box destination\n        bx, by = nx + dx, ny + dy\n        if (bx < 0 or by < 0 or bx >= len(board) or by >= len(board[0]) or \n            board[bx][by] in ['+', '@', '$']):\n            return None\n        \n        # Move box\n        new_box = '$' if board[bx][by] == 'X' else '@'\n        board[bx][by] = new_box\n        \n        # Move player\n        new_player = '*' if board[nx][ny] == '@' else '%'\n        board[nx][ny] = new_player\n        \n        # Clear old player position\n        board[px][py] = '-' if board[px][py] == '*' else 'X'\n        \n        return board\n    \n    return None\n\ndef count_goals_and_boxes(board):\n    goals = 0\n    boxes_on_goals = 0\n    for row in board:\n        for cell in row:\n            if cell in ['X', '%']:  # Count goals\n                goals += 1\n            if cell == '$':  # Count boxes on goals\n                boxes_on_goals += 1\n    return goals, boxes_on_goals\n\ndef is_goal(board):\n    goals, boxes_on_goals = count_goals_and_boxes(board)\n    return goals > 0 and goals == boxes_on_goals\n\ndef solve(initial):\n    initial_board = [list(row) for row in initial.strip().split('\\n')]\n    queue = deque([(initial_board, \"\")])\n    seen = {get_state(initial_board)}\n    max_moves = 20  # Limit search depth\n    \n    while queue:\n        board, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if len(path) > max_moves:  # Prevent infinite loops\n            continue\n            \n        if is_goal(board):\n            return path\n        \n        for move in ['U', 'D', 'L', 'R']:\n            new_board = try_move(board, move)\n            if new_board:\n                state = get_state(new_board)\n                if state not in seen:\n                    seen.add(state)\n                    queue.append((new_board, path + move))\n    \n    return \"No solution found\"\n\n# Test with the puzzle\npuzzle = \"\"\"++++++\n+*$--+\n+@@-++\n+XX+-+\n+++$-+\n++++++\"\"\"\n\nresult = solve(puzzle)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe key changes in this version:\n1. Fixed the box movement logic to properly track boxes on goals\n2. Improved goal state checking to count both goals and boxes on goals\n3. Added a maximum move limit to prevent infinite loops\n4. Modified the box movement to properly update box states when moving onto goals\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle again:\n- We have 2 goals (X)\n- One box is already on a goal ($)\n- We need to move the two boxes (@) to the remaining goals\n- The player (*) needs to navigate to push the boxes\n\nThe solution should be:\n\n<<<DDRULLD>>>\n\nThis represents:\n1. D - Move down behind first box\n2. D - Push first box down toward goal\n3. R - Move right to get in position for second box\n4. U - Move up behind second box\n5. L - Push box left toward goal\n6. L - Continue pushing box\n7. D - Final push to get box onto goal\n\nThis solution should work with the corrected code and properly solve the puzzle by moving both boxes to their respective goals."
