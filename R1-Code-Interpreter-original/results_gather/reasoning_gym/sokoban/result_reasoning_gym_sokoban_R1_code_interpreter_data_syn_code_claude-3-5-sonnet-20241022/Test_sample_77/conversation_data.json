    "Great! The code successfully found a solution. Let me verify this solution:\n\nLLDLUU - Let's break down these moves:\n1. L - Move left\n2. L - Move left again\n3. D - Move down\n4. L - Move left\n5. U - Move up\n6. U - Move up again\n\nThis sequence will successfully move the boxes to their goal positions. Since the code found this solution through a breadth-first search, it represents one of the shortest possible solutions to this puzzle.\n\n<<<LLDLUU>>>"
