    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player and boxes to achieve a state where all boxes are on goals. The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can push a box if there is an empty space or a goal behind it. The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ X X @ - +  \n+ - X - - +  \n+ @ - @ - +  \n+ % @ - - +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player is currently on a goal at position (4, 2).\n- There are three boxes: one at (1, 3), one at (3, 2), and one at (4, 3).\n- There are three goals: one at (1, 1), one at (1, 2), and one at (2, 2).\n\nThe task is to move the boxes onto the goals. We will use a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle. Let's implement a simple search algorithm to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_goal_state(state):\n    # Check if all boxes are on goals\n    for box in state['boxes']:\n        if box not in state['goals']:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state):\n    # Generate possible moves from the current state\n    moves = []\n    player = state['player']\n    boxes = set(state['boxes'])\n    walls = set(state['walls'])\n    \n    directions = {\n        'U': (-1, 0),\n        'D': (1, 0),\n        'L': (0, -1),\n        'R': (0, 1)\n    }\n    \n    for move, (dr, dc) in directions.items():\n        new_player = (player[0] + dr, player[1] + dc)\n        \n        if new_player in walls:\n            continue\n        \n        if new_player in boxes:\n            new_box = (new_player[0] + dr, new_player[1] + dc)\n            if new_box in walls or new_box in boxes:\n                continue\n            new_boxes = set(boxes)\n            new_boxes.remove(new_player)\n            new_boxes.add(new_box)\n            moves.append((move, {'player': new_player, 'boxes': new_boxes, 'goals': state['goals'], 'walls': state['walls']}))\n        else:\n            moves.append((move, {'player': new_player, 'boxes': boxes, 'goals': state['goals'], 'walls': state['walls']}))\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_goal_state(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for move, new_state in get_possible_moves(current_state):\n            state_tuple = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n            if state_tuple not in visited:\n                visited.add(state_tuple)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    \n    return \"No solution\"\n\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (4, 2),\n    'boxes': {(1, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)},\n    'goals': {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5),\n              (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5),\n              (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)}\n}\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code uses a breadth-first search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a solution to the Sokoban puzzle. The `solve_sokoban` function returns a string of moves that solves the puzzle. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "It seems that the initial approach did not yield a solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem and ensure that the logic for generating possible moves and checking goal states is correct. We need to ensure that the player can move and push boxes correctly according to the rules of Sokoban.\n\nLet's try a different approach by manually analyzing the puzzle and finding a sequence of moves that solves it. \n\nThe initial state of the puzzle is:\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ X X @ - +  \n+ - X - - +  \n+ @ - @ - +  \n+ % @ - - +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\n1. The player is at (4, 2) and can move to (3, 2) to push the box at (3, 2) to (2, 2).\n2. Then, the player can move to (4, 3) and push the box at (4, 3) to (4, 4).\n3. The player can then move to (1, 3) and push the box at (1, 3) to (1, 2).\n4. Finally, the player can move to (4, 4) and push the box to (3, 4), and then to (2, 4).\n\nLet's write down these moves in terms of directions:\n- U (up)\n- D (down)\n- L (left)\n- R (right)\n\nThe sequence of moves is: UURRDLUURR.\n\nLet's provide this as the solution.\n\n<<<UURRDLUURR>>>"
