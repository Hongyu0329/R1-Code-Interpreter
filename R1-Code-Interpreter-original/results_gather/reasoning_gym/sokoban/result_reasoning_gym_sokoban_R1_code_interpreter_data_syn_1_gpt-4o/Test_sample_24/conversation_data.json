    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The player is at position (1, 5).\n   - There are several boxes (@) and goals (X) scattered throughout the grid.\n   - Some boxes are already on goals ($).\n\n2. **Objective**: \n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The player can only push one box at a time.\n   - The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes.\n   - The player can only push boxes into empty spaces or onto goals.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - Use a search algorithm to explore possible moves.\n   - Keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.\n   - Prioritize moves that bring boxes closer to goals.\n\nLet's implement a search algorithm to find the solution. We'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = [\n    \"+ + + + + + + + + +\",\n    \"+ X - @ - $ * + + +\",\n    \"+ - @ X - - @ - + +\",\n    \"+ - X - @ - - - + +\",\n    \"+ - X - - @ - X + +\",\n    \"+ - @ - - - - + + +\",\n    \"+ - @ X - @ - - - +\",\n    \"+ + X - $ - - - - +\",\n    \"+ + + + + X - - - +\",\n    \"+ + + + + + + + + +\"\n]\n\n# Convert the initial state into a more manageable format\ngrid = [list(row.split()) for row in initial_state]\nrows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n\n# Find the initial position of the player\nfor r in range(rows):\n    for c in range(cols):\n        if grid[r][c] == '*':\n            player_pos = (r, c)\n\n# Define possible moves: (dr, dc) for (up, down, left, right)\nmoves = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}\n\n# Function to check if a position is within the grid and not a wall\ndef is_valid(r, c):\n    return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols and grid[r][c] != '+'\n\n# Function to check if a position is a goal\ndef is_goal(r, c):\n    return grid[r][c] == 'X' or grid[r][c] == '$'\n\n# BFS to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban():\n    queue = deque([(player_pos, grid, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((player_pos, tuple(map(tuple, grid))))\n\n    while queue:\n        (pr, pc), current_grid, path = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if all boxes are on goals\n        if all(is_goal(r, c) for r in range(rows) for c in range(cols) if current_grid[r][c] == '@'):\n            return path\n\n        for move, (dr, dc) in moves.items():\n            nr, nc = pr + dr, pc + dc\n\n            if is_valid(nr, nc):\n                # If the next position is a box, try to push it\n                if current_grid[nr][nc] == '@' or current_grid[nr][nc] == '$':\n                    nnr, nnc = nr + dr, nc + dc\n                    if is_valid(nnr, nnc) and (current_grid[nnr][nnc] == '-' or current_grid[nnr][nnc] == 'X'):\n                        # Create a new grid state\n                        new_grid = [row[:] for row in current_grid]\n                        # Move the player\n                        new_grid[pr][pc] = '-' if current_grid[pr][pc] == '*' else 'X'\n                        new_grid[nr][nc] = '*'\n                        # Push the box\n                        new_grid[nnr][nnc] = '@' if current_grid[nnr][nnc] == '-' else '$'\n                        new_grid[nr][nc] = '-' if current_grid[nr][nc] == '@' else 'X'\n\n                        new_state = ((nr, nc), tuple(map(tuple, new_grid)))\n                        if new_state not in visited:\n                            visited.add(new_state)\n                            queue.append(((nr, nc), new_grid, path + move))\n                # If the next position is empty or a goal, just move the player\n                elif current_grid[nr][nc] == '-' or current_grid[nr][nc] == 'X':\n                    new_grid = [row[:] for row in current_grid]\n                    new_grid[pr][pc] = '-' if current_grid[pr][pc] == '*' else 'X'\n                    new_grid[nr][nc] = '*'\n\n                    new_state = ((nr, nc), tuple(map(tuple, new_grid)))\n                    if new_state not in visited:\n                        visited.add(new_state)\n                        queue.append(((nr, nc), new_grid, path + move))\n\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban()\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a solution to the Sokoban puzzle using a breadth-first search approach.

    "The timeout error indicates that the search algorithm took too long to find a solution. This can happen if the search space is too large or if the algorithm is not efficient enough.
