    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial positions are:\n- Player (*) at (3, 4)\n- Boxes (@) at (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3)\n- Goals (X) at (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2)\n\nThe walls (+) and empty spaces (-) define the boundaries and paths.\n\nWe will use a search algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to explore possible moves and find a solution. The BFS will explore all possible states by moving the player and pushing boxes, keeping track of visited states to avoid loops.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm in Python to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (3, 4),\n    'boxes': {(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3)},\n    'goals': {(1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8),\n              (1, 0), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 8),\n              (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)},\n    'width': 9,\n    'height': 6\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\ndef is_goal_state(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\ndef move_player(state, direction):\n    dx, dy = moves[direction]\n    px, py = state['player']\n    new_player_pos = (px + dx, py + dy)\n    \n    if new_player_pos in state['walls']:\n        return None\n    \n    new_boxes = set(state['boxes'])\n    if new_player_pos in new_boxes:\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + dx, new_player_pos[1] + dy)\n        if new_box_pos in state['walls'] or new_box_pos in new_boxes:\n            return None\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player_pos)\n        new_boxes.add(new_box_pos)\n    \n    return {\n        'player': new_player_pos,\n        'boxes': new_boxes,\n        'goals': state['goals'],\n        'walls': state['walls'],\n        'width': state['width'],\n        'height': state['height']\n    }\n\ndef bfs(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((initial_state['player'], frozenset(initial_state['boxes'])))\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_goal_state(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for direction in moves:\n            new_state = move_player(current_state, direction)\n            if new_state is None:\n                continue\n            \n            state_id = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n            if state_id not in visited:\n                visited.add(state_id)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + direction))\n    \n    return None\n\nsolution = bfs(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the solution to the Sokoban puzzle. Let's see the result.",
