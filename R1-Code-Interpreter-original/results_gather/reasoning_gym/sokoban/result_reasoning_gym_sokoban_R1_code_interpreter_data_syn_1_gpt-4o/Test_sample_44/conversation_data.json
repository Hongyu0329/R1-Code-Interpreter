    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player and the resulting state of the board after each move.\n3. Use a search algorithm to explore possible sequences of moves until a solution is found.\n\nThe initial board state is:\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ * @ X - - - +  \n+ @ @ $ - - - +  \n+ X - $ - + + +  \n+ + X + + + + +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + + $ $ + + +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player is at position (1, 1), and the goals are at positions (1, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 2). The boxes are at positions (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3).\n\nWe will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves that solves the puzzle. Let's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the board\ninitial_board = [\n    \"++++++++\",\n    \"+*@X---+\",\n    \"+@@$---+\",\n    \"+X-$+++\",\n    \"++X++++\",\n    \"++++++++\",\n    \"++++++++\",\n    \"+++$+++\",\n    \"++++++++\"\n]\n\n# Define the goal state\ngoal_positions = {(1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\n# Define the possible moves\nmoves = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}\n\n# Find the initial position of the player\ndef find_player(board):\n    for r, row in enumerate(board):\n        for c, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*' or cell == '%':\n                return r, c\n    return None\n\n# Check if the current state is a goal state\ndef is_goal_state(board):\n    for r, row in enumerate(board):\n        for c, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '@' and (r, c) not in goal_positions:\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Move the player and update the board\ndef move_player(board, player_pos, direction):\n    r, c = player_pos\n    dr, dc = moves[direction]\n    new_r, new_c = r + dr, c + dc\n    if board[new_r][new_c] in '-X':  # Move to empty or goal\n        new_board = [list(row) for row in board]\n        new_board[r][c] = '-' if board[r][c] == '*' else 'X'\n        new_board[new_r][new_c] = '*' if board[new_r][new_c] == '-' else '%'\n        return new_board, (new_r, new_c)\n    elif board[new_r][new_c] in '@$':  # Push a box\n        box_r, box_c = new_r + dr, new_c + dc\n        if board[box_r][box_c] in '-X':  # Box can be pushed\n            new_board = [list(row) for row in board]\n            new_board[r][c] = '-' if board[r][c] == '*' else 'X'\n            new_board[new_r][new_c] = '*' if board[new_r][new_c] == '@' else '%'\n            new_board[box_r][box_c] = '@' if board[box_r][box_c] == '-' else '$'\n            return new_board, (new_r, new_c)\n    return None, player_pos\n\n# Perform BFS to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_board):\n    initial_player_pos = find_player(initial_board)\n    queue = deque([(initial_board, initial_player_pos, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((tuple(initial_board), initial_player_pos))\n    \n    while queue:\n        board, player_pos, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_goal_state(board):\n            return path\n        \n        for direction in moves:\n            new_board, new_player_pos = move_player(board, player_pos, direction)\n            if new_board and (tuple(new_board), new_player_pos) not in visited:\n                visited.add((tuple(new_board), new_player_pos))\n                queue.append((new_board, new_player_pos, path + direction))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_board)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the solution to the Sokoban puzzle. Let's see the result.",
    "The error occurs because we are trying to use a list as a key in a set, which is not allowed since lists are mutable and unhashable. To fix this, we need to convert the board state into a hashable type, such as a tuple of tuples, before adding it to the `visited` set.\n\nLet's modify the code to address this issue:\n\n1.
