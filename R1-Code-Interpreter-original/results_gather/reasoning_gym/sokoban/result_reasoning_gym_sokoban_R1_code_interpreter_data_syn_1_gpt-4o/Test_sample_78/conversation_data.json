    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's break down the initial state of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + +  \n+ X - * - - - - +  \n+ - - @ X - @ @ +  \n+ - - - + + - - +  \n+ + + $ $ X @ - +  \n+ + + + + + - X +  \n+ + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is at position (1, 3).\n- There are four boxes (@) at positions (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 7), and (4, 6).\n- There are four goals (X) at positions (1, 1), (2, 4), (4, 4), and (5, 7).\n\nThe strategy is to move the player to push the boxes onto the goals while ensuring that no box gets stuck in a corner or against a wall where it cannot be moved.\n\nLet's attempt to solve this puzzle by writing a Python script to explore possible moves and find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = (\n    (1, 3),  # Player position\n    ((2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 7), (4, 6))  # Box positions\n)\n\n# Define the goal positions\ngoal_positions = {(1, 1), (2, 4), (4, 4), (5, 7)}\n\n# Define the walls\nwalls = {\n    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8),\n    (1, 0), (1, 8),\n    (2, 0), (2, 8),\n    (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8),\n    (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 8),\n    (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 8),\n    (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\n# Function to check if a position is free (not a wall or a box)\ndef is_free(position, boxes):\n    return position not in walls and position not in boxes\n\n# Function to apply a move\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player, boxes = state\n    dx, dy = moves[move]\n    new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n    \n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n        if is_free(new_box, boxes):\n            new_boxes = tuple(b if b != new_player else new_box for b in boxes)\n            return new_player, new_boxes\n    elif is_free(new_player, boxes):\n        return new_player, boxes\n    \n    return None\n\n# Function to check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(boxes):\n    return all(box in goal_positions for box in boxes)\n\n# Breadth-first search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved(state[1]):\n            return path\n        \n        for move in moves:\n            new_state = apply_move(state, move)\n            if new_state and new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible moves from the initial state. It checks if the puzzle is solved by verifying if all boxes are on the goal positions. If a solution is found, it returns the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's execute the code to find the solution.",
