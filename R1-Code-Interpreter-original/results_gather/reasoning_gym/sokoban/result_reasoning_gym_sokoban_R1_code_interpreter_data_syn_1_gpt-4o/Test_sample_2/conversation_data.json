    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player and the resulting state of the board after each move.\n3. Use a search algorithm to explore the possible states and find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial board state is:\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ * @ - - X X X - +  \n+ @ $ @ - @ - @ - +  \n+ X X - - - - @ - +  \n+ + + @ - X + - - +  \n+ + + X - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player is at position (1, 1), and the goals are at positions (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (3, 1), (3, 2), and (4, 4).\n\nWe will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the possible moves. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible states level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest solution.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef sokoban_solver(initial_state):\n    # Define the directions for movement\n    directions = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}\n    \n    # Convert the board into a mutable list of lists\n    board = [list(row) for row in initial_state.split('\\n')]\n    \n    # Find the initial position of the player\n    for i, row in enumerate(board):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*':\n                player_pos = (i, j)\n    \n    # Function to check if a position is within bounds and not a wall\n    def is_valid(pos):\n        x, y = pos\n        return 0 <= x < len(board) and 0 <= y < len(board[0]) and board[x][y] != '+'\n    \n    # Function to check if a move is valid\n    def can_move(player, direction):\n        dx, dy = directions[direction]\n        new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n        if not is_valid(new_player):\n            return False\n        if board[new_player[0]][new_player[1]] in '-X':\n            return True\n        if board[new_player[0]][new_player[1]] in '@$':\n            new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n            return is_valid(new_box) and board[new_box[0]][new_box[1]] in '-X'\n        return False\n    \n    # Function to apply a move\n    def apply_move(player, direction):\n        dx, dy = directions[direction]\n        new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n        if board[new_player[0]][new_player[1]] in '-X':\n            board[player[0]][player[1]] = '-'\n            board[new_player[0]][new_player[1]] = '*'\n            return new_player\n        if board[new_player[0]][new_player[1]] in '@$':\n            new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n            board[player[0]][player[1]] = '-'\n            board[new_player[0]][new_player[1]] = '*'\n            board[new_box[0]][new_box[1]] = '@' if board[new_box[0]][new_box[1]] == '-' else '$'\n            return new_player\n    \n    # Function to check if the puzzle is solved\n    def is_solved():\n        for row in board:\n            for cell in row:\n                if cell == '@':\n                    return False\n        return True\n    \n    # BFS to find the solution\n    queue = deque([(player_pos, '')])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((player_pos, tuple(map(tuple, board))))\n    \n    while queue:\n        player, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved():\n            return path\n        \n        for direction in directions:\n            if can_move(player, direction):\n                new_player = apply_move(player, direction)\n                new_state = (new_player, tuple(map(tuple, board)))\n                if new_state not in visited:\n                    visited.add(new_state)\n                    queue.append((new_player, path + direction))\n                # Undo the move\n                apply_move(new_player, 'UDLR'['UDLR'.index(direction) ^ 1])\n    \n    return \"No solution found\"\n\ninitial_state = \"\"\"+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ * @ - - X X X - +  \n+ @ $ @ - @ - @ - +  \n+ X X - - - - @ - +  \n+ + + @ - X + - - +  \n+ + + X - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \"\"\"\n\nsolution = sokoban_solver(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a solution to the Sokoban puzzle using BFS.
