    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player and the resulting positions of the boxes.\n3. Use a search algorithm to explore possible sequences of moves, ensuring that boxes are pushed onto goals.\n4. Check for the solution where all boxes are on goals.\n\nThe initial configuration is:\n- Player (*) is at position (1, 1).\n- Boxes (@) are at positions (1, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 2).\n- Goals (X) are at positions (1, 3), (3, 1), and (6, 3).\n\nWe will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the possible moves. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible states level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest solution.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (1, 1),\n    'boxes': {(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)},\n    'goals': {(1, 3), (3, 1), (6, 3)}\n}\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"+ + + + + +\",\n    \"+ * @ - X +\",\n    \"+ @ @ $ + +\",\n    \"+ X - $ + +\",\n    \"+ + - + $ +\",\n    \"+ - - + + +\",\n    \"+ - - X + +\",\n    \"+ - + + + +\",\n    \"+ + + + + +\",\n    \"+ + + + + +\"\n]\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\n# Check if a position is within the grid and not a wall\ndef is_valid_position(pos):\n    x, y = pos\n    return 0 <= x < len(grid) and 0 <= y < len(grid[0]) and grid[x][y] != '+'\n\n# Check if all boxes are on goals\ndef is_solved(boxes, goals):\n    return boxes == goals\n\n# Perform BFS to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        state, path = queue.popleft()\n        player = state['player']\n        boxes = state['boxes']\n\n        if is_solved(boxes, initial_state['goals']):\n            return path\n\n        for move, (dx, dy) in moves.items():\n            new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n\n            if not is_valid_position(new_player):\n                continue\n\n            if new_player in boxes:\n                new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n                if not is_valid_position(new_box) or new_box in boxes:\n                    continue\n                new_boxes = boxes - {new_player} | {new_box}\n            else:\n                new_boxes = boxes\n\n            new_state = {'player': new_player, 'boxes': new_boxes}\n\n            if (new_player, frozenset(new_boxes)) not in visited:\n                visited.add((new_player, frozenset(new_boxes)))\n                queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n\n    return None\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the sequence of moves that solves the Sokoban puzzle. Let's see the result.",
