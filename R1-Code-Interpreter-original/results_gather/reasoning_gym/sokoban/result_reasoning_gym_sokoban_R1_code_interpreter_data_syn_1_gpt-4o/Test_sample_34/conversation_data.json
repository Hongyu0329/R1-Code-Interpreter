    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial positions are:\n- Player (*) is at (4, 4).\n- Boxes (@) are at (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 3), (5, 3), and (6, 1).\n- Goals (X) are at (3, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2), and (6, 4).\n\nThe walls (+) form the boundaries of the puzzle, and the player cannot move through them.\n\nWe will use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a solution. Let's implement a simple breadth-first search (BFS) to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (4, 4),\n    'boxes': {(2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 3), (5, 3), (6, 1)},\n    'goals': {(3, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 4)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5),\n              (1, 0), (1, 5),\n              (2, 0), (2, 5),\n              (3, 0), (3, 5),\n              (4, 0), (4, 5),\n              (5, 0), (5, 5),\n              (6, 0), (6, 5),\n              (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5)}\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\n# Check if the move is valid\ndef is_valid_move(player, direction, boxes, walls):\n    new_player = (player[0] + direction[0], player[1] + direction[1])\n    if new_player in walls:\n        return False\n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + direction[0], new_player[1] + direction[1])\n        if new_box in walls or new_box in boxes:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Apply the move\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player = state['player']\n    boxes = set(state['boxes'])\n    direction = moves[move]\n    new_player = (player[0] + direction[0], player[1] + direction[1])\n    if new_player in boxes:\n        boxes.remove(new_player)\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + direction[0], new_player[1] + direction[1])\n        boxes.add(new_box)\n    return {'player': new_player, 'boxes': boxes, 'goals': state['goals'], 'walls': state['walls']}\n\n# Check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\n# Perform BFS to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((initial_state['player'], frozenset(initial_state['boxes'])))\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for move in moves:\n            if is_valid_move(current_state['player'], moves[move], current_state['boxes'], current_state['walls']):\n                new_state = apply_move(current_state, move)\n                state_key = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n                if state_key not in visited:\n                    visited.add(state_key)\n                    queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will execute a breadth-first search to find the sequence of moves that solves the Sokoban puzzle.
