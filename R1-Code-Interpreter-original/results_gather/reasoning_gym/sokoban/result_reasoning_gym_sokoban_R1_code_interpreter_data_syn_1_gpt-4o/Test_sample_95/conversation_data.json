    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player and the boxes.\n3. Use a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial configuration is:\n- Player (*) is at position (8, 4).\n- Boxes (@) are at positions (5, 3), (5, 4), (7, 4), and (7, 5).\n- Goals (X) are at positions (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 5), and (7, 2).\n\nThe walls (+) and empty spaces (-) define the boundaries and paths for movement.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore possible moves.
