    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ - - - - - +  \n+ - - - - - +  \n+ - * - @ - +  \n+ - - @ $ + +  \n+ - X - - - +  \n+ + $ X $ + +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is at position (3, 2).\n- There are boxes (@) at positions (3, 4) and (4, 3).\n- There are goals (X) at positions (5, 2) and (6, 3).\n- There are boxes on goals ($) at positions (4, 5) and (6, 4).\n\nThe goal is to move the boxes to the goal positions. We need to find a sequence of moves that accomplishes this.\n\nTo solve this, we can use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a solution. Let's implement a simple search algorithm to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = (\n    (3, 2),  # Player position\n    ((3, 4), (4, 3)),  # Box positions\n)\n\n# Define the goal positions\ngoal_positions = {(5, 2), (6, 3)}\n\n# Define the walls\nwalls = {\n    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6),\n    (1, 0), (1, 6),\n    (2, 0), (2, 6),\n    (3, 0), (3, 6),\n    (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6),\n    (5, 0), (5, 6),\n    (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6),\n    (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6),\n}\n\n# Define the possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1),\n}\n\ndef is_valid_position(position, boxes):\n    return position not in walls and position not in boxes\n\ndef move_player(state, move):\n    player, boxes = state\n    dx, dy = moves[move]\n    new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n    \n    if not is_valid_position(new_player, boxes):\n        return None\n    \n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n        if not is_valid_position(new_box, boxes):\n            return None\n        new_boxes = tuple(b if b != new_player else new_box for b in boxes)\n    else:\n        new_boxes = boxes\n    \n    return (new_player, new_boxes)\n\ndef is_goal_state(state):\n    _, boxes = state\n    return all(box in goal_positions for box in boxes)\n\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_goal_state(state):\n            return path\n        \n        if state in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add(state)\n        \n        for move in moves:\n            new_state = move_player(state, move)\n            if new_state and new_state not in visited:\n                queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible moves from the initial state.
