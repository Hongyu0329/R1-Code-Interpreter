    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's analyze the initial state of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + +  \n+ - - - - - - - +  \n+ - X - X - @ - +  \n+ - - @ - - $ - +  \n+ - @ * @ X - - +  \n+ X - @ $ - - - +  \n+ - - - - - $ - +  \n+ X - - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is located at row 4, column 5. The goals (X) are located at positions (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 7), and (6, 2). The boxes (@) are located at positions (2, 6), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), and (6, 5).\n\nThe strategy is to move the player to push the boxes onto the goals. We need to ensure that the player can reach the boxes and that the boxes can be moved to the goals without getting stuck.\n\nLet's attempt to solve the puzzle by generating a sequence of moves. We'll use a simple approach to try and solve the puzzle manually, and if needed, we can write a script to explore possible moves.\n\n1. Move the player to the right to push the box at (4, 4) to the right.\n2. Move the player down to push the box at (5, 4) down.\n3. Move the player left to push the box at (6, 5) left.\n4.
