    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial positions are:\n- Player (*) is at (3, 4).\n- Boxes (@) are at (2, 4), (6, 2), and (6, 3).\n- Goals (X) are at (2, 2), (4, 3), and (4, 4).\n\nThe walls (+) and empty spaces (-) define the boundaries and paths.\n\nWe will use a search algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to explore possible moves and find a solution. The BFS will explore all possible states, keeping track of visited states to avoid cycles.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (3, 4),\n    'boxes': {(2, 4), (6, 2), (6, 3)},\n    'goals': {(2, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6),\n              (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6),\n              (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6), (7, 0), (7, 6), (8, 0), (8, 1),\n              (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)},\n    'empty': {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5),\n              (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 1),\n              (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 1),\n              (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5)},\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1),\n}\n\n# Check if the move is valid\ndef is_valid_move(state, move):\n    player_pos = state['player']\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + move[0], player_pos[1] + move[1])\n    \n    if new_player_pos in state['walls']:\n        return False\n    \n    if new_player_pos in state['boxes']:\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move[0], new_player_pos[1] + move[1])\n        if new_box_pos in state['walls'] or new_box_pos in state['boxes']:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Apply the move to the state\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player_pos = state['player']\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + move[0], player_pos[1] + move[1])\n    \n    new_boxes = set(state['boxes'])\n    if new_player_pos in new_boxes:\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player_pos)\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move[0], new_player_pos[1] + move[1])\n        new_boxes.add(new_box_pos)\n    \n    return {\n        'player': new_player_pos,\n        'boxes': new_boxes,\n        'goals': state['goals'],\n        'walls': state['walls'],\n        'empty': state['empty'],\n    }\n\n# Check if the state is a goal state\ndef is_goal_state(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\n# Perform BFS to find the solution\ndef bfs(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((initial_state['player'], frozenset(initial_state['boxes'])))\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_goal_state(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for move_name, move in moves.items():\n            if is_valid_move(current_state, move):\n                new_state = apply_move(current_state, move)\n                state_key = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n                \n                if state_key not in visited:\n                    visited.add(state_key)\n                    queue.append((new_state, path + move_name))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = bfs(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and return the sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.",
