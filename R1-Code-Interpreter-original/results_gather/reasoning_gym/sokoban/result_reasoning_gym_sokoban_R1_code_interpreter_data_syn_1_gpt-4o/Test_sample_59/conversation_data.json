    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial positions are:\n- Player (*) is at (7, 2).\n- Boxes (@) are at (1, 3), (2, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2).\n- Goals (X) are at (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1).\n\nThe walls (+) and empty spaces (-) define the boundaries and paths.\n\nWe will use a search algorithm to explore possible moves. A common approach is to use Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the state space. We will implement a simple BFS to find the solution.\n\nLet's write the code to solve the puzzle using BFS:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (7, 2),\n    'boxes': {(1, 3), (2, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2)},\n    'goals': {(1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7),\n              (1, 0), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 7),\n              (5, 0), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 7), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2),\n              (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7)},\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1),\n}\n\n# Check if the move is valid\ndef is_valid_move(state, move):\n    player_pos = state['player']\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + move[0], player_pos[1] + move[1])\n    \n    if new_player_pos in state['walls']:\n        return False\n    \n    if new_player_pos in state['boxes']:\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move[0], new_player_pos[1] + move[1])\n        if new_box_pos in state['walls'] or new_box_pos in state['boxes']:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Apply the move to the state\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player_pos = state['player']\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + move[0], player_pos[1] + move[1])\n    \n    new_boxes = set(state['boxes'])\n    if new_player_pos in new_boxes:\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player_pos)\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move[0], new_player_pos[1] + move[1])\n        new_boxes.add(new_box_pos)\n    \n    return {\n        'player': new_player_pos,\n        'boxes': new_boxes,\n        'goals': state['goals'],\n        'walls': state['walls'],\n    }\n\n# Check if the state is a goal state\ndef is_goal_state(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\n# Perform BFS to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_goal_state(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for move_name, move in moves.items():\n            if is_valid_move(current_state, move):\n                new_state = apply_move(current_state, move)\n                state_key = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n                \n                if state_key not in visited:\n                    visited.add(state_key)\n                    queue.append((new_state, path + move_name))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will execute a BFS to find the sequence of moves that solves the Sokoban puzzle.

    "The timeout error indicates that the search algorithm is taking too long to find a solution. This can happen if the search space is too large or if the algorithm is not efficient enough. To address this, we can try optimizing the search process or using a different approach.\n\nOne way to optimize the search is to implement a more efficient algorithm, such as A* search, which uses heuristics to guide the search towards the goal more quickly. We can also try to reduce the state space by pruning unnecessary states.\n\nLet's implement an A* search algorithm with a simple heuristic: the sum of the Manhattan distances from each box to the nearest goal.

    "The error occurs because the priority queue (heap) is trying to compare dictionaries, which is not supported. This happens because the state is stored as a dictionary, and when two states have the same priority, the heap tries to compare the states themselves.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that the heap only compares the priority values and not the states themselves.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are going to solve a 'sokoban' puzzle.\n\n* - The player\n% - The player on a goal\n@ - A box\nX - A goal\n$ - A box on a goal\n+ - A wall\n- - An empty position\n\nYour solution must be a string of characters enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<a string of characters>>>., ex: LDURRUDL.\n\nHere is your puzzle:\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ - X @ - X X +  \n+ - - - - @ - +  \n+ - - - - X - +  \n+ - @ @ - - + +  \n+ - @ - - - X +  \n+ X @ - $ - - +  \n+ * - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n\n",
