    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial positions are:\n- Player (*) is at (7, 5).\n- Boxes (@) are at (6, 4), (8, 4), and (8, 6).\n- Goals (X) are at (5, 5), (6, 3), and (8, 3).\n\nThe walls (+) define the boundaries and obstacles in the puzzle.\n\nWe will use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a solution.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are going to solve a 'sokoban' puzzle.\n\n* - The player\n% - The player on a goal\n@ - A box\nX - A goal\n$ - A box on a goal\n+ - A wall\n- - An empty position\n\nYour solution must be a string of characters enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<a string of characters>>>., ex: LDURRUDL.\n\nHere is your puzzle:\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ + + $ + + +  \n+ + + $ + + +  \n+ + + + $ $ +  \n+ - - - - - +  \n+ - - - - X +  \n+ - X - @ - +  \n+ - - - @ * +  \n+ - - X @ - +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n\n",
