    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial positions are:\n- Player (*) is at (3, 5).\n- Boxes (@) are at (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 2), and (8, 4).\n- Goals (X) are at (1, 5), (4, 4), and (7, 1).\n\nThe walls (+) and empty spaces (-) define the boundaries and paths the player can take.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, we can use a search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore possible moves.

    "It seems that the current approach is not yielding a solution. Let's take a step back and re-evaluate the problem.

    "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that Python's `heapq` module requires the elements being compared to be of types that support comparison operations. In this case, the `heapq` is trying to compare dictionaries, which is not supported.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that the elements in the priority queue are tuples where the first element is the priority (a number), and the rest of the elements are not compared by the heap. We can achieve this by ensuring that the priority (cost + heuristic) is the first element in the tuple, and the rest of the elements are just data that doesn't need to be compared.\n\nLet's fix the code by ensuring the priority queue only compares the priority value:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (3, 5),\n    'boxes': {(2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 2), (8, 4)},\n    'goals': {(1, 5), (4, 4), (7, 1), (8, 5)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6),\n              (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6),\n              (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6),\n              (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6),\n              (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6),\n              (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6),\n              (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6),\n              (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6),\n              (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6),\n              (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)},\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1),\n}\n\n# Heuristic function: sum of Manhattan distances from each box to the nearest goal\ndef heuristic(state):\n    total_distance = 0\n    for box in state['boxes']:\n        min_distance = min(abs(box[0] - goal[0]) + abs(box[1] - goal[1]) for goal in state['goals'])\n        total_distance += min_distance\n    return total_distance\n\n# Check if a move is valid\ndef is_valid_move(state, move):\n    player_pos = state['player']\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + move[0], player_pos[1] + move[1])\n    \n    if new_player_pos in state['walls']:\n        return False\n    \n    if new_player_pos in state['boxes']:\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move[0], new_player_pos[1] + move[1])\n        if new_box_pos in state['walls'] or new_box_pos in state['boxes']:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Apply a move to the state\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player_pos = state['player']\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + move[0], player_pos[1] + move[1])\n    \n    new_boxes = set(state['boxes'])\n    if new_player_pos in new_boxes:\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player_pos)\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move[0], new_player_pos[1] + move[1])\n        new_boxes.add(new_box_pos)\n    \n    return {\n        'player': new_player_pos,\n        'boxes': new_boxes,\n        'goals': state['goals'],\n        'walls': state['walls'],\n    }\n\n# Check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\n# Perform an A* search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    priority_queue = []\n    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (0 + heuristic(initial_state), 0, initial_state, \"\"))\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while priority_queue:\n        _, cost, current_state, path = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)\n        \n        if is_solved(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for move_name, move in moves.items():\n            if is_valid_move(current_state, move):\n                new_state = apply_move(current_state, move)\n                state_key = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n                \n                if state_key not in visited:\n                    visited.add(state_key)\n                    new_cost = cost + 1\n                    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (new_cost + heuristic(new_state), new_cost, new_state, path + move_name))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code ensures that the priority queue only compares the priority value (cost + heuristic) and not the entire state. Let's execute the code to see if it finds a solution."
