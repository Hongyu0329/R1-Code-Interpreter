    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ X - - - +  \n+ + - - - +  \n+ - - @ - +  \n+ - - - - +  \n+ - X @ - +  \n+ $ $ - - +  \n+ * @ X - +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is located at the bottom row, second from the right.\n- There are three boxes (@) and three goals (X).\n- Two boxes are already on goals ($).\n\nThe strategy is to move the player to push the remaining box onto the goal. We need to ensure that the player can reach the box and that the box can be pushed to a goal without getting stuck.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find a solution for this puzzle. The script will simulate the player's movements and check if the boxes can be moved to the goals.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = [\n    ['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+'],\n    ['+', 'X', '-', '-', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '+', '-', '-', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', '-', '@', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', '-', '-', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', 'X', '@', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '$', '$', '-', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '*', '@', 'X', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+']\n]\n\n# Define the goal state\ngoal_state = [\n    ['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+'],\n    ['+', 'X', '-', '-', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '+', '-', '-', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', '-', '-', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', '-', '-', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', 'X', '-', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '$', '$', '-', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', '$', 'X', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+']\n]\n\n# Define the possible moves\nmoves = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}\n\n# Find the player's initial position\ndef find_player(state):\n    for r, row in enumerate(state):\n        for c, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*' or cell == '%':\n                return r, c\n    return None\n\n# Check if the current state is the goal state\ndef is_goal(state):\n    for r in range(len(state)):\n        for c in range(len(state[0])):\n            if state[r][c] == '@' and goal_state[r][c] != 'X':\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Apply a move to the current state\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    r, c = find_player(state)\n    dr, dc = moves[move]\n    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n    nnr, nnc = nr + dr, nc + dc\n\n    # Check if the move is valid\n    if state[nr][nc] in ('-', 'X'):\n        # Move the player\n        new_state = [row[:] for row in state]\n        new_state[r][c] = '-' if state[r][c] == '*' else 'X'\n        new_state[nr][nc] = '*' if state[nr][nc] == '-' else '%'\n        return new_state\n    elif state[nr][nc] in ('@', '$') and state[nnr][nnc] in ('-', 'X'):\n        # Push the box\n        new_state = [row[:] for row in state]\n        new_state[r][c] = '-' if state[r][c] == '*' else 'X'\n        new_state[nr][nc] = '*' if state[nr][nc] == '@' else '%'\n        new_state[nnr][nnc] = '@' if state[nnr][nnc] == '-' else '$'\n        return new_state\n    return None\n\n# Perform a breadth-first search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(tuple(map(tuple, initial_state)))\n\n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n\n        if is_goal(current_state):\n            return path\n\n        for move in moves:\n            new_state = apply_move(current_state, move)\n            if new_state and tuple(map(tuple, new_state)) not in visited:\n                visited.add(tuple(map(tuple, new_state)))\n                queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n\n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script uses a breadth-first search to explore all possible moves from the initial state. It checks if the current state matches the goal state and returns the sequence of moves if a solution is found. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
