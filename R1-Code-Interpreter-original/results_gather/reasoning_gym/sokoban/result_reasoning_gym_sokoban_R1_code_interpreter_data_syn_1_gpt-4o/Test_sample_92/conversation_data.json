    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the initial state of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + + X @ - $ +  \n+ * - - @ - - +  \n+ - @ X - - X +  \n+ - $ - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is at position (2, 1).\n- There are three boxes (@) at positions (1, 4), (2, 4), and (3, 2).\n- There are three goals (X) at positions (1, 3), (3, 3), and (3, 6).\n- One box is already on a goal ($) at position (1, 6).\n\nThe goal is to move the boxes onto the goals using the player. We need to find a sequence of moves that accomplishes this.\n\nTo solve this, we can use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a solution. Let's implement a simple search algorithm to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = (\n    (1, 4),  # Box 1 position\n    (2, 4),  # Box 2 position\n    (3, 2),  # Box 3 position\n    (2, 1)   # Player position\n)\n\n# Define the goal positions\ngoal_positions = {(1, 3), (3, 3), (3, 6)}\n\n# Define the walls\nwalls = {\n    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7),\n    (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 7),\n    (2, 0), (2, 7),\n    (3, 0), (3, 7),\n    (4, 0), (4, 7),\n    (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7)\n}\n\n# Define the possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\n# Check if a position is within bounds and not a wall\ndef is_valid_position(pos):\n    return pos not in walls\n\n# Check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(state):\n    boxes = state[:3]\n    return all(box in goal_positions for box in boxes)\n\n# Perform a move\ndef move(state, direction):\n    boxes = list(state[:3])\n    player = state[3]\n    move_offset = moves[direction]\n    new_player = (player[0] + move_offset[0], player[1] + move_offset[1])\n\n    if not is_valid_position(new_player):\n        return None\n\n    if new_player in boxes:\n        box_index = boxes.index(new_player)\n        new_box = (boxes[box_index][0] + move_offset[0], boxes[box_index][1] + move_offset[1])\n        if not is_valid_position(new_box) or new_box in boxes:\n            return None\n        boxes[box_index] = new_box\n\n    return tuple(boxes) + (new_player,)\n\n# Breadth-first search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n\n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n\n        if is_solved(current_state):\n            return path\n\n        for direction in moves:\n            new_state = move(current_state, direction)\n            if new_state and new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + direction))\n\n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code uses a breadth-first search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a solution to the Sokoban puzzle. The `solve_sokoban` function returns a string of moves that solves the puzzle. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
