    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial positions are:\n- Player (*) is at (6, 8).\n- Boxes (@) are at (2, 3), (2, 6), (5, 7), and (5, 8).\n- Goals (X) are at (3, 4), (4, 8), (6, 4), and (6, 7).\n\nThe walls (+) and empty spaces (-) define the boundaries and paths for movement.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible states and find the shortest path to the solution. Let's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (6, 8),\n    'boxes': {(2, 3), (2, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)},\n    'goals': {(3, 4), (4, 8), (6, 4), (6, 7)},\n    'walls': {(0, i) for i in range(10)} | {(7, i) for i in range(10)} |\n             {(i, 0) for i in range(8)} | {(i, 9) for i in range(8)} |\n             {(2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)}\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}\n\n# Function to check if a position is within bounds and not a wall\ndef is_valid(pos, walls):\n    return pos not in walls\n\n# Function to apply a move\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player = state['player']\n    boxes = state['boxes']\n    dx, dy = moves[move]\n    new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n    \n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n        if is_valid(new_box, state['walls']) and new_box not in boxes:\n            new_boxes = boxes - {new_player} | {new_box}\n            return {'player': new_player, 'boxes': new_boxes, 'goals': state['goals'], 'walls': state['walls']}\n    elif is_valid(new_player, state['walls']):\n        return {'player': new_player, 'boxes': boxes, 'goals': state['goals'], 'walls': state['walls']}\n    return None\n\n# Function to check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\n# BFS to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((initial_state['player'], frozenset(initial_state['boxes'])))\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for move in moves:\n            new_state = apply_move(current_state, move)\n            if new_state:\n                state_id = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n                if state_id not in visited:\n                    visited.add(state_id)\n                    queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves to solve the Sokoban puzzle.
