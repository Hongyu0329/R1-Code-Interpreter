    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player and push the boxes onto the goals. The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ - - % - - +  \n+ - X @ @ - +  \n+ - - - - - +  \n+ - - - @ X +  \n+ + + - @ - +  \n+ + X $ - - +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player is currently on a goal at position (1, 3).\n- There are three boxes: at positions (2, 3), (2, 4), and (4, 4).\n- There are three goals: at positions (1, 3), (2, 2), and (6, 3).\n\nThe strategy is to move the player to push the boxes onto the goals. We need to ensure that the player can reach the boxes and that the boxes can be moved to the goals without getting stuck.\n\nLet's write a Python script to help us find a solution. We'll use a simple search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a sequence that solves the puzzle.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = (\n    (1, 3),  # Player position\n    ((2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 4))  # Box positions\n)\n\n# Define the goal positions\ngoal_positions = {(1, 3), (2, 2), (6, 3)}\n\n# Define the walls\nwalls = {\n    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6),\n    (1, 0), (1, 6),\n    (2, 0), (2, 6),\n    (3, 0), (3, 6),\n    (4, 0), (4, 6),\n    (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6),\n    (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6),\n    (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6)\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1),\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0)\n}\n\ndef is_goal_state(box_positions):\n    return all(pos in goal_positions for pos in box_positions)\n\ndef is_valid_position(pos, box_positions):\n    return pos not in walls and pos not in box_positions\n\ndef move_player(player_pos, direction, box_positions):\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + direction[0], player_pos[1] + direction[1])\n    if not is_valid_position(new_player_pos, box_positions):\n        return None, None\n    if new_player_pos in box_positions:\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + direction[0], new_player_pos[1] + direction[1])\n        if not is_valid_position(new_box_pos, box_positions):\n            return None, None\n        new_box_positions = tuple(\n            new_box_pos if pos == new_player_pos else pos for pos in box_positions\n        )\n        return new_player_pos, new_box_positions\n    return new_player_pos, box_positions\n\ndef solve_sokoban():\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n\n    while queue:\n        (player_pos, box_positions), path = queue.popleft()\n\n        if is_goal_state(box_positions):\n            return path\n\n        for move, direction in moves.items():\n            new_player_pos, new_box_positions = move_player(player_pos, direction, box_positions)\n            if new_player_pos is not None:\n                new_state = (new_player_pos, new_box_positions)\n                if new_state not in visited:\n                    visited.add(new_state)\n                    queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n\n    return None\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban()\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible moves from the initial state.
