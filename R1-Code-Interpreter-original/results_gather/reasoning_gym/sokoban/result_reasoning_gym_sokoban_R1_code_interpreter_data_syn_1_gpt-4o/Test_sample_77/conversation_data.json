    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + $ + + + + +  \n+ + + - X - - +  \n+ - - - - $ - +  \n+ - - @ @ * - +  \n+ X - - $ - - +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is located at position (4, 6).\n- There are boxes (@) at positions (4, 4) and (4, 5).\n- There are goals (X) at positions (2, 4) and (5, 2).\n- There are boxes on goals ($) at positions (1, 2) and (3, 5).\n\nThe goal is to move the boxes (@) to the goals (X) while ensuring that the player can move around the board without getting stuck.\n\nTo solve this, we can use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a sequence that solves the puzzle.

    "The output being `None` indicates that the search algorithm did not find a solution. This could be due to several reasons, such as the search space not being explored correctly or the state transitions not being handled properly.
