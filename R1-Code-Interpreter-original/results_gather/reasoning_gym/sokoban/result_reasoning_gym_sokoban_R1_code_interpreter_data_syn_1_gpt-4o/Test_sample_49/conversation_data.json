    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial positions are:\n- Player (*) is at (3, 2).\n- Boxes (@) are at (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 7), (5, 2), (5, 7), (6, 4), and (6, 7).\n- Goals (X) are at (3, 5), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), and (6, 6).\n\nThe walls (+) and empty spaces (-) define the boundaries and paths.\n\nWe will use a search algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to explore possible moves and find a solution. The BFS will explore all possible states, keeping track of visited states to avoid cycles.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef sokoban_solver():\n    # Define the initial state\n    initial_state = {\n        'player': (3, 2),\n        'boxes': {(2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 7), (5, 2), (5, 7), (6, 4), (6, 7)},\n        'goals': {(3, 5), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 6)},\n        'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9),\n                  (1, 0), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 9),\n                  (6, 0), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2),\n                  (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9)},\n    }\n    \n    # Define possible moves\n    moves = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}\n    \n    # BFS setup\n    queue = deque([(initial_state['player'], frozenset(initial_state['boxes']), \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        player, boxes, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if all boxes are on goals\n        if boxes == initial_state['goals']:\n            return path\n        \n        # Explore possible moves\n        for move, (dx, dy) in moves.items():\n            new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n            \n            if new_player in initial_state['walls']:\n                continue\n            \n            if new_player in boxes:\n                new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n                if new_box in initial_state['walls'] or new_box in boxes:\n                    continue\n                new_boxes = set(boxes)\n                new_boxes.remove(new_player)\n                new_boxes.add(new_box)\n                new_boxes = frozenset(new_boxes)\n            else:\n                new_boxes = boxes\n            \n            if (new_player, new_boxes) not in visited:\n                visited.add((new_player, new_boxes))\n                queue.append((new_player, new_boxes, path + move))\n    \n    return \"No solution found\"\n\n# Execute the solver\nsolution = sokoban_solver()\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a solution to the Sokoban puzzle using BFS.

    "The timeout error indicates that the search algorithm took too long to find a solution. This can happen if the search space is too large or if the algorithm is not optimized for the specific problem.\n\nTo address this, we can try the following optimizations:\n\n1. **Heuristic Search**: Implement a heuristic-based search like A* to prioritize moves that seem more promising.

    "The timeout issue persists, indicating that the search space is still too large or the heuristic is not guiding the search effectively enough. To address this, we can try further optimizations:\n\n1. **Improved Heuristic**: Use a more sophisticated heuristic that better estimates the cost to reach the goal.

    "The error indicates that the `heuristic` function is not defined within the scope of the `sokoban_solver` function. This is because the `heuristic` function was defined outside of the `sokoban_solver` function, and it needs to be accessible within it.\n\nLet's fix this by ensuring that the `heuristic` function is defined within the scope of the `sokoban_solver` function.
