    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial state of the puzzle is as follows:\n- Player (*) is at position (1, 7).\n- Boxes (@) are at positions (3, 4), (4, 4), and (6, 5).\n- Goals (X) are at positions (1, 5), (3, 3), (4, 3), and (4, 5).\n\nThe goal is to move the boxes onto the goals. We will use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a solution.\n\nLet's implement a search algorithm to solve the puzzle. We'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the state space of the puzzle.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (1, 7),\n    'boxes': {(3, 4), (4, 4), (6, 5)},\n    'goals': {(1, 5), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 5)}\n}\n\n# Define the walls and the grid size\nwalls = {\n    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8),\n    (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 8),\n    (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 8),\n    (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8),\n    (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 8),\n    (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 8),\n    (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 8),\n    (7, 0), (7, 8),\n    (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\n# Function to check if a position is within bounds and not a wall\ndef is_valid_position(pos):\n    return pos not in walls\n\n# Function to apply a move\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player = state['player']\n    boxes = state['boxes']\n    dx, dy = moves[move]\n    new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n    \n    if new_player in walls:\n        return None\n    \n    new_boxes = set(boxes)\n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n        if new_box in walls or new_box in boxes:\n            return None\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player)\n        new_boxes.add(new_box)\n    \n    return {\n        'player': new_player,\n        'boxes': new_boxes,\n        'goals': state['goals']\n    }\n\n# Function to check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\n# Breadth-first search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((initial_state['player'], frozenset(initial_state['boxes'])))\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for move in moves:\n            new_state = apply_move(current_state, move)\n            if new_state is None:\n                continue\n            \n            state_key = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n            if state_key not in visited:\n                visited.add(state_key)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will execute a breadth-first search to find a sequence of moves that solves the Sokoban puzzle.
