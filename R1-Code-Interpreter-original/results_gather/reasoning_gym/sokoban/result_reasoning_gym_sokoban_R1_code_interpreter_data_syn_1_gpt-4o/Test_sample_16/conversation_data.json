    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ - X - - @ - + + +  \n+ - @ X - - - + + +  \n+ - - - - - - + + +  \n+ - $ - X + - + + +  \n+ - - @ $ + - + + +  \n+ - $ * @ X - $ + +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is located at position (6, 4). The goal is to move the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The current positions of the boxes and goals are:\n\n- Boxes (@): (1, 4), (2, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 5)\n- Goals (X): (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 3), (6, 5)\n\nThe player (*) is currently on a goal, which is marked as % in the puzzle. The player needs to move the boxes onto the goals while ensuring that no box gets stuck in a corner or against a wall where it cannot be moved further.\n\nTo solve this puzzle, we can use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a sequence that solves the puzzle.
