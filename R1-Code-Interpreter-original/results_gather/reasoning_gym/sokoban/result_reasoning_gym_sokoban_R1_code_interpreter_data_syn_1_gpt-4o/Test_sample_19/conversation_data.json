    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player and push the boxes onto the goals. The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\n### Initial Analysis\n- The player is currently on a goal, represented by `%`.\n- There are several boxes (`@`) and goals (`X`) scattered throughout the grid.\n- The player can push a box if there is an empty space or a goal behind it.\n\n### Strategy\n1. Identify the positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Use a search algorithm to explore possible moves.\n3. Ensure that each move is valid (i.e., the player can move to the position, and if pushing a box, the box can be moved to an empty space or a goal).\n4. Keep track of the state of the board after each move.\n5. Stop when all boxes are on goals.\n\n### Implementation\nWe'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the possible moves. This approach is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the board\ninitial_board = [\n    \"+ + + + + + +\",\n    \"+ $ + - - X +\",\n    \"+ - - - - - +\",\n    \"+ - - - @ - +\",\n    \"+ - X - @ - +\",\n    \"+ - - - X - +\",\n    \"+ - - @ X X +\",\n    \"+ - - - @ @ +\",\n    \"+ - - - @ % +\",\n    \"+ + + + + + +\"\n]\n\n# Convert the board into a more manageable format\nboard = [list(row.split()) for row in initial_board]\n\n# Define the directions for movement\ndirections = {'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1), 'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0)}\n\n# Find the initial position of the player\ndef find_player(board):\n    for r, row in enumerate(board):\n        for c, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*' or cell == '%':\n                return r, c\n    return None\n\n# Check if a move is valid\ndef is_valid_move(board, r, c, dr, dc):\n    if board[r + dr][c + dc] in ('-', 'X'):  # Move to empty or goal\n        return True\n    if board[r + dr][c + dc] in ('@', '$'):  # Move to box\n        if board[r + 2*dr][c + 2*dc] in ('-', 'X'):  # Box can be pushed\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Apply a move to the board\ndef apply_move(board, r, c, dr, dc):\n    new_board = [row[:] for row in board]\n    if new_board[r + dr][c + dc] in ('-', 'X'):  # Move to empty or goal\n        new_board[r][c] = '-' if new_board[r][c] == '*' else 'X'\n        new_board[r + dr][c + dc] = '*' if new_board[r + dr][c + dc] == '-' else '%'\n    elif new_board[r + dr][c + dc] in ('@', '$'):  # Move to box\n        new_board[r][c] = '-' if new_board[r][c] == '*' else 'X'\n        new_board[r + dr][c + dc] = '*' if new_board[r + dr][c + dc] == '@' else '%'\n        new_board[r + 2*dr][c + 2*dc] = '@' if new_board[r + 2*dr][c + 2*dc] == '-' else '$'\n    return new_board\n\n# Check if the board is solved\ndef is_solved(board):\n    for row in board:\n        for cell in row:\n            if cell == '@':\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Perform BFS to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(board):\n    start = find_player(board)\n    queue = deque([(board, start, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(tuple(map(tuple, board)))\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_board, (r, c), path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved(current_board):\n            return path\n        \n        for move, (dr, dc) in directions.items():\n            if is_valid_move(current_board, r, c, dr, dc):\n                new_board = apply_move(current_board, r, c, dr, dc)\n                new_state = tuple(map(tuple, new_board))\n                if new_state not in visited:\n                    visited.add(new_state)\n                    queue.append((new_board, (r + dr, c + dc), path + move))\n    \n    return \"No solution\"\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(board)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the sequence of moves that solves the Sokoban puzzle.
