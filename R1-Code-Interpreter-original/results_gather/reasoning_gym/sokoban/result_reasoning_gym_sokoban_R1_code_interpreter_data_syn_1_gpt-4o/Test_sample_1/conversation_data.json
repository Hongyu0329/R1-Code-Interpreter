    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial state of the puzzle is as follows:\n\n- Player position: (3, 7) (marked as %)\n- Box positions: (2, 2), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7)\n- Goal positions: (1, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 9)\n\nThe walls (+) and empty spaces (-) define the boundaries and paths the player can take.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, we can use a search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore possible moves.

    "The timeout error suggests that the search space is still too large, and the algorithm is not efficiently finding a solution within the time limit. To address this, we can try a few optimizations:\n\n1. **Prune Redundant States**: Avoid revisiting states that have already been explored.\n2. **Improve Heuristic**: Use a more informed heuristic to guide the search more effectively.\n3. **Limit Search Depth**: Implement a depth limit to prevent the search from going too deep without progress.\n\nLet's focus on improving the heuristic and ensuring that we efficiently prune redundant states. We can also add a depth limit to prevent the search from going too deep.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (3, 7),\n    'boxes': {(2, 2), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7)},\n    'goals': {(1, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 9)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9),\n              (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 9),\n              (2, 0), (2, 8), (2, 9),\n              (3, 0), (3, 8), (3, 9),\n              (4, 0), (4, 9),\n              (5, 0), (5, 9),\n              (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9)},\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\n# Function to check if a move is valid\ndef is_valid_move(state, move):\n    player_pos = state['player']\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + move[0], player_pos[1] + move[1])\n    \n    # Check if the new player position is a wall\n    if new_player_pos in state['walls']:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the new player position is a box\n    if new_player_pos in state['boxes']:\n        # Calculate the new box position\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move[0], new_player_pos[1] + move[1])\n        # Check if the new box position is a wall or another box\n        if new_box_pos in state['walls'] or new_box_pos in state['boxes']:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Function to apply a move\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player_pos = state['player']\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + move[0], player_pos[1] + move[1])\n    \n    new_boxes = set(state['boxes'])\n    \n    # Check if the new player position is a box\n    if new_player_pos in state['boxes']:\n        # Calculate the new box position\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move[0], new_player_pos[1] + move[1])\n        # Move the box\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player_pos)\n        new_boxes.add(new_box_pos)\n    \n    return {\n        'player': new_player_pos,\n        'boxes': new_boxes,\n        'goals': state['goals'],\n        'walls': state['walls']\n    }\n\n# Function to check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\n# Heuristic function: sum of Manhattan distances from each box to the nearest goal\ndef heuristic(state):\n    total_distance = 0\n    for box in state['boxes']:\n        min_distance = min(abs(box[0] - goal[0]) + abs(box[1] - goal[1]) for goal in state['goals'])\n        total_distance += min_distance\n    return total_distance\n\n# A* Search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    priority_queue = []\n    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (0 + heuristic(initial_state), 0, id(initial_state), initial_state, \"\"))\n    visited = set()\n    depth_limit = 100  # Set a reasonable depth limit\n    \n    while priority_queue:\n        _, cost, _, current_state, path = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)\n        \n        if is_solved(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        if len(path) > depth_limit:\n            continue\n        \n        for move_name, move in moves.items():\n            if is_valid_move(current_state, move):\n                new_state = apply_move(current_state, move)\n                state_key = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n                \n                if state_key not in visited:\n                    visited.add(state_key)\n                    new_cost = cost + 1\n                    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (new_cost + heuristic(new_state), new_cost, id(new_state), new_state, path + move_name))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nIn this version, I've added a depth limit to prevent the search from going too deep without progress.
