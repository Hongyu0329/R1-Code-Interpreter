    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ - @ - - X +  \n+ - - X @ - +  \n+ - X - @ * +  \n+ - - - $ - +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is located at position (3, 5).\n- There are three boxes (@) located at positions (1, 2), (2, 4), and (3, 4).\n- There are three goals (X) located at positions (1, 5), (2, 3), and (3, 2).\n- One box is already on a goal ($) at position (4, 4).\n\nThe task is to find a sequence of moves to push all boxes onto the goals. We will use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a solution.\n\nLet's implement a search algorithm to solve this puzzle.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_goal(state):\n    # Check if all boxes are on goals\n    return all(pos in state['goals'] for pos in state['boxes'])\n\ndef get_next_states(state):\n    # Generate all possible next states from the current state\n    directions = {'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1), 'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0)}\n    next_states = []\n    \n    for move, (dr, dc) in directions.items():\n        new_player = (state['player'][0] + dr, state['player'][1] + dc)\n        \n        if state['grid'][new_player[0]][new_player[1]] == '+':\n            continue  # Wall, can't move\n        \n        if new_player in state['boxes']:\n            new_box = (new_player[0] + dr, new_player[1] + dc)\n            if state['grid'][new_box[0]][new_box[1]] in '+@':\n                continue  # Wall or another box, can't push\n            \n            new_boxes = set(state['boxes'])\n            new_boxes.remove(new_player)\n            new_boxes.add(new_box)\n            next_states.append((move, {'player': new_player, 'boxes': new_boxes, 'goals': state['goals'], 'grid': state['grid']}))\n        else:\n            next_states.append((move, {'player': new_player, 'boxes': state['boxes'], 'goals': state['goals'], 'grid': state['grid']}))\n    \n    return next_states\n\ndef solve_sokoban(grid, player, boxes, goals):\n    initial_state = {'player': player, 'boxes': set(boxes), 'goals': set(goals), 'grid': grid}\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_goal(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        state_id = (current_state['player'], frozenset(current_state['boxes']))\n        if state_id in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add(state_id)\n        \n        for move, next_state in get_next_states(current_state):\n            queue.append((next_state, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Define the grid and initial positions\ngrid = [\n    ['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', '@', '-', '-', 'X', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', '-', 'X', '@', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', 'X', '-', '@', '*', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', '-', '-', '$', '-', '+'],\n    ['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+']\n]\n\nplayer = (3, 5)\nboxes = [(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 4)]\ngoals = [(1, 5), (2, 3), (3, 2)]\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban(grid, player, boxes, goals)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a solution to the Sokoban puzzle using a breadth-first search algorithm.
