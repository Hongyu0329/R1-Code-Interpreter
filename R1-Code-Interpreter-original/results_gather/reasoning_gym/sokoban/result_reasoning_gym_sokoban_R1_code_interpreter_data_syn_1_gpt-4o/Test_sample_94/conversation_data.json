    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. The player (*) is initially at position (4, 4).\n2. There are three boxes (@) at positions (2, 4), (2, 6), and (3, 5).\n3. There are three goals (X) at positions (2, 3), (3, 3), and (4, 7).\n4. The walls (+) form the boundaries of the puzzle.\n\nThe goal is to move the boxes onto the goals using the player. The player can only push one box at a time and cannot move through walls or boxes.\n\nTo solve this, we can use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a sequence that solves the puzzle. Let's implement a simple search algorithm to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = (\n    (2, 4),  # Box 1 position\n    (2, 6),  # Box 2 position\n    (3, 5),  # Box 3 position\n    (4, 4)   # Player position\n)\n\n# Define the goal positions\ngoals = {(2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 7)}\n\n# Define the walls\nwalls = {\n    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9),\n    (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 8), (1, 9),\n    (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 9),\n    (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 8), (3, 9),\n    (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 8), (4, 9),\n    (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9)\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\ndef is_goal(state):\n    boxes = state[:3]\n    return all(box in goals for box in boxes)\n\ndef is_valid_move(state, move):\n    boxes, player = state[:3], state[3]\n    dx, dy = moves[move]\n    new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n    \n    if new_player in walls:\n        return False\n    \n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n        if new_box in walls or new_box in boxes:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    boxes, player = list(state[:3]), state[3]\n    dx, dy = moves[move]\n    new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n    \n    if new_player in boxes:\n        box_index = boxes.index(new_player)\n        boxes[box_index] = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n    \n    return tuple(boxes + [new_player])\n\ndef solve_sokoban():\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_goal(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for move in moves:\n            if is_valid_move(current_state, move):\n                new_state = apply_move(current_state, move)\n                if new_state not in visited:\n                    visited.add(new_state)\n                    queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    \n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban()\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible moves from the initial state. It checks if each move is valid and applies it to generate a new state. If a state is a goal state, it returns the path of moves that led to it. If no solution is found, it returns \"No solution found\". Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and found a solution to the Sokoban puzzle.
