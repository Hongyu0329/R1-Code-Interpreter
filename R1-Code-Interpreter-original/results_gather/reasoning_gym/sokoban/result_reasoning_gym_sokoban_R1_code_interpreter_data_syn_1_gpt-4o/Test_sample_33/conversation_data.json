    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the initial positions**: We need to know where the player, boxes, and goals are located.\n2. **Define the rules**: The player can move in four directions, but can only push a box if there is an empty space or a goal behind it.\n3. **Plan a strategy**: We need to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nTo solve this, we can use a search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore possible moves. We'll implement a simple BFS to find the solution.\n\nLet's write the code to solve the puzzle:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = [\n    \"+ + + + + + + + +\",\n    \"+ - - - - - - - +\",\n    \"+ X - @ X - @ - +\",\n    \"+ @ X @ - @ @ X +\",\n    \"+ - - - - X - - +\",\n    \"+ - * @ X - - - +\",\n    \"+ - - - X - - - +\",\n    \"+ + + + + + + + +\"\n]\n\n# Convert the initial state into a more manageable format\ndef parse_state(state):\n    grid = [list(row.replace(\" \", \"\")) for row in state]\n    player_pos = None\n    boxes = set()\n    goals = set()\n    \n    for r, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for c, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*':\n                player_pos = (r, c)\n            elif cell == '@':\n                boxes.add((r, c))\n            elif cell == 'X':\n                goals.add((r, c))\n            elif cell == '$':\n                boxes.add((r, c))\n                goals.add((r, c))\n            elif cell == '%':\n                player_pos = (r, c)\n                goals.add((r, c))\n    \n    return grid, player_pos, boxes, goals\n\n# Check if the current state is a winning state\ndef is_winning(boxes, goals):\n    return boxes == goals\n\n# Get possible moves from the current position\ndef get_moves(grid, player_pos, boxes):\n    directions = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}\n    moves = []\n    \n    for move, (dr, dc) in directions.items():\n        new_r, new_c = player_pos[0] + dr, player_pos[1] + dc\n        if grid[new_r][new_c] in '-X':\n            moves.append((move, (new_r, new_c), boxes))\n        elif (new_r, new_c) in boxes:\n            box_new_r, box_new_c = new_r + dr, new_c + dc\n            if grid[box_new_r][box_new_c] in '-X' and (box_new_r, box_new_c) not in boxes:\n                new_boxes = boxes - {(new_r, new_c)} | {(box_new_r, box_new_c)}\n                moves.append((move, (new_r, new_c), new_boxes))\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Perform BFS to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    grid, player_pos, boxes, goals = parse_state(initial_state)\n    queue = deque([(player_pos, boxes, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        player_pos, boxes, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_winning(boxes, goals):\n            return path\n        \n        for move, new_player_pos, new_boxes in get_moves(grid, player_pos, boxes):\n            state = (new_player_pos, frozenset(new_boxes))\n            if state not in visited:\n                visited.add(state)\n                queue.append((new_player_pos, new_boxes, path + move))\n    \n    return \"No solution\"\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will execute a BFS to find the shortest sequence of moves to solve the Sokoban puzzle.

    "It seems there might be an issue with the logic or the way the state is being represented and checked.

    "The timeout error suggests that the search algorithm is taking too long to find a solution, possibly due to an inefficient exploration of the state space.
