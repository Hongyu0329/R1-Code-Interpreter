    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ - - - - - * +  \n+ - - - @ @ - +  \n+ - X X - $ - +  \n+ X @ - X @ - +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is initially at position (1, 6).\n- There are four boxes (@) and four goals (X).\n- The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals.\n\nThe strategy involves:\n1. Identifying the positions of the boxes and goals.\n2. Planning a sequence of moves to push each box onto a goal.\n3. Ensuring that the player can reach each box and that the boxes can be moved to the goals without getting stuck.\n\nLet's write a Python script to help us find a solution to this puzzle.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = (\n    (1, 6),  # Player position\n    ((2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5))  # Box positions\n)\n\n# Define the goal positions\ngoal_positions = {(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\n# Define the walls\nwalls = {\n    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7),\n    (1, 0), (1, 7),\n    (2, 0), (2, 7),\n    (3, 0), (3, 7),\n    (4, 0), (4, 7),\n    (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7)\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\n# Function to check if a position is within bounds and not a wall\ndef is_valid_position(pos):\n    return pos not in walls\n\n# Function to apply a move\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player_pos, box_positions = state\n    move_delta = moves[move]\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + move_delta[0], player_pos[1] + move_delta[1])\n    \n    if not is_valid_position(new_player_pos):\n        return None\n    \n    new_box_positions = set(box_positions)\n    if new_player_pos in box_positions:\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move_delta[0], new_player_pos[1] + move_delta[1])\n        if not is_valid_position(new_box_pos) or new_box_pos in box_positions:\n            return None\n        new_box_positions.remove(new_player_pos)\n        new_box_positions.add(new_box_pos)\n    \n    return (new_player_pos, tuple(sorted(new_box_positions)))\n\n# Breadth-first search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if set(current_state[1]) == goal_positions:\n            return path\n        \n        for move in moves:\n            new_state = apply_move(current_state, move)\n            if new_state and new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible sequences of moves until it finds a solution where all boxes are on the goals.

The `solve_sokoban` function performs the BFS to find the solution path.\n\nLet's execute the code to find the solution.",
