    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the initial state of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ + - - - - - + $ +  \n+ - - - - - - + + +  \n+ X - X - - - $ + +  \n+ - @ - - - - + + +  \n+ X - @ @ @ + + + +  \n+ + X - @ % $ + + +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player is currently at position (6, 5) (0-indexed). The goals are at positions (3, 1), (3, 3), (5, 1), and (6, 2). The boxes are at positions (1, 7), (3, 7), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 4).\n\nThe player needs to push the boxes onto the goals. We will use a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle. Let's implement a simple search algorithm to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = [\n    \"++++++++++\",\n    \"++-----+$+\",\n    \"+-------++\",\n    \"+X-X---$++\",\n    \"+-@----+++\",\n    \"+X-@@@++++\",\n    \"++X-@%$+++\",\n    \"++++++++++\"\n]\n\n# Define the goal state\ngoal_state = [\n    \"++++++++++\",\n    \"++-----+-+\",\n    \"+-------++\",\n    \"+X-X---$++\",\n    \"+-@----+++\",\n    \"+X-@@@++++\",\n    \"++X-@$%+++\",\n    \"++++++++++\"\n]\n\n# Define the possible moves\nmoves = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}\n\n# Find the player's initial position\ndef find_player(state):\n    for i, row in enumerate(state):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '%' or cell == '*':\n                return i, j\n    return None\n\n# Check if the current state is the goal state\ndef is_goal(state):\n    return state == goal_state\n\n# Generate the next state after a move\ndef move(state, direction):\n    new_state = [list(row) for row in state]\n    pi, pj = find_player(state)\n    di, dj = moves[direction]\n    ni, nj = pi + di, pj + dj\n    if new_state[ni][nj] in '-X':  # Move to empty or goal\n        new_state[pi][pj] = '-' if new_state[pi][pj] == '*' else 'X'\n        new_state[ni][nj] = '%' if new_state[ni][nj] == 'X' else '*'\n    elif new_state[ni][nj] in '@$':  # Push box\n        nni, nnj = ni + di, nj + dj\n        if new_state[nni][nnj] in '-X':  # Box can be pushed\n            new_state[pi][pj] = '-' if new_state[pi][pj] == '*' else 'X'\n            new_state[ni][nj] = '%' if new_state[ni][nj] == 'X' else '*'\n            new_state[nni][nnj] = '$' if new_state[nni][nnj] == 'X' else '@'\n    return [''.join(row) for row in new_state]\n\n# Perform a breadth-first search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban():\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    while queue:\n        state, path = queue.popleft()\n        if is_goal(state):\n            return path\n        if tuple(state) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add(tuple(state))\n        for direction in moves:\n            new_state = move(state, direction)\n            if tuple(new_state) not in visited:\n                queue.append((new_state, path + direction))\n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban()\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code uses a breadth-first search to explore all possible sequences of moves until it finds a solution. The `solve_sokoban` function returns the sequence of moves that solves the puzzle. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The timeout error indicates that the search algorithm is taking too long to find a solution. This can happen if the search space is too large or if the algorithm is not efficient enough. To address this, we can try optimizing the search process. One common optimization is to use a more efficient search algorithm, such as A* search, which uses heuristics to guide the search.\n\nLet's implement an A* search algorithm to solve the Sokoban puzzle. We'll use a heuristic that estimates the cost to reach the goal by considering the distance of each box to the nearest goal.\n\n```python\nfrom heapq import heappop, heappush\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = [\n    \"++++++++++\",\n    \"++-----+$+\",\n    \"+-------++\",\n    \"+X-X---$++\",\n    \"+-@----+++\",\n    \"+X-@@@++++\",\n    \"++X-@%$+++\",\n    \"++++++++++\"\n]\n\n# Define the goal state\ngoal_positions = {(3, 1), (3, 3), (5, 1), (6, 2)}\n\n# Define the possible moves\nmoves = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}\n\n# Find the player's initial position\ndef find_player(state):\n    for i, row in enumerate(state):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '%' or cell == '*':\n                return i, j\n    return None\n\n# Check if the current state is the goal state\ndef is_goal(state):\n    for i, row in enumerate(state):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '@' and (i, j) not in goal_positions:\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Generate the next state after a move\ndef move(state, direction):\n    new_state = [list(row) for row in state]\n    pi, pj = find_player(state)\n    di, dj = moves[direction]\n    ni, nj = pi + di, pj + dj\n    if new_state[ni][nj] in '-X':  # Move to empty or goal\n        new_state[pi][pj] = '-' if new_state[pi][pj] == '*' else 'X'\n        new_state[ni][nj] = '%' if new_state[ni][nj] == 'X' else '*'\n    elif new_state[ni][nj] in '@$':  # Push box\n        nni, nnj = ni + di, nj + dj\n        if new_state[nni][nnj] in '-X':  # Box can be pushed\n            new_state[pi][pj] = '-' if new_state[pi][pj] == '*' else 'X'\n            new_state[ni][nj] = '%' if new_state[ni][nj] == 'X' else '*'\n            new_state[nni][nnj] = '$' if new_state[nni][nnj] == 'X' else '@'\n    return [''.join(row) for row in new_state]\n\n# Heuristic function: sum of Manhattan distances from each box to the nearest goal\ndef heuristic(state):\n    boxes = [(i, j) for i, row in enumerate(state) for j, cell in enumerate(row) if cell in '@$']\n    return sum(min(abs(bi - gi) + abs(bj - gj) for gi, gj in goal_positions) for bi, bj in boxes)\n\n# Perform an A* search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban():\n    queue = []\n    heappush(queue, (0, initial_state, \"\"))\n    visited = set()\n    while queue:\n        _, state, path = heappop(queue)\n        if is_goal(state):\n            return path\n        if tuple(state) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add(tuple(state))\n        for direction in moves:\n            new_state = move(state, direction)\n            if tuple(new_state) not in visited:\n                cost = len(path) + 1 + heuristic(new_state)\n                heappush(queue, (cost, new_state, path + direction))\n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban()\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code uses an A* search algorithm with a heuristic based on the Manhattan distance from each box to the nearest goal.
