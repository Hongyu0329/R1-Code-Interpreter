    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player and the resulting positions of the boxes.\n3. Use a search algorithm to explore possible sequences of moves, ensuring that boxes are pushed onto goals.\n4. Ensure that the player does not move into walls (+) or push boxes into walls or other boxes.\n\nGiven the complexity of Sokoban puzzles, a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) approach is often used to explore possible moves. However, due to the constraints of this environment, we will attempt a more heuristic approach to find a solution.\n\nLet's start by writing a Python script to explore possible moves and find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = [\n    \"+ + + + + + + + +\",\n    \"+ * @ - - - X $ +\",\n    \"+ @ - @ - X + + +\",\n    \"+ - - - - $ $ $ +\",\n    \"+ - + + + + + + +\",\n    \"+ - - + - - - - +\",\n    \"+ X @ - - + + + +\",\n    \"+ + - @ X + + + +\",\n    \"+ + X + + + + + +\",\n    \"+ + + + + + + + +\"\n]\n\n# Convert the initial state into a more manageable format\ndef parse_state(state):\n    grid = [list(row.split()) for row in state]\n    player_pos = None\n    boxes = set()\n    goals = set()\n    \n    for r, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for c, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*':\n                player_pos = (r, c)\n            elif cell == '@':\n                boxes.add((r, c))\n            elif cell == 'X':\n                goals.add((r, c))\n            elif cell == '$':\n                boxes.add((r, c))\n                goals.add((r, c))\n            elif cell == '%':\n                player_pos = (r, c)\n                goals.add((r, c))\n    \n    return grid, player_pos, boxes, goals\n\n# Check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(boxes, goals):\n    return boxes == goals\n\n# Get possible moves for the player\ndef get_moves(grid, player_pos, boxes):\n    moves = []\n    directions = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}\n    \n    for move, (dr, dc) in directions.items():\n        new_r, new_c = player_pos[0] + dr, player_pos[1] + dc\n        if grid[new_r][new_c] == '+':\n            continue  # Wall\n        if (new_r, new_c) in boxes:\n            # Check if the box can be pushed\n            box_new_r, box_new_c = new_r + dr, new_c + dc\n            if grid[box_new_r][box_new_c] == '+' or (box_new_r, box_new_c) in boxes:\n                continue  # Wall or another box\n            moves.append((move, (new_r, new_c), (box_new_r, box_new_c)))\n        else:\n            moves.append((move, (new_r, new_c), None))\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Perform a breadth-first search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    grid, player_pos, boxes, goals = parse_state(initial_state)\n    queue = deque([(player_pos, boxes, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        player_pos, boxes, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved(boxes, goals):\n            return path\n        \n        for move, new_player_pos, new_box_pos in get_moves(grid, player_pos, boxes):\n            new_boxes = set(boxes)\n            if new_box_pos:\n                new_boxes.remove((new_player_pos[0], new_player_pos[1]))\n                new_boxes.add(new_box_pos)\n            \n            state = (new_player_pos, frozenset(new_boxes))\n            if state not in visited:\n                visited.add(state)\n                queue.append((new_player_pos, new_boxes, path + move))\n    \n    return \"No solution\"\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script uses a breadth-first search to explore possible moves and find a solution to the Sokoban puzzle.
