    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial configuration is:\n- Player: (5, 3) (marked as %)\n- Boxes: (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 5)\n- Goals: (1, 5), (4, 3), (5, 5)\n\nThe walls (+) and empty spaces (-) define the boundaries and paths.\n\nWe will use a search algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to explore possible moves and find a solution. The BFS will explore all possible states by moving the player and pushing boxes until all boxes are on goals.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (5, 3),\n    'boxes': {(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 5)},\n    'goals': {(1, 5), (4, 3), (5, 5)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6),\n              (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6),\n              (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)},\n    'width': 7,\n    'height': 7\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\ndef is_goal_state(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\ndef is_valid_position(pos, state):\n    return (0 <= pos[0] < state['height'] and\n            0 <= pos[1] < state['width'] and\n            pos not in state['walls'])\n\ndef move_player(state, direction):\n    player = state['player']\n    dx, dy = moves[direction]\n    new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n    \n    if not is_valid_position(new_player, state):\n        return None\n    \n    new_boxes = set(state['boxes'])\n    if new_player in state['boxes']:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n        if not is_valid_position(new_box, state) or new_box in state['boxes']:\n            return None\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player)\n        new_boxes.add(new_box)\n    \n    return {\n        'player': new_player,\n        'boxes': new_boxes,\n        'goals': state['goals'],\n        'walls': state['walls'],\n        'width': state['width'],\n        'height': state['height']\n    }\n\ndef bfs(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((initial_state['player'], frozenset(initial_state['boxes'])))\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_goal_state(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for direction in moves:\n            new_state = move_player(current_state, direction)\n            if new_state is None:\n                continue\n            \n            state_id = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n            if state_id not in visited:\n                visited.add(state_id)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + direction))\n    \n    return None\n\nsolution = bfs(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the sequence of moves that solves the Sokoban puzzle.
