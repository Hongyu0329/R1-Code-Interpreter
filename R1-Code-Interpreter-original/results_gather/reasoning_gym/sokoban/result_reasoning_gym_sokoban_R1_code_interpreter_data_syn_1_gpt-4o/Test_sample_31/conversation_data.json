    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial positions are:\n- Player (*) is at position (7, 4).\n- Boxes (@) are at positions (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (6, 3).\n- Goals (X) are at positions (1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 3), (4, 6), (6, 2), (6, 4).\n\nThe walls (+) and empty spaces (-) define the boundaries and paths.\n\nWe will use a search algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), to explore possible moves and find a solution. The BFS will explore all possible states by moving the player and pushing boxes, keeping track of visited states to avoid cycles.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (7, 4),\n    'boxes': {(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (6, 3)},\n    'goals': {(1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 3), (4, 6), (6, 2), (6, 4)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8),\n              (1, 0), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 8),\n              (5, 0), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 1),\n              (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)},\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1),\n}\n\n# Check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\n# Get the new position after a move\ndef get_new_position(position, move):\n    return (position[0] + move[0], position[1] + move[1])\n\n# Check if a move is valid\ndef is_valid_move(state, move):\n    new_player_pos = get_new_position(state['player'], move)\n    if new_player_pos in state['walls']:\n        return False\n    if new_player_pos in state['boxes']:\n        new_box_pos = get_new_position(new_player_pos, move)\n        if new_box_pos in state['walls'] or new_box_pos in state['boxes']:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Apply a move to the state\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    new_player_pos = get_new_position(state['player'], move)\n    new_boxes = set(state['boxes'])\n    if new_player_pos in state['boxes']:\n        new_box_pos = get_new_position(new_player_pos, move)\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player_pos)\n        new_boxes.add(new_box_pos)\n    return {\n        'player': new_player_pos,\n        'boxes': new_boxes,\n        'goals': state['goals'],\n        'walls': state['walls'],\n    }\n\n# Perform BFS to find the solution\ndef bfs(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((initial_state['player'], frozenset(initial_state['boxes'])))\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for move, delta in moves.items():\n            if is_valid_move(current_state, delta):\n                new_state = apply_move(current_state, delta)\n                new_state_key = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n                if new_state_key not in visited:\n                    visited.add(new_state_key)\n                    queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = bfs(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the sequence of moves that solves the Sokoban puzzle.

The issue arises from the fact that the state itself is a dictionary, and when two states have the same priority, the heap tries to compare the states directly, which is not possible.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that the elements in the priority queue are fully comparable. We can achieve this by not including the state dictionary directly in the heap elements. Instead, we can use a tuple of the player position and a frozenset of box positions to represent the state in a comparable way.\n\nLet's modify the code to address this issue:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (7, 4),\n    'boxes': {(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (6, 3)},\n    'goals': {(1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 3), (4, 6), (6, 2), (6, 4)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8),\n              (1, 0), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 8),\n              (5, 0), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 1),\n              (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)},\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1),\n}\n\n# Check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\n# Get the new position after a move\ndef get_new_position(position, move):\n    return (position[0] + move[0], position[1] + move[1])\n\n# Check if a move is valid\ndef is_valid_move(state, move):\n    new_player_pos = get_new_position(state['player'], move)\n    if new_player_pos in state['walls']:\n        return False\n    if new_player_pos in state['boxes']:\n        new_box_pos = get_new_position(new_player_pos, move)\n        if new_box_pos in state['walls'] or new_box_pos in state['boxes']:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Apply a move to the state\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    new_player_pos = get_new_position(state['player'], move)\n    new_boxes = set(state['boxes'])\n    if new_player_pos in state['boxes']:\n        new_box_pos = get_new_position(new_player_pos, move)\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player_pos)\n        new_boxes.add(new_box_pos)\n    return {\n        'player': new_player_pos,\n        'boxes': new_boxes,\n        'goals': state['goals'],\n        'walls': state['walls'],\n    }\n\n# Heuristic function: sum of Manhattan distances from boxes to nearest goals\ndef heuristic(state):\n    total_distance = 0\n    for box in state['boxes']:\n        min_distance = min(abs(box[0] - goal[0]) + abs(box[1] - goal[1]) for goal in state['goals'])\n        total_distance += min_distance\n    return total_distance\n\n# Perform A* search to find the solution\ndef a_star_search(initial_state):\n    open_set = []\n    initial_key = (initial_state['player'], frozenset(initial_state['boxes']))\n    heapq.heappush(open_set, (0 + heuristic(initial_state), 0, initial_key, \"\"))\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_key)\n    \n    while open_set:\n        _, cost, current_key, path = heapq.heappop(open_set)\n        current_player, current_boxes = current_key\n        \n        if current_boxes == frozenset(initial_state['goals']):\n            return path\n        \n        current_state = {\n            'player': current_player,\n            'boxes': set(current_boxes),\n            'goals': initial_state['goals'],\n            'walls': initial_state['walls'],\n        }\n        \n        for move, delta in moves.items():\n            if is_valid_move(current_state, delta):\n                new_state = apply_move(current_state, delta)\n                new_key = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n                if new_key not in visited:\n                    visited.add(new_key)\n                    new_cost = cost + 1\n                    heapq.heappush(open_set, (new_cost + heuristic(new_state), new_cost, new_key, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = a_star_search(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code uses a tuple of the player position and a frozenset of box positions to represent the state in a comparable way, ensuring that the priority queue can manage the elements correctly. Let's see if this resolves the issue and finds a solution."
