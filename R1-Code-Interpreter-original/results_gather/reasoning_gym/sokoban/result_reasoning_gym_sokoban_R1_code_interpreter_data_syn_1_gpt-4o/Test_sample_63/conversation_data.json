    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial positions are:\n- Player (*) is at (6, 3).\n- Boxes (@) are at (1, 7), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (5, 2), (5, 6).\n- Goals (X) are at (1, 3), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 7), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 6).\n\nWe will use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a solution.

    "The timeout error suggests that the search algorithm is taking too long to find a solution. This can happen if the search space is too large or if the algorithm is not efficient enough. To address this, we can try optimizing the search process. One approach is to implement a more efficient search algorithm, such as A* search, which uses heuristics to guide the search towards the goal more quickly.\n\nLet's implement an A* search algorithm for the Sokoban puzzle.

    "The timeout error indicates that the search is still taking too long. This can happen if the search space is large or if the heuristic is not guiding the search efficiently. To address this, we can try a few optimizations:\n\n1. **Improve the Heuristic**: The current heuristic is the sum of the Manhattan distances from each box to the nearest goal. We can try to improve it by considering additional factors, such as the number of boxes already on goals.\n\n2. **Prune the Search Space**: We can add additional checks to avoid exploring states that are clearly not leading to a solution, such as states where a box is pushed into a corner where it cannot be moved out.\n\n3. **Limit the Depth**: We can set a limit on the depth of the search to prevent it from exploring too deeply without finding a solution.\n\nLet's try implementing these optimizations:\n\n```python\nfrom heapq import heappop, heappush\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (6, 3),\n    'boxes': frozenset({(1, 7), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (5, 2), (5, 6)}),\n    'goals': {(1, 3), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 7), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 6)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9),\n              (1, 0), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 9),\n              (6, 0), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3),\n              (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9)},\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}\n\n# Function to check if a move is valid\ndef is_valid_move(player, boxes, move, walls):\n    new_player_pos = (player[0] + move[0], player[1] + move[1])\n    \n    # Check if new player position is a wall\n    if new_player_pos in walls:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if new player position is a box\n    if new_player_pos in boxes:\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move[0], new_player_pos[1] + move[1])\n        # Check if new box position is a wall or another box\n        if new_box_pos in walls or new_box_pos in boxes:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Function to apply a move\ndef apply_move(player, boxes, move):\n    new_player_pos = (player[0] + move[0], player[1] + move[1])\n    \n    new_boxes = set(boxes)\n    if new_player_pos in new_boxes:\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player_pos)\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move[0], new_player_pos[1] + move[1])\n        new_boxes.add(new_box_pos)\n    \n    return new_player_pos, frozenset(new_boxes)\n\n# Function to check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(boxes, goals):\n    return boxes == goals\n\n# Improved heuristic function\ndef heuristic(boxes, goals):\n    total_distance = 0\n    for box in boxes:\n        min_distance = min(abs(box[0] - goal[0]) + abs(box[1] - goal[1]) for goal in goals)\n        total_distance += min_distance\n    # Add a penalty for boxes not on goals\n    total_distance += len(goals) - len(boxes.intersection(goals))\n    return total_distance\n\n# A* search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    open_set = []\n    player = initial_state['player']\n    boxes = initial_state['boxes']\n    goals = initial_state['goals']\n    walls = initial_state['walls']\n    \n    heappush(open_set, (0, player, boxes, \"\"))\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while open_set:\n        _, current_player, current_boxes, path = heappop(open_set)\n        \n        if is_solved(current_boxes, goals):\n            return path\n        \n        for move_key, move in moves.items():\n            if is_valid_move(current_player, current_boxes, move, walls):\n                new_player, new_boxes = apply_move(current_player, current_boxes, move)\n                state_key = (new_player, new_boxes)\n                if state_key not in visited:\n                    visited.add(state_key)\n                    cost = len(path) + 1 + heuristic(new_boxes, goals)\n                    heappush(open_set, (cost, new_player, new_boxes, path + move_key))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the solution."
