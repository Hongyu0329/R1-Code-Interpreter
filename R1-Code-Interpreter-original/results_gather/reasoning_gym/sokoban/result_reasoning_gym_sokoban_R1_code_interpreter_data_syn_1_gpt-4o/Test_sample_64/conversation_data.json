    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player and the boxes.\n3. Use a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial positions are:\n- Player (*) is at (2, 6).\n- Boxes (@) are at (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 5), (5, 5), and (6, 2).\n- Goals (X) are at (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (6, 1), and (6, 3).\n\nThe walls (+) define the boundaries and obstacles in the puzzle.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible states and find the shortest path to the solution. The state is defined by the positions of the player and the boxes.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (2, 6),\n    'boxes': {(2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 2)},\n    'goals': {(1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (6, 1), (6, 3)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7),\n              (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (1, 7),\n              (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7),\n              (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 7),\n              (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 7),\n              (5, 0), (5, 6), (5, 7),\n              (6, 0), (6, 6), (6, 7),\n              (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7)}\n}\n\n# Define the possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\n# Function to check if a position is within bounds and not a wall\ndef is_valid_position(pos, walls):\n    return pos not in walls\n\n# Function to check if all boxes are on goals\ndef is_solved(boxes, goals):\n    return boxes == goals\n\n# BFS to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state['player'], frozenset(initial_state['boxes']), '')])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        player, boxes, path = queue.popleft()\n\n        if is_solved(boxes, initial_state['goals']):\n            return path\n\n        if (player, boxes) in visited:\n            continue\n\n        visited.add((player, boxes))\n\n        for move, (dx, dy) in moves.items():\n            new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n\n            if not is_valid_position(new_player, initial_state['walls']):\n                continue\n\n            if new_player in boxes:\n                new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n\n                if new_box in boxes or not is_valid_position(new_box, initial_state['walls']):\n                    continue\n\n                new_boxes = set(boxes)\n                new_boxes.remove(new_player)\n                new_boxes.add(new_box)\n                queue.append((new_player, frozenset(new_boxes), path + move))\n            else:\n                queue.append((new_player, boxes, path + move))\n\n    return None\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the solution to the Sokoban puzzle.
