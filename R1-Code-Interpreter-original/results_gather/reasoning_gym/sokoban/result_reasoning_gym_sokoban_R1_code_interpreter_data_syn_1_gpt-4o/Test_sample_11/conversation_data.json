    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. The player starts at position (1, 4).\n2. There are four boxes initially at positions (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), and (2, 5).\n3. There are four goals at positions (3, 1), (5, 1), (5, 4), and (5, 5).\n4. One box is already on a goal at position (5, 3).\n\nThe strategy is to move the player to push the boxes onto the goals while ensuring that no box gets stuck in a corner or against a wall where it cannot be moved further.\n\nTo solve this puzzle, we can use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a sequence that solves the puzzle. Let's implement a simple search algorithm to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (1, 4),\n    'boxes': {(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)},\n    'goals': {(3, 1), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 5)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5),\n              (1, 0), (1, 5),\n              (2, 0), (2, 5),\n              (3, 0), (3, 5),\n              (4, 0), (4, 5),\n              (5, 0), (5, 5),\n              (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)},\n    'goals_with_boxes': {(5, 3)}\n}\n\n# Define the possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1),\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0)\n}\n\n# Function to check if a position is free (not a wall or a box)\ndef is_free(position, boxes, walls):\n    return position not in boxes and position not in walls\n\n# Function to apply a move\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player = state['player']\n    boxes = state['boxes'].copy()\n    dx, dy = moves[move]\n    new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n    \n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n        if is_free(new_box, boxes, state['walls']):\n            boxes.remove(new_player)\n            boxes.add(new_box)\n            return {'player': new_player, 'boxes': boxes}\n    elif is_free(new_player, boxes, state['walls']):\n        return {'player': new_player, 'boxes': boxes}\n    return None\n\n# Function to check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\n# Breadth-first search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        state, path = queue.popleft()\n        if is_solved(state):\n            return path\n        if (state['player'], frozenset(state['boxes'])) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add((state['player'], frozenset(state['boxes'])))\n        \n        for move in moves:\n            new_state = apply_move(state, move)\n            if new_state:\n                queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    return None\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code uses a breadth-first search to explore all possible sequences of moves until it finds a solution where all boxes are on the goals. The solution is printed as a string of moves.",
    "The error indicates that the key `'goals'` is not found in the `state` dictionary during the execution of the `is_solved` function. This is because the `apply_move` function returns a new state dictionary that does not include the `'goals'` key.

Let's see if this resolves the issue and provides a solution.",
    "The timeout error suggests that the search algorithm is taking too long to find a solution. This can happen if the search space is too large or if the algorithm is not efficiently exploring the possible states.\n\nTo address this, we can try optimizing the search process. One approach is to use a more efficient search algorithm, such as A* search, which uses a heuristic to prioritize exploring more promising states.

    "The error occurs because the priority queue (heap) is trying to compare dictionaries, which is not supported. In a priority queue, the first element of the tuple is used for comparison, so we need to ensure that the first element is a comparable type, such as an integer or a float.\n\nTo fix this, we should ensure that the priority queue only uses the cost (a numeric value) for comparison.
