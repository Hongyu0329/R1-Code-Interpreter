    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player and boxes to achieve a state where all boxes are placed on goals. The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can push a box if there is an empty space or a goal behind it. The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n- The player is currently on a goal, represented by `%`.\n- The boxes are represented by `@` and `$` (box on a goal).\n- The goals are represented by `X`.\n- The walls are represented by `+`.\n- The empty spaces are represented by `-`.\n\nThe initial state of the puzzle is:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + + $ X @ % +  \n+ + $ + + @ @ +  \n+ + + + - - - +  \n+ + + $ - - + +  \n+ + + + + X + +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player needs to move the boxes onto the goals. We will use a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.
