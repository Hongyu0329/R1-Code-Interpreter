    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial positions are:\n- Player (*) is at (3, 4).\n- Boxes (@) are at (1, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), and (4, 3).\n- Goals (X) are at (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 6), and (5, 4).\n\nThe walls (+) define the boundaries and obstacles.\n\nWe will use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a solution. Let's implement a simple breadth-first search (BFS) to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (3, 4),\n    'boxes': {(1, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (4, 3)},\n    'goals': {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 6), (5, 4)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7),\n              (1, 0), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 7),\n              (4, 0), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3),\n              (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7)},\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}\n\n# Function to check if a move is valid\ndef is_valid_move(player, direction, boxes, walls):\n    new_player = (player[0] + direction[0], player[1] + direction[1])\n    if new_player in walls:\n        return False\n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + direction[0], new_player[1] + direction[1])\n        if new_box in walls or new_box in boxes:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Function to apply a move\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player = state['player']\n    boxes = state['boxes'].copy()\n    direction = moves[move]\n    new_player = (player[0] + direction[0], player[1] + direction[1])\n    if new_player in boxes:\n        boxes.remove(new_player)\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + direction[0], new_player[1] + direction[1])\n        boxes.add(new_box)\n    return {'player': new_player, 'boxes': boxes, 'goals': state['goals'], 'walls': state['walls']}\n\n# Function to check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\n# Breadth-first search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((initial_state['player'], frozenset(initial_state['boxes'])))\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for move in moves:\n            if is_valid_move(current_state['player'], moves[move], current_state['boxes'], current_state['walls']):\n                new_state = apply_move(current_state, move)\n                state_key = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n                if state_key not in visited:\n                    visited.add(state_key)\n                    queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will execute a breadth-first search to find the sequence of moves that solves the Sokoban puzzle. Let's see the result.",
