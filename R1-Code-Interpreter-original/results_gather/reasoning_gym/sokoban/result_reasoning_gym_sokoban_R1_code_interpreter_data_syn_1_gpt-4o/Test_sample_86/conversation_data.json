    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ - - X @ - +  \n+ - - @ - - +  \n+ X @ $ - - +  \n+ - - - - - +  \n+ - * @ X X +  \n+ - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is located at position (5, 3). The goals (X) are located at positions (1, 3), (3, 2), (5, 5), and (5, 6). The boxes (@) are located at positions (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), and (5, 4). One box is already on a goal at position (3, 4).\n\nThe task is to find a sequence of moves that will push all boxes onto the goals. We will use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a solution.\n\nLet's implement a search algorithm to solve this puzzle.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = (\n    (1, 4),  # Box 1\n    (2, 3),  # Box 2\n    (3, 3),  # Box 3\n    (5, 4),  # Box 4\n    (5, 3)   # Player\n)\n\n# Define the goal positions\ngoals = {(1, 3), (3, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6)}\n\n# Define the walls\nwalls = {\n    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6),\n    (1, 0), (1, 6),\n    (2, 0), (2, 6),\n    (3, 0), (3, 6),\n    (4, 0), (4, 6),\n    (5, 0), (5, 6),\n    (6, 0), (6, 6),\n    (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6)\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\ndef is_goal(state):\n    boxes = state[:4]\n    return all(box in goals for box in boxes)\n\ndef is_valid_move(state, move):\n    boxes = state[:4]\n    player = state[4]\n    dx, dy = moves[move]\n    new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n    \n    if new_player in walls:\n        return False\n    \n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n        if new_box in walls or new_box in boxes:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    boxes = list(state[:4])\n    player = state[4]\n    dx, dy = moves[move]\n    new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n    \n    if new_player in boxes:\n        box_index = boxes.index(new_player)\n        boxes[box_index] = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n    \n    return tuple(boxes + [new_player])\n\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_goal(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for move in moves:\n            if is_valid_move(current_state, move):\n                new_state = apply_move(current_state, move)\n                if new_state not in visited:\n                    visited.add(new_state)\n                    queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThe code above implements a breadth-first search algorithm to find a solution to the Sokoban puzzle.
