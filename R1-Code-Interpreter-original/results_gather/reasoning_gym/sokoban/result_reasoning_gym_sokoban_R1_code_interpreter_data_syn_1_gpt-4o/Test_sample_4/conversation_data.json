    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. The player (*) is initially at position (2, 2).\n2. There are three boxes (@) at positions (2, 5), (2, 6), and (3, 2).\n3. There are three goals (X) at positions (1, 1), (3, 5), and (3, 6).\n4. The player can push a box if there is an empty space or a goal behind the box in the direction of the push.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n- Move the player to a position where it can push a box.\n- Push the box towards a goal.\n- Repeat until all boxes are on goals.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find a solution for this puzzle.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = (\n    (2, 2),  # Player position\n    ((2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2))  # Box positions\n)\n\n# Define the goal positions\ngoal_positions = {(1, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6)}\n\n# Define the walls\nwalls = {\n    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7),\n    (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 7),\n    (2, 0), (2, 7),\n    (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 7),\n    (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7),\n    (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7)\n}\n\n# Define the possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1),\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0)\n}\n\ndef is_goal_state(box_positions):\n    return all(pos in goal_positions for pos in box_positions)\n\ndef is_valid_position(position, box_positions):\n    return position not in walls and position not in box_positions\n\ndef move_player(state, direction):\n    player_pos, box_positions = state\n    dx, dy = moves[direction]\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + dx, player_pos[1] + dy)\n\n    if not is_valid_position(new_player_pos, box_positions):\n        return None\n\n    new_box_positions = set(box_positions)\n    if new_player_pos in box_positions:\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + dx, new_player_pos[1] + dy)\n        if not is_valid_position(new_box_pos, box_positions):\n            return None\n        new_box_positions.remove(new_player_pos)\n        new_box_positions.add(new_box_pos)\n\n    return (new_player_pos, tuple(new_box_positions))\n\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n\n        if is_goal_state(current_state[1]):\n            return path\n\n        if current_state in visited:\n            continue\n\n        visited.add(current_state)\n\n        for direction in moves:\n            new_state = move_player(current_state, direction)\n            if new_state and new_state not in visited:\n                queue.append((new_state, path + direction))\n\n    return None\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible moves from the initial state.

    "The output being `None` indicates that the script did not find a solution. This could be due to an error in the logic or constraints that prevent the player from reaching a solution.
