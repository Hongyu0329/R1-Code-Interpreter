    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n+ - - - - - - - - +  \n+ - X - $ $ - @ - +  \n+ - - - X X X - - +  \n+ + X - @ @ @ @ * +  \n+ + - - - - - - - +  \n+ + + + + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is located at the bottom right corner.\n- There are several boxes (@) and goals (X) scattered across the board.\n- Some boxes are already on goals ($).\n\nThe goal is to move the player and push the boxes so that all boxes are on goals.\n\nTo solve this, we can use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a solution.

    "The timeout error indicates that the search algorithm is taking too long to find a solution. This can happen if the search space is too large or if the algorithm is not efficient enough. To address this, we can try optimizing the search process.\n\nOne way to optimize the search is to use a more efficient algorithm, such as A* search, which uses heuristics to guide the search towards the goal more quickly.

    "The timeout issue suggests that the search space is still too large or the heuristic is not effective enough in guiding the search efficiently.
