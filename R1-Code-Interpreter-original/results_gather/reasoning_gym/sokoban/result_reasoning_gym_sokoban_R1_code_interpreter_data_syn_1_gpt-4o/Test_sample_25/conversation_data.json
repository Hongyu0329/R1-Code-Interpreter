    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n- The player starts at position (6, 4).\n- There are three boxes (@) initially at positions (3, 2), (5, 2), and (5, 5).\n- There are three goals (X) at positions (4, 4), (4, 5), and (5, 4).\n- The walls (+) and the layout of the board restrict movement.\n\nThe strategy involves:\n1. Moving the player to a position where they can push a box.\n2. Pushing the box towards a goal.\n3. Repeating the process until all boxes are on goals.\n\nLet's attempt to solve this puzzle by generating a sequence of moves. We'll use a simple approach to find a solution.\n\n```python\n# Define the initial state of the board\nboard = [\n    ['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', '$', '+', '$', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', '-', '-', '+', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', '@', '-', '+', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', '-', 'X', 'X', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', '@', 'X', '@', '+'],\n    ['+', '-', '-', '-', '*', '+'],\n    ['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+']\n]\n\n# Define the player's initial position\nplayer_pos = (6, 4)\n\n# Define the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle\n# This is a hypothetical solution and may need adjustments\nmoves = \"UULLDRRURRDDLLURR\"\n\n# Function to apply moves to the board\ndef apply_moves(board, player_pos, moves):\n    for move in moves:\n        x, y = player_pos\n        if move == 'U':\n            new_pos = (x - 1, y)\n        elif move == 'D':\n            new_pos = (x + 1, y)\n        elif move == 'L':\n            new_pos = (x, y - 1)\n        elif move == 'R':\n            new_pos = (x, y + 1)\n        \n        # Check if the new position is valid\n        if board[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] in ['-', 'X']:\n            # Move the player\n            board[x][y] = '-'\n            board[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] = '*'\n            player_pos = new_pos\n        elif board[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] in ['@', '$']:\n            # Check if the box can be pushed\n            box_new_pos = (new_pos[0] + (new_pos[0] - x), new_pos[1] + (new_pos[1] - y))\n            if board[box_new_pos[0]][box_new_pos[1]] in ['-', 'X']:\n                # Move the box\n                board[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] = '*'\n                board[box_new_pos[0]][box_new_pos[1]] = '@' if board[box_new_pos[0]][box_new_pos[1]] == '-' else '$'\n                board[x][y] = '-'\n                player_pos = new_pos\n    return board\n\n# Apply the moves to the board\nfinal_board = apply_moves(board, player_pos, moves)\n\n# Print the final board state\nfor row in final_board:\n    print(' '.join(row))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see if the sequence of moves solves the puzzle.",
    "The code attempted to solve the Sokoban puzzle by applying a predefined sequence of moves. However, the sequence did not successfully solve the puzzle, as not all boxes are on the goals.
