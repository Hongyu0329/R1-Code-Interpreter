    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial positions are:\n- Player (*) is at (5, 2).\n- Boxes (@) are at (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 4), and (2, 5).\n- Goals (X) are at (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), and (3, 3).\n\nThe goal is to move all boxes onto the goals. We will use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a solution.\n\nLet's implement a search algorithm to solve the puzzle. We'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this puzzle.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = (\n    (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5),  # Box positions\n    (5, 2)  # Player position\n)\n\n# Define the goal positions\ngoal_positions = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (3, 3)}\n\n# Define the walls\nwalls = {\n    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8),\n    (1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 8),\n    (2, 0), (2, 7), (2, 8),\n    (3, 0), (3, 7), (3, 8),\n    (4, 0), (4, 7), (4, 8),\n    (5, 0), (5, 7), (5, 8),\n    (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\ndef is_goal_state(state):\n    boxes = state[:4]\n    return all(box in goal_positions for box in boxes)\n\ndef is_valid_position(position, boxes):\n    return position not in walls and position not in boxes\n\ndef move(state, direction):\n    boxes = list(state[:4])\n    player = state[4]\n    dx, dy = moves[direction]\n    new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n\n    if new_player in boxes:\n        # If the player is moving into a box, try to push the box\n        box_index = boxes.index(new_player)\n        new_box_position = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n        if is_valid_position(new_box_position, boxes):\n            boxes[box_index] = new_box_position\n            return tuple(boxes) + (new_player,)\n    elif is_valid_position(new_player, boxes):\n        # If the player is moving into an empty space\n        return tuple(boxes) + (new_player,)\n\n    return None\n\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n\n        if is_goal_state(current_state):\n            return path\n\n        if current_state in visited:\n            continue\n\n        visited.add(current_state)\n\n        for direction in moves:\n            new_state = move(current_state, direction)\n            if new_state and new_state not in visited:\n                queue.append((new_state, path + direction))\n\n    return None\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a solution to the Sokoban puzzle using a breadth-first search. The `solve_sokoban` function explores all possible moves from the initial state, checking if each new state is a goal state. If a solution is found, it returns the sequence of moves. If no solution is found, it returns `None`.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned a sequence of moves: `UULUURRLDLDRDRRURUL`. This sequence represents the steps needed to solve the Sokoban puzzle by moving the player and pushing the boxes onto the goals.\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n- `UULUURRLDLDRDRRURUL` is a sequence of moves where:\n  - `U` stands for moving up.\n  - `D` stands for moving down.\n  - `L` stands for moving left.\n  - `R` stands for moving right.\n\nThis sequence should successfully solve the puzzle by moving the player and boxes to achieve the goal state where all boxes are on the goals.\n\n<<<UULUURRLDLDRDRRURUL>>>"
