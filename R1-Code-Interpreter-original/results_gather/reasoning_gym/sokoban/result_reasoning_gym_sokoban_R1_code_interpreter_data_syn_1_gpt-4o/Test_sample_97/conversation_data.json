    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The solution will be a sequence of moves: L (left), R (right), U (up), and D (down).\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe player starts at position (8, 2). The goals are at positions (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (5, 4), (7, 5), and (8, 8). The boxes are at positions (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (5, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), and (7, 7).\n\nWe will use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a solution.

    "The timeout error suggests that the search space is too large, and the algorithm is taking too long to find a solution. To address this, we can try optimizing the search algorithm. One approach is to implement a more efficient search strategy, such as A* search, which uses heuristics to guide the search process.\n\nLet's implement the A* search algorithm with a heuristic that estimates the distance to the goal.

    "The timeout issue indicates that even with the A* search, the problem is still too complex to solve within the given time constraints. This can happen due to the large state space and the complexity of the Sokoban puzzle. \n\nTo address this, we can try a few strategies:\n\n1. **Pruning**: Avoid exploring states that are obviously unsolvable, such as when a box is pushed into a corner where it cannot be moved out.\n\n2. **Improved Heuristics**: Use more sophisticated heuristics that better estimate the cost to reach the goal.\n\n3. **State Compression**: Reduce the state space by compressing the representation of states.\n\nLet's try implementing a simple pruning strategy to avoid pushing boxes into corners unless they are goals.\n\n```python\nfrom heapq import heappop, heappush\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = (\n    (8, 2),  # Player position\n    frozenset([(2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (5, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 7)])  # Box positions\n)\n\n# Define the goal positions\ngoals = frozenset([(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (5, 4), (7, 5), (8, 8)])\n\n# Define the walls\nwalls = frozenset([\n    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9),\n    (1, 0), (1, 9),\n    (2, 0), (2, 9),\n    (3, 0), (3, 9),\n    (4, 0), (4, 9),\n    (5, 0), (5, 9),\n    (6, 0), (6, 9),\n    (7, 0), (7, 9),\n    (8, 0), (8, 9),\n    (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9)\n])\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1),\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0)\n}\n\ndef is_valid_move(player, box_positions, move):\n    new_player = (player[0] + move[0], player[1] + move[1])\n    if new_player in walls:\n        return False\n    if new_player in box_positions:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + move[0], new_player[1] + move[1])\n        if new_box in walls or new_box in box_positions:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef apply_move(player, box_positions, move):\n    new_player = (player[0] + move[0], player[1] + move[1])\n    new_box_positions = set(box_positions)\n    if new_player in box_positions:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + move[0], new_player[1] + move[1])\n        new_box_positions.remove(new_player)\n        new_box_positions.add(new_box)\n    return new_player, frozenset(new_box_positions)\n\ndef is_solved(box_positions):\n    return box_positions == goals\n\ndef heuristic(box_positions):\n    return sum(min(abs(box[0] - goal[0]) + abs(box[1] - goal[1]) for goal in goals) for box in box_positions)\n\ndef is_deadlock(box_positions):\n    # Check for simple deadlocks: box in a corner not on a goal\n    for box in box_positions:\n        if box not in goals:\n            if ((box[0] - 1, box[1]) in walls or (box[0] + 1, box[1]) in walls) and \\\n               ((box[0], box[1] - 1) in walls or (box[0], box[1] + 1) in walls):\n                return True\n    return False\n\ndef a_star_solve(initial_state):\n    open_set = []\n    heappush(open_set, (0, initial_state, \"\"))\n    visited = set([initial_state])\n    while open_set:\n        _, (player, box_positions), path = heappop(open_set)\n        if is_solved(box_positions):\n            return path\n        for move_name, move in moves.items():\n            if is_valid_move(player, box_positions, move):\n                new_state = apply_move(player, box_positions, move)\n                if new_state not in visited and not is_deadlock(new_state[1]):\n                    visited.add(new_state)\n                    new_cost = len(path) + 1 + heuristic(new_state[1])\n                    heappush(open_set, (new_cost, new_state, path + move_name))\n    return None\n\nsolution = a_star_solve(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code includes a simple deadlock detection to avoid pushing boxes into corners unless they are goals.
