    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ X + $ X @ * +  \n+ - - - - - @ +  \n+ @ - $ - - - +  \n+ - - - - - X +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is initially at position (1, 6).\n- There are three boxes (@) and three goals (X).\n- The walls (+) define the boundaries and obstacles.\n\nThe goal is to push all boxes onto the goals. We will use a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that accomplishes this. Let's implement a simple search algorithm to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = (\n    (1, 6),  # Player position\n    ((1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1))  # Box positions\n)\n\n# Define the goal positions\ngoal_positions = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 6)}\n\n# Define the walls\nwalls = {\n    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7),\n    (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 7),\n    (2, 0), (2, 7),\n    (3, 0), (3, 7),\n    (4, 0), (4, 7),\n    (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7)\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\ndef is_goal_state(state):\n    _, boxes = state\n    return all(box in goal_positions for box in boxes)\n\ndef is_valid_position(position, boxes):\n    return position not in walls and position not in boxes\n\ndef move(state, direction):\n    player, boxes = state\n    dx, dy = moves[direction]\n    new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n    \n    if not is_valid_position(new_player, boxes):\n        return None\n    \n    new_boxes = set(boxes)\n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n        if not is_valid_position(new_box, boxes):\n            return None\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player)\n        new_boxes.add(new_box)\n    \n    return (new_player, tuple(new_boxes))\n\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_goal_state(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        if current_state in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add(current_state)\n        \n        for direction in moves:\n            new_state = move(current_state, direction)\n            if new_state and new_state not in visited:\n                queue.append((new_state, path + direction))\n    \n    return None\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible moves from the initial state until it finds a solution where all boxes are on goals. The `solve_sokoban` function returns the sequence of moves as a string. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The output being `None` indicates that the search algorithm did not find a solution. This could be due to an error in the logic or constraints that prevent the algorithm from exploring valid paths. Let's review the code and make necessary adjustments.\n\n1.
