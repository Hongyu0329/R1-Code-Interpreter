    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The player is at position (3, 4).\n   - There are boxes at positions (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 2), (5, 1), and (5, 4).\n   - There are goals at positions (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), and (4, 5).\n\n2. **Objective**: \n   - Move all boxes onto the goal positions.\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The player can only push one box at a time.\n   - The player cannot move through walls or boxes.\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - Use a search algorithm to explore possible moves.\n   - Keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.\n   - Prioritize moves that place boxes on goals.\n\nLet's implement a search algorithm to find the solution. We'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the possible moves and find the shortest path to the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (3, 4),\n    'boxes': {(2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 4)},\n    'goals': {(1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7),\n              (1, 0), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 7),\n              (5, 0), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3),\n              (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7)}\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\ndef is_valid_move(player, direction, boxes, walls):\n    new_player = (player[0] + direction[0], player[1] + direction[1])\n    if new_player in walls:\n        return False\n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + direction[0], new_player[1] + direction[1])\n        if new_box in walls or new_box in boxes:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef move(state, move):\n    player, boxes = state['player'], state['boxes']\n    direction = moves[move]\n    new_player = (player[0] + direction[0], player[1] + direction[1])\n    new_boxes = set(boxes)\n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + direction[0], new_player[1] + direction[1])\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player)\n        new_boxes.add(new_box)\n    return {'player': new_player, 'boxes': new_boxes}\n\ndef is_solved(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((initial_state['player'], frozenset(initial_state['boxes'])))\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for move in moves:\n            if is_valid_move(current_state['player'], moves[move], current_state['boxes'], initial_state['walls']):\n                new_state = move(current_state, move)\n                state_key = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n                if state_key not in visited:\n                    visited.add(state_key)\n                    queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code uses a breadth-first search to explore all possible moves from the initial state.
