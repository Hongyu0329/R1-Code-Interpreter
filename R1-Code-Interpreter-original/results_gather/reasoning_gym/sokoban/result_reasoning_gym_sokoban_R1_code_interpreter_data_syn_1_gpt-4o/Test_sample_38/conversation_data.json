    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial state of the puzzle is:\n- Player (*) is at position (1, 4).\n- Boxes (@) are at positions (1, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 4).\n- Goals (X) are at positions (1, 2) and (6, 4).\n\nThe walls (+) and empty spaces (-) define the boundaries and paths the player can take.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, we can use a search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore possible moves. The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's implement a search algorithm to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (1, 4),\n    'boxes': {(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)},\n    'goals': {(1, 2), (6, 4)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5),\n              (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5),\n              (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5),\n              (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5),\n              (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5),\n              (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5),\n              (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5),\n              (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5)},\n    'empty': {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4),\n              (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)}\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\ndef is_goal_state(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\ndef move_player(state, direction):\n    player = state['player']\n    dx, dy = moves[direction]\n    new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n    \n    if new_player in state['walls']:\n        return None\n    \n    new_boxes = set(state['boxes'])\n    if new_player in new_boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n        if new_box in state['walls'] or new_box in new_boxes:\n            return None\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player)\n        new_boxes.add(new_box)\n    \n    return {\n        'player': new_player,\n        'boxes': new_boxes,\n        'goals': state['goals'],\n        'walls': state['walls'],\n        'empty': state['empty']\n    }\n\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_goal_state(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for direction in moves:\n            new_state = move_player(current_state, direction)\n            if new_state and (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes'])) not in visited:\n                visited.add((new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes'])))\n                queue.append((new_state, path + direction))\n    \n    return None\n\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThe code above implements a BFS algorithm to find the solution to the Sokoban puzzle.
