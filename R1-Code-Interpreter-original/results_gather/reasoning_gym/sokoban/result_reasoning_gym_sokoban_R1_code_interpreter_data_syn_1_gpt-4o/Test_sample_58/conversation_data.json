    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the initial state of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ * - - - - +  \n+ X @ @ - - +  \n+ X - $ - - +  \n+ - @ X - - +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is at position (1, 1).\n- There are three boxes (@) at positions (2, 2), (2, 3), and (4, 2).\n- There are three goals (X) at positions (2, 1), (3, 1), and (4, 3).\n- One box is already on a goal ($) at position (3, 3).\n\nThe task is to find a sequence of moves that will place all boxes on the goals. We will use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and find a solution.\n\nLet's implement a search algorithm to solve this puzzle. We'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the state space of the puzzle.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (1, 1),\n    'boxes': {(2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 2)},\n    'goals': {(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 3)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6),\n              (1, 0), (1, 6),\n              (2, 0), (2, 6),\n              (3, 0), (3, 6),\n              (4, 0), (4, 6),\n              (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)}\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\n# Function to check if a move is valid\ndef is_valid_move(player, direction, boxes, walls):\n    new_player = (player[0] + direction[0], player[1] + direction[1])\n    if new_player in walls:\n        return False\n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + direction[0], new_player[1] + direction[1])\n        if new_box in walls or new_box in boxes:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Function to apply a move\ndef apply_move(player, direction, boxes):\n    new_player = (player[0] + direction[0], player[1] + direction[1])\n    new_boxes = set(boxes)\n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + direction[0], new_player[1] + direction[1])\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player)\n        new_boxes.add(new_box)\n    return new_player, new_boxes\n\n# Function to check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(boxes, goals):\n    return boxes == goals\n\n# Breadth-first search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state['player'], initial_state['boxes'], \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((initial_state['player'], frozenset(initial_state['boxes'])))\n    \n    while queue:\n        player, boxes, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved(boxes, initial_state['goals']):\n            return path\n        \n        for move, direction in moves.items():\n            if is_valid_move(player, direction, boxes, initial_state['walls']):\n                new_player, new_boxes = apply_move(player, direction, boxes)\n                state = (new_player, frozenset(new_boxes))\n                if state not in visited:\n                    visited.add(state)\n                    queue.append((new_player, new_boxes, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will execute a breadth-first search to find the sequence of moves that solves the Sokoban puzzle. Let's see the result.",
