    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player and the resulting positions of the boxes.\n3. Use a search algorithm to explore possible sequences of moves that lead to a solution.\n\nThe initial configuration is:\n- Player (*) is at position (6, 6).\n- Boxes (@) are at positions (2, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 5).\n- Goals (X) are at positions (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 4), and (6, 5).\n\nThe goal is to move all boxes onto the goals. We will use a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that achieves this.\n\nLet's implement a search algorithm to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (6, 6),\n    'boxes': {(2, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5)},\n    'goals': {(1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 4), (6, 5)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7),\n              (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7),\n              (2, 0), (2, 6), (2, 7),\n              (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7),\n              (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 7),\n              (5, 0), (5, 6), (5, 7),\n              (6, 0), (6, 7),\n              (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7)},\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1),\n}\n\n# Function to check if a position is free (not a wall or a box)\ndef is_free(position, boxes, walls):\n    return position not in walls and position not in boxes\n\n# Function to apply a move\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player = state['player']\n    boxes = state['boxes']\n    dx, dy = moves[move]\n    new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n    \n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n        if is_free(new_box, boxes, state['walls']):\n            new_boxes = boxes - {new_player} | {new_box}\n            return {'player': new_player, 'boxes': new_boxes, 'goals': state['goals'], 'walls': state['walls']}\n    elif is_free(new_player, boxes, state['walls']):\n        return {'player': new_player, 'boxes': boxes, 'goals': state['goals'], 'walls': state['walls']}\n    \n    return None\n\n# Function to check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\n# Breadth-first search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved(state):\n            return path\n        \n        for move in moves:\n            new_state = apply_move(state, move)\n            if new_state and (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes'])) not in visited:\n                visited.add((new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes'])))\n                queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code uses a breadth-first search to explore all possible sequences of moves. It checks each state to see if it is a solution and returns the sequence of moves if it finds one. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The output being `None` indicates that the search algorithm did not find a solution. This could be due to several reasons, such as incorrect handling of moves, incorrect state transitions, or an oversight in the logic for checking valid moves.\n\nLet's review and adjust the code to ensure it correctly handles the Sokoban puzzle logic:\n\n1. Ensure that the player can only push boxes into free spaces.\n2. Ensure that the state transitions are correctly updating the positions of the player and boxes.\n3.
