    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ + - - - +  \n+ - - - $ +  \n+ X @ - + +  \n+ - - - + +  \n+ @ - - + +  \n+ % $ $ + +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player is currently on a goal at position (6, 2).\n- There are three boxes: one at (3, 2), one at (5, 1), and one at (6, 3).\n- There are two goals: one at (3, 1) and one at (6, 2) (where the player is currently located).\n\nThe strategy is to move the player to push the boxes onto the goals. We need to ensure that the player can reach the boxes and that the boxes can be moved to the goals without getting stuck.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find a solution for this puzzle. The script will simulate the moves and check if the boxes can be placed on the goals.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = (\n    (6, 2),  # Player position\n    ((3, 2), (5, 1), (6, 3))  # Box positions\n)\n\n# Define the goal positions\ngoals = {(3, 1), (6, 2)}\n\n# Define the walls\nwalls = {\n    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5),\n    (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5),\n    (2, 0), (2, 5),\n    (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5),\n    (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5),\n    (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 5),\n    (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5),\n    (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5)\n}\n\n# Define the possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1),\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0)\n}\n\n# Function to check if a position is free (not a wall or a box)\ndef is_free(pos, boxes):\n    return pos not in walls and pos not in boxes\n\n# Function to apply a move\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player, boxes = state\n    dx, dy = moves[move]\n    new_player = (player[0] + dx, player[1] + dy)\n    \n    if new_player in boxes:\n        new_box = (new_player[0] + dx, new_player[1] + dy)\n        if is_free(new_box, boxes):\n            new_boxes = tuple(b if b != new_player else new_box for b in boxes)\n            return new_player, new_boxes\n    elif is_free(new_player, boxes):\n        return new_player, boxes\n    \n    return None\n\n# Function to check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(boxes):\n    return all(box in goals for box in boxes)\n\n# Breadth-first search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved(state[1]):\n            return path\n        \n        for move in moves:\n            new_state = apply_move(state, move)\n            if new_state and new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and return the sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle.
