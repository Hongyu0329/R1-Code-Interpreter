    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial positions are:\n- Player (*) is at position (7, 5).\n- Boxes (@) are at positions (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (4, 5), (5, 5), (7, 4).\n- Goals (X) are at positions (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 8), (4, 4), (6, 8), (7, 7), (8, 8).\n\nThe walls (+) and empty spaces (-) define the boundaries and paths.\n\nWe will use a search algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), to explore possible moves and find a solution.

    "The timeout error indicates that the search algorithm took too long to find a solution. This can happen if the search space is large or if the algorithm is not efficient enough. To address this, we can try optimizing the search process or using a more efficient algorithm.\n\nOne approach is to use A* search, which is a more efficient algorithm for pathfinding problems like Sokoban.

    "The error occurs because the priority queue (heap) in Python requires that the elements being compared have a consistent ordering. In this case, the `new_state` dictionary is being compared, which is not directly comparable. To fix this, we need to ensure that the elements in the heap are tuples where the first element is the priority (cost) and the second element is a unique identifier or a comparable object.\n\nWe can use the `state_key` as a unique identifier for the state, which is a tuple of the player's position and a frozenset of the boxes' positions.

    "The persistent timeout issue suggests that the current approach is still not efficient enough for this particular Sokoban puzzle. Given the complexity of Sokoban puzzles, especially with multiple boxes and goals, the search space can become very large, leading to long computation times.\n\nTo address this, we can try a few more strategies:\n\n1. **Deadlock Detection**: Implement checks to detect and avoid deadlock situations where boxes are pushed into positions from which they cannot be moved to a goal.\n\n2. **Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)**: This approach can help manage memory usage better than A* by using a depth-first search strategy with increasing cost limits.\n\n3. **Domain-Specific Heuristics**: Use heuristics that are more tailored to Sokoban, such as considering the number of boxes already on goals or potential deadlock situations.\n\nLet's try implementing a simple deadlock detection mechanism to see if it helps reduce the search space.\n\n```python\nfrom heapq import heappop, heappush\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (7, 5),\n    'boxes': {(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (4, 5), (5, 5), (7, 4)},\n    'goals': {(1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 8), (4, 4), (6, 8), (7, 7), (8, 8)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9),\n              (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 8), (1, 9),\n              (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 9),\n              (3, 0), (3, 9),\n              (4, 0), (4, 9),\n              (5, 0), (5, 9),\n              (6, 0), (6, 9),\n              (7, 0), (7, 9),\n              (8, 0), (8, 9),\n              (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9)},\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\n# Function to check if a move is valid\ndef is_valid_move(state, move):\n    player_pos = state['player']\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + move[0], player_pos[1] + move[1])\n    \n    if new_player_pos in state['walls']:\n        return False\n    \n    if new_player_pos in state['boxes']:\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move[0], new_player_pos[1] + move[1])\n        if new_box_pos in state['walls'] or new_box_pos in state['boxes']:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Function to apply a move\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player_pos = state['player']\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + move[0], player_pos[1] + move[1])\n    \n    new_boxes = set(state['boxes'])\n    if new_player_pos in new_boxes:\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player_pos)\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move[0], new_player_pos[1] + move[1])\n        new_boxes.add(new_box_pos)\n    \n    return {\n        'player': new_player_pos,\n        'boxes': new_boxes,\n        'goals': state['goals'],\n        'walls': state['walls']\n    }\n\n# Function to check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\n# Improved heuristic function for A* search\ndef heuristic(state):\n    # Sum of Manhattan distances from each box to the nearest goal\n    return sum(min(abs(box[0] - goal[0]) + abs(box[1] - goal[1]) for goal in state['goals']) for box in state['boxes'])\n\n# Function to detect deadlocks\ndef is_deadlock(state):\n    # Simple deadlock detection: check if any box is in a corner not on a goal\n    for box in state['boxes']:\n        if box not in state['goals']:\n            if ((box[0] - 1, box[1]) in state['walls'] or (box[0] + 1, box[1]) in state['walls']) and \\\n               ((box[0], box[1] - 1) in state['walls'] or (box[0], box[1] + 1) in state['walls']):\n                return True\n    return False\n\n# A* Search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    open_set = []\n    heappush(open_set, (0, (initial_state['player'], frozenset(initial_state['boxes'])), \"\"))\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while open_set:\n        _, state_key, path = heappop(open_set)\n        current_state = {\n            'player': state_key[0],\n            'boxes': set(state_key[1]),\n            'goals': initial_state['goals'],\n            'walls': initial_state['walls']\n        }\n        \n        if is_solved(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        if is_deadlock(current_state):\n            continue\n        \n        for move_name, move in moves.items():\n            if is_valid_move(current_state, move):\n                new_state = apply_move(current_state, move)\n                new_state_key = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n                \n                if new_state_key not in visited:\n                    visited.add(new_state_key)\n                    cost = len(path) + 1 + heuristic(new_state)\n                    heappush(open_set, (cost, new_state_key, path + move_name))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code includes a simple deadlock detection mechanism to help prune the search space.
