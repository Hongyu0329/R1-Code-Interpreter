    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's analyze the initial state of the puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + + +  \n+ + + + $ + + +  \n+ + X + + $ + +  \n+ X - $ + + + +  \n+ - @ + + + + +  \n+ - - - $ + + +  \n+ @ - - - - + +  \n+ * @ - X + + +  \n+ + + + + + + +  \n```\n\nThe player (*) is at position (7, 2). The boxes (@) are at positions (4, 2), (6, 1), and (7, 3). The goals (X) are at positions (2, 2), (3, 1), and (7, 4).\n\nThe strategy is to move the player to push the boxes onto the goals. We need to carefully plan the moves to avoid getting the boxes stuck in corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\nLet's attempt to solve this puzzle by generating a sequence of moves. We will use a simple approach to try and solve the puzzle manually, and if needed, we can write a script to explore possible moves.\n\n1. Move the player to push the box at (7, 3) to the goal at (7, 4).\n2. Move the player to push the box at (6, 1) to the goal at (3, 1).\n3.
