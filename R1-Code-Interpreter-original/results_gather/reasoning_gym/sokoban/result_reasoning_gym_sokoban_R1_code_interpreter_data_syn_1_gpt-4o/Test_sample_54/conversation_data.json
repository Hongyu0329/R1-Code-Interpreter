    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. Identify the initial positions of the player, boxes, and goals.\n2. Determine the possible moves for the player.\n3. Implement a search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe initial positions are:\n- Player (*) at (4, 4)\n- Boxes (@) at (2, 1), (3, 4), (6, 4), (8, 2)\n- Goals (X) at (2, 4), (4, 3), (6, 1), (8, 1)\n\nThe walls (+) form the boundaries, and the player can only move to empty positions (-) or push boxes into empty positions or goals.\n\nLet's implement a search algorithm to find the solution. We'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible moves until we find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = {\n    'player': (4, 4),\n    'boxes': {(2, 1), (3, 4), (6, 4), (8, 2)},\n    'goals': {(2, 4), (4, 3), (6, 1), (8, 1)},\n    'walls': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5),\n              (1, 0), (1, 5),\n              (2, 0), (2, 5),\n              (3, 0), (3, 5),\n              (4, 0), (4, 5),\n              (5, 0), (5, 5),\n              (6, 0), (6, 5),\n              (7, 0), (7, 5),\n              (8, 0), (8, 5),\n              (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5)},\n}\n\n# Define possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1)\n}\n\n# Check if the move is valid\ndef is_valid_move(state, move):\n    player_pos = state['player']\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + move[0], player_pos[1] + move[1])\n    \n    if new_player_pos in state['walls']:\n        return False\n    \n    if new_player_pos in state['boxes']:\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move[0], new_player_pos[1] + move[1])\n        if new_box_pos in state['walls'] or new_box_pos in state['boxes']:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Apply the move to the state\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player_pos = state['player']\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + move[0], player_pos[1] + move[1])\n    \n    new_boxes = set(state['boxes'])\n    if new_player_pos in new_boxes:\n        new_boxes.remove(new_player_pos)\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move[0], new_player_pos[1] + move[1])\n        new_boxes.add(new_box_pos)\n    \n    return {\n        'player': new_player_pos,\n        'boxes': new_boxes,\n        'goals': state['goals'],\n        'walls': state['walls']\n    }\n\n# Check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(state):\n    return state['boxes'] == state['goals']\n\n# Perform BFS to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for move_name, move in moves.items():\n            if is_valid_move(current_state, move):\n                new_state = apply_move(current_state, move)\n                state_key = (new_state['player'], frozenset(new_state['boxes']))\n                \n                if state_key not in visited:\n                    visited.add(state_key)\n                    queue.append((new_state, path + move_name))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will execute a breadth-first search to find the shortest sequence of moves that solves the Sokoban puzzle.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are going to solve a 'sokoban' puzzle.\n\n* - The player\n% - The player on a goal\n@ - A box\nX - A goal\n$ - A box on a goal\n+ - A wall\n- - An empty position\n\nYour solution must be a string of characters enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<a string of characters>>>., ex: LDURRUDL.\n\nHere is your puzzle:\n+ + + + + +  \n+ - - - - +  \n+ @ - $ X +  \n+ - - @ - +  \n+ - X * - +  \n+ - - - - +  \n+ X - @ - +  \n+ $ - - - +  \n+ X @ - + +  \n+ + + + + +  \n\n",
