    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D). The player can only push one box at a time and cannot move through walls (+) or boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ + X @ * +  \n+ + - - @ +  \n+ $ - - X +  \n+ + + + + +  \n+ + + + $ +  \n+ + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is initially at position (1, 4).\n- There are three boxes (@) at positions (1, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 4).\n- There are three goals (X) at positions (1, 2), (3, 5), and (4, 5).\n\nThe goal is to move all boxes onto the goals. Let's plan the moves:\n\n1. Move the player to push the box at (1, 3) to the goal at (1, 2).\n2. Move the player to push the box at (2, 4) to the goal at (3, 5).\n3. Move the player to push the box at (3, 4) to the goal at (4, 5).\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the solution:\n\n```python\ndef solve_sokoban():\n    # Initial positions\n    player_pos = (1, 4)\n    boxes = [(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)]\n    goals = [(1, 2), (3, 5), (4, 5)]\n    \n    # Moves: L, R, U, D\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Move 1: Push box from (1, 3) to (1, 2)\n    moves.extend(['L', 'L'])\n    \n    # Move 2: Move player to (2, 4) and push box to (3, 5)\n    moves.extend(['R', 'R', 'D', 'D', 'L', 'U', 'R', 'R', 'D'])\n    \n    # Move 3: Move player to (3, 4) and push box to (4, 5)\n    moves.extend(['U', 'L', 'D', 'D', 'R'])\n    \n    # Return the solution as a string\n    return ''.join(moves)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solve_sokoban())\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the solution.",
