    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that results in all boxes being placed on goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n+ + + + + + +  \n+ + + X @ * +  \n+ + X X @ - +  \n+ + + + @ - +  \n+ + $ + - - +  \n+ + + + + + +  \n```\n\n- The player (*) is initially at position (1, 5).\n- There are three boxes (@) at positions (1, 4), (2, 4), and (3, 4).\n- There are three goals (X) at positions (1, 3), (2, 3), and (2, 2).\n- One box is already on a goal ($) at position (4, 3).\n\nThe task is to move the player to push the boxes onto the goals. We need to find a sequence of moves that accomplishes this.\n\nLet's write a Python script to help us find the solution. The script will simulate the moves and check if the boxes are placed on the goals.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state of the puzzle\ninitial_state = (\n    (1, 5),  # Player position\n    ((1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)),  # Box positions\n)\n\n# Define the goal positions\ngoal_positions = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)}\n\n# Define the walls\nwalls = {\n    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6),\n    (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 6),\n    (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6),\n    (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6),\n    (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6),\n    (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6),\n}\n\n# Define the possible moves\nmoves = {\n    'U': (-1, 0),\n    'D': (1, 0),\n    'L': (0, -1),\n    'R': (0, 1),\n}\n\n# Function to check if a position is within bounds and not a wall\ndef is_valid_position(pos):\n    return pos not in walls\n\n# Function to apply a move\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    player_pos, box_positions = state\n    move_delta = moves[move]\n    new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + move_delta[0], player_pos[1] + move_delta[1])\n    \n    if new_player_pos in box_positions:\n        new_box_pos = (new_player_pos[0] + move_delta[0], new_player_pos[1] + move_delta[1])\n        if not is_valid_position(new_box_pos) or new_box_pos in box_positions:\n            return None\n        new_box_positions = tuple(\n            new_box_pos if box == new_player_pos else box for box in box_positions\n        )\n    else:\n        if not is_valid_position(new_player_pos):\n            return None\n        new_box_positions = box_positions\n    \n    return (new_player_pos, new_box_positions)\n\n# Function to check if the puzzle is solved\ndef is_solved(state):\n    _, box_positions = state\n    return all(pos in goal_positions for pos in box_positions)\n\n# Breadth-first search to find the solution\ndef solve_sokoban(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, \"\")])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_solved(current_state):\n            return path\n        \n        for move in moves:\n            new_state = apply_move(current_state, move)\n            if new_state and new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + move))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_sokoban(initial_state)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script uses a breadth-first search to explore all possible sequences of moves until it finds a solution where all boxes are on the goals.
