    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at (5, 3).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), and (3, 7).\n   - The goals (X) are at positions (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 8), (4, 5), (5, 5), and (6, 5).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box towards a goal.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (5, 4) onto the goal at (5, 5).\n   - Move the player to the top to push the box at (3, 4) onto the goal at (3, 3).\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (3, 6) onto the goal at (3, 8).\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (3, 2) onto the goal at (2, 2).\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (2, 6) onto the goal at (2, 5).\n   - Finally, move the player to the bottom to push the box at (3, 7) onto the goal at (4, 5).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: LURRDLUURRDDLLURR.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LURRDLUURRDDLLURR>>>"
