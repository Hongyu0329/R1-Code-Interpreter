    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (3, 4).\n   - There are three boxes (@) at positions (2, 4), (6, 2), and (6, 3).\n   - There are three goals (X) at positions (2, 2), (4, 3), and (4, 4).\n   - There are two boxes already on goals ($) at positions (1, 4) and (5, 4).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes (@) to the goals (X) such that all goals are covered by boxes.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be retrieved.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left of the box at (2, 4) to push it down to the goal at (4, 3).\n   - Move the player to the right of the box at (6, 2) to push it up to the goal at (2, 2).\n   - Finally, move the player to the right of the box at (6, 3) to push it up to the goal at (4, 4).\n\n5. **Execution:**\n   - Move the player: L (to (3, 3)), U (to (2, 3)), R (to (2, 4)), D (to (3, 4)), D (to (4, 4)), L (to (4, 3)), U (to (3, 3)), L (to (3, 2)), D (to (4, 2)), D (to (5, 2)), R (to (5, 3)), U (to (4, 3)), U (to (3, 3)), R (to (3, 4)), D (to (4, 4)), D (to (5, 4)), R (to (5, 5)), U (to (4, 5)), U (to (3, 5)), L (to (3, 4)), D (to (4, 4)).\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: LURDDLUUDDRUURDDRUUL.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<LURDDLUUDDRUURDDRUUL>>>"
