    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push boxes, not pull them. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (2, 2).\n   - There are two boxes (@) at positions (2, 5) and (2, 6).\n   - There are two goals (X) at positions (1, 1) and (3, 5).\n   - One box is already on a goal ($) at position (2, 3).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes to cover all the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - First, we need to move the player to a position where they can push the boxes.\n   - The player can move to the right to push the box at (2, 5) towards the goal at (3, 5).\n   - After placing the first box, the player can then move to push the second box at (2, 6) to the goal at (1, 1).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player right to position (2, 3) to push the box at (2, 5).\n   - Push the box at (2, 5) down to (3, 5).\n   - Move the player back to the left to position (2, 2).\n   - Move the player up to position (1, 2).\n   - Move the player right to position (1, 3).\n   - Move the player down to position (2, 3).\n   - Move the player right to position (2, 4).\n   - Push the box at (2, 6) up to (1, 6).\n   - Move the player left to position (1, 5).\n   - Move the player up to position (1, 4).\n   - Move the player right to position (1, 5).\n   - Push the box at (1, 6) left to (1, 5).\n   - Push the box at (1, 5) left to (1, 4).\n   - Push the box at (1, 4) left to (1, 3).\n   - Push the box at (1, 3) left to (1, 2).\n   - Push the box at (1, 2) left to (1, 1).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: RDDLUURRULULUL.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RDDLUURRULULUL>>>"
