    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1, 4).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), and (5, 3).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (2, 2), (3, 5), (4, 5), and (5, 4).\n   - There is a box on a goal ($) at position (6, 2).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n   - Use the existing box on a goal ($) as a reference to avoid unnecessary moves.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to position (1, 3).\n   - Move down to position (2, 3) to push the box at (2, 3) down to (3, 3).\n   - Move the player around to push the box at (3, 3) to the right onto the goal at (3, 5).\n   - Move the player to push the box at (3, 4) down to (4, 4).\n   - Push the box at (4, 4) to the right onto the goal at (4, 5).\n   - Move the player to push the box at (5, 3) up to (4, 3).\n   - Push the box at (4, 3) to the right onto the goal at (5, 4).\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at (4, 4) down onto the goal at (5, 4).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: LDDRRUURRDDLLURR.\n\nBy following these steps, all boxes will be placed on the goals, solving the puzzle.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LDDRRUURRDDLLURR>>>"
