    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + +  \n   + * $ - - - +  \n   + @ - @ X - +  \n   + - - - - - +  \n   + X + - @ X +  \n   + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Current Positions:**\n   - Player (*) is at (1, 1).\n   - Box on goal ($) is at (1, 2).\n   - Boxes (@) are at (2, 1), (2, 3), and (4, 4).\n   - Goals (X) are at (2, 4), (4, 1), and (4, 5).\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - First, move the player to push the box at (2, 1) to the goal at (4, 1).\n   - Then, move the player to push the box at (2, 3) to the goal at (2, 4).\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at (4, 4) to the goal at (4, 5).\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player down to (2, 1) to push the box down.\n   - Push the box down to (3, 1).\n   - Push the box down to (4, 1) (goal).\n   - Move the player to (2, 3) to push the box right.\n   - Push the box right to (2, 4) (goal).\n   - Move the player to (4, 4) to push the box right.\n   - Push the box right to (4, 5) (goal).\n\n6. **Detailed Moves:**\n   - D (down to (2, 1))\n   - D (push box to (3, 1))\n   - D (push box to (4, 1))\n   - U (up to (3, 1))\n   - R (right to (3, 2))\n   - U (up to (2, 2))\n   - R (right to (2, 3))\n   - R (push box to (2, 4))\n   - D (down to (3, 4))\n   - D (down to (4, 4))\n   - R (push box to (4, 5))\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: <<<DDDRURRRDDRR>>>."
