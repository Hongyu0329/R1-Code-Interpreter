    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + +  \n   + X - - - +  \n   + - @ - $ +  \n   + - $ + + +  \n   + - @ X - +  \n   + - * $ - +  \n   + - - - - +  \n   + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Goals and Boxes:**\n   - Goals (X) are located at (1,1) and (4,4).\n   - Boxes (@) are located at (2,2), (4,2), and (5,3).\n   - Box on goal ($) is located at (2,4) and (5,5).\n\n3. **Player's Initial Position:**\n   - The player (*) is at (5,3).\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals. The box at (2,2) can be pushed to (1,1), and the box at (4,2) can be pushed to (4,4).\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the box at (2,2):\n     - Move up (U) to (4,3)\n     - Move up (U) to (3,3)\n     - Move left (L) to (3,2)\n     - Move up (U) to (2,2)\n   - Push the box at (2,2) to the goal at (1,1):\n     - Move left (L) to (2,1)\n     - Push right (R) to (1,1)\n   - Move the player to the box at (4,2):\n     - Move down (D) to (2,2)\n     - Move down (D) to (3,2)\n     - Move down (D) to (4,2)\n   - Push the box at (4,2) to the goal at (4,4):\n     - Move right (R) to (4,3)\n     - Push right (R) to (4,4)\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The player should now be able to move freely to ensure all boxes are on goals.\n\nThe sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is:\n\n<<<UULULRDDR>>>"
