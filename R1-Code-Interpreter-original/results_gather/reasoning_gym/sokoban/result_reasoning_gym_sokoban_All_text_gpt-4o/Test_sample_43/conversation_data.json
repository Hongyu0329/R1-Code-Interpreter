    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1, 6).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (2, 4), (2, 5), (4, 3), and (4, 6).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 5).\n   - There is a box on a goal ($) at position (3, 5).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box.\n   - Push the boxes towards the goals, ensuring not to block any box in a corner or against a wall where it cannot be moved further.\n   - Use the existing box on a goal ($) to our advantage by not disturbing it unless necessary.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to position (1, 5): L\n   - Move the player to the left to position (1, 4): L\n   - Move the player down to position (2, 4): D\n   - Push the box at (2, 4) down to (3, 4): D\n   - Move the player right to position (2, 5): R\n   - Push the box at (2, 5) down to (3, 5): D\n   - Move the player down to position (3, 5): D\n   - Move the player left to position (3, 4): L\n   - Push the box at (3, 4) left to (3, 3): L\n   - Move the player up to position (2, 3): U\n   - Move the player left to position (2, 2): L\n   - Move the player down to position (3, 2): D\n   - Push the box at (4, 3) up to (3, 3): U\n   - Move the player right to position (3, 4): R\n   - Move the player down to position (4, 4): D\n   - Push the box at (4, 6) left to (4, 5): L\n   - Move the player left to position (4, 4): L\n   - Push the box at (4, 5) up to (3, 5): U\n\n5. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure all boxes are on goals.\n   - The boxes are now at positions (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), and (4, 5), all of which are goals.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LLDRDRDLLULDRULDLU>>>"
