    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + +\n   + * - - - +\n   + - @ - $ +\n   + - @ X X +\n   + - @ - X +\n   + + + + + +\n   ```\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Current Positions:**\n   - Player (*) is at (1, 1).\n   - Boxes (@) are at (2, 2), (3, 2), and (4, 2).\n   - Goals (X) are at (3, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 4).\n   - One box ($) is already on a goal at (2, 4).\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Move the player to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Ensure that boxes are not pushed into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the first box at (2, 2).\n     - R (right) to (1, 2)\n     - D (down) to (2, 2)\n   - Push the first box down to (3, 2).\n     - D (down) to (3, 2)\n   - Move the player to the second box at (3, 2).\n     - D (down) to (4, 2)\n   - Push the second box right to (3, 3).\n     - R (right) to (3, 3)\n   - Move the player to the third box at (4, 2).\n     - U (up) to (3, 2)\n     - R (right) to (3, 3)\n     - D (down) to (4, 3)\n   - Push the third box right to (4, 4).\n     - R (right) to (4, 4)\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The player should now be able to push the remaining boxes onto the goals.\n\n7. **Solution Path:**\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: RDDRURRDD.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RDDRURRDD>>>"
