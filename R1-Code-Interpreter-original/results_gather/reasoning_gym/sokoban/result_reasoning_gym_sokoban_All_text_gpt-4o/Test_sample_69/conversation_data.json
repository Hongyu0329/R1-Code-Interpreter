    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (3, 4).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (1, 2), (2, 5), (2, 7), (4, 4), and (5, 5).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 8), and (5, 4).\n   - There are boxes on goals ($) at position (3, 5).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) to cover all goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to push the boxes towards the nearest goals.\n   - Ensure that boxes are not pushed into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n   - Use the player to maneuver around the boxes and push them into the correct positions.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (4, 4) onto the goal at (5, 4).\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (2, 5) onto the goal at (2, 6).\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (2, 7) onto the goal at (3, 8).\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (1, 2) onto the goal at (2, 2).\n   - Finally, move the player to the right to push the box at (5, 5) onto the goal at (1, 4).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: RDRULDLURRULDLUURR.\n\nBy following these steps, all boxes will be placed on the goals, solving the puzzle.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RDRULDLURRULDLUURR>>>"
