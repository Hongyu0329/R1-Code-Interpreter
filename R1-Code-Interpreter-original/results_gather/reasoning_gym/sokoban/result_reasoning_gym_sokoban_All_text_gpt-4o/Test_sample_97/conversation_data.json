    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The puzzle is solved when all boxes are on goals, either as $ (box on a goal) or as % (player on a goal with a box).\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: \n   - The player (*) is located at (8, 2).\n   - There are several boxes (@) and goals (X) scattered throughout the grid.\n\n2. **Objective**:\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The player can only push one box at a time.\n   - The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes (@) unless pushing them.\n   - The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), Down (D).\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - Identify the nearest box that can be moved to a goal.\n   - Plan a path for the player to reach the box and push it towards a goal.\n   - Repeat the process until all boxes are on goals.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the player to the nearest box that can be pushed towards a goal.\n   - Push the box onto the goal.\n   - Repeat the process for the remaining boxes.\n\nAfter analyzing the puzzle and considering the positions of the boxes and goals, the following sequence of moves will solve the puzzle:\n\n- Move the player to the first box and push it onto a goal.\n- Continue moving and pushing boxes until all are on goals.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<DDRRUULDDRRUURRDDLLUUURRDDLLDDRRUU>>>"
