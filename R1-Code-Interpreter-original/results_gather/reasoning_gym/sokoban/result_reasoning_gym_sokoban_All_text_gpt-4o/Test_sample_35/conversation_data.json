    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + +  \n   + * $ - - +  \n   + @ @ - - +  \n   + X X + - +  \n   + + + $ - +  \n   + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n   - The player (*) is initially at position (1, 1).\n   - There are two boxes (@) at positions (2, 1) and (2, 2).\n   - There are two goals (X) at positions (3, 1) and (3, 2).\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - The player can move to the right to push the box at (1, 2) to the right.\n   - Then, the player can move down to push the box at (2, 2) down onto the goal at (3, 2).\n   - Finally, the player can move to the left to push the box at (2, 1) down onto the goal at (3, 1).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move Right (R) to position (1, 2).\n   - Move Down (D) to position (2, 2).\n   - Move Right (R) to push the box from (2, 2) to (2, 3).\n   - Move Down (D) to position (3, 3).\n   - Move Left (L) to push the box from (2, 3) to (3, 3).\n   - Move Up (U) to position (2, 3).\n   - Move Left (L) to position (2, 2).\n   - Move Down (D) to push the box from (2, 2) to (3, 2).\n   - Move Left (L) to position (3, 1).\n   - Move Up (U) to position (2, 1).\n   - Move Left (L) to push the box from (2, 1) to (3, 1).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves is: RDRDLULDLUL.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RDRDLULDLUL>>>"
