    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes can only be pushed, not pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - The player (*) is located at the bottom row, fourth column from the left.\n   - There are several boxes (@) and goals (X) scattered throughout the grid.\n   - Some boxes are already on goals ($).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - The player can only push boxes, not pull them.\n   - The player cannot move through walls or boxes.\n   - The player can only push one box at a time.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Identify the nearest box that can be moved towards a goal.\n   - Plan a path for the player to reach the box and push it towards a goal.\n   - Repeat the process until all boxes are on goals.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the nearest box that can be pushed towards a goal.\n   - Push the box onto the goal.\n   - Repeat the process for the remaining boxes.\n\n6. **Execution:**\n   - Start by moving the player to the left to push the box in the bottom row onto the goal.\n   - Continue moving the player and pushing boxes until all are on goals.\n\nAfter analyzing the puzzle and planning the moves, the solution can be executed as a sequence of moves. Here is the solution:\n\n<<<UULLLDDRRRUUULLDDRRRDDD>>>"
