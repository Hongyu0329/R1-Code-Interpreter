    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at (3, 4).\n   - There are five boxes (@) located at (2, 3), (2, 5), (5, 2), (5, 5), and (6, 4).\n   - There are five goals (X) located at (2, 6), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), and (5, 4).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to positions where they can push boxes towards the goals.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals first.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or positions where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (2, 3) onto the goal at (3, 3).\n   - Move the player down to push the box at (5, 2) onto the goal at (4, 3).\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (5, 5) onto the goal at (5, 4).\n   - Move the player up to push the box at (6, 4) onto the goal at (4, 4).\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at (2, 5) onto the goal at (2, 6).\n\n5. **Solution Path:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: LDDRRUULDDRRUULDD.\n\nBy following these steps, all boxes will be placed on the goals, solving the puzzle.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<LDDRRUULDDRRUULDD>>>."
