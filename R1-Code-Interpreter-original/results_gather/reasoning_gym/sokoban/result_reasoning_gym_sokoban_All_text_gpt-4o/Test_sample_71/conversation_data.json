    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes can only be pushed, not pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (5, 4).\n   - There are four boxes (@) at positions (3, 3), (5, 3), (5, 5), and (6, 5).\n   - There are four goals (X) at positions (4, 5), (5, 2), (6, 4), and (6, 6).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box towards a goal.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to position (5, 3) to push the box at (5, 3) down to (6, 3).\n   - Push the box at (6, 3) to the right to (6, 4), which is a goal.\n   - Move the player to position (5, 5) to push the box at (5, 5) down to (6, 5).\n   - Push the box at (6, 5) to the right to (6, 6), which is a goal.\n   - Move the player to position (3, 3) to push the box at (3, 3) down to (4, 3).\n   - Push the box at (4, 3) to the right to (4, 4), then down to (5, 4), and finally to the left to (5, 2), which is a goal.\n   - Move the player to position (5, 4) to push the box at (5, 4) up to (4, 4).\n   - Push the box at (4, 4) to the right to (4, 5), which is a goal.\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: LDDRRUULDDRRUUL.\n\nThe final answer, representing the sequence of moves, is:\n\n<<<LDDRRUULDDRRUUL>>>"
