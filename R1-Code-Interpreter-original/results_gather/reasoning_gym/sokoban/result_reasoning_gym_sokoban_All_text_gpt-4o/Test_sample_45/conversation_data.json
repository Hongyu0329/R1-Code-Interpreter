    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be moved through walls or other boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (6, 6).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (2, 2), (5, 3), and (5, 4).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 4), and (4, 5).\n   - There are boxes on goals ($) at positions (5, 5) and (5, 6).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) to cover all goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Ensure that boxes are not pushed into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n   - Use the empty spaces to maneuver the player and boxes effectively.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to position (6, 5) to push the box at (5, 5) upwards.\n   - Push the box at (5, 5) to (4, 5) to cover the goal.\n   - Move the player around to push the box at (5, 4) to the left to (5, 3).\n   - Push the box at (5, 3) upwards to (4, 3).\n   - Move the player to push the box at (4, 3) to the right to (4, 4) to cover the goal.\n   - Move the player to push the box at (2, 2) downwards to (3, 2).\n   - Push the box at (3, 2) to the right to (3, 3).\n   - Push the box at (3, 3) upwards to (2, 3) to cover the goal.\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - Ensure all boxes are on goals.\n\nBy following these steps, we can solve the puzzle. The sequence of moves is:\n\n<<<UULLDDRRUURRDDLL>>>"
