    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1,3).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (2,3), (2,4), (4,2), and (8,3).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (3,1), (3,4), (5,1), and (8,4).\n   - There are boxes on goals ($) at positions (2,1) and (2,2).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) to cover all goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box towards a goal.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to position (2,2) to push the box at (2,3) downwards.\n   - Push the box at (2,3) to (3,3).\n   - Move the player to position (3,2) to push the box at (3,3) to (4,3).\n   - Move the player to position (4,2) to push the box at (4,3) to (5,3).\n   - Move the player to position (5,2) to push the box at (5,3) to (6,3).\n   - Move the player to position (6,2) to push the box at (6,3) to (7,3).\n   - Move the player to position (7,2) to push the box at (7,3) to (8,3).\n   - Move the player to position (8,2) to push the box at (8,3) to (8,4), covering the goal.\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - Move the player to position (2,4) to push the box at (2,4) to (3,4), covering the goal.\n   - Move the player to position (4,4) to push the box at (4,2) to (5,2), covering the goal.\n\nBy following these steps, all boxes will be on goals, solving the puzzle.\n\nThe solution in terms of player moves is:\n\n<<<DDRRUURRDDLLDDRRUURRDDLL>>>"
