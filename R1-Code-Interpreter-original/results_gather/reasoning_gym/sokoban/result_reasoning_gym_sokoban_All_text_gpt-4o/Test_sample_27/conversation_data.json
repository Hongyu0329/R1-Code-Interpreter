    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + +  \n   + - @ - - X +  \n   + - - X @ - +  \n   + - X - @ * +  \n   + - - - $ - +  \n   + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Current Positions:**\n   - Player (*) is at (3, 5).\n   - Boxes (@) are at (1, 2), (2, 4), and (3, 4).\n   - Goals (X) are at (1, 5), (2, 3), and (3, 2).\n   - One box is already on a goal ($) at (4, 4).\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Move the player to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Avoid getting boxes stuck in corners or against walls where they cannot be moved.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to position (3, 4) to push the box at (3, 4) to the left onto the goal at (3, 2).\n   - Move the player to the top to position (2, 4) to push the box at (2, 4) down onto the goal at (2, 3).\n   - Finally, move the player to the top to position (1, 2) to push the box at (1, 2) to the right onto the goal at (1, 5).\n\n6. **Execution:**\n   - Move sequence: L (left), L (left), U (up), R (right), D (down), U (up), R (right), R (right).\n\nBy following these steps, all boxes will be placed on the goals.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<LLURDURR>>>"
