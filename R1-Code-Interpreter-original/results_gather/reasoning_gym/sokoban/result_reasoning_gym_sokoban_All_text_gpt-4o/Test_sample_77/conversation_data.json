    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at position (4, 5).\n   - There are three boxes (@) located at positions (4, 4), (4, 3), and (5, 4).\n   - There are two goals (X) located at positions (3, 4) and (6, 2).\n   - One box is already on a goal ($) at position (2, 2).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes (@) to cover all the goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - First, we need to move the player to a position where they can push the boxes.\n   - We need to ensure that boxes are not pushed into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n   - We should aim to move the boxes towards the goals efficiently.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to position (4, 4) to push the box at (4, 4) downwards.\n   - Push the box at (4, 4) down to (5, 4).\n   - Move the player to the left to position (4, 3) to push the box at (4, 3) downwards.\n   - Push the box at (4, 3) down to (5, 3).\n   - Move the player to the right to position (5, 4) to push the box at (5, 4) to the right.\n   - Push the box at (5, 4) to the right to (5, 5).\n   - Move the player to the right to position (5, 5) to push the box at (5, 5) upwards.\n   - Push the box at (5, 5) upwards to (4, 5).\n   - Move the player to the left to position (5, 3) to push the box at (5, 3) upwards.\n   - Push the box at (5, 3) upwards to (4, 3).\n   - Move the player to the left to position (4, 3) to push the box at (4, 3) to the left.\n   - Push the box at (4, 3) to the left to (4, 2).\n   - Move the player to the left to position (4, 2) to push the box at (4, 2) upwards.\n   - Push the box at (4, 2) upwards to (3, 2).\n   - Move the player to the right to position (3, 4) to push the box at (3, 4) to the right.\n   - Push the box at (3, 4) to the right to (3, 5).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The boxes are now on the goals, and the puzzle is solved.\n\nThe sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LLDDRRUULDDRR>>>"
