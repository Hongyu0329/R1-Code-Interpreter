    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (3, 5).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (2, 5), (3, 4), and (6, 1).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (1, 5), (4, 4), and (7, 1).\n   - There are boxes on goals ($) at positions (4, 2) and (8, 4).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) to cover all goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Ensure that boxes are not pushed into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n   - Use the empty spaces (-) strategically to maneuver the player and boxes.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to position (3, 4) to push the box at (3, 4) down to (4, 4), which is a goal.\n   - Move the player to position (2, 5) to push the box at (2, 5) down to (3, 5).\n   - Move the player to position (3, 5) to push the box at (3, 5) down to (4, 5).\n   - Move the player to position (4, 5) to push the box at (4, 5) left to (4, 4), which is a goal.\n   - Move the player to position (6, 1) to push the box at (6, 1) up to (5, 1).\n   - Move the player to position (5, 1) to push the box at (5, 1) up to (4, 1).\n   - Move the player to position (4, 1) to push the box at (4, 1) right to (4, 2), which is a goal.\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - Ensure all boxes are on goals.\n\nBy following these steps, we can solve the puzzle. The sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<UURRDDLLDDRRUULDD>>>"
