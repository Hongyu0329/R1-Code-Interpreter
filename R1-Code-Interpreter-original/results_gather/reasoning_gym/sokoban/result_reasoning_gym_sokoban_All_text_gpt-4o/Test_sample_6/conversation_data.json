    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes can only be pushed, not pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1, 7).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (3, 5), (4, 5), and (4, 6).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (1, 5), (3, 3), (3, 5), and (4, 3).\n   - There are boxes on goals ($) at positions (1, 2) and (5, 3).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box towards a goal.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to position (1, 8).\n   - Move the player down to position (2, 8).\n   - Move the player left to position (2, 7).\n   - Move the player left to position (2, 6).\n   - Move the player down to position (3, 6).\n   - Move the player left to position (3, 5) to push the box to the left onto the goal at (3, 3).\n   - Move the player down to position (4, 5).\n   - Move the player right to position (4, 6).\n   - Move the player down to position (5, 6).\n   - Move the player left to position (5, 5) to push the box to the left onto the goal at (4, 3).\n   - Move the player up to position (4, 5).\n   - Move the player left to position (4, 4).\n   - Move the player down to position (5, 4).\n   - Move the player left to position (5, 3) to push the box to the left onto the goal at (5, 2).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - Ensure all boxes are on goals.\n\nBy following these steps, we can solve the puzzle. The sequence of moves is represented by the string of characters indicating the directions: L (left), R (right), U (up), D (down).\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<RRDLLDLLURRDL>>>"
