    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes can only be pushed, not pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1, 1).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (1, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 2).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (1, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 2).\n   - There are boxes on goals ($) at positions (2, 3) and (3, 2).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - First, we need to move the player to a position where it can push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - We need to ensure that we do not block any boxes in corners or against walls where they cannot be moved.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to position (1, 2) to push the box at (1, 2) to the right onto the goal at (1, 3).\n   - Move the player down to position (2, 2) to push the box at (2, 2) down onto the goal at (3, 2).\n   - Move the player to the left to position (2, 1) to push the box at (2, 1) down onto the goal at (3, 1).\n\n5. **Execution:**\n   - R (Move right to (1, 2))\n   - R (Push box from (1, 2) to (1, 3))\n   - D (Move down to (2, 2))\n   - D (Push box from (2, 2) to (3, 2))\n   - L (Move left to (2, 1))\n   - D (Push box from (2, 1) to (3, 1))\n\nBy following these steps, all boxes will be on the goals, and the puzzle will be solved.\n\nThe final solution is:\n<<<RRDDLD>>>"
