    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + + +  \n   + - - - - - - +  \n   + - $ @ - $ - +  \n   + - X - @ $ - +  \n   + - - - X * - +  \n   + + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n   - The player (*) is at position (4, 6).\n   - There are three boxes (@) and two boxes on goals ($).\n   - There are two goals (X) at positions (3, 2) and (4, 4).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Move the player to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Ensure that boxes are not pushed into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (4, 5) onto the goal at (4, 4).\n   - Move the player up to push the box at (3, 4) onto the goal at (3, 2).\n\n5. **Execution:**\n   - Move left (L) to position (4, 5).\n   - Move left (L) to position (4, 4), pushing the box onto the goal.\n   - Move up (U) to position (3, 4).\n   - Move left (L) to position (3, 3).\n   - Move left (L) to position (3, 2), pushing the box onto the goal.\n\n6. **Final Configuration:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + + +  \n   + - - - - - - +  \n   + - $ @ - $ - +  \n   + - $ - - - - +  \n   + - - - X - - +  \n   + + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n   - All boxes are on goals.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is the sequence of moves: <<<LLULL>>>."
