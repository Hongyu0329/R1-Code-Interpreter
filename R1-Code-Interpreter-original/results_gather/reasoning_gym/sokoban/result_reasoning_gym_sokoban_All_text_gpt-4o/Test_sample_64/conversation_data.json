    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at row 3, column 7.\n   - There are four boxes (@) located at:\n     - Row 2, column 4\n     - Row 2, column 6\n     - Row 3, column 3\n     - Row 5, column 6\n   - There are four goals (X) located at:\n     - Row 2, column 3\n     - Row 2, column 5\n     - Row 3, column 2\n     - Row 6, column 2\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move each box onto a goal.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box.\n   - Push the boxes towards the goals, ensuring not to block any box in a corner or against a wall where it cannot be moved.\n   - Use the goals as temporary storage if needed, but ensure all boxes end up on goals.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to position them to push the box at row 2, column 6.\n   - Push the box at row 2, column 6 to the right onto the goal at row 2, column 5.\n   - Move the player down and left to push the box at row 3, column 3 to the left onto the goal at row 3, column 2.\n   - Move the player to the bottom row to push the box at row 5, column 6 up to the goal at row 6, column 2.\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at row 2, column 4 to the right onto the goal at row 2, column 3.\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: LURRDLUURRDDLL.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LURRDLUURRDDLL>>>"
