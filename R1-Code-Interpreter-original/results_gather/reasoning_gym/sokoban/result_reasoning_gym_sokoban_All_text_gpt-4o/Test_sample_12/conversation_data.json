    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at position (7, 7).\n   - There are 5 boxes (@) and 6 goals (X).\n   - One box is already on a goal ($) at position (1, 1).\n\n2. **Goals and Boxes:**\n   - We need to move the boxes onto the remaining goals.\n   - The goals are located at positions: (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 3), and (5, 4).\n   - The boxes are located at positions: (1, 7), (2, 6), (2, 7), (4, 2), and (6, 4).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be retrieved.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the box at (6, 4) and push it to the goal at (5, 4).\n   - Move the player to the box at (4, 2) and push it to the goal at (3, 1).\n   - Move the player to the box at (2, 6) and push it to the goal at (2, 5).\n   - Move the player to the box at (2, 7) and push it to the goal at (3, 4).\n   - Finally, move the player to the box at (1, 7) and push it to the goal at (1, 5).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The player should carefully navigate around the boxes and walls to achieve the above steps.\n\nBy following these steps, we can solve the puzzle. The sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<UUULLLDDRRRUUURRDDLLDDRRUUUURRDDLLL>>>"
