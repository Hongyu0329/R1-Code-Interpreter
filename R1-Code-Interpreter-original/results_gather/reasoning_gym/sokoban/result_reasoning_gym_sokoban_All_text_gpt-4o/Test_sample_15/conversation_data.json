    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + + +  \n   + X + $ X @ * +  \n   + - - - - - @ +  \n   + @ - $ - - - +  \n   + - - - - - X +  \n   + + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Current Positions:**\n   - Player (*) is at (1, 6).\n   - Boxes (@) are at (1, 5), (2, 6), and (3, 1).\n   - Goals (X) are at (1, 1), (1, 4), and (4, 6).\n\n4. **Plan:**\n   - Move the player to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push the nearest box onto a goal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move the player left to push the box at (1, 5) onto the goal at (1, 4).\n     - L (Player moves to (1, 5))\n     - L (Player pushes the box from (1, 5) to (1, 4))\n   - Move the player down to push the box at (2, 6) onto the goal at (4, 6).\n     - D (Player moves to (2, 5))\n     - D (Player moves to (3, 5))\n     - R (Player moves to (3, 6))\n     - D (Player pushes the box from (2, 6) to (3, 6))\n     - D (Player pushes the box from (3, 6) to (4, 6))\n   - Move the player to push the box at (3, 1) onto the goal at (1, 1).\n     - U (Player moves to (3, 5))\n     - L (Player moves to (3, 4))\n     - L (Player moves to (3, 3))\n     - L (Player moves to (3, 2))\n     - L (Player moves to (3, 1))\n     - U (Player pushes the box from (3, 1) to (2, 1))\n     - U (Player pushes the box from (2, 1) to (1, 1))\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: LLD, DDR, D, ULLLLUU.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LLDDRRDDULLLLUU>>>"
