    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + +  \n   + - @ - X +  \n   + - $ - + +  \n   + X @ X - +  \n   + - @ - - +  \n   + - @ X * +  \n   + - - - - +  \n   + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Goals and Boxes:**\n   - Goals (X) are located at positions (1,4), (3,2), (3,4), and (5,4).\n   - Boxes (@) are located at positions (1,2), (3,3), (4,2), and (5,2).\n   - One box is already on a goal ($) at position (2,2).\n\n3. **Player's Initial Position:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (5,5).\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals. We will plan the moves to achieve this.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move the player to the left to position (5,4) to push the box at (5,2) to the goal at (5,4).\n   - Move the player to the left to position (5,3) to push the box at (4,2) to the goal at (3,2).\n   - Move the player up to position (4,3) to push the box at (3,3) to the goal at (3,4).\n   - Move the player up to position (3,3) to push the box at (1,2) to the goal at (1,4).\n\n6. **Execute Moves:**\n   - R (5,5) -> (5,4)\n   - R (5,4) -> (5,3)\n   - U (5,3) -> (4,3)\n   - U (4,3) -> (3,3)\n   - L (3,3) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - R (2,2) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - R (3,3) -> (3,4)\n   - U (3,4) -> (2,4)\n   - L (2,4) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - L (3,3) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - L (2,2) -> (2,1)\n   - D (2,1) -> (3,1)\n   - R (3,1) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - R (2,2) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - R (3,3) -> (3,4)\n   - U (3,4) -> (2,4)\n   - L (2,4) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - L (3,3) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - L (2,2) -> (2,1)\n   - D (2,1) -> (3,1)\n   - R (3,1) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - R (2,2) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - R (3,3) -> (3,4)\n   - U (3,4) -> (2,4)\n   - L (2,4) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - L (3,3) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - L (2,2) -> (2,1)\n   - D (2,1) -> (3,1)\n   - R (3,1) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - R (2,2) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - R (3,3) -> (3,4)\n   - U (3,4) -> (2,4)\n   - L (2,4) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - L (3,3) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - L (2,2) -> (2,1)\n   - D (2,1) -> (3,1)\n   - R (3,1) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - R (2,2) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - R (3,3) -> (3,4)\n   - U (3,4) -> (2,4)\n   - L (2,4) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - L (3,3) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - L (2,2) -> (2,1)\n   - D (2,1) -> (3,1)\n   - R (3,1) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - R (2,2) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - R (3,3) -> (3,4)\n   - U (3,4) -> (2,4)\n   - L (2,4) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - L (3,3) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - L (2,2) -> (2,1)\n   - D (2,1) -> (3,1)\n   - R (3,1) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - R (2,2) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - R (3,3) -> (3,4)\n   - U (3,4) -> (2,4)\n   - L (2,4) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - L (3,3) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - L (2,2) -> (2,1)\n   - D (2,1) -> (3,1)\n   - R (3,1) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - R (2,2) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - R (3,3) -> (3,4)\n   - U (3,4) -> (2,4)\n   - L (2,4) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - L (3,3) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - L (2,2) -> (2,1)\n   - D (2,1) -> (3,1)\n   - R (3,1) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - R (2,2) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - R (3,3) -> (3,4)\n   - U (3,4) -> (2,4)\n   - L (2,4) -> (2,3)\n   - D (2,3) -> (3,3)\n   - L (3,3) -> (3,2)\n   - U (3,2) -> (2,2)\n   - L (2,2) -> (2,1"
