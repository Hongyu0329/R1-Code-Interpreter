    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes can only be pushed, not pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1, 5).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (2, 4), (3, 5), (5, 3), and (5, 5).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (1, 6), (3, 2), and (4, 4).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box towards a goal.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to position (2, 5) to push the box at (2, 4) towards the goal at (3, 2).\n   - Push the box at (2, 4) left to (2, 3), then down to (3, 3), and finally left to (3, 2) onto the goal.\n   - Move the player to position (3, 6) to push the box at (3, 5) towards the goal at (4, 4).\n   - Push the box at (3, 5) down to (4, 5), then left to (4, 4) onto the goal.\n   - Move the player to position (5, 4) to push the box at (5, 5) towards the goal at (1, 6).\n   - Push the box at (5, 5) up to (4, 5), then up to (3, 5), then up to (2, 5), and finally right to (1, 6) onto the goal.\n   - Move the player to position (5, 2) to push the box at (5, 3) towards the goal at (5, 4).\n   - Push the box at (5, 3) right to (5, 4) onto the goal.\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: RULDLDRRULUURRDDLL.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RULDLDRRULUURRDDLL>>>"
