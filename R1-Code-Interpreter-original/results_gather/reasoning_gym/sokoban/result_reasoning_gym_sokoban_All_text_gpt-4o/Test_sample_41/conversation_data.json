    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + + +  \n   + X - - X + + +  \n   + - - - X @ - +  \n   + @ @ @ X $ - +  \n   + * - - - - - +  \n   + + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Current Positions:**\n   - Player (*) is at (4, 1).\n   - Boxes (@) are at (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 3), and (3, 4).\n   - Goals (X) are at (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 5), and (3, 6).\n\n4. **Plan:**\n   - Move the player to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Start with the box at (2, 5) since it is closest to a goal.\n\n5. **Steps:**\n   - Move the player to the right to position (4, 5) to push the box at (2, 5).\n   - Push the box at (2, 5) to the right onto the goal at (2, 6).\n   - Move the player to the left to position (4, 3) to push the box at (3, 3).\n   - Push the box at (3, 3) up onto the goal at (2, 4).\n   - Move the player to the left to position (4, 2) to push the box at (3, 2).\n   - Push the box at (3, 2) up onto the goal at (2, 3).\n   - Move the player to the right to position (4, 4) to push the box at (3, 4).\n   - Push the box at (3, 4) up onto the goal at (2, 5).\n\n6. **Solution:**\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: RRRUULUURRDDLLURRUU.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RRRUULUURRDDLLURRUU>>>"
