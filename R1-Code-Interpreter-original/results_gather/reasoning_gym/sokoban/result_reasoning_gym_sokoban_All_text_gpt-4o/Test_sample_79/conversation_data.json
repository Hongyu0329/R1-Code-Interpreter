    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (3, 3).\n   - There are three boxes (@) at positions (3, 5), (4, 4), and (6, 3).\n   - There are three goals (X) at positions (5, 3), (6, 4), and (6, 5).\n   - There is one box already on a goal ($) at position (4, 5).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are not on goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to position (3, 4) to push the box at (3, 5).\n   - Push the box at (3, 5) down to (4, 5), which is already a goal position.\n   - Move the player to position (4, 3) to push the box at (4, 4).\n   - Push the box at (4, 4) down to (5, 4).\n   - Move the player to position (5, 3) to push the box at (5, 4).\n   - Push the box at (5, 4) right to (5, 5), which is a goal position.\n   - Move the player to position (6, 3) to push the box at (6, 3).\n   - Push the box at (6, 3) right to (6, 4), which is a goal position.\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: RDDRURRDD.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RDDRURRDD>>>"
