    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can only push one box at a time and cannot pull boxes. The player and boxes cannot move through walls (+).\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1, 1).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 7), and (4, 3).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 5), and (5, 3).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goal positions.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to positions where they can push boxes towards the goals.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals first.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or positions where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (1, 2) to the right towards the goal at (1, 5).\n   - Continue moving the player and boxes strategically to align them with the goals.\n   - Ensure that each move contributes towards getting a box onto a goal without blocking other boxes.\n\n5. **Execution:**\n   - The player moves right (R) to push the first box.\n   - Continue with a sequence of moves to push each box onto a goal.\n\nAfter analyzing the puzzle and planning the moves, the solution can be executed as a sequence of moves. The solution is:\n\n<<<RRDLLURRDDLLURRULDDRRU>>>"
