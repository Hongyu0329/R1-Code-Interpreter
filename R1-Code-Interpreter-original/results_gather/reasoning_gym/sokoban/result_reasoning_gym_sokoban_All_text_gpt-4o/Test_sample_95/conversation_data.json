    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The puzzle is solved when all boxes are on goals, either as $ (box on a goal) or % (player on a goal with a box).\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (8, 4).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (5, 3), (5, 4), (7, 4), and (7, 5).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 5), and (7, 2).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes (@) to the goals (X) to turn them into $ or %.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - The player can only push one box at a time.\n   - The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes (@) unless pushing them.\n   - The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), Down (D).\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box towards a goal.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved again.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to position (7, 4) to push the box at (7, 4) upwards to (6, 4).\n   - Push the box at (6, 4) upwards to (5, 4).\n   - Move the player to position (5, 3) to push the box at (5, 3) left to (5, 2), which is a goal.\n   - Move the player to position (5, 5) to push the box at (5, 4) right to (5, 5), which is a goal.\n   - Move the player to position (7, 5) to push the box at (7, 5) left to (7, 4).\n   - Push the box at (7, 4) upwards to (6, 4).\n   - Push the box at (6, 4) upwards to (5, 4).\n   - Move the player to position (5, 3) to push the box at (5, 4) left to (5, 3), which is a goal.\n   - Finally, move the player to position (7, 2) to push the box at (7, 2) right to (7, 3), which is a goal.\n\nFollowing these steps, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<UUULLLDRRRDDLUUURRDDLL>>>"
