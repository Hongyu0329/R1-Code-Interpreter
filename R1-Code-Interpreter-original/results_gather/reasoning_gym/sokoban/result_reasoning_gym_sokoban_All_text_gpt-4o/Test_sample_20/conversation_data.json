    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes can only be pushed, not pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + + +  \n   + X X @ - @ - +  \n   + - - X X @ - +  \n   + - - - $ @ - +  \n   + - * - - - - +  \n   + + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Current Positions:**\n   - Player (*) is at (4, 3).\n   - Boxes (@) are at (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), and (3, 4) (which is already on a goal, $).\n\n4. **Goals (X) are at:**\n   - (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4).\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to the goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (3, 5) onto the goal at (2, 4).\n   - Move the player up to push the box at (2, 5) onto the goal at (2, 3).\n   - Move the player left to push the box at (1, 5) onto the goal at (1, 2).\n   - Finally, move the player left to push the box at (1, 3) onto the goal at (1, 1).\n\n7. **Detailed Moves:**\n   - R (move right to (4, 4))\n   - U (move up to (3, 4))\n   - R (move right to (3, 5), push box to (2, 5))\n   - U (move up to (2, 5), push box to (2, 4))\n   - L (move left to (2, 3))\n   - D (move down to (3, 3))\n   - L (move left to (3, 2))\n   - U (move up to (2, 2))\n   - U (move up to (1, 2))\n   - R (move right to (1, 3), push box to (1, 4))\n   - R (move right to (1, 4), push box to (1, 5))\n   - L (move left to (1, 4))\n   - L (move left to (1, 3), push box to (1, 2))\n   - L (move left to (1, 2), push box to (1, 1))\n\n8. **Final Solution:**\n   - The sequence of moves is: RURULDLUURRLLL\n\nTherefore, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RURULDLUURRLLL>>>"
