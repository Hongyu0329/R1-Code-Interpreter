    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (6, 2).\n   - There are two boxes (@) at positions (1, 3) and (6, 3).\n   - There are two goals (X) at positions (1, 4) and (6, 5).\n   - There are two boxes on goals ($) at positions (3, 5) and (4, 5).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes (@) to the goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - First, move the player to push the box at (1, 3) to the goal at (1, 4).\n   - Then, move the player to push the box at (6, 3) to the goal at (6, 5).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the box at (1, 3):\n     - R (to (6, 3))\n     - U (to (5, 3))\n     - U (to (4, 3))\n     - U (to (3, 3))\n     - U (to (2, 3))\n     - U (to (1, 3))\n   - Push the box at (1, 3) to the goal at (1, 4):\n     - R (push box to (1, 4))\n   - Move the player to the box at (6, 3):\n     - D (to (2, 3))\n     - D (to (3, 3))\n     - D (to (4, 3))\n     - D (to (5, 3))\n     - D (to (6, 3))\n   - Push the box at (6, 3) to the goal at (6, 5):\n     - R (to (6, 4))\n     - R (push box to (6, 5))\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The player has successfully moved both boxes to the goals.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is the sequence of moves the player makes:\n\n<<<RRUUUUURDDDDRR>>>"
