    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at the bottom row, second from the right.\n   - There are several boxes (@) and goals (X) scattered throughout the grid.\n   - Some boxes are already on goals ($).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - The player can only push boxes, not pull them.\n   - The player cannot move through walls or boxes.\n   - The player can only push one box at a time.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Identify the positions of the boxes and goals.\n   - Plan a sequence of moves to push each box onto a goal.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to a position where they can start pushing boxes onto goals.\n   - Push the boxes one by one onto the goals, ensuring that each move is valid and does not block other boxes or the player.\n\n6. **Execution:**\n   - Start by moving the player to the left to access the boxes.\n   - Push the boxes towards the goals, ensuring that each box is moved in a way that allows further movement of other boxes.\n\nAfter analyzing the puzzle and planning the moves, the solution can be executed as follows:\n\n- Move the player left to access the first box.\n- Push the first box onto the nearest goal.\n- Continue moving the player and pushing boxes until all boxes are on goals.\n\nThe final sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LUUURRDDLLURRDDLUURRDD>>>"
