    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Player (*) is at position (1,1).\n   - Boxes (@) are at positions (2,3), (2,4), and (4,2).\n   - Goals (X) are at positions (2,1), (3,1), and (4,3).\n   - One box is already on a goal at position (3,3).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box.\n   - Push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Ensure that boxes are not pushed into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to position (1,2): R\n   - Move the player down to position (2,2): D\n   - Push the box at (2,3) to the left onto the goal at (2,1): L\n   - Move the player to the right to position (2,2): R\n   - Move the player down to position (3,2): D\n   - Move the player down to position (4,2): D\n   - Push the box at (4,2) to the right onto the goal at (4,3): R\n   - Move the player up to position (3,2): U\n   - Move the player right to position (3,3): R\n   - Move the player up to position (2,3): U\n   - Push the box at (2,4) to the right onto the goal at (3,4): R\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The boxes are now on the goals at (2,1), (3,3), and (4,3).\n\nThe sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RDLDRDDRUUR>>>"
