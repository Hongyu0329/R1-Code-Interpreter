    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + +  \n   + - - @ X +  \n   + % @ - - +  \n   + - - $ - +  \n   + - - - - +  \n   + + X @ - +  \n   + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n   - The player is on a goal at position (2, 2) marked as %.\n   - There are three boxes (@) at positions (1, 3), (2, 3), and (5, 4).\n   - There are two goals (X) at positions (1, 4) and (5, 3).\n   - One box is already on a goal at position (3, 3) marked as $.\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes to cover all the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Move the player to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Ensure that the player can always reach a box to push it.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n   - **Move 1:** Move the player to the right to push the box at (2, 3) to the right.\n     - Move sequence: R (Player moves to (2, 3), pushing the box to (2, 4))\n   \n   - **Move 2:** Move the player down to push the box at (1, 3) down.\n     - Move sequence: D (Player moves to (3, 3), pushing the box to (3, 4))\n   \n   - **Move 3:** Move the player left to push the box at (3, 4) left.\n     - Move sequence: L (Player moves to (3, 4), pushing the box to (3, 3))\n   \n   - **Move 4:** Move the player down to push the box at (5, 4) up.\n     - Move sequence: D (Player moves to (4, 4), then to (5, 4))\n     - Move sequence: U (Player moves to (4, 4), pushing the box to (4, 3))\n   \n   - **Move 5:** Move the player left to push the box at (4, 3) left.\n     - Move sequence: L (Player moves to (4, 3), pushing the box to (4, 2))\n   \n   - **Move 6:** Move the player up to push the box at (4, 2) up.\n     -
