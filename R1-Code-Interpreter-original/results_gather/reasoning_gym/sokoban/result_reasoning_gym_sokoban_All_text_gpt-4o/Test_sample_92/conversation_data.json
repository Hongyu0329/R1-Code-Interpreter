    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes can only be pushed, not pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + + +  \n   + + + X @ - $ +  \n   + * - - @ - - +  \n   + - @ X - - X +  \n   + - $ - - - - +  \n   + + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Current Positions:**\n   - Player (*) is at (2, 1).\n   - Boxes (@) are at (1, 4), (2, 4), and (3, 2).\n   - Goals (X) are at (1, 3), (3, 3), and (3, 6).\n   - Box on goal ($) is at (1, 6).\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Move the player to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Avoid getting boxes stuck in corners or against walls where they cannot be moved.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (2, 4) to the right.\n   - Move the player down to push the box at (3, 2) to the right.\n   - Move the player up to push the box at (1, 4) to the left.\n   - Continue moving the player and boxes until all boxes are on goals.\n\n6. **Solution Path:**\n   - R (Right) to move to (2, 2)\n   - R (Right) to move to (2, 3)\n   - U (Up) to move to (1, 3)\n   - R (Right) to push the box from (1, 4) to (1, 5)\n   - D (Down) to move to (2, 5)\n   - L (Left) to move to (2, 4)\n   - D (Down) to move to (3, 4)\n   - R (Right) to push the box from (3, 2) to (3, 3)\n   - U (Up) to move to (2, 3)\n   - L (Left) to move to (2, 2)\n   - D (Down) to move to (3, 2)\n   - R (Right) to move to (3, 3)\n   - R (Right) to push the box from (3, 4) to (3, 5)\n   - U (Up) to move to (2, 5)\n   - L (Left) to move to (2, 4)\n   - D (Down) to move to (3, 4)\n   - R (Right) to move to (3, 5)\n   - R (Right) to push the box from (3, 5) to (3, 6)\n\n7. **Final Solution:**\n   - The sequence of moves is: RRUURDLDRURRULDRRR\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RRUURDLDRURRULDRRR>>>"
