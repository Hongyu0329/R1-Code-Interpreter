    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Player (*) is at position (1, 2).\n   - Boxes (@) are at positions (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), and (2, 7).\n   - Goals (X) are at positions (1, 8), (3, 5), (4, 1), and (4, 6).\n   - Box on a goal ($) is at position (3, 7).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) to cover all goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Avoid getting boxes stuck in corners or against walls where they cannot be moved.\n   - Use the empty spaces to maneuver the player and boxes effectively.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to push the first box towards the goal at (1, 8).\n   - Push the box at (2, 1) down to the goal at (4, 1).\n   - Push the box at (2, 2) to the right and then down to the goal at (3, 5).\n   - Push the box at (2, 3) to the right and then down to the goal at (4, 6).\n   - Finally, push the box at (2, 7) to the right to the goal at (1, 8).\n\n5. **Execution:**\n   - Move sequence: RRRRDDDLLLDDRRUURRDDLLUUURRDDDLLL.\n\nBy following these steps, all boxes will be placed on the goals, solving the puzzle.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RRRRDDDLLLDDRRUURRDDLLUUURRDDDLLL>>>"
