    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1, 4).\n   - There are four boxes (@) at positions (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), and (2, 5).\n   - There are four goals (X) at positions (3, 1), (5, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 1).\n   - One box is already on a goal ($) at position (5, 3).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes to cover all the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to the goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to position (1, 3) to start pushing the boxes.\n   - Push the box at (2, 2) down to (3, 2), then to (4, 2), and finally to (5, 2) to cover the goal at (6, 1).\n   - Move the player back to push the next box at (2, 3) down to (3, 3), then to (4, 3), and finally to (5, 3) to cover the goal at (5, 4).\n   - Move the player to push the box at (2, 4) down to (3, 4), then to (4, 4), and finally to (5, 4) to cover the goal at (5, 5).\n   - Finally, move the player to push the last box at (2, 5) down to (3, 5), then to (4, 5), and finally to (5, 5) to cover the goal at (3, 1).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: LDDRRUULDDRRUULDDRRUULDDRRUULDD.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LDDRRUULDDRRUULDDRRUULDDRRUULDD>>>"
