    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can push a box if there is an empty space or a goal behind it. The player cannot pull boxes or move through walls (+).\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player is on a goal at position (3, 2).\n   - There are boxes at positions (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 5), and (6, 7).\n   - There are goals at positions (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), and (6, 2).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved again.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (3, 3) to the right onto the goal at (3, 6).\n   - Move the player down to push the box at (4, 2) down onto the goal at (6, 2).\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (4, 5) to the right onto the goal at (5, 6).\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (2, 2) down and then right onto the goal at (2, 7).\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at (6, 7) left onto the goal at (6, 6).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down, Left, Left, Up, Right, Right, Down, Down,"
