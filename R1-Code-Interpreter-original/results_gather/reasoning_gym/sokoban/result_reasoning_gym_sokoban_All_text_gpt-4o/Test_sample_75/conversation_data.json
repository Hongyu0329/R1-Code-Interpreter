    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The puzzle is solved when all boxes are on goals, which are represented by $.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at (7, 6).\n   - There are four boxes (@) located at (6, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4), and (7, 4).\n   - There are three goals (X) located at (5, 5), (7, 3), and (9, 4).\n   - There are two boxes already on goals ($) at (3, 4) and (3, 5).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes (@) to the goals (X) such that all goals are covered by boxes.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that boxes are not pushed into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n   - The player can move in four directions: Left (L), Right (R), Up (U), and Down (D).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to position (7, 5) to push the box at (8, 5) upwards.\n   - Push the box at (8, 5) to (7, 5).\n   - Move the player to position (6, 5) to push the box at (7, 5) upwards.\n   - Push the box at (7, 5) to (6, 5).\n   - Move the player to position (5, 5) to push the box at (6, 5) onto the goal at (5, 5).\n   - Move the player to position (8, 4) to push the box at (8, 4) to the right.\n   - Push the box at (8, 4) to (8, 5).\n   - Move the player to position (7, 4) to push the box at (8, 5) upwards.\n   - Push the box at (8, 5) to (7, 5).\n   - Move the player to position (6, 5) to push the box at (7, 5) upwards.\n   - Push the box at (7, 5) to (6, 5).\n   - Move the player to position (5, 5) to push the box at (6, 5) onto the goal at (5, 5).\n   - Move the player to position (8, 4) to push the box at (8, 4) to the right.\n   - Push the box at (8, 4) to (8, 5).\n   - Move the player to position (7, 4) to push the box at (8, 5) upwards.\n   - Push the box at (8, 5) to (7, 5).\n   - Move the player to position (6, 5) to push the box at (7, 5) upwards.\n   - Push the box at (7, 5) to (6, 5).\n   - Move the player to position (5, 5) to push the box at (6, 5) onto the goal at (5, 5).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The final sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: DLUURRDDLUURRDDLUURRDDLUURRDD.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<DLUURRDDLUURRDDLUURRDDLUURRDD>>>"
