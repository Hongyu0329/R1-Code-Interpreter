    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The player (*) is at position (1, 8). There are several boxes (@) and goals (X) scattered around the board.\n\n2. **Goals and Boxes**: \n   - Goals are at positions: (1, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 8), (5, 2), (5, 8).\n   - Boxes are at positions: (1, 7), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 5), (4, 5), (6, 2).\n\n3. **Strategy**: \n   - We need to push the boxes onto the goals. \n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box towards a goal.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be retrieved.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the player to position (1, 7) to push the box at (1, 7) to the right onto the goal at (1, 8).\n   - Move the player to position (2, 4) to push the box at (2, 4) down onto the goal at (3, 4).\n   - Move the player to position (2, 6) to push the box at (2, 6) down onto the goal at (3, 7).\n   - Move the player to position (2, 7) to push the box at (2, 7) down onto the goal at (4, 8).\n   - Move the player to position (2, 8) to push the box at (2, 8) down onto the goal at (5, 8).\n   - Move the player to position (3, 5) to push the box at (3, 5) down onto the goal at (4, 5).\n   - Move the player to position (4, 5) to push the box at (4, 5) down onto the goal at (5, 5).\n   - Move the player to position (6, 2) to push the box at (6, 2) right onto the goal at (6, 3).\n\n5. **Final Moves**:\n   - The player should carefully navigate around the board to ensure all boxes are placed on goals without getting stuck.\n\nBy following these steps, the puzzle can be solved. The sequence of moves is represented by the string of characters indicating the direction of each move: L (left), R (right), U (up), D (down).\n\nThe final solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RRUULDDRRUURRDDLLDDRRUU>>>"
