    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pushed into walls or other boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1,3).\n   - There are four boxes (@) at positions (2,3), (2,5), (2,6), and (4,6).\n   - There are four goals (X) at positions (1,1), (2,4), (4,4), and (5,7).\n   - Two boxes are already on goals at positions (4,3) and (4,4).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the remaining boxes onto the remaining goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to push the box at (2,3) onto the goal at (1,1).\n   - Then, move the player to push the box at (2,5) onto the goal at (2,4).\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at (2,6) onto the goal at (5,7).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (2,3) onto the goal at (1,1).\n     - Move sequence: L (left), U (up), L (left), D (down), R (right).\n   - Move the player to push the box at (2,5) onto the goal at (2,4).\n     - Move sequence: R (right), U (up), R (right), D (down), L (left).\n   - Move the player to push the box at (2,6) onto the goal at (5,7).\n     - Move sequence: R (right), D (down), R (right), U (up), L (left).\n\n5. **Final Move Sequence:**\n   - Combine all the move sequences to get the final solution.\n\nThe final solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LULDRRURDLDRURDL>>>"
