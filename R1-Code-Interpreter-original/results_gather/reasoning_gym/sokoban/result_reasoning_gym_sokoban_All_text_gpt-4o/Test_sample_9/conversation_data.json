    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + +  \n   + - - - - +  \n   + - X - - +  \n   + @ @ - - +  \n   + % @ X $ +  \n   + + + + + +  \n   ```\n   - The player is on a goal at position (4, 2).\n   - There are three boxes: \n     - One at (3, 2)\n     - One at (3, 3)\n     - One at (4, 3) on a goal\n   - There are two goals:\n     - One at (2, 2)\n     - One at (4, 4) with a box on it\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes to cover all goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - The player needs to move the boxes to the goals without getting stuck.\n   - The player should push the boxes in a way that they can be moved to the goals without blocking any paths.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to get off the goal: L\n   - Move up to position (3, 2): U\n   - Push the box at (3, 2) to the left to position (3, 1): L\n   - Move down to position (4, 1): D\n   - Move right to position (4, 2): R\n   - Move up to position (3, 2): U\n   - Push the box at (3, 3) to the right to position (3, 4): R\n   - Move down to position (4, 4): D\n   - Move left to position (4, 3): L\n   - Push the box at (4, 3) up to position (3, 3): U\n   - Move right to position (3, 4): R\n   - Move down to position (4, 4): D\n   - Move left to position (4, 3): L\n   - Push the box at (3, 3) up to position (2, 3): U\n   - Move left to position (2, 2): L\n   - Push the box at (2, 3) left to position (2, 2): L\n\n5. **Final Configuration:**\n   - All boxes are on goals.\n\nThe sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LUULDRURDLUURDLUL>>>"
