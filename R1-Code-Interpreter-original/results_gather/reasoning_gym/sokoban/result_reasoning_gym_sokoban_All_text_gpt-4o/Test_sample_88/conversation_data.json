    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at the bottom row, second from the right.\n   - There are four boxes (@) and three boxes already on goals ($).\n   - There are four goals (X) in total.\n\n2. **Goals:**\n   - We need to move the boxes onto the goals. The three boxes already on goals ($) are correctly placed.\n   - One box (@) is not on a goal and needs to be moved.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Move the player to push the box (@) onto the nearest goal (X).\n   - Avoid moving boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be retrieved.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player left to position them to push the box.\n   - Push the box up onto the goal.\n\n5. **Execution:**\n   - Move the player left (L) to position them next to the box.\n   - Push the box up (U) onto the goal.\n\nBy following these steps, we can solve the puzzle.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is: <<<LU>>>."
