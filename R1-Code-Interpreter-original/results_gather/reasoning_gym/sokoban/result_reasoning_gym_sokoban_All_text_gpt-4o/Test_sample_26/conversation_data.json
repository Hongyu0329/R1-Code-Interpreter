    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can push a box if there is an empty space or a goal behind it. The goal is to have all boxes on goals, represented by $.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (5, 8).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 8), and (5, 7).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (1, 4), (3, 3), (3, 6), and (4, 8).\n   - There is one box already on a goal ($) at position (1, 8).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) to cover all goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Ensure that boxes are not pushed into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n   - Plan moves to avoid blocking other boxes or goals.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to position (5, 7) to push the box at (5, 7) onto the goal at (4, 8).\n   - Move the player to position (4, 7) and push the box at (4, 8) onto the goal at (3, 6).\n   - Move the player to position (3, 5) to push the box at (2, 5) onto the goal at (3, 3).\n   - Move the player to position (2, 4) to push the box at (2, 3) onto the goal at (1, 4).\n\n5. **Execution:**\n   - The player moves: L (left), U (up), L (left), D (down), R (right), U (up), R (right), D (down), L (left), U (up), L (left), D (down), R (right), U (up), R (right), D (down).\n\nBy following these steps, all boxes will be placed on the goals, solving the puzzle.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LULDRURDLULDRURD>>>"
