    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + + + + +  \n   + + - - - - - - - +  \n   + + - X - @ - @ - +  \n   + + + X $ @ - - - +  \n   + + $ * $ - - X - +  \n   + + + + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Goals and Boxes:**\n   - Goals (X) are located at positions (2,3), (3,3), and (4,7).\n   - Boxes (@) are located at positions (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), and (4,3) (already on a goal).\n\n3. **Player (*) Initial Position:**\n   - The player is at position (4,4).\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals. We will plan the moves to achieve this.\n\n5. **Move Sequence:**\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (4,3) to the left goal (3,3).\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (3,5) to the right goal (4,7).\n   - Move the player up to push the box at (2,5) to the top goal (2,3).\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at (2,7) to the remaining goal.\n\n6. **Execute Moves:**\n   - L (left) to push the box at (4,3) to (3,3).\n   - R (right) to push the box at (3,5) to (4,7).\n   - U (up) to push the box at (2,5) to (2,3).\n   - R (right) to push the box at (2,7) to (2,5).\n   - D (down) to push the box at (2,5) to (3,5).\n   - R (right) to push the box at (3,5) to (4,5).\n   - U (up) to push the box at (4,5) to (4,7).\n\n7. **Final Move Sequence:**\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: LURRDRUR.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LURRDRUR>>>"
