    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player is on a goal at position (5, 2).\n   - There are two boxes on goals at positions (2, 3) and (5, 3).\n   - There are two boxes at positions (3, 4) and (5, 1).\n   - There are two goals at positions (4, 3) and (5, 4).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are not on goals first.\n   - Ensure that the player does not get stuck or block the path to other boxes.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (5, 1) onto the goal at (5, 4).\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (3, 4) onto the goal at (4, 3).\n\n5. **Detailed Moves:**\n   - From the initial position (5, 2), move right (R) to (5, 3).\n   - Move right (R) to (5, 4) to push the box onto the goal.\n   - Move left (L) to (5, 3).\n   - Move up (U) to (4, 3).\n   - Move left (L) to (4, 2).\n   - Move down (D) to (5, 2).\n   - Move left (L) to (5, 1).\n   - Move up (U) to (4, 1).\n   - Move right (R) to (4, 2).\n   - Move right (R) to (4, 3) to push the box onto the goal.\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves is: RRLULDLURR.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RRLULDLURR>>>"
