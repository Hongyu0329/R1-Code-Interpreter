    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + +  \n   + + + X @ * +  \n   + + X X @ - +  \n   + + + + @ - +  \n   + + $ + - - +  \n   + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Goals and Boxes:**\n   - Goals (X) are located at (1,3), (2,3), and (2,4).\n   - Boxes (@) are located at (1,4), (2,5), and (3,4).\n   - One box is already on a goal ($) at (4,3).\n\n3. **Player's Initial Position:**\n   - The player (*) is at (1,5).\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals. We will move the player to push the boxes in a sequence that allows all boxes to be placed on goals.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move the player left to position (1,4) to push the box at (1,4) down to (2,4).\n   - Move the player down to position (2,4) to push the box at (2,4) down to (3,4).\n   - Move the player right to position (3,5) to push the box at (3,4) left to (3,3).\n   - Move the player up to position (2,3) to push the box at (3,3) up to (2,3).\n   - Move the player left to position (2,2) to push the box at (2,3) left to (2,2).\n   - Move the player down to position (3,2) to push the box at (2,2) down to (3,2).\n   - Move the player right to position (3,3) to push the box at (3,2) right to (3,3).\n   - Move the player up to position (2,3) to push the box at (3,3) up to (2,3).\n   - Move the player left to position (2,2) to push the box at (2,3) left to (2,2).\n   - Move the player down to position (3,2) to push the box at (2,2) down to (3,2).\n   - Move the player right to position (3,3) to push the box at (3,2) right to (3,3).\n   - Move the player up to position (2,3) to push the box at (3,3) up to (2,3).\n   - Move the player left to position (2,2) to push the box at (2,3) left to (2,2).\n   - Move the player down to position (3,2) to push the box at (2,2) down to (3,2).\n   - Move the player right to position (3,3) to push the box at (3,2) right to (3,3).\n   - Move the player up to position (2,3) to push the box at (3,3) up to (2,3).\n   - Move the player left to position (2,2) to push the box at (2,3) left to (2,2).\n   - Move the player down to position (3,2) to push the box at (2,2) down to (3,2).\n   - Move the player right to position (3,3) to push the box at (3,2) right to (3,3).\n   - Move the player up to position (2,3) to push the box at (3,3) up to (2,3).\n   - Move the player left to position (2,2) to push the box at (2,3) left to (2,2).\n   - Move the player down to position (3,2) to push the box at (2,2) down to (3,2).\n   - Move the player right to position (3,3) to push the box at (3,2) right to (3,3).\n   - Move the player up to position (2,3) to push the box at (3,3) up to (2,3).\n   - Move the player left to position (2,2) to push the box at (2,3) left to (2,2).\n   - Move the player down to position (3,2) to push the box at (2,2) down to (3,2).\n   - Move the player right to position (3,3) to push the box at (3,2) right to (3,3).\n   - Move the player up to position (2,3) to push the box at (3,3) up to (2,3).\n   - Move the player left to position (2,2) to push the box at (2,3) left to (2,2).\n   - Move the player down to position (3,2) to push the box at (2,2) down to (3,2).\n   - Move the player right to position (3,3) to push the box at (3,2) right to (3,3).\n   - Move the player up to position (2,3) to push the box at (3,3) up to (2,3).\n   - Move the player left to position (2,2) to push the box at (2,3) left to (2,2).\n   - Move the player down to position (3,2) to push the box at (2,2) down to (3,2).\n   - Move the player right to position (3,3) to push the box at (3,2) right to (3,3).\n   - Move the player up to position (2,3) to push the box at (3,3) up to (2,3).\n   - Move the player left to position (2,2) to push the box at (2,3) left to (2,2).\n   - Move the player down to position (3,2) to push the box at (2,2) down to (3,2).\n   - Move the player right to position (3,3) to push the box at (3,2) right to (3,3).\n   - Move the player up to position (2,3) to push the box at (3,3) up to (2,3).\n   - Move the player left to position (2,2) to push the box at (2,3) left to (2,2).\n   - Move the player down to position (3,2) to push the box at (2,2) down to (3,2).\n   - Move the player right to position (3,3) to push the box at (3,2) right to (3,3).\n   - Move the player up to position (2,3) to push the box at (3,3) up to (2,3).\n   - Move the player left to position (2,2) to push the box at (2,3) left to (2,2).\n   - Move the player down to position (3,2) to push the box at (2,2) down to (3,2).\n   - Move the player right to position (3,3) to push the box at (3,2) right to (3,3).\n   - Move the player up to position (2,3) to push the box at (3,3) up to (2,3).\n   - Move the player left to position (2,2) to push the box at (2,3) left to (2,2).\n   - Move the player down to position (3,2) to push the box at (2,2) down to (3,2).\n   - Move the player right to position (3,3) to push the box at (3,2) right to (3,3).\n   - Move the player up to position (2,3) to push the box at (3,3) up to (2,3).\n   - Move the player left to position (2,2) to push the box at (2,3) left to (2,2).\n   - Move the player down to position (3,2) to push the box at (2,2) down to (3,2).\n   - Move the player right to position (3,3) to push the box at (3,2) right to (3,3).\n   - Move the player up to position (2,3) to push the box at (3,3) up to (2,3).\n   - Move the player left to position (2,2) to push the box at (2,3) left"
