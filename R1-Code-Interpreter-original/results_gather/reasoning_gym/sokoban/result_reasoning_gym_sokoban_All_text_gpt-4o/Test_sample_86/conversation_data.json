    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (5, 3).\n   - There are three boxes (@) at positions (1, 4), (2, 3), and (3, 3).\n   - There are three goals (X) at positions (1, 3), (3, 2), and (5, 5).\n   - One box is already on a goal ($) at position (3, 4).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes to cover all the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are not on goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to position (5, 4) to push the box at (5, 5) onto the goal.\n   - Push the box at (5, 4) to the right (R) onto the goal at (5, 5).\n   - Move the player up to position (4, 3) to push the box at (3, 3) onto the goal at (3, 2).\n   - Push the box at (3, 3) up (U) onto the goal at (3, 2).\n   - Move the player to position (2, 4) to push the box at (1, 4) onto the goal at (1, 3).\n   - Push the box at (1, 4) left (L) onto the goal at (1, 3).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: RURULU.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RURULU>>>"
