    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes can only be pushed, not pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1, 7).\n   - There are three boxes (@) at positions (2, 2), (2, 4), and (2, 7).\n   - There are three goals (X) at positions (1, 2), (3, 5), and (4, 3).\n   - There are two boxes already on goals ($) at positions (4, 2) and (4, 6).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes (@) to cover all the goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Carefully plan the moves to avoid getting boxes stuck in corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to position (1, 6) to get closer to the first box at (2, 2).\n   - Move down to position (2, 6) and then left to position (2, 5).\n   - Move left to position (2, 4) to push the box at (2, 4) down to (3, 4).\n   - Move the player around to push the box at (3, 4) to the right to (3, 5), covering the goal.\n   - Move the player back to the top row to push the box at (2, 2) down to (3, 2).\n   - Move the player around to push the box at (3, 2) to the right to (4, 3), covering the goal.\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at (2, 7) down to (3, 7) and then left to (3, 6).\n   - Move the player around to push the box at (3, 6) left to (3, 5), covering the goal.\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: LDDRRULDDRRUULDD.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LDDRRULDDRRUULDD>>>"
