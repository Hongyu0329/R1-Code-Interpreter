    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1, 6).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2), (6, 2), and (6, 5).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), and (8, 3).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to push the nearest box onto a goal.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved.\n   - Use the empty spaces to maneuver the player and boxes efficiently.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (1, 3) onto the goal at (1, 1).\n   - Move the player down to push the box at (2, 2) onto the goal at (2, 3).\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (2, 6) onto the goal at (3, 2).\n   - Move the player down to push the box at (3, 4) onto the goal at (4, 2).\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (4, 5) onto the goal at (5, 3).\n   - Move the player down to push the box at (5, 2) onto the goal at (6, 3).\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (6, 5) onto the goal at (8, 3).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: LDRRULDDRRULDD.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LDRRULDDRRULDD>>>"
