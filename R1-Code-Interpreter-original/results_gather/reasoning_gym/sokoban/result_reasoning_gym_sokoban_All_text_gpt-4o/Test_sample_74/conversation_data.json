    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player is on a goal (%).\n   - There are three boxes (@) and one box on a goal ($).\n   - There are three goals (X) and one goal with a box on it ($).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - The player can only push boxes, not pull them.\n   - The player cannot move through walls or boxes.\n   - The player must end with all boxes on goals.\n\n4. **Plan:**\n   - Move the player to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Ensure that the player does not get stuck or push a box into a corner where it cannot be moved.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box (@) onto the goal (X).\n   - Move the player down to push the next box (@) onto the goal (X).\n   - Move the player to the left and then down to push the last box (@) onto the remaining goal (X).\n\n6. **Execution:**\n   - Start by moving the player to the right to push the first box onto the goal.\n   - Then, move the player down to push the second box onto the goal.\n   - Finally, move the player left and down to push the last box onto the goal.\n\nBy following these steps, we can solve the puzzle.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RRDLLDRU>>>"
