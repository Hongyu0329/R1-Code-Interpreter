    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player is on a goal (%).\n   - There are three boxes (@) and one box already on a goal ($).\n   - There are three goals (X) in total.\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the player to push all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - The player is initially at position (1, 3) on a goal.\n   - The boxes are at positions (2, 4), (2, 5), and (4, 5).\n   - The goals are at positions (2, 3), (4, 6), and (6, 3).\n\n4. **Plan:**\n   - Move the player to push the box at (2, 4) to the goal at (2, 3).\n   - Move the player to push the box at (2, 5) to the goal at (4, 6).\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at (4, 5) to the goal at (6, 3).\n\n5. **Execution:**\n   - Move the player from (1, 3) to (2, 3) to push the box at (2, 4) left onto the goal at (2, 3).\n   - Move the player around to push the box at (2, 5) down to the goal at (4, 6).\n   - Move the player to push the box at (4, 5) down to the goal at (6, 3).\n\n6. **Solution:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: RDDLLURRDDLLURR.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RDDLLURRDDLLURR>>>"
