    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player is on a goal at position (3, 7).\n   - There are four boxes (@) at positions (2, 2), (4, 2), (4, 5), and (4, 6).\n   - There are four goals (X) at positions (1, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), and (4, 4).\n   - There are two boxes already on goals ($) at positions (1, 8) and (4, 8).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes to cover all the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be retrieved.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to position (3, 6) to push the box at (4, 6) onto the goal at (3, 6).\n   - Push the box at (4, 6) up to (3, 6).\n   - Move the player to position (4, 5) to push the box at (4, 5) onto the goal at (4, 4).\n   - Push the box at (4, 5) left to (4, 4).\n   - Move the player to position (4, 2) to push the box at (4, 2) onto the goal at (3, 3).\n   - Push the box at (4, 2) up to (3, 2), then right to (3, 3).\n   - Finally, move the player to position (2, 2) to push the box at (2, 2) onto the goal at (1, 1).\n   - Push the box at (2, 2) up to (1, 2), then left to (1, 1).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: RUUULLDDRRUULDD.\n\nThe final answer, representing the sequence of moves, is:\n\n<<<RUUULLDDRRUULDD>>>"
