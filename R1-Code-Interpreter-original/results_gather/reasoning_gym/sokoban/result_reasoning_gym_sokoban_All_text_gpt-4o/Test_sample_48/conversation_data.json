    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can push a box if there is an empty space or a goal behind it. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (7, 2).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (5, 2), (6, 1), and (7, 3).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (2, 2), (3, 1), and (7, 4).\n   - There are boxes on goals ($) at positions (1, 4), (2, 5), and (4, 3).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes (@) to the goals (X) at (2, 2), (3, 1), and (7, 4).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to position (6, 2) to push the box at (5, 2) upwards to the goal at (3, 1).\n   - Then, move the player to position (7, 3) to push the box at (7, 3) to the right onto the goal at (7, 4).\n   - Finally, move the player to position (6, 1) to push the box at (6, 1) upwards to the goal at (2, 2).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move the player down to (7, 2) and then left to (7, 1).\n   - Push the box at (6, 1) upwards to (5, 1), then to (4, 1), and finally to (3, 1).\n   - Move the player to (7, 3) and push the box to the right onto the goal at (7, 4).\n   - Move the player to (6, 1) and push the box upwards to (5, 1), then to (4, 1), and finally to (2, 2).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: RRUUULLLDDRRRUU.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RRUUULLLDDRRRUU>>>"
