    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + + + +  \n   + - - - @ X - - +  \n   + - X - @ - - - +  \n   + @ @ * - - X - +  \n   + X - $ + - - - +  \n   + + + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Goals and Boxes:**\n   - Goals (X) are located at (1,4), (2,2), (3,6), and (4,1).\n   - Boxes (@) are located at (1,3), (2,4), (3,1), and (3,2).\n   - One box is already on a goal ($) at (4,3).\n\n3. **Player's Initial Position:**\n   - The player (*) is at (3,4).\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals. We will plan the moves to achieve this.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (3,3) to the left goal at (3,2).\n     - L (3,4) -> (3,3)\n     - L (3,3) -> (3,2) [Push box to (3,1)]\n   - Move the player down to push the box at (3,1) to the goal at (4,1).\n     - D (3,2) -> (4,2)\n     - L (4,2) -> (4,1) [Push box to (4,1)]\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (2,4) to the goal at (2,2).\n     - U (4,1) -> (3,1)\n     - U (3,1) -> (2,1)\n     - R (2,1) -> (2,2) [Push box to (2,3)]\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (1,3) to the goal at (1,4).\n     - U (2,2) -> (1,2)\n     - R (1,2) -> (1,3) [Push box to (1,4)]\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The player has successfully pushed all boxes onto the goals.\n\nThe sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LLDLLURUR>>>"
