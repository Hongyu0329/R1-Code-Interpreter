    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at (7, 2).\n   - There are three boxes (@) located at (3, 4), (5, 4), and (7, 3).\n   - There are three goals (X) located at (1, 2), (5, 2), and (7, 4).\n   - There are two boxes already on goals ($) at (6, 2) and (6, 3).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes to cover all the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - The player can only push boxes, not pull them.\n   - The player must avoid getting stuck or blocking the boxes in corners or against walls.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the box at (7, 3) and push it to the goal at (7, 4).\n   - Move the player to the box at (3, 4) and push it to the goal at (1, 2).\n   - Move the player to the box at (5, 4) and push it to the goal at (5, 2).\n\n5. **Detailed Moves:**\n   - From (7, 2), move right to (7, 3) and push the box to (7, 4).\n   - Move up to (6, 4), then left to (6, 3), then up to (5, 3), then left to (5, 2).\n   - Move up to (4, 2), then left to (4, 1), then up to (3, 1), then right to (3, 2), then right to (3, 3), then right to (3, 4) and push the box to (2, 4).\n   - Move up to (1, 4), then left to (1, 3), then left to (1, 2) and push the box to (1, 1).\n   - Move down to (2, 1), then right to (2, 2), then down to (3, 2), then down to (4, 2), then right to (4, 3), then down to (5, 3), then right to (5, 4) and push the box to (5, 5).\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: RURRULULULURRRULULDLDRR.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RURRULULULURRRULULDLDRR>>>"
