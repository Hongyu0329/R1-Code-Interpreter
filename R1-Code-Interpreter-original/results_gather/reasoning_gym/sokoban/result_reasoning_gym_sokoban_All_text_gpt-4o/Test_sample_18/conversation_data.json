    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1, 5).\n   - There are four boxes (@) at positions (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), and (2, 5).\n   - There are four goals (X) at positions (1, 1), (1, 4), (3, 4), and (5, 4).\n   - There is one box already on a goal ($) at position (4, 5).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals first.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to position (1, 4) to push the box at (2, 4) down onto the goal at (3, 4).\n   - Move the player around to push the box at (2, 5) down to position (4, 5), which is already a goal.\n   - Move the player to push the box at (2, 3) to the right onto the goal at (1, 4).\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at (2, 2) to the right onto the goal at (1, 1).\n\n5. **Solution Path:**\n   - The player moves: LDDRRUULDDRRUULDD.\n\nBy following these steps, all boxes will be placed on the goals, solving the puzzle.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<LDDRRUULDDRRUULDD>>>"
