    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + +  \n   + + + X @ * +  \n   + + + + @ @ +  \n   + + + X - - +  \n   + $ + + + X +  \n   + + + $ + + +  \n   + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Goals and Boxes:**\n   - Goals (X) are located at (1, 3), (3, 3), and (4, 5).\n   - Boxes (@) are located at (1, 4), (2, 4), and (2, 5).\n   - Box on goal ($) is located at (4, 2).\n\n3. **Player's Initial Position:**\n   - The player (*) is at (1, 5).\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals. We will plan the moves to achieve this.\n\n5. **Move Sequence:**\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (1, 4) onto the goal at (1, 3).\n     - Move left (L) to (1, 4).\n     - Move left (L) to push the box to (1, 3).\n   - Move the player down to push the box at (2, 4) onto the goal at (3, 3).\n     - Move down (D) to (2, 4).\n     - Move down (D) to push the box to (3, 3).\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (2, 5) onto the goal at (4, 5).\n     - Move right (R) to (2, 5).\n     - Move down (D) to (3, 5).\n     - Move down (D) to (4, 5).\n     - Move right (R) to push the box to (4, 5).\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The player has successfully pushed all boxes onto the goals.\n\n7. **Solution:**\n   - The sequence of moves is: LLDLDDRDR.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<LLDLDDRDR>>>"
