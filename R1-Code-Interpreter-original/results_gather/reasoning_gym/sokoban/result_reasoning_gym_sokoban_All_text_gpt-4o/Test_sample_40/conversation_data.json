    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can only push one box at a time and cannot pull boxes. The player and boxes cannot move through walls (+).\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Player (*) is at position (1, 1).\n   - Boxes (@) are at positions (1, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 2).\n   - Goals (X) are at positions (1, 3), (3, 1), and (6, 3).\n   - Boxes on goals ($) are at positions (2, 3) and (3, 3).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Move the player to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Avoid getting boxes stuck in corners or against walls where they cannot be moved.\n   - Plan moves to ensure that each box can be pushed to a goal.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to position (1, 2) to push the box at (1, 2) to the right onto the goal at (1, 3).\n   - Move the player to position (2, 1) to push the box at (2, 1) down to position (3, 1).\n   - Move the player to position (3, 1) to push the box at (3, 1) to the right onto the goal at (3, 1).\n   - Move the player to position (6, 3) to push the box at (5, 3) up onto the goal at (6, 3).\n\n5. **Execution:**\n   - The player moves right (R) to push the first box onto the goal.\n   - The player moves down (D) and left (L) to position themselves to push the second box.\n   - The player moves right (R) to push the second box onto the goal.\n   - The player moves down (D) and right (R) to position themselves to push the third box.\n   - The player moves up (U) to push the third box onto the goal.\n\nBy following these steps, the puzzle is solved.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<RDLDRUR>>>"
