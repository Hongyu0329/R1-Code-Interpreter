    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can only push one box at a time and cannot move through walls (+) or boxes. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals, represented by ($).\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at position (5, 2).\n   - There are four boxes (@) located at positions (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 4), and (2, 5).\n   - There are four goals (X) located at positions (1, 4), (1, 5), (3, 3), and (3, 7).\n   - One box is already on a goal, represented by ($) at position (4, 3).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box.\n   - Push the boxes towards the goals, ensuring that no box gets stuck in a corner or against a wall where it cannot be moved.\n   - Use the empty spaces to maneuver the player and boxes effectively.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to position (5, 3).\n   - Move up to position (4, 3) to push the box at (4, 3) to the right onto the goal at (3, 3).\n   - Move the player back down to (5, 3), then left to (5, 2), and up to (4, 2).\n   - Push the box at (2, 2) down to (3, 2), then to the right onto the goal at (3, 3).\n   - Move the player to the right to (4, 3), then up to (3, 3), and push the box at (2, 4) down to (3, 4).\n   - Move the player to the right to (3, 5), then up to (2, 5), and push the box at (2, 5) down to (3, 5).\n   - Finally, move the player to the left to (3, 4), then up to (2, 4), and push the box at (2, 4) down to (3, 4).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The player should now be able to push all boxes onto the goals without any getting stuck.\n\nBy following these steps, we can solve the puzzle. The sequence of moves is:\n\n<<<UURRDLDDRRUULLDDRR>>>"
