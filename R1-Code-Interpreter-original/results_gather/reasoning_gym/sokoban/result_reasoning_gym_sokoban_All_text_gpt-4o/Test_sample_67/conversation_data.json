    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at row 5, column 5.\n   - There are four boxes (@) and two boxes already on goals ($).\n   - There are four goals (X) on the board.\n\n2. **Goals:**\n   - We need to move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Avoid getting boxes stuck in corners or against walls where they cannot be moved.\n   - Use the empty spaces to maneuver the player and boxes.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (5, 4) to the left goal at (5, 3).\n   - Move the player down to push the box at (6, 4) to the goal at (6, 2).\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (3, 6) to the goal at (3, 4).\n   - Finally, move the player to push the remaining box at (4, 4) to the goal at (4, 6).\n\n5. **Execution:**\n   - The player will move in the following sequence: L, L, U, R, R, D, D, L, L, U, R, R, U, L, L, D, D, R, R.\n\nBy following these steps, all boxes will be placed on the goals, solving the puzzle.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<LLURRDDLLUURRULLDDRR>>>"
