    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (4, 4).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (2, 2), (4, 7), and (9, 3).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (3, 4), (5, 3), (7, 3), and (9, 2).\n   - There is a box on a goal ($) at position (2, 4).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to push the box at (2, 2) onto the goal at (3, 4).\n   - Then, move the player to push the box at (4, 7) onto the goal at (5, 3).\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at (9, 3) onto the goal at (7, 3).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the box at (2, 2): UUL.\n   - Push the box at (2, 2) down to the goal at (3, 4): DDD.\n   - Move the player to the box at (4, 7): RRRDD.\n   - Push the box at (4, 7) left to the goal at (5, 3): LLL.\n   - Move the player to the box at (9, 3): DDDRR.\n   - Push the box at (9, 3) up to the goal at (7, 3): UU.\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - Combine all the moves: UULDDDRRRDDLLLDDDRRUU.\n\nThe final solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<UULDDDRRRDDLLLDDDRRUU>>>"
