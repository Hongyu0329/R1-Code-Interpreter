    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and can only push boxes into empty spaces or onto goals.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player is on a goal (%).\n   - There are boxes (@) and boxes on goals ($).\n   - There are goals (X) that need to be covered by boxes.\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - The player can only push boxes, not pull them.\n   - The player cannot move through walls or boxes.\n   - The player can only push a box if there is an empty space or a goal behind it.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Identify the positions of the boxes and goals.\n   - Plan a sequence of moves to push each box onto a goal.\n   - Ensure that boxes are not pushed into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box.\n   - Push the box towards a goal.\n   - Repeat the process for each box until all goals are covered.\n\n6. **Execution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box on the goal to the right.\n   - Continue moving the player and pushing boxes until all goals are covered.\n\nBy carefully planning each move and ensuring that boxes are pushed towards goals without getting stuck, we can solve the puzzle.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is a sequence of moves represented by the string:\n\n<<<RRDLLURRDDLLURR>>>"
