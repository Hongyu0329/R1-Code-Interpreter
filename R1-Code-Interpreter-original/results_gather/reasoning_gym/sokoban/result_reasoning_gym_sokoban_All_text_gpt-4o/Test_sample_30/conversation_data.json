    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player is on a goal (%).\n   - There are four boxes (@) and four goals (X).\n   - The player needs to push each box onto a goal.\n\n2. **Goals and Boxes:**\n   - The goals are located at positions (1,3), (4,3), (4,4), and (5,5).\n   - The boxes are initially at positions (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), and (2,4).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to move the player to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - The player should avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n   - The player should also avoid blocking paths to other boxes or goals.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the first box at (1,2) and push it to the goal at (1,3).\n   - Move the player to the second box at (2,1) and push it to the goal at (4,3).\n   - Move the player to the third box at (2,3) and push it to the goal at (4,4).\n   - Finally, move the player to the fourth box at (2,4) and push it to the goal at (5,5).\n\n5. **Execution:**\n   - The player starts at (1,1) on a goal.\n   - Move right (R) to (1,2) and push the box to (1,3).\n   - Move down (D) to (2,2), then left (L) to (2,1) and push the box down to (4,1), then right (R) to (4,3).\n   - Move up (U) to (2,3) and push the box down to (4,4).\n   - Move right (R) to (2,4) and push the box down to (5,5).\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: RDLDRRULDDRR.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the Sokoban puzzle is:\n\n<<<RDLDRRULDDRR>>>"
