    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at row 3, column 5.\n   - There are four boxes (@) located at:\n     - Row 1, column 3\n     - Row 2, column 5\n     - Row 2, column 6\n     - Row 2, column 7\n   - There are four goals (X) located at:\n     - Row 1, column 2\n     - Row 2, column 3\n     - Row 3, column 4\n     - Row 4, column 6\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals first.\n   - Avoid getting boxes stuck in corners or against walls where they cannot be moved.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at row 2, column 5 onto the goal at row 3, column 4.\n   - Move the player to push the box at row 2, column 6 onto the goal at row 2, column 3.\n   - Move the player to push the box at row 2, column 7 onto the goal at row 1, column 2.\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at row 1, column 3 onto the goal at row 4, column 6.\n\n5. **Execution:**\n   - The player moves left (L), down (D), left (L), up (U), right (R), down (D), right (R), up (U), left (L), down (D), right (R), up (U), left (L), down (D), right (R), up (U), left (L), down (D), right (R).\n\nBy following these steps, the player can successfully push all the boxes onto the goals.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is: <<<LDRULDRULDRULDR>>>."
