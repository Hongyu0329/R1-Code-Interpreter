    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be moved through walls or other boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (4, 2).\n   - There are three boxes (@) at positions (5, 2), (5, 3), and (6, 2).\n   - There are three goals (X) at positions (3, 1), (6, 3), and (6, 4).\n   - There are two boxes already on goals ($) at positions (2, 1) and (2, 2).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes (@) to the goals (X) at positions (3, 1), (6, 3), and (6, 4).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - First, move the player to a position where they can push the boxes.\n   - Push the boxes one by one onto the goals.\n   - Ensure that no box is pushed into a corner or against a wall where it cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to position (4, 3).\n   - Push the box at (5, 2) to the right to (5, 3).\n   - Move the player down to (5, 2) and then to (6, 2).\n   - Push the box at (6, 2) to the right to (6, 3).\n   - Move the player up to (5, 3) and then to (5, 4).\n   - Push the box at (5, 3) down to (6, 3).\n   - Move the player to the right to (6, 4).\n   - Push the box at (6, 3) to the right to (6, 4).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The player should make the following moves: R, D, R, U, R, D, R.\n\nBy following these steps, all boxes will be placed on the goals, solving the puzzle.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RDRURDR>>>"
