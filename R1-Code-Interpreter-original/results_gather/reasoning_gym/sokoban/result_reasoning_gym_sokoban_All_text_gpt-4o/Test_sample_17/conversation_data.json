    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player is on a goal, represented by '%'.\n   - There are three boxes: one on a goal ('$') and two on empty positions ('@').\n   - There are two goals: one under the player and one in the middle of the board.\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - The player can only push boxes, not pull them.\n   - The player cannot move through walls or boxes.\n\n4. **Plan:**\n   - Move the player to a position where they can push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Ensure that each move is valid and does not block the player or boxes.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to get off the goal: R\n   - Move down to position the player to push the box: D\n   - Push the box up onto the goal: U\n   - Move the player back down to push the next box: D\n   - Move left to position the player to push the second box: L\n   - Push the second box up onto the goal: U\n   - Move the player back down to push the last box: D\n   - Move right to position the player to push the third box: R\n   - Push the third box up onto the goal: U\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: RDLULDRU\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RDLULDRU>>>"
