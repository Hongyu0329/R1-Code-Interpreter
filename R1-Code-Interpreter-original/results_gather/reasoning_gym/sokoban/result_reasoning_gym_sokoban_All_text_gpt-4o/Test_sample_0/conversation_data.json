    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player is on a goal (%).\n   - There are three boxes (@) and three goals (X).\n   - The player needs to push each box onto a goal.\n\n2. **Goals and Boxes:**\n   - The goals are located at positions (1,3), (2,5), and (5,4).\n   - The boxes are initially at positions (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to move the player to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - The player starts on a goal, so we need to move the player off the goal to start pushing boxes.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player down to get off the goal: D\n   - Move right to position the player to push the first box: R\n   - Push the first box right onto the goal: R\n   - Move the player down to push the second box: D\n   - Push the second box right onto the goal: R\n   - Move the player down to push the third box: D\n   - Push the third box right onto the goal: R\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The player should now have pushed all boxes onto the goals.\n\nBy following these steps, the player successfully pushes all boxes onto the goals.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<DRRDRDR>>>"
