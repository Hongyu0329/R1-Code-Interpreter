    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player is on a goal (%).\n   - There are boxes (@) and boxes on goals ($).\n   - There are goals (X) that need to be covered by boxes.\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - The player can only push boxes, not pull them.\n   - The player cannot move through walls or boxes.\n   - The player must end up with all boxes on goals.\n\n4. **Plan:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push boxes towards the goals.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be retrieved.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box (@) into the goal (X) on the bottom row.\n   - Continue moving boxes towards the goals, ensuring that each move is reversible if needed.\n\nLet's execute the plan:\n\n- Move the player right (R) to push the box (@) on the second row into the goal (X) on the bottom row.\n- Move the player down (D) to position them to push the next box.\n- Move the player left (L) to push the box (@) on the third row into the goal (X) on the bottom row.\n- Continue this process, moving the player around the board to push each box onto a goal.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing and executing the moves, the final sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RRDLLDRURRDDLLURR>>>"
