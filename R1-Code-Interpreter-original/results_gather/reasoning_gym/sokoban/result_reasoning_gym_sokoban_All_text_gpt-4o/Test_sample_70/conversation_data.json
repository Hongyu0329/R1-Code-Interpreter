    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at the bottom row, second from the right.\n   - There are several boxes (@) and goals (X) scattered throughout the grid.\n   - Some boxes are already on goals ($).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Identify which boxes are closest to goals and plan moves to push them onto the goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be retrieved.\n   - Use the player to navigate around the grid efficiently, ensuring that each move contributes towards solving the puzzle.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to position themselves to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Push the boxes one by one onto the goals, ensuring that each move is valid and contributes to the solution.\n\n5. **Execution:**\n   - Start by moving the player to the left to push the box in the bottom row onto the goal.\n   - Continue moving the player around the grid, pushing each box onto a goal.\n\nBy carefully planning each move and ensuring that the player can always reach the next box, we can solve the puzzle.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle, represented as a sequence of moves, is:\n\n<<<UULLLDDRRUURRDDLLUUURRDDLLDDRRUU>>>"
