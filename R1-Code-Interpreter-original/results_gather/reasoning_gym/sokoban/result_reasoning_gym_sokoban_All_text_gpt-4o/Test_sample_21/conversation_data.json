    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1, 1).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (1, 2), (2, 3), and (4, 3).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (1, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 5).\n   - There are boxes on goals ($) at positions (2, 1), (3, 1), and (4, 1).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) to cover all goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to push the box at (1, 2) onto the goal at (1, 3).\n   - Then, move the player to push the box at (2, 3) onto the goal at (3, 4).\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at (4, 3) onto the goal at (4, 5).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player right to position (1, 2) and push the box to the right onto the goal at (1, 3): R.\n   - Move the player down to position (2, 2), then right to position (2, 3) to push the box down to the goal at (3, 4): DRD.\n   - Move the player down to position (4, 2), then right to position (4, 3) to push the box right to the goal at (4, 5): DRR.\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves is: RDRDRDRR.\n\nBy following these steps, all boxes will be placed on the goals, solving the puzzle.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<RDRDRDRR>>>"
