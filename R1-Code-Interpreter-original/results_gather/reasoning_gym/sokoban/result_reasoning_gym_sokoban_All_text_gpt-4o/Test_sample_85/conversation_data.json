    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + +  \n   + - - - @ X +  \n   + - - - @ - +  \n   + - @ - X - +  \n   + - X - @ - +  \n   + - - % $ + +  \n   + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n   - The player is on a goal at position (5, 4).\n   - There are three boxes (@) at positions (1, 4), (2, 4), and (4, 6).\n   - There are three goals (X) at positions (1, 5), (3, 5), and (4, 3).\n   - One box is already on a goal at position (5, 5).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Move the player to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - Ensure that boxes are not pushed into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to get off the goal: L\n   - Move up to position (4, 4): U\n   - Move left to position (4, 3) to push the box at (4, 4) onto the goal at (4, 3): L\n   - Move down to position (5, 3): D\n   - Move right to position (5, 4): R\n   - Move up to position (4, 4): U\n   - Move up to position (3, 4): U\n   - Move left to position (3, 3): L\n   - Move up to position (2, 3): U\n   - Move right to position (2, 4) to push the box at (2, 4) onto the goal at (3, 5): R\n   - Move down to position (3, 4): D\n   - Move down to position (4, 4): D\n   - Move right to position (4, 5): R\n   - Move up to position (3, 5): U\n   - Move up to position (2, 5): U\n   - Move left to position (2, 4): L\n   - Move left to position (2, 3): L\n   - Move down to position (3, 3): D\n   - Move right to position (3, 4): R\n   - Move right to position (3, 5): R\n   - Move down to position (4, 5): D\n   - Move left to position (4, 4): L\n   - Move left to position (4, 3): L\n   - Move up to position (3, 3): U\n   - Move right to position (3, 4): R\n   - Move right to position (3, 5): R\n   - Move down to position (4, 5): D\n   - Move right to position (4, 6) to push the box at (4, 6) onto the goal at (4, 5): R\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The boxes are now on the goals, and the puzzle is solved.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LURULDRURULDLDRURULDLDRUR>>>"
