    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + +  \n   + + X @ * +  \n   + + - - @ +  \n   + $ - - X +  \n   + + + + + +  \n   + + + + $ +  \n   + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the player (*) to push the boxes (@) onto the goals (X).\n\n3. **Current Positions:**\n   - Player (*) is at (1, 4).\n   - Boxes (@) are at (1, 3) and (2, 4).\n   - Goals (X) are at (1, 2) and (3, 4).\n   - Box on goal ($) is at (3, 2) and (5, 4).\n\n4. **Plan:**\n   - Move the player to push the box at (1, 3) onto the goal at (1, 2).\n   - Then, move the player to push the box at (2, 4) onto the goal at (3, 4).\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move Left (L) to position (1, 3).\n   - Push the box Left (L) to position (1, 2) (goal).\n   - Move Down (D) to position (2, 3).\n   - Move Right (R) to position (2, 4).\n   - Push the box Down (D) to position (3, 4) (goal).\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - L (Move Left)\n   - L (Push Box Left)\n   - D (Move Down)\n   - R (Move Right)\n   - D (Push Box Down)\n\nThe sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LLDRD>>>"
