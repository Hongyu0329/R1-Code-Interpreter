    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (7, 5).\n   - There are four boxes (@) at positions (3, 4), (3, 5), (6, 2), and (6, 4).\n   - There are four goals (X) at positions (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 2), and (5, 2).\n   - One box is already on a goal ($) at position (1, 4).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes to cover all the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to the goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to position (7, 4): L\n   - Move up to position (6, 4): U\n   - Push the box at (6, 4) to the left to position (6, 3): L\n   - Move the player down to position (7, 3): D\n   - Move left to position (7, 2): L\n   - Move up to position (6, 2): U\n   - Push the box at (6, 2) up to position (5, 2): U\n   - Move the player down to position (6, 2): D\n   - Move right to position (6, 3): R\n   - Move up to position (5, 3): U\n   - Move up to position (4, 3): U\n   - Push the box at (3, 4) to the right to position (3, 5): R\n   - Move the player down to position (4, 5): D\n   - Move left to position (4, 4): L\n   - Push the box at (3, 5) down to position (4, 5): D\n   - Move the player up to position (3, 5): U\n   - Move left to position (3, 4): L\n   - Push the box at (3, 4) left to position (3, 3): L\n   - Move the player down to position (4, 3): D\n   - Move left to position (4, 2): L\n   - Push the box at (5, 2) up to position (4, 2): U\n   - Move the player down to position (5, 2): D\n   - Move right to position (5, 3): R\n   - Move up to position (4, 3): U\n   - Move up to position (3, 3): U\n   - Push the box at (3, 3) up to position (2, 3): U\n   - Move the player down to position (3, 3): D\n   - Move right to position (3, 4): R\n   - Move up to position (2, 4): U\n   - Push the box at (2, 3) left to position (2, 2): L\n\n5. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure all boxes are on goals.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LUULDDRRUULDDLUURRDDLUU>>>"
