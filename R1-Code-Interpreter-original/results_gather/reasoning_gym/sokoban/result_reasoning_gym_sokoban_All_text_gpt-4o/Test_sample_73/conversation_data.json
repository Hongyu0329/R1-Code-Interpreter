    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at the bottom right corner.\n   - There are four boxes (@) and four goals (X).\n   - Some boxes are already on goals ($).\n\n2. **Goals:**\n   - We need to move the boxes onto the goals. The goals are located at positions (3, 3), (4, 7), (5, 7), and (6, 4).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push the boxes towards the goals.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are not on goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be retrieved.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to get into a position to push the box at (6, 6).\n   - Push the box at (6, 6) to the left onto the goal at (6, 4).\n   - Move the player to the top to push the box at (5, 6) down onto the goal at (5, 7).\n   - Move the player to the top to push the box at (2, 3) down onto the goal at (3, 3).\n   - Finally, move the player to the left to push the box at (2, 5) down onto the goal at (4, 7).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: LDDRRULDDLUURRDD.\n\nBy following these steps, all boxes will be placed on the goals, solving the puzzle.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LDDRRULDDLUURRDD>>>"
