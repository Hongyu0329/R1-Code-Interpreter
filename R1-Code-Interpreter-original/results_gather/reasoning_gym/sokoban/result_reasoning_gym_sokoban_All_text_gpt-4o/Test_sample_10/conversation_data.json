    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + +  \n   + X X @ - +  \n   + - X - - +  \n   + @ - @ - +  \n   + % @ - - +  \n   + + + + + +  \n   ```\n   - The player is on a goal at position (4, 2).\n   - There are three boxes at positions (1, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 3).\n   - There are three goals at positions (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 2).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to push the box at (3, 1) onto the goal at (2, 2).\n   - Then, push the box at (1, 3) onto the goal at (1, 1).\n   - Finally, push the box at (3, 3) onto the goal at (1, 2).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to position (4, 1): L\n   - Move up to position (3, 1): U\n   - Push the box at (3, 1) up to (2, 1): U\n   - Move right to position (2, 2): R\n   - Move down to position (3, 2): D\n   - Move right to position (3, 3): R\n   - Push the box at (3, 3) up to (2, 3): U\n   - Move left to position (2, 2): L\n   - Move up to position (1, 2): U\n   - Push the box at (1, 3) left to (1, 2): L\n   - Move down to position (2, 2): D\n   - Move right to position (2, 3): R\n   - Move up to position (1, 3): U\n   - Push the box at (1, 3) left to (1, 2): L\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: LURURDLULURDLU\n\nTherefore, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LURURDLULURDLU>>>"
