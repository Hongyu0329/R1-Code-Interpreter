    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can only push one box at a time and cannot move through walls (+) or boxes. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals, represented by ($).\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player is on a goal, represented by (%).\n   - There are four boxes (@) and three goals (X).\n   - The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals.\n\n2. **Identify Movable Boxes:**\n   - The boxes that can be moved initially are the ones not blocked by walls or other boxes.\n   - The box at position (3, 6) is directly accessible to the player.\n\n3. **Plan Moves:**\n   - Move the player to a position where they can push the box at (3, 6) onto a goal.\n   - After moving a box onto a goal, the player should move to the next accessible box.\n\n4. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (3, 6) onto the goal at (3, 4).\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (4, 5) onto the goal at (4, 4).\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (4, 6) onto the goal at (4, 3).\n   - Finally, move the player to the left to push the box at (4, 7) onto the goal at (4, 2).\n\n5. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure all boxes are on goals, and the player is in a valid position.\n\nBy following these steps, we can derive the sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is: <<<RRUULLDDRRUULLDD>>>."
