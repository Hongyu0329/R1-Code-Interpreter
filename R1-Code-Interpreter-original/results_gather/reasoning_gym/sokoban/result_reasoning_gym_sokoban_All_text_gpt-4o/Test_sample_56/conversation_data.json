    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + + + +  \n   + - - - + X - $ +  \n   + X - - + $ - * +  \n   + - - @ - - X - +  \n   + @ $ - - - @ - +  \n   + - - - - - - - +  \n   + + + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Goals and Boxes:**\n   - Goals (X) are located at (1,5), (2,1), and (3,6).\n   - Boxes (@) are located at (3,3), (4,1), and (4,6).\n   - Box on goal ($) is located at (1,7) and (4,3).\n\n3. **Player (*) Initial Position:**\n   - The player is initially at (2,7).\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - Move the player to push the box at (3,3) to the goal at (2,1).\n   - Move the player to push the box at (4,1) to the goal at (1,5).\n   - Move the player to push the box at (4,6) to the goal at (3,6).\n\n5. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move left to position (2,6): L\n   - Move left to position (2,5): L\n   - Move down to position (3,5): D\n   - Move left to position (3,4): L\n   - Move left to position (3,3): L\n   - Push the box up to position (2,3): U\n   - Move up to position (2,2): U\n   - Move left to position (2,1): L\n   - Push the box left to position (1,1): L\n   - Move down to position (2,1): D\n   - Move right to position (2,2): R\n   - Move right to position (2,3): R\n   - Move down to position (3,3): D\n   - Move down to position (4,3): D\n   - Move left to position (4,2): L\n   - Push the box up to position (3,2): U\n   - Move up to position (2,2): U\n   - Move left to position (2,1): L\n   - Push the box left to position (1,1): L\n   - Move down to position (2,1): D\n   - Move right to position (2,2): R\n   - Move right to position (2,3): R\n   - Move down to position (3,3): D\n   - Move down to position (4,3): D\n   - Move right to position (4,4): R\n   - Move right to position (4,5): R\n   - Push the box up to position (3,5): U\n   - Move up to position (2,5): U\n   - Move right to position (2,6): R\n   - Move right to position (2,7): R\n   - Move down to position (3,7): D\n   - Move left to position (3,6): L\n   - Push the box up to position (2,6): U\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The boxes are now on the goals, and the puzzle is solved.\n\nThe sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LLDLLULURRRDDLLULURRRDDRRUURRDDLLUR>>>"
