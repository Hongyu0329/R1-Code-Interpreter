    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + + +  \n   + + + $ * $ + +  \n   + - - - @ - + +  \n   + - @ - X - $ +  \n   + - - + + + + +  \n   + - - X + + + +  \n   + + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Goals and Boxes:**\n   - Goals (X) are located at (3,4) and (5,3).\n   - Boxes (@) are located at (2,4), (3,2), and (4,6) (already on a goal).\n\n3. **Player (*) Initial Position:**\n   - The player is at (1,4).\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - First, we need to move the player to push the box at (2,4) onto the goal at (3,4).\n   - Then, move the player to push the box at (3,2) onto the goal at (5,3).\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player down to (2,4) to push the box down: D\n   - Push the box down to (3,4): D\n   - Move the player left to (3,3): L\n   - Move the player down to (4,3): D\n   - Move the player right to (4,4): R\n   - Move the player up to (3,4) to push the box right: U\n   - Push the box right to (3,5): R\n   - Move the player down to (4,5): D\n   - Move the player left to (4,4): L\n   - Move the player down to (5,4): D\n   - Move the player left to (5,3) to push the box left: L\n   - Push the box left to (5,2): L\n   - Move the player up to (4,2): U\n   - Move the player left to (4,1): L\n   - Move the player down to (5,1): D\n   - Move the player right to (5,2) to push the box right: R\n   - Push the box right to (5,3): R\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The boxes are now on the goals, and the puzzle is solved.\n\nThe sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is:\n\n<<<DDLRDRULRDLULDRR>>>"
