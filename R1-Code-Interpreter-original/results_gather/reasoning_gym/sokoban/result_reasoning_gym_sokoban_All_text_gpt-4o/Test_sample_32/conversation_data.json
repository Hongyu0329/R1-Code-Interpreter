    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + + + + +  \n   + - X - * - - - +  \n   + $ @ - - + $ - +  \n   + - - - - + $ - +  \n   + - - - X @ - - +  \n   + + + + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Goals and Boxes:**\n   - Goals (X) are located at (1,2) and (4,4).\n   - Boxes (@) are located at (2,2), (2,6), and (3,6).\n   - Box on a goal ($) is at (2,1).\n\n3. **Player's Initial Position:**\n   - The player (*) is at (1,4).\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - First, move the player to push the box at (2,2) onto the goal at (1,2).\n   - Then, move the player to push the box at (2,6) onto the goal at (4,4).\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at (3,6) onto the goal at (2,6).\n\n5. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move the player left to (1,3), then left to (1,2) to push the box at (2,2) up onto the goal at (1,2).\n   - Move the player right to (1,3), then down to (2,3), then right to (2,4), then right to (2,5), then down to (3,5), then right to (3,6) to push the box at (2,6) down onto the goal at (4,4).\n   - Move the player up to (3,5), then left to (3,4), then left to (3,3), then up to (2,3), then right to (2,4), then right to (2,5), then down to (3,5), then right to (3,6) to push the box at (3,6) left onto the goal at (2,6).\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: LULDRRRDDLUURRDD.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LULDRRRDDLUURRDD>>>"
