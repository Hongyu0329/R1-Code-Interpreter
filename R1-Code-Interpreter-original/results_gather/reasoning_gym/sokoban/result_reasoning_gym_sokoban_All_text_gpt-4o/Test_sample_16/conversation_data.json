    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at row 6, column 6.\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions: (1, 5), (2, 2), (5, 3), (6, 4), and (6, 7).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions: (1, 3), (2, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), and (6, 8).\n   - There are boxes on goals ($) at positions: (4, 2), (5, 4), and (6, 7).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box onto a goal.\n   - Prioritize moving boxes that are closer to goals.\n   - Avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved again.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (6, 4) onto the goal at (6, 5).\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (6, 7) onto the goal at (6, 8).\n   - Move the player up to push the box at (5, 3) onto the goal at (5, 5).\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (2, 2) onto the goal at (2, 3).\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (1, 5) onto the goal at (1, 3).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to achieve the solution is: LDRRULURRDLU.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LDRRULURRDLU>>>"
