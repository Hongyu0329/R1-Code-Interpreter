    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (7, 1).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (1, 3), (2, 5), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 2), and (6, 3).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), and (6, 1).\n   - There is a box on a goal ($) at position (6, 4).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box.\n   - Push boxes towards the goals, ensuring not to block any box in a corner or against a wall where it cannot be moved.\n   - Use the empty spaces to maneuver the player and boxes effectively.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the right to position (7, 2): R\n   - Move up to position (6, 2): U\n   - Push the box at (6, 2) to the left onto the goal at (6, 1): L\n   - Move the player back to the right to position (6, 2): R\n   - Move up to position (5, 2): U\n   - Push the box at (5, 2) to the right to position (5, 3): R\n   - Move the player down to position (6, 3): D\n   - Push the box at (6, 3) to the right to position (6, 4): R\n   -
