    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The player (*) is at position (1, 1). There are boxes (@) at positions (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 4), (6, 3), (6, 5), and (7, 2). There are goals (X) at positions (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), and (6, 4).\n\n2. **Objective**: Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start by moving the player to push the box at (1, 2) to the goal at (1, 6).\n   - Then, focus on the boxes in the lower part of the grid, moving them to the nearest goals.\n   - Ensure that boxes are not pushed into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (1, 2) to the right: RRRRR.\n   - Move down to push the box at (2, 1) to the goal at (3, 1): DDD.\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (2, 4) to the goal at (3, 3): RRUU.\n   - Move down to push the box at (6, 3) to the goal at (5, 3): DDD.\n   - Move the player to the right to push the box at (6, 5) to the goal at (6, 4): R.\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at (7, 2) to the goal at (6, 3): UUU.\n\n5. **Final Moves**:\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: RRRRRDDDRRUUDDDRRUUU.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RRRRRDDDRRUUDDDRRUUU>>>"
