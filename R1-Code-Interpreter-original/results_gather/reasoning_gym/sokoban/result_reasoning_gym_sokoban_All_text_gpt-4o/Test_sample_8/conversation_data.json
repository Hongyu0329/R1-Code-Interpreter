    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The goal is to have all boxes on the goals, represented by $.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1, 2).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (2, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 5), (6, 4), and (6, 5).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 3), (6, 3), and (8, 7).\n   - Some boxes are already on goals, represented by $ at positions (1, 3) and (5, 4).\n\n2. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals. We need to carefully plan the moves to avoid getting boxes stuck in corners or against walls where they cannot be moved.\n   - The player can move to adjacent empty spaces or push a box if there is an empty space or goal behind it.\n\n3. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move the player to position (2, 2) to push the box at (2, 1) to the right onto the goal at (3, 1).\n   - Move the player to position (3, 4) to push the box at (3, 3) down onto the goal at (4, 3).\n   - Move the player to position (5, 6) to push the box at (5, 5) down onto the goal at (6, 5).\n   - Move the player to position (6, 6) to push the box at (6, 5) right onto the goal at (6, 6).\n   - Move the player to position (7, 5) to push the box at (6, 4) down onto the goal at (7, 5).\n   - Finally, move the player to position (8, 6) to push the box at (8, 5) right onto the goal at (8, 7).\n\n4. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure all boxes are on goals, represented by $.\n   - The puzzle is solved when all goals are covered by boxes.\n\nBy following these steps, we can derive the sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is: <<<DRRULDDRRULDDRRU>>>."
