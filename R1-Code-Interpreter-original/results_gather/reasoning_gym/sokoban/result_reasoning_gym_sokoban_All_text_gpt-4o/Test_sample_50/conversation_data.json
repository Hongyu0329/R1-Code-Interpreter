    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be moved through walls or other boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (7, 6).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (2, 3), (3, 5), (7, 5).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (2, 4), (6, 3), (7, 3).\n   - There are boxes on goals ($) at positions (2, 2), (5, 4).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes (@) to cover all goals (X).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to push the box at (3, 5) to the goal at (2, 4).\n   - Then, move the player to push the box at (7, 5) to the goal at (7, 3).\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at (2, 3) to the goal at (6, 3).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the box at (3, 5): R, R, U, U.\n   - Push the box at (3, 5) to the goal at (2, 4): L, U.\n   - Move the player to the box at (7, 5): D, D, D, R.\n   - Push the box at (7, 5) to the goal at (7, 3): U, U.\n   - Move the player to the box at (2, 3): L, L, U, U, L.\n   - Push the box at (2, 3) to the goal at (6, 3): D, D, D, R.\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves is: R, R, U, U, L, U, D, D, D, R, U, U, L, L, U, U, L, D, D, D, R.\n\nThe final answer, representing the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle, is:\n\n<<<RRUULUDDDRUULLUULDDDR>>>"
