    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes cannot be moved through walls or other boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1, 4).\n   - There are three boxes (@) at positions (1, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 2).\n   - There are two goals (X) at positions (1, 2) and (6, 4).\n   - There are two boxes already on goals ($) at positions (2, 3) and (6, 2).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes (@) to the goals (X) such that all goals are covered by boxes ($).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals.\n   - We need to carefully plan the moves to avoid getting boxes stuck in corners or against walls where they cannot be moved.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box at (1, 3) onto the goal at (1, 2).\n   - Move the player down to push the box at (2, 4) onto the goal at (6, 4).\n\n5. **Detailed Moves:**\n   - From the initial position (1, 4), move left (L) to (1, 3).\n   - Push the box left (L) to (1, 2), covering the goal.\n   - Move down (D) to (2, 2), then right (R) to (2, 3), then down (D) to (3, 3).\n   - Move right (R) to (3, 4), then down (D) to (4, 4), then down (D) to (5, 4).\n   - Move left (L) to (5, 3), then down (D) to (6, 3).\n   - Move right (R) to (6, 4) and push the box right (R) to cover the goal at (6, 4).\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves is: LLDLDRDDDRR.\n\nBy following these steps, all boxes will be on goals, and the puzzle will be solved.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is: <<<LLDLDRDDDRR>>>."
