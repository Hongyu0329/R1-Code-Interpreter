    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and cannot pull boxes.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   + + + + + +  \n   + - $ + $ +  \n   + - - - + +  \n   + - @ - + +  \n   + - - X X +  \n   + - @ X @ +  \n   + - - - * +  \n   + + + + + +  \n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Goals and Boxes:**\n   - Goals (X) are located at positions (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), and (5,5).\n   - Boxes (@) are located at positions (3,2), (5,2), and (5,5).\n   - Box on a goal ($) is located at (1,2) and (1,4).\n\n3. **Player's Initial Position:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (6,4).\n\n4. **Plan Moves:**\n   - The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals. We will start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box.\n\n5. **Move Sequence:**\n   - Move the player to the left to get behind the box at (5,2).\n   - Push the box at (5,2) to the right onto the goal at (5,4).\n   - Move the player to the top to push the box at (3,2) down onto the goal at (4,4).\n   - Finally, move the player to push the box at (5,5) left onto the goal at (5,4).\n\n6. **Detailed Steps:**\n   - Move left (L) to position (6,3).\n   - Move up (U) to position (5,3).\n   - Move left (L) to position (5,2).\n   - Push the box right (R) to position (5,3).\n   - Move right (R) to position (5,4).\n   - Move up (U) to position (4,4).\n   - Move left (L) to position (4,3).\n   - Move up (U) to position (3,3).\n   - Move left (L) to position (3,2).\n   - Push the box down (D) to position (4,2).\n   - Move down (D) to position (5,2).\n   - Move right (R) to position (5,3).\n   - Move right (R) to position (5,4).\n   - Move up (U) to position (4,4).\n   - Move right (R) to position (4,5).\n   - Move down (D) to position (5,5).\n   - Push the box left (L) to position (5,4).\n\n7. **Final Move Sequence:**\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: LURRULULDDRRURDLD.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<LURRULULDDRRURDLD>>>"
