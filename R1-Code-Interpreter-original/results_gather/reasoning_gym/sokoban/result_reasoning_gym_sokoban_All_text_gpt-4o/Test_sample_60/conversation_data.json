    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), and can only push one box at a time. The player cannot move through walls (+) or boxes, and boxes can only be pushed, not pulled.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is at position (1, 1).\n   - There are boxes (@) at positions (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (6, 2), and (7, 3).\n   - There are goals (X) at positions (1, 6), (2, 5), (6, 1), (7, 4), and (8, 2).\n   - There are boxes on goals ($) at positions (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), and (3, 7).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by moving the player to push the box at (1, 2) onto the goal at (1, 6).\n   - Then, move the player to push the box at (2, 1) onto the goal at (6, 1).\n   - Next, push the box at (2, 3) onto the goal at (2, 5).\n   - Finally, push the box at (6, 2) onto the goal at (8, 2) and the box at (7, 3) onto the goal at (7, 4).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player right to push the box at (1, 2) to the right: R\n   - Move the player right to push the box at (1, 3) to the right: R\n   - Move the player right to push the box at (1, 4) to the right: R\n   - Move the player right to push the box at (1, 5) to the right: R\n   - Move the player down to position (2, 5): D\n   - Move the player left to position (2, 4): L\n   - Move the player left to position (2, 3): L\n   -
