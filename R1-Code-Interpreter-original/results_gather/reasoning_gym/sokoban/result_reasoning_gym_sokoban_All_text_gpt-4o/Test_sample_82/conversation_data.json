    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The puzzle is solved when all boxes are on goals, either as $ (box on a goal) or % (player on a goal with a box).\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player (*) is located at (8, 1).\n   - There are boxes (@) at (5, 3), (6, 3), and (8, 2).\n   - There are goals (X) at (2, 1), (6, 1), and (8, 4).\n   - There are already boxes on goals ($) at (1, 2), (2, 5), and (3, 5).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move the boxes (@) to the remaining goals (X) at (2, 1), (6, 1), and (8, 4).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - The player needs to push the boxes onto the goals. The player can only push a box if there is an empty space (-) or a goal (X) behind the box in the direction of the push.\n   - The player cannot pull boxes, only push them.\n   - The player cannot move through walls (+).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - Move the player to the box at (8, 2) and push it to the goal at (8, 4).\n   - Move the player to the box at (6, 3) and push it to the goal at (6, 1).\n   - Move the player to the box at (5, 3) and push it to the goal at (2, 1).\n\n5. **Detailed Moves:**\n   - From (8, 1), move right to (8, 2).\n   - Push the box from (8, 2) to (8, 3), then to (8, 4).\n   - Move up to (7, 3), then to (6, 3).\n   - Push the box from (6, 3) to (6, 2), then to (6, 1).\n   - Move down to (7, 2), then to (8, 2), then up to (7, 2), then to (6, 2), then to (5, 2), then to (4, 2), then to (3, 2), then to (2, 2).\n   - Push the box from (5, 3) to (4, 3), then to (3, 3), then to (2, 3), then to (2, 2), then to (2, 1).\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves to solve the puzzle is: RRUUULLLDDRRUULLL.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<RRUUULLLDDRRUULLL>>>"
