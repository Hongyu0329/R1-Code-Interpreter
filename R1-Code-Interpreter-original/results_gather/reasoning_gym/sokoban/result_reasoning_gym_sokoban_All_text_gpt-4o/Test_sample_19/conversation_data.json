    "To solve the Sokoban puzzle, we need to move the player (*) to push all the boxes (@) onto the goals (X). The player can only push one box at a time and cannot move through walls (+) or boxes. The goal is to have all boxes on goals, represented by ($).\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The player is on a goal, represented by (%).\n   - There are several boxes (@) and goals (X) scattered throughout the grid.\n   - The objective is to move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n2. **Identify Movable Boxes:**\n   - The player can only push boxes that are adjacent to them and have an empty space or a goal on the opposite side.\n   - We need to plan a path that allows the player to push each box onto a goal.\n\n3. **Plan Moves:**\n   - Start by moving the player to a position where they can push a box.\n   - Push the box towards a goal.\n   - Repeat this process for each box until all are on goals.\n\n4. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move the player to the left to push the box on the goal ($) to the left.\n   - Continue moving the player and pushing boxes until all boxes are on goals.\n\n5. **Considerations:**\n   - Ensure that boxes are not pushed into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved.\n   - Plan moves to avoid blocking the playerâ€™s path to other boxes.\n\nBy carefully planning and executing these steps, we can solve the puzzle. Here is the sequence of moves:\n\n<<<ULLLDDRRUURRDDLLDDRRUUU>>>"
