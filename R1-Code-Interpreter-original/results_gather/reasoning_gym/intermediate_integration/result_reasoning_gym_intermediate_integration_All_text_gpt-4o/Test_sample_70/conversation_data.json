    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -18*sqrt(9*x + 7) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Let u = 9*x + 7. \n   - Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 9, or du = 9*dx.\n   - Solving for dx gives dx = du/9.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**:\n   - Substitute u and dx into the integral: \n   - ∫ -18*sqrt(9*x + 7) dx becomes ∫ -18*sqrt(u) * (du/9).\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral**:\n   - Factor out constants from the integral: \n   - ∫ -18*sqrt(u) * (du/9) = -18/9 * ∫ sqrt(u) du = -2 * ∫ u**(1/2) du.\n\n4. **Integrate**:\n   - The integral of u**(1/2) with respect to u is (2/3)*u**(3/2).\n   - Therefore, -2 * ∫ u**(1/2) du = -2 * (2/3)*u**(3/2) = -(4/3)*u**(3/2).\n\n5. **Back-Substitute**:\n   - Replace u with the original expression in terms of x: u = 9*x + 7.\n   - So, -(4/3)*u**(3/2) becomes -(4/3)*(9*x + 7)**(3/2).\n\n6. **Add the Constant of Integration**:\n   - Since this is an indefinite integral, add the constant of integration, C.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<-(4/3)*(9*x + 7)**(3/2) + C>>>"
