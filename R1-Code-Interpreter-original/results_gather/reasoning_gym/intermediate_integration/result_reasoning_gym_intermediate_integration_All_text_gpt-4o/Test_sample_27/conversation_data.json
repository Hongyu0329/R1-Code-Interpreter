    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ 9*sqrt(3*x - 1) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: \n   - The integrand is 9*sqrt(3*x - 1). \n   - We can use a substitution to simplify the square root. Let u = 3*x - 1. \n   - Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 3, or dx = du/3.\n\n2. **Substitute in the integral**:\n   - Replace 3*x - 1 with u, and dx with du/3.\n   - The integral becomes ∫ 9*sqrt(u) * (du/3).\n\n3. **Simplify the integral**:\n   - Factor out constants: 9/3 = 3.\n   - The integral simplifies to 3 * ∫ sqrt(u) du.\n\n4. **Integrate with respect to u**:\n   - The antiderivative of sqrt(u) is (2/3)*u**(3/2).\n   - Therefore, 3 * ∫ sqrt(u) du = 3 * (2/3) * u**(3/2) = 2 * u**(3/2).\n\n5. **Substitute back in terms of x**:\n   - Recall that u = 3*x - 1.\n   - Substitute back to get 2 * (3*x - 1)**(3/2).\n\n6. **Add the constant of integration**:\n   - The final antiderivative is 2 * (3*x - 1)**(3/2) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nTherefore, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n<<<2 * (3*x - 1)**(3/2) + C>>>"
