    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ exp(-x - 2) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Function**: The function we need to integrate is exp(-x - 2). This can be rewritten using properties of exponents as exp(-x) * exp(-2).\n\n2. **Constant Factor**: Notice that exp(-2) is a constant with respect to x. Therefore, it can be factored out of the integral. This gives us:\n   ∫ exp(-x - 2) dx = exp(-2) * ∫ exp(-x) dx.\n\n3. **Integrate the Exponential Function**: The integral of exp(-x) with respect to x is a standard result. The antiderivative of exp(-x) is -exp(-x). Therefore:\n   ∫ exp(-x) dx = -exp(-x).\n\n4. **Combine the Results**: Substitute the result of the integration back into the expression with the constant factor:\n   exp(-2) * ∫ exp(-x) dx = exp(-2) * (-exp(-x)).\n\n5. **Simplify the Expression**: Simplify the expression by distributing the constant:\n   -exp(-2) * exp(-x) = -exp(-x - 2).\n\n6. **Add the Constant of Integration**: Since we are finding an indefinite integral, we must add a constant of integration, C, to the result:\n   -exp(-x - 2) + C.\n\nTherefore, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n<<<-exp(-x - 2) + C>>>"
