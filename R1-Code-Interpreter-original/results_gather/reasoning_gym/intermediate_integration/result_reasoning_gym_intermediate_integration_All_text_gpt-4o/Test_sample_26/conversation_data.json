    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ x**3 * cos(x) dx, we will use the method of integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nStep 1: Choose u and dv\n- Let u = x**3, which implies that du = 3*x**2 dx.\n- Let dv = cos(x) dx, which implies that v = ∫ cos(x) dx = sin(x).\n\nStep 2: Apply the integration by parts formula\n- Substitute u, du, v, and dv into the integration by parts formula:\n  ∫ x**3 * cos(x) dx = x**3 * sin(x) - ∫ sin(x) * 3*x**2 dx\n\nStep 3: Simplify and apply integration by parts again\n- The remaining integral is ∫ 3*x**2 * sin(x) dx. We will apply integration by parts again to this integral.\n- Let u = 3*x**2, which implies that du = 6*x dx.\n- Let dv = sin(x) dx, which implies that v = ∫ sin(x) dx = -cos(x).\n\n- Substitute u, du, v, and dv into the integration by parts formula:\n  ∫ 3*x**2 * sin(x) dx = 3*x**2 * (-cos(x)) - ∫ -cos(x) * 6*x dx\n  = -3*x**2 * cos(x) + ∫ 6*x * cos(x) dx\n\nStep 4: Simplify and apply integration by parts again\n- The remaining integral is ∫ 6*x * cos(x) dx. We will apply integration by parts again to this integral.\n- Let u = 6*x, which implies that du = 6 dx.\n- Let dv = cos(x) dx, which implies that v = ∫ cos(x) dx = sin(x).\n\n- Substitute u, du, v, and dv into the integration by parts formula:\n  ∫ 6*x * cos(x) dx = 6*x * sin(x) - ∫ sin(x) * 6 dx\n  = 6*x * sin(x) - 6 * ∫ sin(x) dx\n  = 6*x * sin(x) + 6 * cos(x)\n\nStep 5: Combine all parts\n- Substitute back into the original expression:\n  ∫ x**3 * cos(x) dx = x**3 * sin(x) - (-3*x**2 * cos(x) + 6*x * sin(x) + 6 * cos(x))\n  = x**3 * sin(x) + 3*x**2 * cos(x) - 6*x * sin(x) - 6 * cos(x) + C\n\nThe constant of integration is represented by C.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<x**3 * sin(x) + 3*x**2 * cos(x) - 6*x * sin(x) - 6 * cos(x) + C>>>"
