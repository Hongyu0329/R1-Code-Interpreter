    "To solve the indefinite integral ∫ -12*sin(4*x - 6)**3*cos(4*x - 6) dx, we can use a substitution method. Let's go through the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: \n   - Notice that the integrand contains a composition of functions: sin(4*x - 6) and cos(4*x - 6).\n   - A common technique is to use substitution when you have a function and its derivative present. Here, the derivative of sin(4*x - 6) is 4*cos(4*x - 6).\n\n2. **Choose the substitution**:\n   - Let u = sin(4*x - 6). Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 4*cos(4*x - 6).\n   - Therefore, du = 4*cos(4*x - 6) dx.\n\n3. **Rewrite the integral in terms of u**:\n   - The original integral is ∫ -12*sin(4*x - 6)**3*cos(4*x - 6) dx.\n   - Substitute u = sin(4*x - 6) and du = 4*cos(4*x - 6) dx.\n   - Solve for dx: dx = du / (4*cos(4*x - 6)).\n   - Substitute into the integral: ∫ -12*u**3*(1/4)*du = ∫ -3*u**3 du.\n\n4. **Integrate with respect to u**:\n   - The integral ∫ -3*u**3 du is straightforward.\n   - Integrate: ∫ -3*u**3 du = -3*(u**4)/4 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n5. **Substitute back in terms of x**:\n   - Recall that u = sin(4*x - 6).\n   - Substitute back: -3*(sin(4*x - 6)**4)/4 + C.\n\n6. **Simplify the expression**:\n   - The final expression is already simplified: -3/4 * sin(4*x - 6)**4 + C.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral is:\n\n<<<-3/4 * sin(4*x - 6)**4 + C>>>"
