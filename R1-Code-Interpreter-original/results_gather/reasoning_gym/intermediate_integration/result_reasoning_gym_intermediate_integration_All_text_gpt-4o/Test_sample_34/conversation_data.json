    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 3*(4*x - 8)**3 dx, we will use the method of substitution. Let's go through the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: \n   We notice that the expression inside the power, (4*x - 8), can be substituted with a new variable to simplify the integration process. Let's set:\n   u = 4*x - 8\n\n2. **Differentiate the substitution**:\n   Differentiate u with respect to x to find du:\n   du/dx = 4\n   Therefore, du = 4*dx\n\n3. **Solve for dx**:\n   From the expression for du, we can solve for dx:\n   dx = du/4\n\n4. **Substitute in the integral**:\n   Substitute u and dx into the integral:\n   ∫ 3*(4*x - 8)**3 dx = ∫ 3*u**3 * (du/4)\n\n5. **Simplify the integral**:\n   Factor out the constant 3/4 from the integral:\n   = (3/4) * ∫ u**3 du\n\n6. **Integrate with respect to u**:\n   The integral of u**3 with respect to u is (u**4)/4. Therefore:\n   ∫ u**3 du = (u**4)/4\n\n7. **Substitute back the original variable**:\n   Substitute u = 4*x - 8 back into the expression:\n   (3/4) * (u**4)/4 = (3/16) * (4*x - 8)**4\n\n8. **Add the constant of integration**:\n   Since this is an indefinite integral, we add the constant of integration C:\n   (3/16) * (4*x - 8)**4 + C\n\nThus, the final answer to the indefinite integral is:\n\n<<<(3/16) * (4*x - 8)**4 + C>>>"
