    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 3*sin(3*x + 4)*cos(3*x + 4)**4 dx, we will use substitution and integration techniques. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Let u = 3*x + 4. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 3. \n   - This implies that dx = du/3.\n\n2. **Rewrite the integral**:\n   - Substitute u into the integral: ∫ 3*sin(u)*cos(u)**4 * (du/3).\n   - The 3 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, simplifying the integral to ∫ sin(u)*cos(u)**4 du.\n\n3. **Integration by parts or trigonometric identities**:\n   - Notice that sin(u)*cos(u)**4 can be rewritten using trigonometric identities. \n   - We can use the identity sin(2u) = 2*sin(u)*cos(u) to express sin(u) in terms of sin(2u).\n   - However, a more straightforward approach is to use the substitution v = cos(u), which implies dv = -sin(u) du.\n\n4. **Substitute and simplify**:\n   - With v = cos(u), the integral becomes ∫ -v**4 dv (since dv = -sin(u) du).\n   - This simplifies to -∫ v**4 dv.\n\n5. **Integrate**:\n   - The integral of v**4 with respect to v is (v**5)/5.\n   - Therefore, -∫ v**4 dv = -(v**5)/5.\n\n6. **Back-substitute**:\n   - Recall that v = cos(u) and u = 3*x + 4.\n   - Substitute back to get -(cos(3*x + 4)**5)/5.\n\n7. **Add the constant of integration**:\n   - Since this is an indefinite integral, we add a constant of integration, C.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-(cos(3*x + 4)**5)/5 + C>>>"
