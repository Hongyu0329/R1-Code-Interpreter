    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ -x**2*sin(2*x) dx, we will use the method of integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nStep 1: Identify u and dv\n- Let u = -x**2. Then, the derivative du = -2*x dx.\n- Let dv = sin(2*x) dx. To find v, we need to integrate dv. The integral of sin(2*x) is -1/2*cos(2*x), so v = -1/2*cos(2*x).\n\nStep 2: Apply the integration by parts formula\n- Substitute u, du, v, and dv into the integration by parts formula:\n  ∫ -x**2*sin(2*x) dx = uv - ∫ v du\n  = (-x**2)*(-1/2*cos(2*x)) - ∫ (-1/2*cos(2*x))*(-2*x) dx\n\nStep 3: Simplify the expression\n- The first term becomes (1/2)*x**2*cos(2*x).\n- The integral in the second term becomes ∫ x*cos(2*x) dx.\n\nStep 4: Apply integration by parts again to ∫ x*cos(2*x) dx\n- Let u = x. Then, du = dx.\n- Let dv = cos(2*x) dx. The integral of cos(2*x) is 1/2*sin(2*x), so v = 1/2*sin(2*x).\n\nStep 5: Apply the integration by parts formula again\n- Substitute u, du, v, and dv into the integration by parts formula:\n  ∫ x*cos(2*x) dx = uv - ∫ v du\n  = x*(1/2*sin(2*x)) - ∫ (1/2*sin(2*x)) dx\n\nStep 6: Simplify the expression\n- The first term becomes (1/2)*x*sin(2*x).\n- The integral in the second term becomes (1/4)*(-cos(2*x)) = -(1/4)*cos(2*x).\n\nStep 7: Combine all parts\n- Substitute back into the original expression:\n  ∫ -x**2*sin(2*x) dx = (1/2)*x**2*cos(2*x) - [(1/2)*x*sin(2*x) + (1/4)*cos(2*x)]\n\nStep 8: Simplify the final expression\n- Combine the terms:\n  = (1/2)*x**2*cos(2*x) - (1/2)*x*sin(2*x) - (1/4)*cos(2*x) + C\n\nThe constant of integration is added at the end.\n\n<<<(1/2)*x**2*cos(2*x) - (1/2)*x*sin(2*x) - (1/4)*cos(2*x) + C>>>"
