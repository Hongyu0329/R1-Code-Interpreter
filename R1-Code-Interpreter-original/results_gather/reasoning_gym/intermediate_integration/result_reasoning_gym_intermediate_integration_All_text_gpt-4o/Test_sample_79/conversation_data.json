    "To solve the integral ∫ 2*exp(x)*cos(x) dx, we will use the method of integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nFor this integral, we will choose:\n\n- u = cos(x), which implies that du = -sin(x) dx\n- dv = 2*exp(x) dx, which implies that v = 2*exp(x)\n\nNow, applying the integration by parts formula:\n\n1. Calculate uv:\n   - u = cos(x)\n   - v = 2*exp(x)\n   - Therefore, uv = 2*exp(x)*cos(x)\n\n2. Calculate ∫ v du:\n   - v = 2*exp(x)\n   - du = -sin(x) dx\n   - Therefore, ∫ v du = ∫ 2*exp(x)*(-sin(x)) dx = -2*∫ exp(x)*sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we have:\n\n∫ 2*exp(x)*cos(x) dx = 2*exp(x)*cos(x) + 2*∫ exp(x)*sin(x) dx\n\nNext, we need to solve the integral ∫ exp(x)*sin(x) dx. We will again use integration by parts:\n\n- Let u = sin(x), which implies that du = cos(x) dx\n- Let dv = exp(x) dx, which implies that v = exp(x)\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\n1. Calculate uv:\n   - u = sin(x)\n   - v = exp(x)\n   - Therefore, uv = exp(x)*sin(x)\n\n2. Calculate ∫ v du:\n   - v = exp(x)\n   - du = cos(x) dx\n   - Therefore, ∫ v du = ∫ exp(x)*cos(x) dx\n\nNow, we have:\n\n∫ exp(x)*sin(x) dx = exp(x)*sin(x) - ∫ exp(x)*cos(x) dx\n\nSubstitute this back into the previous equation:\n\n∫ 2*exp(x)*cos(x) dx = 2*exp(x)*cos(x) + 2*(exp(x)*sin(x) - ∫ exp(x)*cos(x) dx)\n\nSimplify:\n\n∫ 2*exp(x)*cos(x) dx = 2*exp(x)*cos(x) + 2*exp(x)*sin(x) - 2*∫ exp(x)*cos(x) dx\n\nNotice that ∫ exp(x)*cos(x) dx appears on both sides of the equation. Let's denote I = ∫ exp(x)*cos(x) dx. Then:\n\n2*I = 2*exp(x)*cos(x) + 2*exp(x)*sin(x) - 2*I\n\nAdd 2*I to both sides:\n\n4*I = 2*exp(x)*cos(x) + 2*exp(x)*sin(x)\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nI = (1/2)*exp(x)*cos(x) + (1/2)*exp(x)*sin(x)\n\nTherefore, the antiderivative of the original integral is:\n\n∫ 2*exp(x)*cos(x) dx = exp(x)*cos(x) + exp(x)*sin(x) + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\n<<<answer>>> exp(x)*cos(x) + exp(x)*sin(x) + C"
