    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 6*exp(6*x - 6) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the structure of the integrand**: The integrand is 6*exp(6*x - 6). This can be rewritten as 6*exp(6*(x - 1)) by factoring out the 6 from the exponent.\n\n2. **Recognize the form of the exponential function**: The function exp(6*(x - 1)) is an exponential function with a linear argument. The general form for integrating an exponential function of the form exp(a*x) is (1/a)*exp(a*x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n3. **Apply the integration rule for exponential functions**: \n   - Here, the argument of the exponential function is 6*(x - 1), which can be expanded to 6*x - 6.\n   - The derivative of the inner function 6*x - 6 with respect to x is 6.\n   - Therefore, the integral of exp(6*x - 6) with respect to x is (1/6)*exp(6*x - 6) + C.\n\n4. **Multiply by the constant factor outside the integral**: \n   - The original integrand is 6*exp(6*x - 6). \n   - We have found that the integral of exp(6*x - 6) is (1/6)*exp(6*x - 6) + C.\n   - Therefore, the integral of 6*exp(6*x - 6) is 6 * (1/6)*exp(6*x - 6) + C = exp(6*x - 6) + C.\n\n5. **Write the final answer**: The indefinite integral of the given function is exp(6*x - 6) + C.\n\n<<<exp(6*x - 6) + C>>>"
