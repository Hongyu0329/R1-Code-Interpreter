    "To find the indefinite integral of ∫ asin(x) dx, we will use integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nStep 1: Choose u and dv\n- Let u = asin(x). Then, the derivative du = acos(x) dx.\n- Let dv = dx. Then, the integral v = x.\n\nStep 2: Apply the integration by parts formula\n- Substitute u, du, v, and dv into the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ asin(x) dx = x * asin(x) - ∫ x * acos(x) dx\n\nStep 3: Simplify the remaining integral\n- We need to solve ∫ x * acos(x) dx. Again, we will use integration by parts for this integral.\n\nStep 4: Choose new u and dv for the remaining integral\n- Let u = x. Then, the derivative du = dx.\n- Let dv = acos(x) dx. Then, the integral v = asin(x).\n\nStep 5: Apply the integration by parts formula again\n- Substitute the new u, du, v, and dv into the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ x * acos(x) dx = x * asin(x) - ∫ asin(x) dx\n\nStep 6: Substitute back into the original equation\n- Substitute the result from Step 5 back into the equation from Step 2:\n\n∫ asin(x) dx = x * asin(x) - (x * asin(x) - ∫ asin(x) dx)\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation\n- Simplify the equation to solve for ∫ asin(x) dx:\n\n∫ asin(x) dx = x * asin(x) - x * asin(x) + ∫ asin(x) dx\n\n- This simplifies to:\n\n0 = 0\n\nThis indicates that the integration by parts method needs to be adjusted or another method should be used. Let's try a substitution method instead.\n\nStep 8: Use substitution\n- Let t = asin(x). Then, dt = acos(x) dx.\n\n- Rewrite the integral in terms of t:\n\n∫ t dt\n\nStep 9: Integrate with respect to t\n- The integral of t with respect to t is:\n\n(1/2) * t**2 + C\n\nStep 10: Substitute back in terms of x\n- Replace t with asin(x):\n\n(1/2) * (asin(x))**2 + C\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of ∫ asin(x) dx is:\n\n<<<(1/2) * (asin(x))**2 + C>>>"
