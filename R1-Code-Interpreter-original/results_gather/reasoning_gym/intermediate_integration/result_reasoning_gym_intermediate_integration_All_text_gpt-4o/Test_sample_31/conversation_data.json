    "To solve the integral ∫ -6*sin(2*x + 2)*cos(2*x + 2) dx, we can use a trigonometric identity to simplify the integrand. The identity we will use is:\n\nsin(A)*cos(A) = (1/2)*sin(2*A)\n\nThis identity allows us to express the product of sine and cosine in terms of a single sine function with a double angle. Let's apply this identity to the integrand:\n\n1. Identify A in the expression sin(2*x + 2)*cos(2*x + 2). Here, A = 2*x + 2.\n\n2. Apply the identity: sin(2*x + 2)*cos(2*x + 2) = (1/2)*sin(2*(2*x + 2)) = (1/2)*sin(4*x + 4).\n\n3. Substitute this back into the integral:\n\n   ∫ -6*sin(2*x + 2)*cos(2*x + 2) dx = ∫ -6*(1/2)*sin(4*x + 4) dx\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n\n   = ∫ -3*sin(4*x + 4) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the antiderivative of -3*sin(4*x + 4). To do this, we use the standard antiderivative formula for sin(k*x + b), which is:\n\n∫ sin(k*x + b) dx = -(1/k)*cos(k*x + b) + C\n\n5. In our case, k = 4 and b = 4. Therefore, the antiderivative is:\n\n   = -3*(-1/4)*cos(4*x + 4) + C\n\n6. Simplify the expression:\n\n   = (3/4)*cos(4*x + 4) + C\n\nThus, the antiderivative of the given integral is:\n\n<<<(3/4)*cos(4*x + 4) + C>>>"
