    "To solve the indefinite integral ∫ 3*sin(3*x - 10)**3*cos(3*x - 10) dx, we can use a substitution method. Let's go through the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: \n   - Notice that the integrand has the form of a function raised to a power and its derivative. Specifically, we have sin(3*x - 10) raised to a power and its derivative, cos(3*x - 10), present in the integrand.\n   - Let u = sin(3*x - 10). Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 3*cos(3*x - 10).\n\n2. **Express dx in terms of du**:\n   - From the derivative, we have du = 3*cos(3*x - 10) dx.\n   - Solving for dx gives dx = du / (3*cos(3*x - 10)).\n\n3. **Substitute into the integral**:\n   - Substitute u = sin(3*x - 10) and dx = du / (3*cos(3*x - 10)) into the integral.\n   - The integral becomes ∫ 3*u**3*cos(3*x - 10) * (du / (3*cos(3*x - 10))).\n   - Simplify the expression: The 3 and cos(3*x - 10) terms cancel out, leaving us with ∫ u**3 du.\n\n4. **Integrate with respect to u**:\n   - The integral ∫ u**3 du is a standard power rule integral.\n   - Using the power rule, ∫ u**n du = u**(n+1)/(n+1) + C, we find ∫ u**3 du = u**4/4 + C.\n\n5. **Substitute back in terms of x**:\n   - Recall that u = sin(3*x - 10).\n   - Substitute back to get the integral in terms of x: (sin(3*x - 10))**4 / 4 + C.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral is:\n\n<<<(sin(3*x - 10))**4 / 4 + C>>>"
