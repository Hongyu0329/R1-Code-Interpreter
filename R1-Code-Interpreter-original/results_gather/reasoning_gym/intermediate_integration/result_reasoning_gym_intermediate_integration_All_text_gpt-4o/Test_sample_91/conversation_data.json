    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ -2*(7*x + 5)**2 dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand the Expression**: \n   Start by expanding the expression (7*x + 5)**2. \n   Using the formula (a + b)**2 = a**2 + 2*a*b + b**2, we have:\n   (7*x + 5)**2 = (7*x)**2 + 2*(7*x)*5 + 5**2\n                = 49*x**2 + 70*x + 25.\n\n2. **Multiply by -2**:\n   Now, multiply the expanded expression by -2:\n   -2*(49*x**2 + 70*x + 25) = -98*x**2 - 140*x - 50.\n\n3. **Integrate Term by Term**:\n   Integrate each term separately with respect to x:\n   - The antiderivative of -98*x**2 is (-98/3)*x**3.\n   - The antiderivative of -140*x is (-140/2)*x**2 = -70*x**2.\n   - The antiderivative of -50 is -50*x.\n\n4. **Combine the Results**:\n   Combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration C:\n   ∫ -2*(7*x + 5)**2 dx = (-98/3)*x**3 - 70*x**2 - 50*x + C.\n\nTherefore, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n<<<(-98/3)*x**3 - 70*x**2 - 50*x + C>>>."
