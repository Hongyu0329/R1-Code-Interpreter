    "To solve the indefinite integral ∫ -sin(x + 6)*cos(x + 6)**4 dx, we can use a substitution method. Let's go through the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Let u = x + 6. \n   - Then, du/dx = 1, which implies that du = dx.\n\n2. **Rewrite the integral**:\n   - The integral becomes ∫ -sin(u)*cos(u)**4 du.\n\n3. **Simplify the integral**:\n   - Notice that the integral is in the form of ∫ -sin(u)*cos(u)**n du, where n = 4.\n   - This suggests using a substitution for cos(u). Let v = cos(u), then dv/du = -sin(u), which implies that dv = -sin(u) du.\n\n4. **Substitute and simplify**:\n   - The integral now becomes ∫ v**4 dv, since -sin(u) du = dv.\n\n5. **Integrate**:\n   - The integral of v**4 with respect to v is (1/5)*v**5 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n6. **Back-substitute**:\n   - Recall that v = cos(u) and u = x + 6.\n   - Substitute back to get (1/5)*cos(x + 6)**5 + C.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of ∫ -sin(x + 6)*cos(x + 6)**4 dx is:\n\n<<<(1/5)*cos(x + 6)**5 + C>>>"
