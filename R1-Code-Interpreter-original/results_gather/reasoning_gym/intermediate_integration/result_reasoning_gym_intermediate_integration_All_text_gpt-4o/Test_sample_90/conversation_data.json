    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -x*cos(2*x) dx, we will use integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nStep 1: Identify u and dv\n- Let u = -x. Then, the derivative du = -1 dx.\n- Let dv = cos(2*x) dx. Then, we need to find v by integrating dv.\n\nStep 2: Integrate dv to find v\n- The integral of cos(2*x) dx is (1/2)*sin(2*x), because the derivative of sin(2*x) is 2*cos(2*x), and we need to divide by 2 to account for the chain rule.\n\nStep 3: Apply the integration by parts formula\n- Substitute u, du, v, and dv into the integration by parts formula:\n  ∫ -x*cos(2*x) dx = uv - ∫ v du\n  = (-x)*(1/2)*sin(2*x) - ∫ (1/2)*sin(2*x)*(-1) dx\n\nStep 4: Simplify the expression\n- The expression becomes:\n  = (-1/2)*x*sin(2*x) + (1/2)∫ sin(2*x) dx\n\nStep 5: Integrate the remaining integral\n- The integral of sin(2*x) dx is -(1/2)*cos(2*x), because the derivative of cos(2*x) is -2*sin(2*x), and we need to divide by -2 to account for the chain rule.\n\nStep 6: Substitute back and simplify\n- Substitute the result of the integral back into the expression:\n  = (-1/2)*x*sin(2*x) + (1/2)*(-(1/2)*cos(2*x))\n  = (-1/2)*x*sin(2*x) - (1/4)*cos(2*x)\n\nStep 7: Add the constant of integration\n- Since this is an indefinite integral, we add a constant of integration, C.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<(-1/2)*x*sin(2*x) - (1/4)*cos(2*x) + C>>>"
