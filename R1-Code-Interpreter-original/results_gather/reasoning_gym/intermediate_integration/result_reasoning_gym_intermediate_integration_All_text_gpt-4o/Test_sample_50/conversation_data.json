    "To solve the integral ∫ -3*sqrt(5 - 3*x) dx, we will use substitution and integration techniques. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: \n   We have an expression under the square root, 5 - 3*x. A common technique is to use substitution to simplify the integral. Let u = 5 - 3*x. \n\n2. **Differentiate the substitution**:\n   Differentiate u with respect to x to find du/dx:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{du}{dx} = -3\n   \\]\n   Therefore, du = -3*dx or dx = du / -3.\n\n3. **Substitute in the integral**:\n   Replace 5 - 3*x with u and dx with du / -3 in the integral:\n   \\[\n   \\int -3*\\sqrt{5 - 3*x} \\, dx = \\int -3*\\sqrt{u} \\, \\frac{du}{-3}\n   \\]\n   Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   \\int \\sqrt{u} \\, du\n   \\]\n\n4. **Integrate with respect to u**:\n   The integral of \\(\\sqrt{u}\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\int u^{1/2} \\, du = \\frac{u^{3/2}}{3/2} + C = \\frac{2}{3}*u^{3/2} + C\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substitute back in terms of x**:\n   Recall that u = 5 - 3*x. Substitute back to get the antiderivative in terms of x:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3}*(5 - 3*x)^{3/2} + C\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final answer**:\n   The antiderivative of the given integral is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3}*(5 - 3*x)^{3/2} + C\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{2}{3}*(5 - 3*x)^{3/2} + C\\)>>>"
