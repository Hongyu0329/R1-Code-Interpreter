    "To solve the integral ∫ 7*sin(7*x + 1)**2*cos(7*x + 1) dx, we will use substitution and integration techniques. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: \n   - Notice that the expression inside the trigonometric functions is the same: 7*x + 1. This suggests a substitution to simplify the integral.\n   - Let u = 7*x + 1. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 7, or dx = du/7.\n\n2. **Substitute in the integral**:\n   - Replace 7*x + 1 with u, and dx with du/7 in the integral.\n   - The integral becomes ∫ 7*sin(u)**2*cos(u) * (du/7).\n\n3. **Simplify the integral**:\n   - The 7 in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, simplifying the integral to ∫ sin(u)**2 * cos(u) du.\n\n4. **Use substitution for integration**:\n   - To integrate sin(u)**2 * cos(u), we can use another substitution. Let v = sin(u), then dv/du = cos(u), or du = dv/cos(u).\n   - Substitute v = sin(u) and du = dv/cos(u) into the integral: ∫ v**2 * cos(u) * (dv/cos(u)).\n   - The cos(u) terms cancel, leaving ∫ v**2 dv.\n\n5. **Integrate with respect to v**:\n   - The integral ∫ v**2 dv is straightforward. The antiderivative is (1/3)*v**3 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n6. **Back-substitute for v and u**:\n   - Recall that v = sin(u) and u = 7*x + 1.\n   - Substitute back to get (1/3)*(sin(7*x + 1))**3 + C.\n\n7. **Final answer**:\n   - The antiderivative of the original integral is (1/3)*(sin(7*x + 1))**3 + C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(1/3)*(sin(7*x + 1))**3 + C>>>"
