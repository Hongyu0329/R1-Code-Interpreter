    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ 3*x**3*exp(x) dx, we will use the method of integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nWe need to choose u and dv from the integrand 3*x**3*exp(x). A common strategy is to let u be the algebraic part and dv be the exponential part. \n\nStep 1: Choose u and dv\n- Let u = 3*x**3, which implies that du = 9*x**2 dx.\n- Let dv = exp(x) dx, which implies that v = exp(x).\n\nStep 2: Apply the integration by parts formula\nUsing the formula ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du, we substitute the chosen u, du, v, and dv:\n\n∫ 3*x**3*exp(x) dx = 3*x**3*exp(x) - ∫ exp(x) * 9*x**2 dx\n\nStep 3: Simplify and repeat integration by parts\nNow, we need to integrate ∫ 9*x**2*exp(x) dx. We apply integration by parts again:\n\n- Let u = 9*x**2, which implies that du = 18*x dx.\n- Let dv = exp(x) dx, which implies that v = exp(x).\n\nUsing the formula again:\n\n∫ 9*x**2*exp(x) dx = 9*x**2*exp(x) - ∫ exp(x) * 18*x dx\n\nStep 4: Simplify and repeat integration by parts\nNow, we need to integrate ∫ 18*x*exp(x) dx. We apply integration by parts again:\n\n- Let u = 18*x, which implies that du = 18 dx.\n- Let dv = exp(x) dx, which implies that v = exp(x).\n\nUsing the formula again:\n\n∫ 18*x*exp(x) dx = 18*x*exp(x) - ∫ exp(x) * 18 dx\n\nStep 5: Simplify and integrate the remaining term\nNow, we need to integrate ∫ 18*exp(x) dx, which is straightforward:\n\n∫ 18*exp(x) dx = 18*exp(x)\n\nStep 6: Combine all parts\nSubstitute back all the parts into the original integration by parts steps:\n\n∫ 3*x**3*exp(x) dx = 3*x**3*exp(x) - [9*x**2*exp(x) - (18*x*exp(x) - 18*exp(x))]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n= 3*x**3*exp(x) - 9*x**2*exp(x) + 18*x*exp(x) - 18*exp(x) + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration.\n\n<<<3*x**3*exp(x) - 9*x**2*exp(x) + 18*x*exp(x) - 18*exp(x) + C>>>"
