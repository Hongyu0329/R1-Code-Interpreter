    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -2*x**2*cos(3*x) dx, we will use integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nStep 1: Choose u and dv\n- Let u = -2*x**2. Then, differentiate u to find du:\n  du = d(-2*x**2) = -4*x dx\n\n- Let dv = cos(3*x) dx. Then, integrate dv to find v:\n  v = ∫ cos(3*x) dx = (1/3)*sin(3*x)\n\nStep 2: Apply the integration by parts formula\n- Substitute u, du, v, and dv into the integration by parts formula:\n  ∫ -2*x**2*cos(3*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v du\n  = (-2*x**2)*((1/3)*sin(3*x)) - ∫ ((1/3)*sin(3*x))*(-4*x) dx\n\nStep 3: Simplify the expression\n- Simplify the first term:\n  = (-2/3)*x**2*sin(3*x)\n\n- Simplify the integral:\n  = + (4/3)∫ x*sin(3*x) dx\n\nStep 4: Apply integration by parts again to ∫ x*sin(3*x) dx\n- Let u = x. Then, differentiate u to find du:\n  du = dx\n\n- Let dv = sin(3*x) dx. Then, integrate dv to find v:\n  v = ∫ sin(3*x) dx = -(1/3)*cos(3*x)\n\n- Substitute u, du, v, and dv into the integration by parts formula:\n  ∫ x*sin(3*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v du\n  = x*(-(1/3)*cos(3*x)) - ∫ (-(1/3)*cos(3*x)) dx\n\nStep 5: Simplify the expression\n- Simplify the first term:\n  = -(1/3)*x*cos(3*x)\n\n- Simplify the integral:\n  = + (1/9)*sin(3*x)\n\nStep 6: Substitute back into the original expression\n- Substitute the result of ∫ x*sin(3*x) dx back into the expression from Step 3:\n  = (-2/3)*x**2*sin(3*x) + (4/3)*(-(1/3)*x*cos(3*x) + (1/9)*sin(3*x))\n\nStep 7: Simplify the final expression\n- Distribute and combine like terms:\n  = (-2/3)*x**2*sin(3*x) - (4/9)*x*cos(3*x) + (4/27)*sin(3*x) + C\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<(-2/3)*x**2*sin(3*x) - (4/9)*x*cos(3*x) + (4/27)*sin(3*x) + C>>>"
