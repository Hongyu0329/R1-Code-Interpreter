    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ 2*(x - 1)**2 dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand the Expression:**\n   - Start by expanding the expression (x - 1)**2.\n   - (x - 1)**2 = (x - 1)*(x - 1) = x**2 - 2*x + 1.\n\n2. **Multiply by the Constant:**\n   - Multiply the expanded expression by 2.\n   - 2*(x**2 - 2*x + 1) = 2*x**2 - 4*x + 2.\n\n3. **Integrate Term by Term:**\n   - Integrate each term separately with respect to x.\n   - ∫ 2*x**2 dx = (2/3)*x**3 + C1, where C1 is a constant of integration.\n   - ∫ -4*x dx = -2*x**2 + C2, where C2 is a constant of integration.\n   - ∫ 2 dx = 2*x + C3, where C3 is a constant of integration.\n\n4. **Combine the Integrals:**\n   - Combine the results of the integrals and the constants of integration.\n   - (2/3)*x**3 - 2*x**2 + 2*x + C, where C = C1 + C2 + C3 is the overall constant of integration.\n\nTherefore, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n<<<(2/3)*x**3 - 2*x**2 + 2*x + C>>>"
