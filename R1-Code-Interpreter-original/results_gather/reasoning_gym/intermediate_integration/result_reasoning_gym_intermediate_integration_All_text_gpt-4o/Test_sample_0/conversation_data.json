    "To find the indefinite integral of the function ∫ (3*x + 5)**3 dx, we will use the method of substitution. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: \n   We notice that the integrand is a power of a linear function. We can use substitution to simplify the integration process. Let u = 3*x + 5. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 3.\n\n2. **Express dx in terms of du**:\n   From the derivative, we have du = 3*dx, which implies dx = du/3.\n\n3. **Substitute in the integral**:\n   Replace (3*x + 5) with u and dx with du/3 in the integral:\n   ∫ (3*x + 5)**3 dx = ∫ u**3 * (du/3).\n\n4. **Factor out constants**:\n   The constant 1/3 can be factored out of the integral:\n   (1/3) * ∫ u**3 du.\n\n5. **Integrate with respect to u**:\n   The integral of u**3 with respect to u is (u**4)/4. Therefore:\n   (1/3) * ∫ u**3 du = (1/3) * (u**4)/4 = (1/12) * u**4.\n\n6. **Substitute back in terms of x**:\n   Recall that u = 3*x + 5. Substitute back to get the expression in terms of x:\n   (1/12) * (3*x + 5)**4.\n\n7. **Add the constant of integration**:\n   Since this is an indefinite integral, we add a constant of integration, C.\n\nThus, the indefinite integral of the function is:\n\n<<<(1/12) * (3*x + 5)**4 + C>>>"
