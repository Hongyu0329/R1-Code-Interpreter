    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 10*sqrt(10*x + 9) dx, we will use a substitution method. Let's go through the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Let u = 10*x + 9. \n   - Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 10. \n   - This implies that dx = du/10.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**:\n   - Substitute u and dx into the integral: \n   - ∫ 10*sqrt(10*x + 9) dx becomes ∫ 10*sqrt(u) * (du/10).\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral**:\n   - The 10 in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, so we have:\n   - ∫ sqrt(u) du.\n\n4. **Integrate**:\n   - The integral of sqrt(u) with respect to u is (2/3)*u**(3/2) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n5. **Back-Substitute**:\n   - Replace u with the original expression in terms of x: u = 10*x + 9.\n   - So, (2/3)*u**(3/2) + C becomes (2/3)*(10*x + 9)**(3/2) + C.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of 10*sqrt(10*x + 9) with respect to x is:\n\n<<<(2/3)*(10*x + 9)**(3/2) + C>>>"
