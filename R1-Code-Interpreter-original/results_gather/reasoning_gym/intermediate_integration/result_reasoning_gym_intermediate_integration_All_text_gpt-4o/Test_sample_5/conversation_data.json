    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ 24*exp(8 - 8*x) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the function to integrate**: The function given is 24*exp(8 - 8*x).\n\n2. **Recognize the exponential function**: The function exp(8 - 8*x) can be rewritten using the properties of exponents as exp(8) * exp(-8*x).\n\n3. **Factor out constants**: The constant 24 and exp(8) can be factored out of the integral since they do not depend on x. This gives us:\n   ∫ 24*exp(8)*exp(-8*x) dx = 24*exp(8) * ∫ exp(-8*x) dx.\n\n4. **Integrate the exponential function**: The integral of exp(-8*x) with respect to x is:\n   -1/8 * exp(-8*x) + C, where C is the constant of integration. This is because the derivative of exp(-8*x) is -8*exp(-8*x), so we need to divide by -8 to account for the chain rule.\n\n5. **Combine the results**: Multiply the result of the integration by the constants factored out earlier:\n   24*exp(8) * (-1/8) * exp(-8*x) + C.\n\n6. **Simplify the expression**: Simplify the expression by multiplying the constants:\n   -3*exp(8) * exp(-8*x) + C.\n\n7. **Combine the exponential terms**: Since exp(8) * exp(-8*x) = exp(8 - 8*x), the expression simplifies to:\n   -3*exp(8 - 8*x) + C.\n\nTherefore, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n<<<-3*exp(8 - 8*x) + C>>>"
