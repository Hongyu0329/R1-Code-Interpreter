    "To solve the indefinite integral ∫ -4*sin(4*x + 1)**2*cos(4*x + 1) dx, we will use substitution and integration techniques. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: \n   - Notice that the integrand involves a composition of functions: sin(4*x + 1) and cos(4*x + 1). \n   - A common technique for integrals of this form is to use substitution. Let u = 4*x + 1. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 4, or dx = du/4.\n\n2. **Rewrite the integral in terms of u**:\n   - Substitute u = 4*x + 1 into the integral. The expression becomes:\n     ∫ -4*sin(u)**2*cos(u) * (dx).\n   - Replace dx with du/4, giving:\n     ∫ -4*sin(u)**2*cos(u) * (du/4).\n   - Simplify the expression:\n     ∫ -sin(u)**2*cos(u) du.\n\n3. **Integrate using substitution**:\n   - The integral ∫ -sin(u)**2*cos(u) du can be solved using another substitution. Let v = sin(u), then dv/du = cos(u), or du = dv/cos(u).\n   - Substitute v = sin(u) into the integral:\n     ∫ -v**2 * cos(u) * (dv/cos(u)).\n   - The cos(u) terms cancel out, leaving:\n     ∫ -v**2 dv.\n\n4. **Integrate with respect to v**:\n   - The integral ∫ -v**2 dv is straightforward:\n     -v**3/3 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n5. **Back-substitute to the original variable**:\n   - Recall that v = sin(u) and u = 4*x + 1. Substitute back:\n     - (sin(4*x + 1))**3/3 + C.\n\n6. **Final answer**:\n   - The indefinite integral of the original expression is:\n     <<<- (sin(4*x + 1))**3/3 + C>>>."
