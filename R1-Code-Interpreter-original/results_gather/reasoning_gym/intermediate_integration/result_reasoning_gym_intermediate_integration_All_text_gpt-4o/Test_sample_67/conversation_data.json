    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -12*sin(4*x + 2)**3*cos(4*x + 2) dx, we can use a substitution method. Let's go through the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: \n   We notice that the integrand involves a composition of functions where the inner function is 4*x + 2. This suggests a substitution of the form:\n   Let u = 4*x + 2.\n\n2. **Differentiate the substitution**:\n   Differentiate u with respect to x to find du:\n   du/dx = 4, which implies that du = 4*dx or dx = du/4.\n\n3. **Rewrite the integral in terms of u**:\n   Substitute u = 4*x + 2 and dx = du/4 into the integral:\n   ∫ -12*sin(u)**3*cos(u) * (du/4).\n\n4. **Simplify the integral**:\n   Factor out constants from the integral:\n   = -12/4 * ∫ sin(u)**3 * cos(u) du\n   = -3 * ∫ sin(u)**3 * cos(u) du.\n\n5. **Use substitution for integration**:\n   Notice that the integral ∫ sin(u)**3 * cos(u) du can be solved by another substitution. Let v = sin(u), then dv = cos(u) du. The integral becomes:\n   -3 * ∫ v**3 dv.\n\n6. **Integrate with respect to v**:\n   The integral of v**3 with respect to v is:\n   ∫ v**3 dv = (v**4)/4 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n7. **Substitute back to original variable**:\n   Recall that v = sin(u) and u = 4*x + 2. Substitute back:\n   = -3 * [(sin(u)**4)/4] + C\n   = -3/4 * sin(u)**4 + C\n   = -3/4 * sin(4*x + 2)**4 + C.\n\nThus, the indefinite integral is:\n\n<<<-3/4 * sin(4*x + 2)**4 + C>>>"
