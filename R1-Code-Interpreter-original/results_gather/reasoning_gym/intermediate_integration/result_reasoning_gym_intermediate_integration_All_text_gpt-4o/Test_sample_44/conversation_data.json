    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function \\(-\\log(x)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Function**: The function we need to integrate is \\(-\\log(x)\\).\n\n2. **Integration by Parts**: The integration by parts formula is \\(\\int u \\, dv = uv - \\int v \\, du\\). We need to choose \\(u\\) and \\(dv\\) from the function \\(-\\log(x)\\).\n\n3. **Choose \\(u\\) and \\(dv\\)**:\n   - Let \\(u = -\\log(x)\\). Then, \\(du = -\\frac{1}{x} \\, dx\\).\n   - Let \\(dv = dx\\). Then, \\(v = x\\).\n\n4. **Apply Integration by Parts**:\n   - Using the formula \\(\\int u \\, dv = uv - \\int v \\, du\\), we substitute:\n     \\[\n     \\int -\\log(x) \\, dx = -\\log(x) \\cdot x - \\int x \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\, dx\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the Expression**:\n   - The expression becomes:\n     \\[\n     -x \\log(x) + \\int 1 \\, dx\n     \\]\n\n6. **Integrate the Remaining Part**:\n   - The integral \\(\\int 1 \\, dx\\) is simply \\(x\\).\n\n7. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the results to get the antiderivative:\n     \\[\n     -x \\log(x) + x + C\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n8. **Final Answer**:\n   - The antiderivative of \\(-\\log(x)\\) is:\n     \\[\n     -x \\log(x) + x + C\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-x*log(x) + x + C>>>"
