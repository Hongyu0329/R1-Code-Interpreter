    "To find the indefinite integral ∫ 20*sin(10*x + 9)**3*cos(10*x + 9) dx, we can use a substitution method. Let's go through the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: \n   - Notice that the integrand has the form of a function and its derivative. Specifically, the function inside the sine and cosine is (10*x + 9). \n   - Let u = 10*x + 9. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 10.\n\n2. **Express dx in terms of du**:\n   - From du/dx = 10, we can express dx as dx = du/10.\n\n3. **Substitute in the integral**:\n   - Substitute u = 10*x + 9 and dx = du/10 into the integral.\n   - The integral becomes ∫ 20*sin(u)**3*cos(u) * (du/10).\n\n4. **Simplify the integral**:\n   - Factor out the constants: 20/10 = 2.\n   - The integral simplifies to 2 * ∫ sin(u)**3 * cos(u) du.\n\n5. **Use substitution for integration**:\n   - Notice that the integral ∫ sin(u)**3 * cos(u) du can be solved by another substitution. Let v = sin(u), then dv/du = cos(u), or dv = cos(u) du.\n   - Substitute v = sin(u) and dv = cos(u) du into the integral.\n   - The integral becomes 2 * ∫ v**3 dv.\n\n6. **Integrate with respect to v**:\n   - The integral of v**3 with respect to v is (v**4)/4.\n   - Therefore, 2 * ∫ v**3 dv = 2 * (v**4)/4 = (v**4)/2.\n\n7. **Substitute back to the original variable**:\n   - Recall that v = sin(u) and u = 10*x + 9.\n   - Substitute back to get (sin(10*x + 9)**4)/2.\n\n8. **Add the constant of integration**:\n   - Since this is an indefinite integral, add the constant of integration C.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<(sin(10*x + 9)**4)/2 + C>>>"
