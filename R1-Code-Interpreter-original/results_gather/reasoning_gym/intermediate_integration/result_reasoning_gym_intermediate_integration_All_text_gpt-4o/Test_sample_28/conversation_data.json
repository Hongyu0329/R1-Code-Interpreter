    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ -2*asin(x) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Function**: The function we need to integrate is -2*asin(x). Here, asin(x) is the inverse sine function, also known as arcsin(x).\n\n2. **Integration by Parts**: Since the function involves an inverse trigonometric function, we can use integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n   ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\n3. **Choose u and dv**: \n   - Let u = asin(x). Then, the derivative du = 1/√(1-x**2) dx.\n   - Let dv = -2 dx. Then, the integral v = -2x.\n\n4. **Apply Integration by Parts**:\n   - Using the integration by parts formula, we have:\n     ∫ -2*asin(x) dx = uv - ∫ v du\n     = (-2x)*asin(x) - ∫ (-2x)*(1/√(1-x**2)) dx\n\n5. **Simplify the Integral**: \n   - The remaining integral is ∫ (2x/√(1-x**2)) dx. This can be solved using a substitution method.\n   - Let w = 1-x**2, then dw = -2x dx, or -dw = 2x dx.\n   - Substitute into the integral: ∫ (2x/√(1-x**2)) dx = ∫ (-1/√w) dw\n   - The integral of -1/√w is -2√w.\n\n6. **Substitute Back**:\n   - Substitute w = 1-x**2 back into the expression: -2√(1-x**2).\n\n7. **Combine Results**:\n   - Combine the results from the integration by parts and the substitution:\n     (-2x)*asin(x) + 2√(1-x**2) + C\n\n8. **Final Answer**:\n   - The antiderivative of ∫ -2*asin(x) dx is:\n     <<<-2*x*asin(x) + 2*√(1-x**2) + C>>>"
