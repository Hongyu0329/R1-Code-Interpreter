    "To solve the indefinite integral ∫ -24*sin(8*x + 9)**3*cos(8*x + 9) dx, we will use substitution and integration techniques. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: \n   Notice that the integrand is in the form of a function and its derivative. Specifically, we have sin(8*x + 9) and its derivative, cos(8*x + 9), present in the integrand. This suggests a substitution method.\n\n2. **Substitution**:\n   Let u = sin(8*x + 9). Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is:\n   du/dx = 8*cos(8*x + 9).\n   Therefore, dx = du / (8*cos(8*x + 9)).\n\n3. **Rewrite the integral**:\n   Substitute u and dx into the integral:\n   ∫ -24*sin(8*x + 9)**3*cos(8*x + 9) dx becomes:\n   ∫ -24*u**3*cos(8*x + 9) * (du / (8*cos(8*x + 9))).\n\n4. **Simplify the integral**:\n   The cos(8*x + 9) terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n   ∫ -24/8 * u**3 du = ∫ -3*u**3 du.\n\n5. **Integrate with respect to u**:\n   The integral of -3*u**3 with respect to u is:\n   -3 * (u**4 / 4) + C = -3/4 * u**4 + C.\n\n6. **Back-substitute for x**:\n   Recall that u = sin(8*x + 9). Substitute back to get the integral in terms of x:\n   -3/4 * (sin(8*x + 9))**4 + C.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral is:\n\n<<<-3/4 * (sin(8*x + 9))**4 + C>>>"
