    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ -3*asin(2*x) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Function and Constants:**\n   - The function to integrate is -3*asin(2*x).\n   - The constant factor is -3, which can be factored out of the integral.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral:**\n   - The integral becomes -3 * ∫ asin(2*x) dx.\n\n3. **Use Integration by Parts:**\n   - Integration by parts formula: ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du.\n   - Choose u = asin(2*x) and dv = dx.\n   - Differentiate u: du = (2/sqrt(1-(2*x)**2)) dx (using the derivative of asin(u) which is 1/sqrt(1-u**2) and chain rule).\n   - Integrate dv: v = x.\n\n4. **Apply Integration by Parts:**\n   - Substitute into the integration by parts formula:\n     ∫ asin(2*x) dx = x*asin(2*x) - ∫ x*(2/sqrt(1-(2*x)**2)) dx.\n\n5. **Simplify the Remaining Integral:**\n   - The remaining integral is ∫ (2*x/sqrt(1-(2*x)**2)) dx.\n   - Use substitution: let w = 2*x, then dw = 2 dx, or dx = dw/2.\n   - Substitute into the integral: ∫ (w/sqrt(1-w**2)) * (1/2) dw = (1/2) ∫ w/sqrt(1-w**2) dw.\n\n6. **Solve the Substituted Integral:**\n   - The integral ∫ w/sqrt(1-w**2) dw can be solved using substitution or recognizing it as a standard form.\n   - The antiderivative of w/sqrt(1-w**2) is -sqrt(1-w**2) + C.\n\n7. **Substitute Back:**\n   - Replace w with 2*x: -sqrt(1-(2*x)**2) + C.\n\n8. **Combine Results:**\n   - The antiderivative of ∫ asin(2*x) dx is x*asin(2*x) + (1/2)(-sqrt(1-(2*x)**2)) + C.\n\n9. **Multiply by the Constant Factor:**\n   - Multiply the entire expression by -3: \n     -3 * [x*asin(2*x) - (1/2)sqrt(1-(2*x)**2)] + C.\n\n10. **Simplify the Expression:**\n    - Distribute the -3: \n      -3*x*asin(2*x) + (3/2)sqrt(1-(2*x)**2) + C.\n\nThe final antiderivative is:\n\n<<<-3*x*asin(2*x) + (3/2)*sqrt(1-(2*x)**2) + C>>>"
