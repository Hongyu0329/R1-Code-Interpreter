    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 2*x**3*cos(3*x) dx, we will use the method of integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nWe need to choose u and dv from the integrand 2*x**3*cos(3*x). A good choice is to let:\n\n- u = 2*x**3, which implies that du = 6*x**2 dx\n- dv = cos(3*x) dx, which implies that v = (1/3)*sin(3*x) (since the integral of cos(3*x) is (1/3)*sin(3*x))\n\nNow, apply the integration by parts formula:\n\n1. Calculate uv:\n   - u = 2*x**3\n   - v = (1/3)*sin(3*x)\n   - Therefore, uv = 2*x**3 * (1/3)*sin(3*x) = (2/3)*x**3*sin(3*x)\n\n2. Calculate ∫ v du:\n   - v = (1/3)*sin(3*x)\n   - du = 6*x**2 dx\n   - Therefore, ∫ v du = ∫ (1/3)*sin(3*x) * 6*x**2 dx = 2*∫ x**2*sin(3*x) dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral 2*∫ x**2*sin(3*x) dx using integration by parts again. Choose:\n\n- u = x**2, which implies that du = 2*x dx\n- dv = sin(3*x) dx, which implies that v = -(1/3)*cos(3*x) (since the integral of sin(3*x) is -(1/3)*cos(3*x))\n\nApply the integration by parts formula again:\n\n1. Calculate uv:\n   - u = x**2\n   - v = -(1/3)*cos(3*x)\n   - Therefore, uv = x**2 * (-(1/3)*cos(3*x)) = -(1/3)*x**2*cos(3*x)\n\n2. Calculate ∫ v du:\n   - v = -(1/3)*cos(3*x)\n   - du = 2*x dx\n   - Therefore, ∫ v du = ∫ -(1/3)*cos(3*x) * 2*x dx = -2/3 * ∫ x*cos(3*x) dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral -2/3 * ∫ x*cos(3*x) dx using integration by parts one more time. Choose:\n\n- u = x, which implies that du = dx\n- dv = cos(3*x) dx, which implies that v = (1/3)*sin(3*x)\n\nApply the integration by parts formula again:\n\n1. Calculate uv:\n   - u = x\n   - v = (1/3)*sin(3*x)\n   - Therefore, uv = x * (1/3)*sin(3*x) = (1/3)*x*sin(3*x)\n\n2. Calculate ∫ v du:\n   - v = (1/3)*sin(3*x)\n   - du = dx\n   - Therefore, ∫ v du = ∫ (1/3)*sin(3*x) dx = (1/9)*(-cos(3*x))\n\nNow, combine all the parts:\n\n- The integral 2*∫ x**2*sin(3*x) dx becomes:\n  -2/3 * [-(1/3)*x**2*cos(3*x) - 2/3 * ((1/3)*x*sin(3*x) - (1/9)*cos(3*x))]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n-2/3 * [-(1/3)*x**2*cos(3*x) - 2/3 * ((1/3)*x*sin(3*x) - (1/9)*cos(3*x))]\n= -2/3 * [-(1/3)*x**2*cos(3*x) - 2/9*x*sin(3*x) + 2/27*cos(3*x)]\n\nNow, substitute back into the original integration by parts:\n\n∫ 2*x**3*cos(3*x) dx = (2/3)*x**3*sin(3*x) - 2/3 * [-(1/3)*x**2*cos(3*x) - 2/9*x*sin(3*x) + 2/27*cos(3*x)]\n\nSimplify the entire expression:\n\n= (2/3)*x**3*sin(3*x) + (2/9)*x**2*cos(3*x) + (4/27)*x*sin(3*x) - (4/81)*cos(3*x) + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration.\n\n<<<(2/3)*x**3*sin(3*x) + (2/9)*x**2*cos(3*x) + (4/27)*x*sin(3*x) - (4/81)*cos(3*x) + C>>>"
