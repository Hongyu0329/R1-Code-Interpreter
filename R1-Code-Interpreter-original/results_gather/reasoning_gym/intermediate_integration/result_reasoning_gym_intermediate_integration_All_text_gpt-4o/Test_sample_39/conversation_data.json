    "To find the indefinite integral of the function \\(-a\\sin(x)\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Integral**: We need to find \\(\\int -a\\sin(x) \\, dx\\).\n\n2. **Constant Factor Rule**: The constant factor rule of integration allows us to factor out constants from the integral. Here, \\(-a\\) is a constant, so we can rewrite the integral as:\n   \\[\n   -a \\int \\sin(x) \\, dx\n   \\]\n\n3. **Integrate \\(\\sin(x)\\)**: The integral of \\(\\sin(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is \\(-\\cos(x)\\). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\int \\sin(x) \\, dx = -\\cos(x)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute Back**: Substitute the result of the integral back into the expression with the constant factor:\n   \\[\n   -a \\int \\sin(x) \\, dx = -a(-\\cos(x)) = a\\cos(x)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Add the Constant of Integration**: Since this is an indefinite integral, we must add a constant of integration, \\(C\\), to the result:\n   \\[\n   a\\cos(x) + C\n   \\]\n\nThus, the indefinite integral of \\(-a\\sin(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is:\n\n<<<a*cos(x) + C>>>"
