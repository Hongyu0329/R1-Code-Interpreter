    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ x**3 * exp(x) dx, we will use the method of integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nWe need to choose u and dv from the integrand x**3 * exp(x). A common strategy is to let u be the polynomial part and dv be the exponential part. This choice simplifies the problem as differentiating polynomials reduces their degree.\n\nStep 1: Choose u and dv\n- Let u = x**3, which implies that du = 3*x**2 dx.\n- Let dv = exp(x) dx, which implies that v = exp(x).\n\nStep 2: Apply the integration by parts formula\nUsing the formula ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du, we substitute our choices:\n\n∫ x**3 * exp(x) dx = x**3 * exp(x) - ∫ exp(x) * 3*x**2 dx\n\nStep 3: Simplify and repeat integration by parts\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral ∫ 3*x**2 * exp(x) dx. We apply integration by parts again:\n\n- Let u = 3*x**2, which implies that du = 6*x dx.\n- Let dv = exp(x) dx, which implies that v = exp(x).\n\nUsing the formula again:\n\n∫ 3*x**2 * exp(x) dx = 3*x**2 * exp(x) - ∫ exp(x) * 6*x dx\n\nStep 4: Simplify and repeat integration by parts\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral ∫ 6*x * exp(x) dx. We apply integration by parts again:\n\n- Let u = 6*x, which implies that du = 6 dx.\n- Let dv = exp(x) dx, which implies that v = exp(x).\n\nUsing the formula again:\n\n∫ 6*x * exp(x) dx = 6*x * exp(x) - ∫ exp(x) * 6 dx\n\nStep 5: Simplify the remaining integral\nThe remaining integral is ∫ 6 * exp(x) dx, which is straightforward:\n\n∫ 6 * exp(x) dx = 6 * exp(x)\n\nStep 6: Combine all parts\nNow, we combine all the parts from the integration by parts steps:\n\n∫ x**3 * exp(x) dx = x**3 * exp(x) - [3*x**2 * exp(x) - (6*x * exp(x) - 6 * exp(x))]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n= x**3 * exp(x) - 3*x**2 * exp(x) + 6*x * exp(x) - 6 * exp(x)\n\nStep 7: Add the constant of integration\nSince this is an indefinite integral, we add the constant of integration C:\n\n= x**3 * exp(x) - 3*x**2 * exp(x) + 6*x * exp(x) - 6 * exp(x) + C\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<x**3 * exp(x) - 3*x**2 * exp(x) + 6*x * exp(x) - 6 * exp(x) + C>>>"
