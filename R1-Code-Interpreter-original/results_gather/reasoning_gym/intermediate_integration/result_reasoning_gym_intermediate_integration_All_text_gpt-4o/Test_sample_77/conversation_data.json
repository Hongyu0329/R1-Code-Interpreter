    "To find the indefinite integral of the function ∫ asin(3*x) dx, we will use integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nFor the given integral, we need to choose u and dv. A common strategy is to let u be a function that simplifies when differentiated, and dv be a function that is easy to integrate.\n\nStep 1: Choose u and dv\n- Let u = asin(3*x). Then, differentiate u to find du:\n  du = a*cos(3*x) * 3 dx = 3*a*cos(3*x) dx\n\n- Let dv = dx. Then, integrate dv to find v:\n  v = x\n\nStep 2: Apply the integration by parts formula\nUsing the formula ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du, we substitute the values we found:\n∫ asin(3*x) dx = x*asin(3*x) - ∫ x * 3*a*cos(3*x) dx\n\nStep 3: Simplify the expression\n∫ asin(3*x) dx = x*asin(3*x) - 3*a ∫ x*cos(3*x) dx\n\nStep 4: Solve the remaining integral ∫ x*cos(3*x) dx using integration by parts again\n- Let u = x. Then, differentiate u to find du:\n  du = dx\n\n- Let dv = cos(3*x) dx. Then, integrate dv to find v:\n  v = (1/3)*sin(3*x)\n\nApply the integration by parts formula again:\n∫ x*cos(3*x) dx = x*(1/3)*sin(3*x) - ∫ (1/3)*sin(3*x) dx\n\nStep 5: Simplify and solve the remaining integral\n∫ x*cos(3*x) dx = (1/3)*x*sin(3*x) - (1/3)∫ sin(3*x) dx\n\nThe integral ∫ sin(3*x) dx is straightforward:\n∫ sin(3*x) dx = -(1/3)*cos(3*x)\n\nSubstitute back:\n∫ x*cos(3*x) dx = (1/3)*x*sin(3*x) + (1/9)*cos(3*x)\n\nStep 6: Substitute back into the original expression\n∫ asin(3*x) dx = x*asin(3*x) - 3*a*((1/3)*x*sin(3*x) + (1/9)*cos(3*x))\n\nStep 7: Simplify the expression\n∫ asin(3*x) dx = x*asin(3*x) - a*x*sin(3*x) - (a/3)*cos(3*x) + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<x*asin(3*x) - a*x*sin(3*x) - (a/3)*cos(3*x) + C>>>"
