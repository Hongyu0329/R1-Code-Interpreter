    "To find the indefinite integral ∫ -2*x**2*cos(3*x) dx, we will use integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nWe need to choose u and dv from the integrand -2*x**2*cos(3*x).\n\nStep 1: Choose u and dv\n- Let u = -2*x**2. Then, differentiate u to find du:\n  du = d(-2*x**2) = -4*x dx\n\n- Let dv = cos(3*x) dx. Then, integrate dv to find v:\n  v = ∫ cos(3*x) dx = (1/3)*sin(3*x)\n\nStep 2: Apply the integration by parts formula\nUsing the formula ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du, we substitute the values we found:\n\n∫ -2*x**2*cos(3*x) dx = (-2*x**2)*((1/3)*sin(3*x)) - ∫ ((1/3)*sin(3*x))*(-4*x) dx\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n= (-2/3)*x**2*sin(3*x) + (4/3)∫ x*sin(3*x) dx\n\nStep 3: Solve the remaining integral ∫ x*sin(3*x) dx using integration by parts again\n\nChoose new u and dv:\n- Let u = x. Then, differentiate u to find du:\n  du = dx\n\n- Let dv = sin(3*x) dx. Then, integrate dv to find v:\n  v = ∫ sin(3*x) dx = -(1/3)*cos(3*x)\n\nApply the integration by parts formula again:\n\n∫ x*sin(3*x) dx = x*(-(1/3)*cos(3*x)) - ∫ (-(1/3)*cos(3*x)) dx\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n= -(1/3)*x*cos(3*x) + (1/9)∫ cos(3*x) dx\n\nStep 4: Solve the integral ∫ cos(3*x) dx\n\nWe already found this integral earlier:\n\n∫ cos(3*x) dx = (1/3)*sin(3*x)\n\nSubstitute back:\n\n= -(1/3)*x*cos(3*x) + (1/9)*(1/3)*sin(3*x)\n\n= -(1/3)*x*cos(3*x) + (1/27)*sin(3*x)\n\nStep 5: Substitute back into the original expression\n\nSubstitute the result of ∫ x*sin(3*x) dx back into the expression from Step 2:\n\n= (-2/3)*x**2*sin(3*x) + (4/3)*(-(1/3)*x*cos(3*x) + (1/27)*sin(3*x))\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (-2/3)*x**2*sin(3*x) - (4/9)*x*cos(3*x) + (4/81)*sin(3*x)\n\nFinally, add the constant of integration C:\n\n<<<answer>>> (-2/3)*x**2*sin(3*x) - (4/9)*x*cos(3*x) + (4/81)*sin(3*x) + C"
