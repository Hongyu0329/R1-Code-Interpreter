    "To solve the integral ∫ 20*sqrt(-10*x - 6) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: The expression inside the square root is -10*x - 6. We can use a substitution to simplify the integral. Let u = -10*x - 6. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = -10, or du = -10*dx.\n\n2. **Solve for dx**: From the substitution, we have du = -10*dx, which implies dx = du / -10.\n\n3. **Substitute in the integral**: Replace -10*x - 6 with u and dx with du / -10 in the integral:\n   ∫ 20*sqrt(u) * (du / -10).\n\n4. **Simplify the integral**: The constant factors can be simplified:\n   ∫ 20*(-1/10)*sqrt(u) du = -2*∫ sqrt(u) du.\n\n5. **Integrate with respect to u**: The integral of sqrt(u) with respect to u is (2/3)*u**(3/2). Therefore:\n   -2*∫ sqrt(u) du = -2*(2/3)*u**(3/2) = -(4/3)*u**(3/2).\n\n6. **Substitute back for x**: Recall that u = -10*x - 6. Substitute back to get the antiderivative in terms of x:\n   -(4/3)*(-10*x - 6)**(3/2).\n\n7. **Add the constant of integration**: Since this is an indefinite integral, we add a constant of integration, C.\n\nThe final antiderivative is:\n<<<-(4/3)*(-10*x - 6)**(3/2) + C>>>."
