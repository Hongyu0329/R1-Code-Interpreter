    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ -2*(3*x - 7)**4 dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the function to integrate**: The function is -2*(3*x - 7)**4.\n\n2. **Use substitution method**: \n   - Let u = 3*x - 7. \n   - Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 3, or dx = du/3.\n\n3. **Substitute in the integral**:\n   - Replace (3*x - 7) with u, and dx with du/3.\n   - The integral becomes ∫ -2*u**4 * (du/3).\n\n4. **Simplify the integral**:\n   - Factor out the constants: -2/3 * ∫ u**4 du.\n\n5. **Integrate with respect to u**:\n   - The antiderivative of u**4 is (u**5)/5.\n   - Therefore, the integral becomes -2/3 * (u**5)/5 = -2/15 * u**5.\n\n6. **Substitute back the original variable**:\n   - Replace u with 3*x - 7 to get the antiderivative in terms of x.\n   - The antiderivative is -2/15 * (3*x - 7)**5.\n\n7. **Add the constant of integration**:\n   - The final antiderivative is -2/15 * (3*x - 7)**5 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n<<<-2/15 * (3*x - 7)**5 + C>>>"
