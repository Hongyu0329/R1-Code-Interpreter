    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -15*sqrt(5*x - 9) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Let u = 5*x - 9. \n   - Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 5, or du = 5*dx.\n   - Solving for dx gives dx = du/5.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**:\n   - Substitute u and dx into the integral: \n   - ∫ -15*sqrt(5*x - 9) dx becomes ∫ -15*sqrt(u) * (du/5).\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral**:\n   - Factor out constants from the integral:\n   - ∫ -15*sqrt(u) * (du/5) = -15/5 * ∫ sqrt(u) du = -3 * ∫ u**(1/2) du.\n\n4. **Integrate**:\n   - Use the power rule for integration: ∫ u**n du = (u**(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n ≠ -1.\n   - Here, n = 1/2, so the integral becomes:\n   - -3 * ∫ u**(1/2) du = -3 * [(u**(3/2))/(3/2)] + C.\n   - Simplify the expression: \n   - -3 * [(u**(3/2))/(3/2)] = -3 * (2/3) * u**(3/2) = -2 * u**(3/2).\n\n5. **Back-Substitute**:\n   - Replace u with the original expression in terms of x:\n   - u = 5*x - 9, so u**(3/2) = (5*x - 9)**(3/2).\n   - Therefore, the integral becomes: -2 * (5*x - 9)**(3/2) + C.\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The indefinite integral is: -2 * (5*x - 9)**(3/2) + C.\n\n<<<-2 * (5*x - 9)**(3/2) + C>>>"
