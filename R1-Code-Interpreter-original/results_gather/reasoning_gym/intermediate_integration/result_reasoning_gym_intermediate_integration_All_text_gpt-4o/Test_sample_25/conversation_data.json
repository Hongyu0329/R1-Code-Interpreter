    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -2*(4*x - 9)**3 dx, we will use the method of substitution. Let's go through the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: \n   Let u = 4*x - 9. This substitution simplifies the expression inside the integral.\n\n2. **Differentiate the substitution**: \n   Differentiate u with respect to x to find du/dx.\n   du/dx = 4.\n\n3. **Express dx in terms of du**: \n   Rearrange the derivative to express dx in terms of du.\n   dx = du/4.\n\n4. **Substitute in the integral**: \n   Replace (4*x - 9) with u and dx with du/4 in the integral.\n   The integral becomes: ∫ -2*u**3 * (du/4).\n\n5. **Simplify the integral**: \n   Factor out the constants from the integral.\n   ∫ -2*u**3 * (du/4) = -2/4 * ∫ u**3 du = -1/2 * ∫ u**3 du.\n\n6. **Integrate with respect to u**: \n   Use the power rule for integration, which states that ∫ u**n du = u**(n+1)/(n+1) + C, where n ≠ -1.\n   Here, n = 3, so ∫ u**3 du = u**4/4 + C.\n\n7. **Apply the integration result**: \n   Substitute the result of the integration back into the expression.\n   -1/2 * (u**4/4 + C) = -1/8 * u**4 + C.\n\n8. **Substitute back in terms of x**: \n   Replace u with the original expression 4*x - 9.\n   -1/8 * (4*x - 9)**4 + C.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of ∫ -2*(4*x - 9)**3 dx is:\n\n<<<-1/8 * (4*x - 9)**4 + C>>>"
