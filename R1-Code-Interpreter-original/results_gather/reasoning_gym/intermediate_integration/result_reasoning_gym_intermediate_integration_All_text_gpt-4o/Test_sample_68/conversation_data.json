    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 21*sqrt(7*x - 7) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Let u = 7*x - 7. \n   - Then, differentiate u with respect to x: du/dx = 7.\n   - This implies that du = 7*dx, or dx = du/7.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**:\n   - Substitute u and dx into the integral: \n   - ∫ 21*sqrt(7*x - 7) dx becomes ∫ 21*sqrt(u) * (du/7).\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral**:\n   - Factor out constants: \n   - ∫ 21*sqrt(u) * (du/7) = (21/7) * ∫ sqrt(u) du = 3 * ∫ u**(1/2) du.\n\n4. **Integrate**:\n   - Use the power rule for integration: ∫ u**n du = (u**(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n ≠ -1.\n   - Here, n = 1/2, so the integral becomes:\n   - 3 * ∫ u**(1/2) du = 3 * [(u**(1/2 + 1))/(1/2 + 1)] + C = 3 * [(u**(3/2))/(3/2)] + C.\n\n5. **Simplify the Result**:\n   - Simplify the expression: \n   - 3 * [(u**(3/2))/(3/2)] = 3 * (2/3) * u**(3/2) = 2 * u**(3/2).\n\n6. **Back-Substitute**:\n   - Replace u with the original expression in terms of x: \n   - u = 7*x - 7, so u**(3/2) = (7*x - 7)**(3/2).\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The indefinite integral is: 2 * (7*x - 7)**(3/2) + C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2 * (7*x - 7)**(3/2) + C>>>"
