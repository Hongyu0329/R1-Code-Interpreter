    "To solve the indefinite integral ∫ (16*x + 4)*exp(4*x**2 + 2*x + 10) dx, we will use the method of substitution. Let's go through the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the inner function for substitution**: \n   The expression inside the exponential function is 4*x**2 + 2*x + 10. Let's set this as our substitution variable:\n   Let u = 4*x**2 + 2*x + 10.\n\n2. **Differentiate u with respect to x**: \n   We need to find du/dx to perform the substitution. \n   - The derivative of 4*x**2 with respect to x is 8*x.\n   - The derivative of 2*x with respect to x is 2.\n   - The derivative of 10 with respect to x is 0.\n   Therefore, du/dx = 8*x + 2.\n\n3. **Express dx in terms of du**: \n   Rearrange the expression for du/dx to solve for dx:\n   du = (8*x + 2) dx\n   => dx = du / (8*x + 2).\n\n4. **Substitute in the integral**: \n   Replace (16*x + 4) and dx in the original integral with expressions in terms of u:\n   - Notice that 16*x + 4 can be rewritten as 2*(8*x + 2).\n   - Substitute dx with du / (8*x + 2).\n\n   The integral becomes:\n   ∫ 2*(8*x + 2)*exp(u) * (du / (8*x + 2)).\n\n5. **Simplify the integral**: \n   The (8*x + 2) terms cancel out:\n   ∫ 2*exp(u) du.\n\n6. **Integrate with respect to u**: \n   The integral of 2*exp(u) with respect to u is straightforward:\n   ∫ 2*exp(u) du = 2*exp(u) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n7. **Substitute back in terms of x**: \n   Recall that u = 4*x**2 + 2*x + 10. Substitute back to get the final answer in terms of x:\n   2*exp(4*x**2 + 2*x + 10) + C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2*exp(4*x**2 + 2*x + 10) + C>>>"
