    "To find the indefinite integral ∫ -2*x*cos(x) dx, we will use the method of integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nStep 1: Identify u and dv\n- Choose u = -2*x, which implies that du = -2 dx.\n- Choose dv = cos(x) dx, which implies that v = ∫ cos(x) dx = sin(x).\n\nStep 2: Apply the integration by parts formula\n- Substitute u, du, v, and dv into the integration by parts formula:\n  ∫ -2*x*cos(x) dx = (-2*x)*sin(x) - ∫ sin(x)*(-2) dx\n\nStep 3: Simplify the expression\n- The expression becomes: -2*x*sin(x) + 2*∫ sin(x) dx\n\nStep 4: Integrate ∫ sin(x) dx\n- The integral of sin(x) is -cos(x), so:\n  2*∫ sin(x) dx = 2*(-cos(x)) = -2*cos(x)\n\nStep 5: Combine the results\n- Substitute back into the expression:\n  -2*x*sin(x) - 2*cos(x) + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of ∫ -2*x*cos(x) dx is:\n\n<<<-2*x*sin(x) - 2*cos(x) + C>>>"
