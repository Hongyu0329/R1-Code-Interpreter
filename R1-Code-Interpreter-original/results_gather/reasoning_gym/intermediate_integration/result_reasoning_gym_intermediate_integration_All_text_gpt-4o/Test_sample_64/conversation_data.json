    "To find the indefinite integral ∫ 3*log(x**2) dx, we will proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Recognize the Function**: The integrand is 3*log(x**2). We can use the property of logarithms to simplify this expression. Recall that log(a**b) = b*log(a). Therefore, log(x**2) = 2*log(x).\n\n2. **Simplify the Integrand**: Substitute the simplified logarithmic expression into the integrand:\n   ∫ 3*log(x**2) dx = ∫ 3*(2*log(x)) dx = ∫ 6*log(x) dx.\n\n3. **Integration by Parts**: To integrate 6*log(x) dx, we use integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du. We choose:\n   - u = log(x)  ⇒  du = (1/x) dx\n   - dv = 6 dx  ⇒  v = 6*x\n\n4. **Apply Integration by Parts**: Substitute u, du, v, and dv into the integration by parts formula:\n   ∫ 6*log(x) dx = 6*x*log(x) - ∫ 6*x*(1/x) dx\n                  = 6*x*log(x) - ∫ 6 dx\n\n5. **Evaluate the Remaining Integral**: The remaining integral is ∫ 6 dx, which is straightforward:\n   ∫ 6 dx = 6*x + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n6. **Combine the Results**: Substitute back into the integration by parts result:\n   6*x*log(x) - 6*x + C\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of 3*log(x**2) with respect to x is:\n\n<<<6*x*log(x) - 6*x + C>>>"
