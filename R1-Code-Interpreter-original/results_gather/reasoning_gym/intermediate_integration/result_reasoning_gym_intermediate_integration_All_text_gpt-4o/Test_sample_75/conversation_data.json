    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ -15*sqrt(7 - 5*x) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: The integrand contains a square root of a linear function, which suggests a substitution. Let u = 7 - 5*x. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = -5. Therefore, dx = du / -5.\n\n2. **Substitute in the integral**: Replace 7 - 5*x with u and dx with du / -5 in the integral. The integral becomes:\n   ∫ -15*sqrt(u) * (du / -5).\n\n3. **Simplify the integral**: The constants can be factored out of the integral:\n   ∫ -15*sqrt(u) * (du / -5) = ∫ (15/5)*sqrt(u) du = 3*∫ sqrt(u) du.\n\n4. **Integrate with respect to u**: The integral of sqrt(u) with respect to u is:\n   ∫ u**(1/2) du = (2/3)*u**(3/2) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n5. **Multiply by the constant**: Multiply the result by the constant factor 3:\n   3*(2/3)*u**(3/2) = 2*u**(3/2).\n\n6. **Substitute back in terms of x**: Replace u with 7 - 5*x to express the antiderivative in terms of x:\n   2*(7 - 5*x)**(3/2) + C.\n\nTherefore, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n<<<2*(7 - 5*x)**(3/2) + C>>>"
