    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 12*sqrt(3 - 4*x) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Let u = 3 - 4*x. Then, differentiate both sides with respect to x to find du/dx.\n   - du/dx = -4, which implies that dx = du / -4.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**:\n   - Substitute u and dx into the integral: \n   - ∫ 12*sqrt(3 - 4*x) dx becomes ∫ 12*sqrt(u) * (du / -4).\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral**:\n   - Factor out constants from the integral: \n   - ∫ 12*sqrt(u) * (du / -4) = -3 * ∫ sqrt(u) du.\n\n4. **Integrate**:\n   - The integral of sqrt(u) with respect to u is (2/3)*u**(3/2).\n   - Therefore, -3 * ∫ sqrt(u) du = -3 * (2/3) * u**(3/2) = -2 * u**(3/2).\n\n5. **Back-Substitute**:\n   - Replace u with the original expression in terms of x: \n   - u = 3 - 4*x, so u**(3/2) = (3 - 4*x)**(3/2).\n\n6. **Final Expression**:\n   - The indefinite integral is -2 * (3 - 4*x)**(3/2) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-2 * (3 - 4*x)**(3/2) + C>>>"
