    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ -30*exp(10*x - 6) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the function to integrate**: The function given is -30*exp(10*x - 6).\n\n2. **Recognize the form of the function**: The function is of the form a*exp(b*x + c), where a = -30, b = 10, and c = -6.\n\n3. **Use the rule for integrating exponential functions**: The integral of exp(b*x + c) with respect to x is (1/b)*exp(b*x + c) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n4. **Apply the integration rule**: \n   - The integral of exp(10*x - 6) with respect to x is (1/10)*exp(10*x - 6) + C.\n   - Therefore, the integral of -30*exp(10*x - 6) with respect to x is -30 * (1/10) * exp(10*x - 6) + C.\n\n5. **Simplify the expression**: \n   - -30 * (1/10) = -3.\n   - Therefore, the antiderivative is -3*exp(10*x - 6) + C.\n\n6. **Include the constant of integration**: Always remember to add the constant of integration, C, when finding an indefinite integral.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<-3*exp(10*x - 6) + C>>>"
