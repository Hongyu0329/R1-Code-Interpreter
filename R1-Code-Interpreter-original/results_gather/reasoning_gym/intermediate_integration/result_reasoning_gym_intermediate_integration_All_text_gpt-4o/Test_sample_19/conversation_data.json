    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -12*sqrt(4*x - 7) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Let u = 4*x - 7. \n   - Then, differentiate both sides with respect to x: du/dx = 4, which implies du = 4*dx or dx = du/4.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**:\n   - Substitute u and dx into the integral: \n     ∫ -12*sqrt(4*x - 7) dx becomes ∫ -12*sqrt(u) * (du/4).\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral**:\n   - Factor out constants: \n     ∫ -12*sqrt(u) * (du/4) = ∫ (-12/4)*sqrt(u) du = ∫ -3*sqrt(u) du.\n\n4. **Integrate**:\n   - Recall that sqrt(u) = u**(1/2).\n   - The integral becomes ∫ -3*u**(1/2) du.\n   - Use the power rule for integration: ∫ u**n du = (u**(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n ≠ -1.\n   - Here, n = 1/2, so the integral becomes:\n     -3 * (u**(1/2 + 1))/(1/2 + 1) + C = -3 * (u**(3/2))/(3/2) + C.\n\n5. **Simplify the Result**:\n   - Simplify the expression: \n     -3 * (u**(3/2))/(3/2) = -3 * (2/3) * u**(3/2) = -2 * u**(3/2).\n\n6. **Back-Substitute**:\n   - Replace u with the original expression in terms of x: \n     u = 4*x - 7.\n   - Therefore, the integral becomes: \n     -2 * (4*x - 7)**(3/2) + C.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<-2*(4*x - 7)**(3/2) + C>>>"
