    "To find the indefinite integral of the function ∫ -2*x*exp(x) dx, we will use integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nFor the given integral, we need to choose u and dv such that the integration becomes simpler. Let's choose:\n\n- u = -2*x\n- dv = exp(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find du and v:\n\n1. Differentiate u to find du:\n   u = -2*x\n   du = -2 dx\n\n2. Integrate dv to find v:\n   dv = exp(x) dx\n   v = exp(x)\n\nNow, apply the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ -2*x*exp(x) dx = uv - ∫ v du\n\nSubstitute the values of u, v, and du:\n\n= (-2*x)*exp(x) - ∫ exp(x)*(-2) dx\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n= -2*x*exp(x) + 2*∫ exp(x) dx\n\nNow, integrate ∫ exp(x) dx:\n\n∫ exp(x) dx = exp(x)\n\nSubstitute back into the expression:\n\n= -2*x*exp(x) + 2*exp(x) + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of the function is:\n\n<<<-2*x*exp(x) + 2*exp(x) + C>>>"
