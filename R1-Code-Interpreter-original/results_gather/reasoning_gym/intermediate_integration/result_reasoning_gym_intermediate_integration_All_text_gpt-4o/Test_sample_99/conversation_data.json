    "To find the indefinite integral of the function \\(-a\\sin(2*x)\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the integral to be solved:**\n   The integral we need to solve is \\(\\int -a\\sin(2*x) \\, dx\\).\n\n2. **Use the basic integration rule for sine:**\n   The integral of \\(\\sin(k*x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is \\(-\\frac{1}{k}\\cos(k*x) + C\\), where \\(k\\) is a constant and \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n3. **Apply the integration rule:**\n   In our case, the function is \\(-a\\sin(2*x)\\). Here, \\(k = 2\\) and the constant factor outside the sine function is \\(-a\\).\n\n4. **Integrate the function:**\n   Using the rule, we integrate \\(-a\\sin(2*x)\\) as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\int -a\\sin(2*x) \\, dx = -a \\int \\sin(2*x) \\, dx\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = -a \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2*x)\\right) + C\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{a}{2}\\cos(2*x) + C\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the expression:**\n   The simplified form of the integral is \\(\\frac{a}{2}\\cos(2*x) + C\\).\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of \\(-a\\sin(2*x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{a}{2}\\cos(2*x) + C\\)>>>"
