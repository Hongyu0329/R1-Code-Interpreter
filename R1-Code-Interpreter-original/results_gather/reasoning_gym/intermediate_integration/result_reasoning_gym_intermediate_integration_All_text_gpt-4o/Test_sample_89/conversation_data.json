    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 2*(3*x + 10)**3 dx, we will use the method of substitution. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: \n   Let u = 3*x + 10. This substitution simplifies the expression inside the integral.\n\n2. **Differentiate u with respect to x**: \n   du/dx = 3, which implies that du = 3*dx or dx = du/3.\n\n3. **Substitute in the integral**: \n   Replace (3*x + 10) with u and dx with du/3 in the integral. The integral becomes:\n   ∫ 2*u**3 * (du/3).\n\n4. **Simplify the integral**: \n   Factor out the constants from the integral:\n   ∫ (2/3) * u**3 * du.\n\n5. **Integrate with respect to u**: \n   The integral of u**3 with respect to u is (u**4)/4. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n   (2/3) * (u**4)/4 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n6. **Simplify the expression**: \n   (2/3) * (u**4)/4 = (2*u**4)/(12) = (u**4)/6.\n\n7. **Substitute back in terms of x**: \n   Recall that u = 3*x + 10. Substitute back to get the expression in terms of x:\n   ((3*x + 10)**4)/6 + C.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of 2*(3*x + 10)**3 with respect to x is:\n\n<<<((3*x + 10)**4)/6 + C>>>"
