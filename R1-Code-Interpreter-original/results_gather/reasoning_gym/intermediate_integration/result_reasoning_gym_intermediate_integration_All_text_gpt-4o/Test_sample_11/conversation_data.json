    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -3*(8*x + 6)**3 dx, we will use the method of substitution. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: \n   Let u = 8*x + 6. This substitution simplifies the expression inside the integral.\n\n2. **Differentiate u with respect to x**: \n   du/dx = 8, which implies that du = 8*dx.\n\n3. **Solve for dx**: \n   From du = 8*dx, we can express dx in terms of du: dx = du/8.\n\n4. **Substitute u and dx into the integral**: \n   The integral becomes ∫ -3*(u)**3 * (du/8).\n\n5. **Simplify the integral**: \n   Factor out constants from the integral: \n   ∫ -3/8 * u**3 * du.\n\n6. **Integrate with respect to u**: \n   The integral of u**3 with respect to u is (u**4)/4. Therefore, \n   ∫ u**3 du = (u**4)/4.\n\n7. **Apply the constant factor**: \n   Multiply the result by the constant factor -3/8: \n   -3/8 * (u**4)/4 = -3/32 * u**4.\n\n8. **Substitute back in terms of x**: \n   Recall that u = 8*x + 6. Substitute back to get the expression in terms of x: \n   -3/32 * (8*x + 6)**4.\n\n9. **Add the constant of integration**: \n   Since this is an indefinite integral, add the constant of integration C.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-3/32 * (8*x + 6)**4 + C>>>."
