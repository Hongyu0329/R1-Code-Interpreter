    "To find the indefinite integral ∫ 5*sqrt(-5*x - 4) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Let u = -5*x - 4. \n   - Then, du/dx = -5, which implies that dx = du / -5.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**:\n   - Substitute u into the integral: ∫ 5*sqrt(u) * (du / -5).\n   - Simplify the expression: ∫ -sqrt(u) du.\n\n3. **Integrate**:\n   - The integral of -sqrt(u) with respect to u is -∫ u**(1/2) du.\n   - Use the power rule for integration: ∫ u**n du = (u**(n+1)) / (n+1) + C, where n ≠ -1.\n   - Here, n = 1/2, so the integral becomes: \n     - (u**(3/2)) / (3/2) = (2/3) * u**(3/2).\n\n4. **Apply the Constant and Simplify**:\n   - Multiply by the constant from the substitution: -1 * (2/3) * u**(3/2) = -(2/3) * u**(3/2).\n\n5. **Back-Substitute**:\n   - Replace u with the original expression: u = -5*x - 4.\n   - The expression becomes: -(2/3) * (-5*x - 4)**(3/2).\n\n6. **Add the Constant of Integration**:\n   - The indefinite integral includes a constant of integration, C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-(2/3) * (-5*x - 4)**(3/2) + C>>>"
