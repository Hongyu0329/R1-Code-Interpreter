    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -8*sqrt(8 - 4*x) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Let u = 8 - 4*x. Then, differentiate both sides with respect to x to find du/dx.\n   - du/dx = -4, which implies that dx = du / -4.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**:\n   - Substitute u and dx into the integral: \n   - ∫ -8*sqrt(8 - 4*x) dx becomes ∫ -8*sqrt(u) * (du / -4).\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral**:\n   - Simplify the expression: \n   - ∫ -8*sqrt(u) * (du / -4) = ∫ 2*sqrt(u) du.\n\n4. **Integrate**:\n   - The integral of 2*sqrt(u) with respect to u is:\n   - ∫ 2*u**(1/2) du = 2 * (2/3) * u**(3/2) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n   - This simplifies to (4/3) * u**(3/2) + C.\n\n5. **Back-Substitute**:\n   - Replace u with the original expression in terms of x:\n   - u = 8 - 4*x, so u**(3/2) = (8 - 4*x)**(3/2).\n\n6. **Final Expression**:\n   - Substitute back to get the final answer in terms of x:\n   - (4/3) * (8 - 4*x)**(3/2) + C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(4/3) * (8 - 4*x)**(3/2) + C>>>"
