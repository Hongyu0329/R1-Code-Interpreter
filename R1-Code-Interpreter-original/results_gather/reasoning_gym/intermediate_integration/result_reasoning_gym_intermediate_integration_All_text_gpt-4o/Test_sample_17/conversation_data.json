    "To find the indefinite integral of the function ∫ -(2*x + 6)**4 dx, we will use the method of substitution. Let's go through the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the substitution**: \n   We notice that the integrand is in the form of a power of a linear function. We can use substitution to simplify the integration process. Let u = 2*x + 6. \n\n2. **Differentiate the substitution**:\n   Differentiate u with respect to x to find du/dx:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{du}{dx} = 2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, du = 2*dx or dx = du/2.\n\n3. **Substitute in the integral**:\n   Replace (2*x + 6) with u and dx with du/2 in the integral:\n   \\[\n   \\int -(2*x + 6)**4 \\, dx = \\int -u**4 \\cdot \\frac{du}{2}\n   \\]\n   Simplify the integral:\n   \\[\n   = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int u**4 \\, du\n   \\]\n\n4. **Integrate with respect to u**:\n   The integral of u**4 with respect to u is:\n   \\[\n   \\int u**4 \\, du = \\frac{u**5}{5}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{u**5}{5} = -\\frac{1}{10} u**5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substitute back in terms of x**:\n   Recall that u = 2*x + 6. Substitute back to get the expression in terms of x:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{1}{10} (2*x + 6)**5\n   \\]\n\n6. **Add the constant of integration**:\n   Since this is an indefinite integral, we add a constant of integration, C:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{1}{10} (2*x + 6)**5 + C\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer to the indefinite integral is:\n\n<<<answer>>> -\\frac{1}{10} (2*x + 6)**5 + C"
