    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 3*x**2*sin(3*x) dx, we will use the method of integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nStep 1: Choose u and dv\n- Let u = 3*x**2. Then, differentiate u to find du:\n  du = d(3*x**2) = 6*x dx\n- Let dv = sin(3*x) dx. Then, integrate dv to find v:\n  v = ∫ sin(3*x) dx = -1/3 * cos(3*x)\n\nStep 2: Apply the integration by parts formula\n- Substitute u, du, v, and dv into the integration by parts formula:\n  ∫ 3*x**2*sin(3*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v du\n  = (3*x**2) * (-1/3 * cos(3*x)) - ∫ (-1/3 * cos(3*x)) * (6*x) dx\n\nStep 3: Simplify the expression\n- Simplify the first term:\n  = -x**2 * cos(3*x)\n- Simplify the integral:\n  = ∫ 2*x * cos(3*x) dx\n\nStep 4: Apply integration by parts again to ∫ 2*x * cos(3*x) dx\n- Let u = 2*x. Then, differentiate u to find du:\n  du = 2 dx\n- Let dv = cos(3*x) dx. Then, integrate dv to find v:\n  v = ∫ cos(3*x) dx = 1/3 * sin(3*x)\n\nStep 5: Apply the integration by parts formula again\n- Substitute u, du, v, and dv into the integration by parts formula:\n  ∫ 2*x * cos(3*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v du\n  = (2*x) * (1/3 * sin(3*x)) - ∫ (1/3 * sin(3*x)) * 2 dx\n\nStep 6: Simplify the expression\n- Simplify the first term:\n  = 2/3 * x * sin(3*x)\n- Simplify the integral:\n  = -2/9 * cos(3*x)\n\nStep 7: Combine all parts\n- Substitute back into the original expression:\n  ∫ 3*x**2*sin(3*x) dx = -x**2 * cos(3*x) + 2/3 * x * sin(3*x) + 2/9 * cos(3*x) + C\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-x**2 * cos(3*x) + 2/3 * x * sin(3*x) + 2/9 * cos(3*x) + C>>>"
