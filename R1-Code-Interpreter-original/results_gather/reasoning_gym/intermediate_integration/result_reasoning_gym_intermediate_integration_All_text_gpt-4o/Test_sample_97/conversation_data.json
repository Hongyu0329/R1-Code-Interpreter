    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ 3*x*cos(2*x) dx, we will use integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nStep 1: Identify u and dv\n- Let u = 3*x. Then, the derivative du = 3 dx.\n- Let dv = cos(2*x) dx. Then, the antiderivative v = (1/2)*sin(2*x).\n\nStep 2: Apply the integration by parts formula\n- Substitute u, du, v, and dv into the integration by parts formula:\n  ∫ 3*x*cos(2*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v du\n  = (3*x)*(1/2)*sin(2*x) - ∫ (1/2)*sin(2*x) * 3 dx\n\nStep 3: Simplify the expression\n- The first term is (3/2)*x*sin(2*x).\n- The second term is - (3/2) ∫ sin(2*x) dx.\n\nStep 4: Integrate the remaining integral\n- The integral ∫ sin(2*x) dx can be solved by recognizing that the antiderivative of sin(2*x) is - (1/2)*cos(2*x).\n- Therefore, ∫ sin(2*x) dx = - (1/2)*cos(2*x).\n\nStep 5: Substitute back and simplify\n- Substitute the result of the integral back into the expression:\n  = (3/2)*x*sin(2*x) - (3/2)*(- (1/2)*cos(2*x))\n  = (3/2)*x*sin(2*x) + (3/4)*cos(2*x)\n\nStep 6: Add the constant of integration\n- Since this is an indefinite integral, we add a constant of integration, C.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<(3/2)*x*sin(2*x) + (3/4)*cos(2*x) + C>>>"
