    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ 4*sqrt(4*x + 8) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Let u = 4*x + 8. \n   - Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 4. \n   - This implies that dx = du/4.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**:\n   - Substitute u into the integral: ∫ 4*sqrt(u) * (du/4).\n   - Simplify the expression: ∫ sqrt(u) du.\n\n3. **Integrate**:\n   - The integral of sqrt(u) with respect to u is (2/3)*u**(3/2) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n4. **Back-Substitute**:\n   - Replace u with the original expression in terms of x: u = 4*x + 8.\n   - Therefore, the antiderivative becomes (2/3)*(4*x + 8)**(3/2) + C.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The antiderivative of the given function is (2/3)*(4*x + 8)**(3/2) + C.\n\n<<<(2/3)*(4*x + 8)**(3/2) + C>>>"
