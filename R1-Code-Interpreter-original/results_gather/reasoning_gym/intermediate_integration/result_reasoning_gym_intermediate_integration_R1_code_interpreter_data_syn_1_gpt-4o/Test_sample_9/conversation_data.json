    "To solve the indefinite integral ∫ 20*sin(10*x + 9)**3*cos(10*x + 9) dx, we can use a substitution method. \n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Let \\( u = 10*x + 9 \\). \n   - Then, \\( du = 10*dx \\) or \\( dx = du/10 \\).\n\n2. **Rewriting the Integral**:\n   - Substitute \\( u \\) into the integral: \n   - The integral becomes \\( ∫ 20*sin(u)**3*cos(u) * (du/10) \\).\n\n3. **Simplifying the Integral**:\n   - Simplify the constant factor: \n   - \\( ∫ 2*sin(u)**3*cos(u) \\, du \\).\n\n4. **Using Trigonometric Identity**:\n   - Recognize that \\( sin(u)**3*cos(u) \\) can be integrated using the identity for powers of sine and cosine.\n   - Use the identity: \\( sin^n(x)*cos(x) \\) can be integrated by substitution.\n\n5. **Integration**:\n   - The integral \\( ∫ sin(u)**3*cos(u) \\, du \\) can be solved by recognizing it as a form suitable for substitution.\n   - Let \\( v = sin(u) \\), then \\( dv = cos(u) \\, du \\).\n   - The integral becomes \\( ∫ v^3 \\, dv \\).\n\n6. **Solving the Integral**:\n   - Integrate \\( v^3 \\): \n   - \\( ∫ v^3 \\, dv = (v^4)/4 + C \\).\n\n7. **Back Substitution**:\n   - Substitute back \\( v = sin(u) \\) and \\( u = 10*x + 9 \\).\n   - The integral becomes \\( (sin(10*x + 9)**4)/4 + C \\).\n\n8. **Final Expression**:\n   - Multiply by the constant factor from the substitution: \n   - \\( 2 * (sin(10*x + 9)**4)/4 + C = (sin(10*x + 9)**4)/2 + C \\).\n\nNow, let's verify this by computing the integral using Python to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, sin, cos\n\n# Define the variable and function\nx = symbols('x')\nu = 10*x + 9\nintegrand = 20*sin(u)**3*cos(u)\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral = integrate(integrand, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the integration result.",
