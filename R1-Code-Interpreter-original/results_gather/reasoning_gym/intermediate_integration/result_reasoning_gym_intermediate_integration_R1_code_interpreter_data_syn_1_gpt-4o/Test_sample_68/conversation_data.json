    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 21*sqrt(7*x - 7) dx, we can use a substitution method to simplify the integration process.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let \\( u = 7*x - 7 \\). Then, the derivative of \\( u \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( du/dx = 7 \\), or \\( du = 7*dx \\). Therefore, \\( dx = du/7 \\).\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**: Substitute \\( u \\) and \\( dx \\) into the integral:\n   \\[\n   \\int 21*\\sqrt{7*x - 7} \\, dx = \\int 21*\\sqrt{u} \\, \\frac{du}{7}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral**: \n   \\[\n   \\int 21*\\sqrt{u} \\, \\frac{du}{7} = 3*\\int \\sqrt{u} \\, du\n   \\]\n\n4. **Integrate**: The integral of \\( \\sqrt{u} \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{3}*u^{3/2} \\). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   3*\\int \\sqrt{u} \\, du = 3*\\left(\\frac{2}{3}*u^{3/2}\\right) = 2*u^{3/2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Back-substitute**: Replace \\( u \\) with \\( 7*x - 7 \\):\n   \\[\n   2*(7*x - 7)^{3/2}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Add the Constant of Integration**: \n   \\[\n   2*(7*x - 7)^{3/2} + C\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python to ensure the integration is correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, sqrt\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = 21*sqrt(7*x - 7)\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral_result = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the integration result.",
    "The code output confirms that the integration was performed correctly. The indefinite integral of the function \\( 21*\\sqrt{7*x - 7} \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is indeed \\( 2*(7*x - 7)^{3/2} \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the indefinite integral is:\n\n<<<2*(7*x - 7)^{3/2} + C>>>"
