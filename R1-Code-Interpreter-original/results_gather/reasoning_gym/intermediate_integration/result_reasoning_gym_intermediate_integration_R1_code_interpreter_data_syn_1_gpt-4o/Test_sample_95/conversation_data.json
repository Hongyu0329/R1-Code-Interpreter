    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\( \\int 2*(x - 1)^2 \\, dx \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand the expression**: First, expand the expression \\( (x - 1)^2 \\).\n   \\[\n   (x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2*x + 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply by 2**: Multiply the expanded expression by 2.\n   \\[\n   2*(x^2 - 2*x + 1) = 2*x^2 - 4*x + 2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Integrate term by term**: Integrate each term separately.\n   - The antiderivative of \\( 2*x^2 \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{3}*x^3 \\).\n   - The antiderivative of \\( -4*x \\) is \\( -2*x^2 \\).\n   - The antiderivative of \\( 2 \\) is \\( 2*x \\).\n\n4. **Combine the results**: Combine the antiderivatives and add the constant of integration \\( C \\).\n   \\[\n   \\int 2*(x - 1)^2 \\, dx = \\frac{2}{3}*x^3 - 2*x^2 + 2*x + C\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the function to integrate\nfunction = 2 * (x - 1)**2\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the antiderivative calculation.",
