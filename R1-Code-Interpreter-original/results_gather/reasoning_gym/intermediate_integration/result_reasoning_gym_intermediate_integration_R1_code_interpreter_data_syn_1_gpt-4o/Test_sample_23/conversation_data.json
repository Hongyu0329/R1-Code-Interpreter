    "To solve the indefinite integral ∫ -(3*x + 5)**4 dx, we can use the method of substitution. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let u = 3*x + 5. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 3, or du = 3*dx. Therefore, dx = du/3.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**: Substitute u and dx into the integral:\n   ∫ -(3*x + 5)**4 dx = ∫ -u**4 * (du/3).\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral**: This becomes:\n   ∫ -(1/3) * u**4 du = -(1/3) * ∫ u**4 du.\n\n4. **Integrate**: The integral of u**4 with respect to u is (u**5)/5. Therefore:\n   -(1/3) * ∫ u**4 du = -(1/3) * (u**5)/5 = -(1/15) * u**5.\n\n5. **Back-Substitute**: Replace u with 3*x + 5:\n   -(1/15) * (3*x + 5)**5.\n\n6. **Add the Constant of Integration**: Since this is an indefinite integral, we add a constant C.\n\nThe final expression for the indefinite integral is:\n-(1/15) * (3*x + 5)**5 + C.\n\nLet's verify this by computing the integral using Python to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = -(3*x + 5)**4\n\n# Compute the indefinite integral\nintegral = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code output indicates that the integration was performed directly without substitution, resulting in a polynomial expression. However, the manual substitution method I described earlier should yield the correct result. Let's re-evaluate the steps and ensure the substitution method is correctly applied.\n\nThe correct indefinite integral using substitution should be:\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let \\( u = 3x + 5 \\), then \\( du = 3 \\, dx \\) or \\( dx = \\frac{du}{3} \\).\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**: \n   \\[\n   \\int -(3x + 5)^4 \\, dx = \\int -u^4 \\cdot \\frac{du}{3} = -\\frac{1}{3} \\int u^4 \\, du\n   \\]\n\n3. **Integrate**:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{1}{3} \\int u^4 \\, du = -\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{u^5}{5} = -\\frac{1}{15} u^5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Back-Substitute**:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{1}{15} (3x + 5)^5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Add the Constant of Integration**:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{1}{15} (3x + 5)^5 + C\n   \\]\n\nThe manual calculation and substitution method should yield the expression \\(-\\frac{1}{15} (3x + 5)^5 + C\\).\n\nThe discrepancy between the code output and the manual calculation is due to the direct integration approach used by the symbolic computation library, which expands the polynomial before integrating. However, both methods are valid and should yield equivalent results when simplified.\n\nThe final answer using the substitution method is:\n<<<-1/15 * (3*x + 5)**5 + C>>>"
