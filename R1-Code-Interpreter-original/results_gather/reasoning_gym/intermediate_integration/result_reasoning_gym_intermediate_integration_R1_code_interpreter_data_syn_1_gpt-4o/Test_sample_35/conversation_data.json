    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -2*(8*x - 7)**4 dx, we can use the method of substitution. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let u = 8*x - 7. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 8, or du = 8*dx. This implies that dx = du/8.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**: Substitute u and dx in the integral:\n   ∫ -2*(8*x - 7)**4 dx = ∫ -2*u**4 * (du/8).\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral**: \n   - Factor out the constants: -2/8 = -1/4.\n   - The integral becomes: ∫ -1/4 * u**4 du.\n\n4. **Integrate**: \n   - The integral of u**4 with respect to u is (u**5)/5.\n   - Therefore, ∫ u**4 du = (u**5)/5.\n\n5. **Combine the Constants**: \n   - Multiply the result by -1/4: -1/4 * (u**5)/5 = -1/20 * u**5.\n\n6. **Back-Substitute**: Replace u with 8*x - 7:\n   - The result is -1/20 * (8*x - 7)**5 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = -2 * (8*x - 7)**4\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral_result = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the integration result.",
    "The code output provides the expanded form of the integral, which is equivalent to the expression we derived. Let's compare the expanded form with our derived result:\n\n1. **Derived Result**: \n   - We found: \\(-\\frac{1}{20} \\cdot (8x - 7)^5 + C\\).\n\n2. **Expanded Form**:\n   - The code output: \\(-\\frac{8192}{5}x^5 + 7168x^4 - 12544x^3 + 10976x^2 - 4802x\\).\n\nTo verify, let's expand \\(-\\frac{1}{20} \\cdot (8x - 7)^5\\) manually:\n\n- \\((8x - 7)^5\\) is expanded using the binomial theorem, and then each term is multiplied by \\(-\\frac{1}{20}\\).\n\nThe expanded form from the code matches the expanded form of our derived result, confirming the correctness of the integration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in its original form is:\n\n<<<-1/20 * (8*x - 7)**5 + C>>>"
