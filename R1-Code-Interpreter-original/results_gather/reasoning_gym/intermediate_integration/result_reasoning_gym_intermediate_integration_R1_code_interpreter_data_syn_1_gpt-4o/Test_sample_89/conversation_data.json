    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 2*(3*x + 10)**3 dx, we can use the method of substitution. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let u = 3*x + 10. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 3, or du = 3*dx. This implies that dx = du/3.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**: Substitute u and dx into the integral:\n   ∫ 2*(3*x + 10)**3 dx = ∫ 2*u**3 * (du/3).\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral**: \n   ∫ 2*u**3 * (du/3) = (2/3) * ∫ u**3 du.\n\n4. **Integrate**: The integral of u**3 with respect to u is (u**4)/4. Therefore:\n   (2/3) * ∫ u**3 du = (2/3) * (u**4)/4 = (1/6) * u**4.\n\n5. **Back-Substitute**: Replace u with the original expression in terms of x:\n   (1/6) * (3*x + 10)**4.\n\n6. **Add the Constant of Integration**: Since this is an indefinite integral, we add a constant C.\n\nNow, let's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = 2 * (3*x + 10)**3\n\n# Compute the indefinite integral\nintegral = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the result of the indefinite integral.",
    "The code output provides the expanded form of the indefinite integral. However, we need to express it in the form derived from our substitution method. Let's compare the result from the code with our manual calculation:\n\n1. **Manual Calculation**: \n   - We found the integral to be (1/6) * (3*x + 10)**4 + C.\n\n2. **Code Output**: \n   - The code output is 27*x**4/2 + 180*x**3 + 900*x**2 + 2000*x.\n\nTo verify, let's expand (3*x + 10)**4 and compare it with the code output:\n\n- (3*x + 10)**4 = (3*x + 10)*(3*x + 10)*(3*x + 10)*(3*x + 10).\n\nLet's expand this expression to see if it matches the code output:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import expand\n\n# Define the expression\nu = 3*x + 10\n\n# Expand the expression (3*x + 10)**4\nexpanded_expression = expand(u**4)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nThis will help us verify if the expanded form matches the code output. Let's execute this code.",
    "It seems there was an error because the variable `x` was not defined in the second code block. Let's correct this by ensuring that `x` is defined before using it in the expression. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the expression\nu = 3*x + 10\n\n# Expand the expression (3*x + 10)**4\nexpanded_expression = expand(u**4)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nLet's execute this corrected code to verify the expanded form of \\((3*x + 10)^4\\).",
    "The expanded form of \\((3*x + 10)^4\\) is \\(81*x^4 + 1080*x^3 + 5400*x^2 + 12000*x + 10000\\).\n\nNow, let's compare this with the code output from the integral:\n\n1. **Expanded Form**: \n   - \\((3*x + 10)^4 = 81*x^4 + 1080*x^3 + 5400*x^2 + 12000*x + 10000\\).\n\n2. **Code Output for Integral**: \n   - \\(27*x^4/2 + 180*x^3 + 900*x^2 + 2000*x\\).\n\nTo match the code output with the expanded form, we need to multiply the expanded form by \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) as derived from our manual calculation:\n\n- \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times (81*x^4 + 1080*x^3 + 5400*x^2 + 12000*x + 10000)\\).\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times 81*x^4 = 13.5*x^4\\).\n- \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times 1080*x^3 = 180*x^3\\).\n- \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times 5400*x^2 = 900*x^2\\).\n- \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times 12000*x = 2000*x\\).\n- \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times 10000 = 1666.67\\).\n\nThe code output matches the terms except for the constant term, which is not shown in the code output because it represents the indefinite integral without the constant of integration.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral is:\n\n<<<(1/6) * (3*x + 10)**4 + C>>>"
