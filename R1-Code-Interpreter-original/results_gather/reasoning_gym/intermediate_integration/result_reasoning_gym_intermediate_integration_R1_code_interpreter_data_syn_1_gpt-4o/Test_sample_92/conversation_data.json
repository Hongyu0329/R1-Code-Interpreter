    "To solve the integral ∫ -2*x**3*sin(x) dx, we can use the method of integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nWe need to choose u and dv from the integrand -2*x**3*sin(x). A good choice is:\n\n- Let u = -2*x**3, which implies that du = -6*x**2 dx.\n- Let dv = sin(x) dx, which implies that v = -cos(x).\n\nNow, applying the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ -2*x**3*sin(x) dx = uv - ∫ v du\n\nSubstituting the values of u, v, du, and dv:\n\n= (-2*x**3)*(-cos(x)) - ∫ (-cos(x))*(-6*x**2) dx\n\n= 2*x**3*cos(x) - ∫ 6*x**2*cos(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to solve the integral ∫ 6*x**2*cos(x) dx. We will apply integration by parts again:\n\n- Let u = 6*x**2, which implies that du = 12*x dx.\n- Let dv = cos(x) dx, which implies that v = sin(x).\n\nApplying the integration by parts formula again:\n\n∫ 6*x**2*cos(x) dx = uv - ∫ v du\n\n= (6*x**2)*sin(x) - ∫ sin(x)*(12*x) dx\n\n= 6*x**2*sin(x) - ∫ 12*x*sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to solve the integral ∫ 12*x*sin(x) dx. We will apply integration by parts one more time:\n\n- Let u = 12*x, which implies that du = 12 dx.\n- Let dv = sin(x) dx, which implies that v = -cos(x).\n\nApplying the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ 12*x*sin(x) dx = uv - ∫ v du\n\n= (12*x)*(-cos(x)) - ∫ (-cos(x))*(12) dx\n\n= -12*x*cos(x) + ∫ 12*cos(x) dx\n\n= -12*x*cos(x) + 12*sin(x)\n\nNow, substituting back into the previous expressions:\n\n∫ 6*x**2*cos(x) dx = 6*x**2*sin(x) - (-12*x*cos(x) + 12*sin(x))\n\n= 6*x**2*sin(x) + 12*x*cos(x) - 12*sin(x)\n\nFinally, substituting back into the original expression:\n\n∫ -2*x**3*sin(x) dx = 2*x**3*cos(x) - (6*x**2*sin(x) + 12*x*cos(x) - 12*sin(x))\n\n= 2*x**3*cos(x) - 6*x**2*sin(x) - 12*x*cos(x) + 12*sin(x) + C\n\nLet's verify this result using Python to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, sin, cos\n\nx = symbols('x')\nintegrand = -2*x**3*sin(x)\nantiderivative = integrate(integrand, x)\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the correctness of the antiderivative.",
    "The code output confirms that the antiderivative of the given integral is correct. The expression matches the result obtained through manual calculation.\n\nTherefore, the antiderivative of ∫ -2*x**3*sin(x) dx is:\n\n<<<2*x**3*cos(x) - 6*x**2*sin(x) - 12*x*cos(x) + 12*sin(x) + C>>>"
