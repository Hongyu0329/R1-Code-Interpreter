    "To solve the integral ∫ -3*asin(2*x) dx, we need to find the antiderivative of the function -3*asin(2*x) with respect to x.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Function**: The function to integrate is -3*asin(2*x). Here, asin(2*x) is the inverse sine function, also known as arcsin.\n\n2. **Integration by Parts**: The integral involves an inverse trigonometric function, which suggests that integration by parts might be a suitable method. The formula for integration by parts is:\n   \\[\n   \\int u \\, dv = uv - \\int v \\, du\n   \\]\n   We need to choose \\( u \\) and \\( dv \\) appropriately.\n\n3. **Choose \\( u \\) and \\( dv \\)**:\n   - Let \\( u = \\text{asin}(2*x) \\), then \\( du = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{1-(2*x)^2}} \\, dx \\).\n   - Let \\( dv = -3 \\, dx \\), then \\( v = -3x \\).\n\n4. **Apply Integration by Parts**:\n   \\[\n   \\int -3 \\cdot \\text{asin}(2*x) \\, dx = -3x \\cdot \\text{asin}(2*x) - \\int -3x \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{1-(2*x)^2}} \\, dx\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the Remaining Integral**:\n   The remaining integral is:\n   \\[\n   \\int \\frac{6x}{\\sqrt{1-(2*x)^2}} \\, dx\n   \\]\n   This integral can be solved using a substitution method. Let \\( t = 2x \\), then \\( dt = 2 \\, dx \\) or \\( dx = \\frac{dt}{2} \\).\n\n6. **Substitute and Solve**:\n   \\[\n   \\int \\frac{6x}{\\sqrt{1-(2*x)^2}} \\, dx = \\int \\frac{3t}{2\\sqrt{1-t^2}} \\cdot \\frac{dt}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{3}{4} \\int \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}} \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n7. **Evaluate the Integral**:\n   The integral \\(\\int \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}} \\, dt\\) can be solved using a trigonometric substitution or recognizing it as a standard form.\n\nLet's compute the integral using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, asin, sqrt\n\n# Define the variable and function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = -3 * asin(2 * x)\n\n# Compute the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the antiderivative of the given function.",
    "The code execution has provided the antiderivative of the function \\(-3 \\cdot \\text{asin}(2x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\). The result is:\n\n\\[\n-3x \\cdot \\text{asin}(2x) - \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{1 - 4x^2} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n<<<-3*x*asin(2*x) - 3*sqrt(1 - 4*x**2)/2 + C>>>"
