    "To find the indefinite integral of the function ∫ asin(x) dx, we can use integration by parts. Integration by parts is a technique that is based on the product rule for differentiation and is given by the formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nFor the integral ∫ asin(x) dx, we can choose:\n- u = asin(x), which implies that du = acos(x) dx\n- dv = dx, which implies that v = x\n\nNow, applying the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ asin(x) dx = x * asin(x) - ∫ x * acos(x) dx\n\nThe remaining integral ∫ x * acos(x) dx can be solved using integration by parts again. Let's choose:\n- u = x, which implies that du = dx\n- dv = acos(x) dx, which implies that v = asin(x) + C\n\nApplying integration by parts again:\n\n∫ x * acos(x) dx = x * asin(x) - ∫ asin(x) dx\n\nNow, we have:\n\n∫ asin(x) dx = x * asin(x) - (x * asin(x) - ∫ asin(x) dx)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n∫ asin(x) dx = x * asin(x) - x * asin(x) + ∫ asin(x) dx\n\nThis doesn't seem to simplify correctly, so let's try a different approach using substitution.\n\nLet's use the substitution method:\nLet t = asin(x), then x = sin(t) and dx = cos(t) dt.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\n∫ t * cos(t) dt\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts on this integral:\n\nChoose:\n- u = t, which implies that du = dt\n- dv = cos(t) dt, which implies that v = sin(t)\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\n∫ t * cos(t) dt = t * sin(t) - ∫ sin(t) dt\n\nThe integral of sin(t) is -cos(t), so:\n\n∫ t * cos(t) dt = t * sin(t) + cos(t) + C\n\nSubstitute back t = asin(x):\n\n∫ asin(x) dx = asin(x) * sin(asin(x)) + cos(asin(x)) + C\n\nNow, let's compute the final expression using Python to ensure correctness.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, asin\n\nx = symbols('x')\nintegral = integrate(asin(x), x)\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code output provides the correct indefinite integral of the function ∫ asin(x) dx. The result is:\n\n∫ asin(x) dx = x * asin(x) + sqrt(1 - x**2) + C\n\nThis result is consistent with the integration by parts and substitution methods, where the term sqrt(1 - x**2) arises from the integration process.\n\n<<<x * asin(x) + sqrt(1 - x**2) + C>>>"
