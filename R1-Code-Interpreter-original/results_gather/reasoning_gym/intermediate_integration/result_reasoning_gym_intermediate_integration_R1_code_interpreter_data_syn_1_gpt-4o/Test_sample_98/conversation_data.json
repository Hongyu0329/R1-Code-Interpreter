    "To solve the indefinite integral ∫ -3*x**3*cos(2*x) dx, we can use the method of integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nWe need to choose u and dv from the integrand -3*x**3*cos(2*x). A good choice is:\n\n- Let u = -3*x**3, which implies that du = -9*x**2 dx.\n- Let dv = cos(2*x) dx, which implies that v = (1/2)*sin(2*x) (since the integral of cos(2*x) is (1/2)*sin(2*x)).\n\nNow, applying the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ -3*x**3*cos(2*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v du\n\nSubstituting the values of u, v, and du:\n\n= (-3*x**3) * ((1/2)*sin(2*x)) - ∫ ((1/2)*sin(2*x)) * (-9*x**2) dx\n\n= (-3/2)*x**3*sin(2*x) + (9/2)∫ x**2*sin(2*x) dx\n\nNow, we need to solve the integral ∫ x**2*sin(2*x) dx using integration by parts again. Let's choose:\n\n- Let u = x**2, which implies that du = 2*x dx.\n- Let dv = sin(2*x) dx, which implies that v = -(1/2)*cos(2*x) (since the integral of sin(2*x) is -(1/2)*cos(2*x)).\n\nApplying the integration by parts formula again:\n\n∫ x**2*sin(2*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v du\n\nSubstituting the values of u, v, and du:\n\n= (x**2) * (-(1/2)*cos(2*x)) - ∫ (-(1/2)*cos(2*x)) * (2*x) dx\n\n= -(1/2)*x**2*cos(2*x) + ∫ x*cos(2*x) dx\n\nNow, we need to solve the integral ∫ x*cos(2*x) dx using integration by parts one more time. Let's choose:\n\n- Let u = x, which implies that du = dx.\n- Let dv = cos(2*x) dx, which implies that v = (1/2)*sin(2*x).\n\nApplying the integration by parts formula again:\n\n∫ x*cos(2*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v du\n\nSubstituting the values of u, v, and du:\n\n= (x) * ((1/2)*sin(2*x)) - ∫ ((1/2)*sin(2*x)) * (1) dx\n\n= (1/2)*x*sin(2*x) - (1/2)∫ sin(2*x) dx\n\nThe integral ∫ sin(2*x) dx is -(1/2)*cos(2*x), so:\n\n= (1/2)*x*sin(2*x) + (1/4)*cos(2*x)\n\nNow, we can substitute back to find the original integral:\n\n∫ -3*x**3*cos(2*x) dx = (-3/2)*x**3*sin(2*x) + (9/2)*(-(1/2)*x**2*cos(2*x) + (1/2)*x*sin(2*x) + (1/4)*cos(2*x))\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n\n= (-3/2)*x**3*sin(2*x) - (9/4)*x**2*cos(2*x) + (9/4)*x*sin(2*x) + (9/8)*cos(2*x) + C\n\nLet's verify and simplify this using Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, cos, sin\n\nx = symbols('x')\nintegral = integrate(-3*x**3*cos(2*x), x)\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code output matches the manually derived expression for the indefinite integral. Therefore, the final answer for the indefinite integral ∫ -3*x**3*cos(2*x) dx is:\n\n<<<-3*x**3*sin(2*x)/2 - 9*x**2*cos(2*x)/4 + 9*x*sin(2*x)/4 + 9*cos(2*x)/8 + C>>>"
