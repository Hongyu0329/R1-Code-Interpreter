    "To find the indefinite integral of the function ∫ (3*x + 5)**3 dx, we can use the method of substitution. \n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Let u = 3*x + 5. \n   - Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 3, or du = 3*dx. \n   - Therefore, dx = du/3.\n\n2. **Substitute in the integral**:\n   - The integral becomes ∫ u**3 * (1/3) du = (1/3) ∫ u**3 du.\n\n3. **Integrate**:\n   - The integral of u**3 with respect to u is (u**4)/4.\n   - Therefore, (1/3) ∫ u**3 du = (1/3) * (u**4)/4 = (1/12) * u**4.\n\n4. **Back-substitute**:\n   - Replace u with 3*x + 5 to get the expression in terms of x.\n   - The result is (1/12) * (3*x + 5)**4 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = (3*x + 5)**3\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the integration result.",
    "The code output provides the expanded form of the integral, which is equivalent to the expression we derived. Let's compare the two:\n\n1. **Expanded Form**: \n   - \\( \\frac{27}{4}x^4 + 45x^3 + \\frac{225}{2}x^2 + 125x \\)\n\n2. **Factored Form**:\n   - \\( \\frac{1}{12} (3x + 5)^4 \\)\n\nBoth forms represent the same integral, but the expanded form is the result of multiplying out the polynomial. The constant of integration \\( C \\) is omitted in the code output but should be included in the final answer.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of \\( \\int (3x + 5)^3 \\, dx \\) is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{1}{12} (3x + 5)^4 + C\\)>>>"
