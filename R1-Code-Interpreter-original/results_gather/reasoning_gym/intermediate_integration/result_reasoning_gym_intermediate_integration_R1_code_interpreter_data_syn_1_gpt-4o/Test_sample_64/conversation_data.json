    "To solve the indefinite integral ∫ 3*log(x**2) dx, we need to apply integration techniques. The function involves a logarithm, so we can use integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nLet's choose:\n- \\( u = \\log(x^2) \\) which implies \\( du = \\frac{2}{x} dx \\)\n- \\( dv = 3 dx \\) which implies \\( v = 3x \\)\n\nNow, applying the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ 3*log(x**2) dx = 3x*log(x**2) - ∫ 3x * \\(\\frac{2}{x}\\) dx\n\nSimplifying the integral on the right:\n\n∫ 3*log(x**2) dx = 3x*log(x**2) - ∫ 6 dx\n\nNow, we can integrate the remaining part:\n\n∫ 6 dx = 6x\n\nSubstituting back, we get:\n\n∫ 3*log(x**2) dx = 3x*log(x**2) - 6x + C\n\nLet's verify this by computing the derivative of the result to ensure it matches the original integrand. We will use Python to perform this verification.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, log, diff\n\n# Define the variable and function\nx = symbols('x')\nintegral_result = 3*x*log(x**2) - 6*x\n\n# Differentiate the result\nderivative = diff(integral_result, x)\n\n# Output the derivative\nprint(derivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will check if the derivative matches the original integrand, 3*log(x**2). If it does, our integration is correct.",
    "The derivative of the result, 3*log(x**2), matches the original integrand, confirming that our integration is correct. Therefore, the indefinite integral of ∫ 3*log(x**2) dx is:\n\n<<<3*x*log(x**2) - 6*x + C>>>"
