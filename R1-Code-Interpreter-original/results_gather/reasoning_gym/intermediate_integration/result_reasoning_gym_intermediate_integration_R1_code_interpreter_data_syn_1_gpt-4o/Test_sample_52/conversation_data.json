    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ (12 - 54*x)*exp(9*x**2 - 4*x - 8) dx, we can use the method of substitution. The expression inside the exponential function, 9*x**2 - 4*x - 8, suggests that a substitution might simplify the integration process.\n\nLet's consider the substitution:\n- Let u = 9*x**2 - 4*x - 8.\n- Then, the derivative du/dx = 18*x - 4.\n\nThis implies that dx = du / (18*x - 4).\n\nNow, we need to express the integral in terms of u. The original integral is:\n\n∫ (12 - 54*x)*exp(9*x**2 - 4*x - 8) dx\n\nSubstituting u and dx, we get:\n\n∫ (12 - 54*x)*exp(u) * (du / (18*x - 4))\n\nThis substitution seems complex because it involves both x and u. Let's simplify the substitution further by expressing x in terms of u. However, this might not be straightforward, so let's try another approach.\n\nInstead of directly substituting, let's consider the derivative of the exponential function and see if it matches the form of the integrand. The derivative of exp(9*x**2 - 4*x - 8) with respect to x is:\n\nd/dx [exp(9*x**2 - 4*x - 8)] = (18*x - 4)*exp(9*x**2 - 4*x - 8)\n\nNotice that the integrand (12 - 54*x) can be related to (18*x - 4) by rewriting it as:\n\n12 - 54*x = -3*(18*x - 4) + 24\n\nThis suggests that we can split the integral into two parts:\n\n∫ (12 - 54*x)*exp(9*x**2 - 4*x - 8) dx = ∫ [-3*(18*x - 4) + 24]*exp(9*x**2 - 4*x - 8) dx\n\n= -3*∫ (18*x - 4)*exp(9*x**2 - 4*x - 8) dx + 24*∫ exp(9*x**2 - 4*x - 8) dx\n\nThe first integral can be solved by recognizing it as the derivative of the exponential function, and the second integral can be solved by substitution.\n\nLet's compute these integrals using Python to verify the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, exp, integrate\n\nx = symbols('x')\nintegrand = (12 - 54*x) * exp(9*x**2 - 4*x - 8)\nintegral = integrate(integrand, x)\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the indefinite integral.",
    "The code output indicates that the integral of the expression \\((12 - 54*x) \\cdot \\exp(9*x^2 - 4*x - 8)\\) is \\(-3 \\cdot \\exp(9*x^2 - 4*x - 8)\\). This result aligns with our earlier reasoning where we split the integral into two parts and recognized that the first part is the derivative of the exponential function.\n\nThe integral simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\int (12 - 54*x) \\cdot \\exp(9*x^2 - 4*x - 8) \\, dx = -3 \\cdot \\exp(9*x^2 - 4*x - 8) + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n<<<-3*exp(9*x**2 - 4*x - 8) + C>>>"
