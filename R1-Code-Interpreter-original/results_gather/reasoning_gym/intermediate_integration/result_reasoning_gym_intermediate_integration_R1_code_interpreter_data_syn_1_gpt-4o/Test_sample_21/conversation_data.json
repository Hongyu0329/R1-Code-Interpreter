    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -2*x**2*cos(3*x) dx, we can use the method of integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nWe need to choose u and dv from the integrand -2*x**2*cos(3*x). A common strategy is to let u be the algebraic part and dv be the trigonometric part. Let's choose:\n\n- u = -2*x**2\n- dv = cos(3*x) dx\n\nThen, we need to find du and v:\n\n- du = d(-2*x**2) = -4*x dx\n- v = ∫ cos(3*x) dx = (1/3)*sin(3*x)\n\nNow, we can apply the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ -2*x**2*cos(3*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v du\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n= (-2*x**2) * ((1/3)*sin(3*x)) - ∫ ((1/3)*sin(3*x)) * (-4*x) dx\n\n= (-2/3)*x**2*sin(3*x) + (4/3)∫ x*sin(3*x) dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral ∫ x*sin(3*x) dx using integration by parts again. Let's choose:\n\n- u = x\n- dv = sin(3*x) dx\n\nThen, we find du and v:\n\n- du = dx\n- v = ∫ sin(3*x) dx = -(1/3)*cos(3*x)\n\nApplying integration by parts again:\n\n∫ x*sin(3*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v du\n\n= x*(-(1/3)*cos(3*x)) - ∫ (-(1/3)*cos(3*x)) dx\n\n= -(1/3)*x*cos(3*x) + (1/9)*sin(3*x)\n\nSubstituting back into the original expression:\n\n= (-2/3)*x**2*sin(3*x) + (4/3)*(-(1/3)*x*cos(3*x) + (1/9)*sin(3*x))\n\nNow, let's compute this expression using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, cos, sin\n\nx = symbols('x')\nintegral = integrate(-2*x**2*cos(3*x), x)\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the integral and provide the result.",
    "The code output confirms the steps we took in the integration process. Let's summarize the result:\n\nThe indefinite integral of ∫ -2*x**2*cos(3*x) dx is:\n\n- The first term from the integration by parts: \\(-\\frac{2}{3}x^2\\sin(3x)\\)\n- The second term from the integration by parts: \\(-\\frac{4}{9}x\\cos(3x)\\)\n- The third term from the integration by parts: \\(\\frac{4}{27}\\sin(3x)\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer, including the constant of integration \\(C\\), is:\n\n<<<-2*x**2*sin(3*x)/3 - 4*x*cos(3*x)/9 + 4*sin(3*x)/27 + C>>>"
