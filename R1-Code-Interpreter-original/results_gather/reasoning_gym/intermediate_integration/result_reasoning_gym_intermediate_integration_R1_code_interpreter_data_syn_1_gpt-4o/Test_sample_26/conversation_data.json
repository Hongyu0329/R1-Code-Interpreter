    "To solve the integral ∫ x**3 * cos(x) dx, we can use the method of integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nWe need to choose u and dv from the integrand x**3 * cos(x). A good choice is:\n\n- u = x**3, which implies du = 3*x**2 dx\n- dv = cos(x) dx, which implies v = ∫ cos(x) dx = sin(x)\n\nNow, applying the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ x**3 * cos(x) dx = x**3 * sin(x) - ∫ sin(x) * 3*x**2 dx\n\nThe remaining integral ∫ 3*x**2 * sin(x) dx can again be solved using integration by parts. Let's choose:\n\n- u = 3*x**2, which implies du = 6*x dx\n- dv = sin(x) dx, which implies v = ∫ sin(x) dx = -cos(x)\n\nApplying integration by parts again:\n\n∫ 3*x**2 * sin(x) dx = 3*x**2 * (-cos(x)) - ∫ -cos(x) * 6*x dx\n                      = -3*x**2 * cos(x) + ∫ 6*x * cos(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to solve ∫ 6*x * cos(x) dx using integration by parts one more time. Let's choose:\n\n- u = 6*x, which implies du = 6 dx\n- dv = cos(x) dx, which implies v = sin(x)\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\n∫ 6*x * cos(x) dx = 6*x * sin(x) - ∫ sin(x) * 6 dx\n                   = 6*x * sin(x) + 6*cos(x)\n\nNow, we can substitute back into the previous results:\n\n∫ 3*x**2 * sin(x) dx = -3*x**2 * cos(x) + 6*x * sin(x) + 6*cos(x)\n\nFinally, substitute this back into the first integration by parts result:\n\n∫ x**3 * cos(x) dx = x**3 * sin(x) - (-3*x**2 * cos(x) + 6*x * sin(x) + 6*cos(x))\n                    = x**3 * sin(x) + 3*x**2 * cos(x) - 6*x * sin(x) - 6*cos(x) + C\n\nLet's verify this result using Python code to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, cos, sin\n\nx = symbols('x')\nintegral = integrate(x**3 * cos(x), x)\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the antiderivative of x**3 * cos(x) using symbolic integration. Let's execute it to verify our manual calculations.",
    "The code output matches our manual calculations, confirming that the antiderivative of ∫ x**3 * cos(x) dx is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<x**3*sin(x) + 3*x**2*cos(x) - 6*x*sin(x) - 6*cos(x) + C>>>"
