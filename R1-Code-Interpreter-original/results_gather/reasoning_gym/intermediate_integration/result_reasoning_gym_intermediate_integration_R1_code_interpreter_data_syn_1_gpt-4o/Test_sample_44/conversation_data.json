    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\(-\\log(x)\\), we need to integrate it with respect to \\(x\\). The integration process involves finding a function whose derivative is the given function.\n\n### Step-by-step Integration Process:\n\n1. **Integration by Parts**: \n   The formula for integration by parts is:\n   \\[\n   \\int u \\, dv = uv - \\int v \\, du\n   \\]\n   For the integral \\(\\int -\\log(x) \\, dx\\), we can choose:\n   - \\(u = -\\log(x)\\) which implies \\(du = -\\frac{1}{x} \\, dx\\)\n   - \\(dv = dx\\) which implies \\(v = x\\)\n\n2. **Apply Integration by Parts**:\n   Using the integration by parts formula:\n   \\[\n   \\int -\\log(x) \\, dx = -x\\log(x) - \\int -x \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\, dx\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the integral:\n   \\[\n   \\int -\\log(x) \\, dx = -x\\log(x) + \\int 1 \\, dx\n   \\]\n\n3. **Integrate the Remaining Part**:\n   \\[\n   \\int 1 \\, dx = x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Results**:\n   \\[\n   \\int -\\log(x) \\, dx = -x\\log(x) + x + C\n   \\]\n   where \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, let's verify this result using Python to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, log\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the function to integrate\nf = -log(x)\n\n# Perform the integration\nantiderivative = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we should get the antiderivative of \\(-\\log(x)\\).\n\n<<<-x*log(x) + x + C>>>",
    "The code output confirms the antiderivative we calculated manually. The result of the integration is \\(-x\\log(x) + x\\), which matches our earlier calculation. The constant of integration \\(C\\) is typically omitted in computational outputs but is understood to be part of the general solution.\n\nTherefore, the antiderivative of \\(-\\log(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is:\n\n<<<-x*log(x) + x + C>>>"
