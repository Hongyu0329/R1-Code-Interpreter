    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ x**3*sin(2*x) dx, we can use the method of integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nFor this integral, we can choose:\n- u = x**3, which implies that du = 3*x**2 dx\n- dv = sin(2*x) dx, which implies that v = -1/2 * cos(2*x) (since the integral of sin(2*x) is -1/2 * cos(2*x))\n\nNow, applying the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ x**3 * sin(2*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v*du\n\nSubstituting the values of u, v, du, and dv:\n\n∫ x**3 * sin(2*x) dx = (-1/2) * x**3 * cos(2*x) - ∫ (-1/2) * cos(2*x) * 3*x**2 dx\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n= (-1/2) * x**3 * cos(2*x) + (3/2) ∫ x**2 * cos(2*x) dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral ∫ x**2 * cos(2*x) dx using integration by parts again. Let's choose:\n- u = x**2, which implies that du = 2*x dx\n- dv = cos(2*x) dx, which implies that v = 1/2 * sin(2*x)\n\nApplying integration by parts again:\n\n∫ x**2 * cos(2*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v*du\n\nSubstituting the values of u, v, du, and dv:\n\n∫ x**2 * cos(2*x) dx = (1/2) * x**2 * sin(2*x) - ∫ (1/2) * sin(2*x) * 2*x dx\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n= (1/2) * x**2 * sin(2*x) - ∫ x * sin(2*x) dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral ∫ x * sin(2*x) dx using integration by parts one more time. Let's choose:\n- u = x, which implies that du = dx\n- dv = sin(2*x) dx, which implies that v = -1/2 * cos(2*x)\n\nApplying integration by parts again:\n\n∫ x * sin(2*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v*du\n\nSubstituting the values of u, v, du, and dv:\n\n∫ x * sin(2*x) dx = (-1/2) * x * cos(2*x) - ∫ (-1/2) * cos(2*x) dx\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n= (-1/2) * x * cos(2*x) + (1/4) * sin(2*x)\n\nNow, we can substitute back to find the original integral:\n\n∫ x**3 * sin(2*x) dx = (-1/2) * x**3 * cos(2*x) + (3/2) * [(1/2) * x**2 * sin(2*x) - ((-1/2) * x * cos(2*x) + (1/4) * sin(2*x))]\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, sin, cos\n\nx = symbols('x')\nintegral = integrate(x**3 * sin(2*x), x)\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the integral using symbolic computation. Let's execute it to find the result.",
