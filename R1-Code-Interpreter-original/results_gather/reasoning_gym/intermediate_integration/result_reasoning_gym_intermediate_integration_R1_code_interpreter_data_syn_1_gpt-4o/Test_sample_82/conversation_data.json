    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 12*sqrt(3 - 4*x) dx, we can use a substitution method. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Substitution**: We will use a substitution to simplify the integral. Let u = 3 - 4*x. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = -4, or dx = du / -4.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**: Substitute u into the integral:\n   ∫ 12*sqrt(3 - 4*x) dx = ∫ 12*sqrt(u) * (du / -4).\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral**: This becomes:\n   ∫ -3*sqrt(u) du.\n\n4. **Integrate**: The integral of sqrt(u) with respect to u is (2/3)*u**(3/2). Therefore:\n   ∫ -3*sqrt(u) du = -3 * (2/3) * u**(3/2) + C = -2*u**(3/2) + C.\n\n5. **Back-Substitute**: Replace u with 3 - 4*x:\n   -2*(3 - 4*x)**(3/2) + C.\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, sqrt\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = 12*sqrt(3 - 4*x)\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the integration result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the indefinite integral of the function \\( \\int 12\\sqrt{3 - 4x} \\, dx \\) is indeed \\(-2(3 - 4x)^{3/2} + C\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-2*(3 - 4*x)**(3/2) + C>>>"
