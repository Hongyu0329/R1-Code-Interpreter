    "To solve the integral ∫ -2*(7*x + 5)**2 dx, we need to find the antiderivative of the given function. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify the function to integrate**: The function is -2*(7*x + 5)**2.\n\n2. **Use substitution if necessary**: We can use substitution to simplify the integration. Let u = 7*x + 5, then du/dx = 7, or dx = du/7.\n\n3. **Rewrite the integral in terms of u**: Substitute u and dx in the integral:\n   ∫ -2*(u)**2 * (1/7) du = -2/7 ∫ u**2 du.\n\n4. **Integrate with respect to u**: The antiderivative of u**2 is (u**3)/3. Therefore:\n   -2/7 * (u**3)/3 = -2/21 * u**3.\n\n5. **Substitute back in terms of x**: Replace u with 7*x + 5:\n   -2/21 * (7*x + 5)**3.\n\n6. **Add the constant of integration**: The final antiderivative is:\n   -2/21 * (7*x + 5)**3 + C.\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nfunction = -2 * (7*x + 5)**2\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the antiderivative calculation.",
    "The code output indicates that the antiderivative of the function -2*(7*x + 5)**2 is -98*x**3/3 - 70*x**2 - 50*x. This result is obtained by directly integrating the expanded form of the function without substitution. Let's compare this with our manual calculation:\n\n1. **Manual Calculation**: We used substitution and found the antiderivative to be -2/21 * (7*x + 5)**3 + C.\n\n2. **Code Calculation**: The code expanded the function and integrated it directly, resulting in -98*x**3/3 - 70*x**2 - 50*x.\n\nBoth results are valid antiderivatives of the given function, but they are expressed in different forms. The code output is the expanded form of the antiderivative, while the manual calculation used substitution to express it in a compact form.\n\nTherefore, the final answer can be expressed in either form. Here is the final answer in the expanded form as obtained from the code:\n\n<<<-98*x**3/3 - 70*x**2 - 50*x + C>>>"
