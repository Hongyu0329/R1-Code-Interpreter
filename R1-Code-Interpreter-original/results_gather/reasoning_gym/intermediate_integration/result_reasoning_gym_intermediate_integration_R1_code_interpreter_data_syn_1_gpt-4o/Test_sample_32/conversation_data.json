    "To solve the indefinite integral ∫ -10*sin(5*x + 3)*cos(5*x + 3) dx, we can use a trigonometric identity to simplify the expression. The identity we will use is:\n\n\\[ \\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) \\]\n\nIn this case, we can set \\(\\theta = 5*x + 3\\), so:\n\n\\[ \\sin(2*(5*x + 3)) = 2*\\sin(5*x + 3)*\\cos(5*x + 3) \\]\n\nThus, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n\\[ \\int -10*\\sin(5*x + 3)*\\cos(5*x + 3) \\, dx = \\int -5*\\sin(2*(5*x + 3)) \\, dx \\]\n\nNow, we need to integrate \\(-5*\\sin(2*(5*x + 3))\\). The integral of \\(\\sin(ax)\\) is \\(-\\frac{1}{a}\\cos(ax)\\), so we apply this rule:\n\n\\[ \\int -5*\\sin(2*(5*x + 3)) \\, dx = -5*\\left(-\\frac{1}{2*(5)}\\right)\\cos(2*(5*x + 3)) + C \\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{10}\\cos(2*(5*x + 3)) + C = \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2*(5*x + 3)) + C \\]\n\nNow, let's compute this using Python to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, sin, cos\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = -10*sin(5*x + 3)*cos(5*x + 3)\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral_result = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral_result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the result of the indefinite integral.",
    "The code output indicates that the integration process has been completed, and the result is \\(\\cos(5*x + 3)^2\\). This suggests that the integration was performed correctly, but let's ensure that the interpretation aligns with the expected result.\n\nThe integral of \\(-10*\\sin(5*x + 3)*\\cos(5*x + 3)\\) was simplified using the trigonometric identity, and the integration process yielded \\(\\cos(5*x + 3)^2\\). This result is consistent with the expected form of the integral, considering the simplification and integration steps.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the indefinite integral is:\n\n<<<\\(\\cos(5*x + 3)^2 + C\\)>>>"
