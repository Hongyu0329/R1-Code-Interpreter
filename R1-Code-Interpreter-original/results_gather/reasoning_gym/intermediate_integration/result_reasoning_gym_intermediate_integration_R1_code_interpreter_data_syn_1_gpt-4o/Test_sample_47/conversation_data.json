Use ** instead of ^ to represent exponents. For example, write 7*X**2 instead of 7*X^2.\n2. Always include the * symbol for all multiplication operations in your reasoning steps. For example, write `-3*X**3*sin(X) - 9*X**2*cos(X) + 18*X*sin(X) + 18*cos(X) + C` instead of `-3x3sin(x) - 9x2cos(x) + 18xsin(x) + 18cos(x) + C`.\n3.

    "To solve the integral \\(\\int 4\\sqrt{4x + 8} \\, dx\\), we can use a substitution method to simplify the expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let \\( u = 4x + 8 \\). Then, the derivative \\( du = 4 \\, dx \\) or \\( dx = \\frac{1}{4} \\, du \\).\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**: Substitute \\( u \\) and \\( dx \\) into the integral:\n   \\[\n   \\int 4\\sqrt{4x + 8} \\, dx = \\int 4\\sqrt{u} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\, du = \\int \\sqrt{u} \\, du\n   \\]\n\n3. **Integrate**: The integral of \\(\\sqrt{u}\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\int u^{1/2} \\, du = \\frac{u^{3/2}}{3/2} = \\frac{2}{3}u^{3/2} + C\n   \\]\n\n4. **Back-Substitute**: Replace \\( u \\) with \\( 4x + 8 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3}(4x + 8)^{3/2} + C\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, sqrt\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = 4 * sqrt(4*x + 8)\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the antiderivative calculation.",
