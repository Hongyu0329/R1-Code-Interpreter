    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -18*sqrt(9*x + 7) dx, we can use a substitution method. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let u = 9*x + 7. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 9, or dx = du/9.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**: Substitute u into the integral:\n   ∫ -18*sqrt(9*x + 7) dx = ∫ -18*sqrt(u) * (1/9) du = ∫ -2*sqrt(u) du.\n\n3. **Integrate**: The integral of -2*sqrt(u) with respect to u is:\n   ∫ -2*u**(1/2) du = -2 * (2/3) * u**(3/2) + C = -(4/3) * u**(3/2) + C.\n\n4. **Back-Substitute**: Replace u with 9*x + 7:\n   -(4/3) * (9*x + 7)**(3/2) + C.\n\nNow, let's compute this using Python to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, sqrt\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = -18 * sqrt(9*x + 7)\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the integration.",
