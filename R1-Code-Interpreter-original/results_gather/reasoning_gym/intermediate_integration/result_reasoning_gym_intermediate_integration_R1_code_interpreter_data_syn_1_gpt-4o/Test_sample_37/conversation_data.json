    "To solve the problem of finding the antiderivative of the function \\(-30 \\cdot \\exp(10 \\cdot x - 6)\\), we need to apply the rules of integration for exponential functions.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Function Form**: The function is of the form \\(a \\cdot \\exp(b \\cdot x + c)\\), where \\(a = -30\\), \\(b = 10\\), and \\(c = -6\\).\n\n2. **Integration Rule for Exponential Functions**: The antiderivative of \\(\\exp(b \\cdot x + c)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{b} \\cdot \\exp(b \\cdot x + c)\\).\n\n3. **Apply the Rule**: \n   - The antiderivative of \\(-30 \\cdot \\exp(10 \\cdot x - 6)\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\int -30 \\cdot \\exp(10 \\cdot x - 6) \\, dx = -30 \\cdot \\frac{1}{10} \\cdot \\exp(10 \\cdot x - 6) + C\n   \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   -3 \\cdot \\exp(10 \\cdot x - 6) + C\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification**: To ensure correctness, we can differentiate the result and check if we obtain the original function.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to verify:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, exp, diff\n\n# Define the variable and function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = -3 * exp(10 * x - 6)\n\n# Differentiate the function\nf_prime = diff(f, x)\n\n# Print the derivative\nprint(f_prime)\n```\n\nThis code will differentiate the antiderivative to check if it matches the original function \\(-30 \\cdot \\exp(10 \\cdot x - 6)\\).\n\nOnce the code is executed, we can confirm the correctness of our antiderivative.\n\n<<<-3*exp(10*x - 6) + C>>>",
    "The code output confirms that the derivative of the antiderivative \\(-3 \\cdot \\exp(10 \\cdot x - 6)\\) is indeed the original function \\(-30 \\cdot \\exp(10 \\cdot x - 6)\\). This verifies that our integration was performed correctly.\n\nTherefore, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n<<<-3*exp(10*x - 6) + C>>>"
