    "To solve the integral ∫ 3*x*cos(2*x) dx, we can use the method of integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nWe need to choose u and dv from the integrand 3*x*cos(2*x). A common strategy is to let u be the algebraic part (x) and dv be the trigonometric part (cos(2*x) dx).\n\nLet's set:\n- u = 3*x, which implies that du = 3 dx\n- dv = cos(2*x) dx, which implies that v is the antiderivative of cos(2*x) dx.\n\nTo find v, we integrate dv:\n∫ cos(2*x) dx = (1/2) * sin(2*x) + C\n\nNow, we can apply the integration by parts formula:\n∫ 3*x*cos(2*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v*du\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n= (3*x) * ((1/2) * sin(2*x)) - ∫ ((1/2) * sin(2*x)) * 3 dx\n\nSimplifying:\n= (3/2) * x * sin(2*x) - (3/2) * ∫ sin(2*x) dx\n\nNow, we need to compute the integral ∫ sin(2*x) dx:\n∫ sin(2*x) dx = -(1/2) * cos(2*x) + C\n\nSubstitute back:\n= (3/2) * x * sin(2*x) - (3/2) * (-(1/2) * cos(2*x))\n\nSimplify:\n= (3/2) * x * sin(2*x) + (3/4) * cos(2*x) + C\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python to ensure correctness.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, cos, sin\n\nx = symbols('x')\nintegral = integrate(3*x*cos(2*x), x)\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the integral using symbolic computation to verify our manual calculation.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The antiderivative of ∫ 3*x*cos(2*x) dx is:\n\n3*x*sin(2*x)/2 + 3*cos(2*x)/4 + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\n<<<3*x*sin(2*x)/2 + 3*cos(2*x)/4 + C>>>"
