    "To solve the integral ∫ -3*sqrt(5 - 3*x) dx, we need to perform a substitution to simplify the expression. Let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let u = 5 - 3*x. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = -3. This implies that dx = du / -3.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**: Substitute u and dx into the integral:\n   ∫ -3*sqrt(5 - 3*x) dx = ∫ -3*sqrt(u) * (du / -3).\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral**: The -3 in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, leaving us with:\n   ∫ sqrt(u) du.\n\n4. **Integrate**: The antiderivative of sqrt(u) is (2/3)*u**(3/2) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n5. **Back-substitute**: Replace u with 5 - 3*x to get the antiderivative in terms of x:\n   (2/3)*(5 - 3*x)**(3/2) + C.\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, sqrt\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = -3*sqrt(5 - 3*x)\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the antiderivative calculation.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The antiderivative of the given integral ∫ -3*sqrt(5 - 3*x) dx is indeed:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} (5 - 3x)^{3/2} + C \\]\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2/3 * (5 - 3*x)**(3/2) + C>>>"
