    "To solve the problem of finding the antiderivative of the function \\( \\int 9 \\sqrt{3x - 1} \\, dx \\), we can use substitution to simplify the integration process.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let \\( u = 3x - 1 \\). Then, the derivative \\( du = 3 \\, dx \\) or \\( dx = \\frac{du}{3} \\).\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**: Substitute \\( u \\) and \\( dx \\) into the integral:\n   \\[\n   \\int 9 \\sqrt{3x - 1} \\, dx = \\int 9 \\sqrt{u} \\cdot \\frac{du}{3}\n   \\]\n   Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   = \\int 3 \\sqrt{u} \\, du\n   \\]\n\n3. **Integrate**: The integral of \\( \\sqrt{u} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\int u^{1/2} \\, du = \\frac{u^{3/2}}{3/2} = \\frac{2}{3} u^{3/2}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   3 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} = 2 u^{3/2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Back-substitute**: Replace \\( u \\) with \\( 3x - 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   2 (3x - 1)^{3/2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Add the Constant of Integration**: The final antiderivative is:\n   \\[\n   2 (3x - 1)^{3/2} + C\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, sqrt\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = 9 * sqrt(3*x - 1)\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will confirm the result and provide the final answer.",
    "The code execution confirms that the antiderivative of the function \\( \\int 9 \\sqrt{3x - 1} \\, dx \\) is indeed \\( 2 (3x - 1)^{3/2} \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2*(3*x - 1)**(3/2) + C>>>"
