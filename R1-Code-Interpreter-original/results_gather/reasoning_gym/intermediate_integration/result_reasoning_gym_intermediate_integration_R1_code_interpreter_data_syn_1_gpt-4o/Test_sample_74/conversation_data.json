    "To solve the problem of finding the antiderivative of the function ∫ exp(-x - 2) dx, we need to perform integration on the given expression.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1. **Identify the Function to Integrate:**\n   The function given is exp(-x - 2). This can be rewritten using the properties of exponents as exp(-x) * exp(-2).\n\n2. **Integration of Exponential Functions:**\n   The integral of exp(ax) with respect to x is (1/a) * exp(ax) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n3. **Apply the Integration Rule:**\n   In this case, the function can be seen as exp(-x) * exp(-2). Since exp(-2) is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n   ∫ exp(-x - 2) dx = exp(-2) * ∫ exp(-x) dx\n\n4. **Integrate exp(-x):**\n   The integral of exp(-x) is -exp(-x) + C.\n\n5. **Combine the Results:**\n   Therefore, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n   -exp(-2) * exp(-x) + C\n\n6. **Simplify the Expression:**\n   This can be simplified to:\n   -exp(-x - 2) + C\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure the integration is correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, exp, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nfunction = exp(-x - 2)\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the antiderivative calculation. Let's proceed with the final answer.\n\n<<<-exp(-x - 2) + C>>>",
    "The code output confirms that the antiderivative of the function ∫ exp(-x - 2) dx is indeed -exp(-x - 2). The constant of integration, C, is typically included in indefinite integrals to account for any constant that could be added to the function. However, the code output focuses on the main expression of the antiderivative.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, including the constant of integration, is:\n\n<<<-exp(-x - 2) + C>>>"
