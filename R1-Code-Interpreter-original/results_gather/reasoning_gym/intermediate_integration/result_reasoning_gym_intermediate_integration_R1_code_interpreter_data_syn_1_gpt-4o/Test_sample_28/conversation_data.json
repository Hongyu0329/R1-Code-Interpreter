    "To solve the integral ∫ -2*asin(x) dx, we need to find the antiderivative of the function -2*asin(x) with respect to x.\n\nThe function asin(x) is the inverse sine function, also known as arcsin(x). The antiderivative of arcsin(x) is a known result, and it can be derived using integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nFor the integral ∫ asin(x) dx, we can choose:\n- u = asin(x)  =>  du = 1/sqrt(1-x**2) dx\n- dv = dx  =>  v = x\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\n∫ asin(x) dx = x*asin(x) - ∫ x*(1/sqrt(1-x**2)) dx\n\nThe remaining integral ∫ x/sqrt(1-x**2) dx can be solved using a trigonometric substitution or recognizing it as a standard integral. The result of this integral is:\n\n∫ x/sqrt(1-x**2) dx = -sqrt(1-x**2) + C\n\nSubstituting back, we have:\n\n∫ asin(x) dx = x*asin(x) + sqrt(1-x**2) + C\n\nNow, we need to multiply this result by -2 to find the antiderivative of -2*asin(x):\n\n∫ -2*asin(x) dx = -2*(x*asin(x) + sqrt(1-x**2)) + C\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, asin, sqrt, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the function to integrate\nf = -2 * asin(x)\n\n# Compute the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the antiderivative of the given function.",
