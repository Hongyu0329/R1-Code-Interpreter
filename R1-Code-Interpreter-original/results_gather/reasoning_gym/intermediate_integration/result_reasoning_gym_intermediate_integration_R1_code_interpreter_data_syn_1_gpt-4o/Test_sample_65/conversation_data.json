    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 10*sqrt(10*x + 9) dx, we can use a substitution method. Let's go through the reasoning process step by step:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Let \\( u = 10*x + 9 \\). \n   - Then, the derivative \\( du = 10*dx \\) or \\( dx = \\frac{du}{10} \\).\n\n2. **Substitute in the integral**:\n   - The integral becomes ∫ 10*sqrt(u) * (1/10) du = ∫ sqrt(u) du.\n\n3. **Integrate**:\n   - The integral of sqrt(u) with respect to u is \\(\\frac{2}{3}*u^{3/2}\\).\n\n4. **Back-substitute**:\n   - Replace u with the original expression: \\( u = 10*x + 9 \\).\n   - The integral becomes \\(\\frac{2}{3}*(10*x + 9)^{3/2} + C\\), where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, sqrt\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = 10 * sqrt(10*x + 9)\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral_result = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the integration result. Let's proceed to the final answer.\n\n<<<(2/3)*(10*x + 9)**(3/2) + C>>>",
    "The code output confirms the integration result we derived manually. The indefinite integral of the function \\(10*\\sqrt{10*x + 9}\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is indeed \\(\\frac{2}{3}*(10*x + 9)^{3/2} + C\\), where \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(2/3)*(10*x + 9)**(3/2) + C>>>"
