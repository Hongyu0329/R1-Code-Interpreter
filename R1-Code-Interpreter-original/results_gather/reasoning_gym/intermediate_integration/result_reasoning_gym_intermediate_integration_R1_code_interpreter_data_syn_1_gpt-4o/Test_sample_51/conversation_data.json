    "To solve the integral ∫ 7*sin(7*x + 1)**2*cos(7*x + 1) dx, we can use a substitution method. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Let u = 7*x + 1. Then, du/dx = 7, or dx = du/7.\n   - The integral becomes ∫ 7*sin(u)**2*cos(u) * (du/7).\n\n2. **Simplification**:\n   - The 7 in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, simplifying the integral to ∫ sin(u)**2 * cos(u) du.\n\n3. **Integration by Substitution**:\n   - We can use another substitution: let v = sin(u), then dv/du = cos(u), or du = dv/cos(u).\n   - The integral becomes ∫ v**2 dv.\n\n4. **Integration**:\n   - The integral of v**2 with respect to v is (v**3)/3 + C.\n\n5. **Back-substitution**:\n   - Substitute back v = sin(u) to get (sin(u)**3)/3 + C.\n   - Substitute back u = 7*x + 1 to get (sin(7*x + 1)**3)/3 + C.\n\nNow, let's verify this process using Python code to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, sin, cos, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nu = 7*x + 1\nf = 7*sin(u)**2*cos(u)\n\n# Perform the integration\nantiderivative = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the antiderivative of the given function and confirm our manual calculations.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The antiderivative of the given integral ∫ 7*sin(7*x + 1)**2*cos(7*x + 1) dx is indeed:\n\n<<<sin(7*x + 1)**3/3 + C>>>"
