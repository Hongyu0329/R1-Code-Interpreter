    "To solve the integral ∫ -2*x**3*exp(x) dx, we can use the method of integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nFor this integral, we need to choose u and dv such that the integration becomes simpler. A common strategy is to let u be a polynomial term and dv be the exponential term. Let's choose:\n\n- u = -2*x**3, which implies that du = -6*x**2 dx\n- dv = exp(x) dx, which implies that v = exp(x)\n\nNow, applying the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ -2*x**3*exp(x) dx = -2*x**3*exp(x) - ∫ (-6*x**2)*exp(x) dx\n\nThe new integral ∫ 6*x**2*exp(x) dx can be solved using integration by parts again. We repeat the process:\n\n1. For ∫ 6*x**2*exp(x) dx, let:\n   - u = 6*x**2, which implies that du = 12*x dx\n   - dv = exp(x) dx, which implies that v = exp(x)\n\nApplying integration by parts again:\n\n∫ 6*x**2*exp(x) dx = 6*x**2*exp(x) - ∫ 12*x*exp(x) dx\n\n2. For ∫ 12*x*exp(x) dx, let:\n   - u = 12*x, which implies that du = 12 dx\n   - dv = exp(x) dx, which implies that v = exp(x)\n\nApplying integration by parts again:\n\n∫ 12*x*exp(x) dx = 12*x*exp(x) - ∫ 12*exp(x) dx\n\n3. The integral ∫ 12*exp(x) dx is straightforward:\n\n∫ 12*exp(x) dx = 12*exp(x)\n\nNow, we can combine all these results to find the original integral. Let's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, exp\n\nx = symbols('x')\nintegral = integrate(-2*x**3*exp(x), x)\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the antiderivative of the given function. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code output provides the antiderivative of the function \\(-2*x^3*exp(x)\\). The integration by parts was applied iteratively, and the result is:\n\n\\[\n\\int -2*x^3*exp(x) \\, dx = (-2*x^3 + 6*x^2 - 12*x + 12)*exp(x) + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n<<<(-2*x**3 + 6*x**2 - 12*x + 12)*exp(x) + C>>>"
