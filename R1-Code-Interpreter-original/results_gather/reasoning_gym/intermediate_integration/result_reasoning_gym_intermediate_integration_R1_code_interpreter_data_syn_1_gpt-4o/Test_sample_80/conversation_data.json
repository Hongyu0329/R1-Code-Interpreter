    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 3*sin(3*x + 4)*cos(3*x + 4)**4 dx, we can use a substitution method. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let u = 3*x + 4. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 3, or dx = du/3.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**: Substitute u into the integral:\n   ∫ 3*sin(u)*cos(u)**4 * (du/3)\n\n   The 3s cancel out, simplifying the integral to:\n   ∫ sin(u)*cos(u)**4 du\n\n3. **Use Trigonometric Identity**: We can use the identity sin(2u) = 2*sin(u)*cos(u) to help simplify the integral. However, in this case, it might be more straightforward to use a direct substitution for cos(u).\n\n4. **Further Substitution**: Let v = cos(u), then dv = -sin(u) du, or sin(u) du = -dv.\n\n5. **Rewrite the Integral Again**: Substitute v into the integral:\n   ∫ sin(u)*cos(u)**4 du = ∫ -v**4 dv\n\n6. **Integrate**: The integral of -v**4 with respect to v is:\n   -v**5/5 + C\n\n7. **Back-Substitute**: Replace v with cos(u) and u with 3*x + 4:\n   -cos(3*x + 4)**5/5 + C\n\nNow, let's verify this solution using Python to ensure the integration is correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, sin, cos\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nu = 3*x + 4\nintegrand = 3*sin(u)*cos(u)**4\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral = integrate(integrand, x)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the integration result.",
    "The code output confirms that the integration was performed correctly. The indefinite integral of the given function is:\n\n<<<-cos(3*x + 4)**5/5 + C>>>"
