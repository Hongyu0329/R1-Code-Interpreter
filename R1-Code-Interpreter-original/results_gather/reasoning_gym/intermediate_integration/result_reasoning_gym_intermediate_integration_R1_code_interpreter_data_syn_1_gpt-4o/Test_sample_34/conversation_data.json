    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 3*(4*x - 8)**3 dx, we can use the method of substitution. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let u = 4*x - 8. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 4, or du = 4*dx. This implies that dx = du/4.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**: Substitute u and dx into the integral:\n   ∫ 3*(4*x - 8)**3 dx = ∫ 3*u**3 * (du/4).\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral**: Factor out constants from the integral:\n   = (3/4) * ∫ u**3 du.\n\n4. **Integrate**: The integral of u**3 with respect to u is (u**4)/4. Therefore:\n   (3/4) * ∫ u**3 du = (3/4) * (u**4)/4 = (3/16) * u**4.\n\n5. **Back-Substitute**: Replace u with the original expression in terms of x:\n   = (3/16) * (4*x - 8)**4.\n\n6. **Add the Constant of Integration**: Since this is an indefinite integral, we add a constant C:\n   = (3/16) * (4*x - 8)**4 + C.\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = 3 * (4*x - 8)**3\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the integration.",
    "The code output provides the expanded form of the integral, which is equivalent to the expression we derived. Let's compare the two results:\n\n1. Our derived result was: \\((3/16) * (4*x - 8)^4 + C\\).\n\n2. The expanded form from the code output is: \\(48*x^4 - 384*x^3 + 1152*x^2 - 1536*x + C\\).\n\nBoth expressions represent the same indefinite integral, just in different forms. The expanded form is the polynomial representation of the integral.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the indefinite integral is:\n\n<<<(3/16) * (4*x - 8)**4 + C>>>"
