Use ** instead of ^ to represent exponents. For example, write 7*X**2 instead of 7*X^2.\n2. Always include the * symbol for all multiplication operations in your reasoning steps. For example, write `-3*X**3*sin(X) - 9*X**2*cos(X) + 18*X*sin(X) + 18*cos(X) + C` instead of `-3x3sin(x) - 9x2cos(x) + 18xsin(x) + 18cos(x) + C`.\n3.

    "To solve the integral ∫ 2*exp(x)*cos(x) dx, we can use the method of integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nFor this integral, we can choose:\n- u = cos(x)  =>  du = -sin(x) dx\n- dv = 2*exp(x) dx  =>  v = 2*exp(x)\n\nNow, applying the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ 2*exp(x)*cos(x) dx = 2*exp(x)*cos(x) - ∫ 2*exp(x)*(-sin(x)) dx\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2*exp(x)*cos(x) + ∫ 2*exp(x)*sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to solve the integral ∫ 2*exp(x)*sin(x) dx using integration by parts again. Let's choose:\n- u = sin(x)  =>  du = cos(x) dx\n- dv = 2*exp(x) dx  =>  v = 2*exp(x)\n\nApplying the integration by parts formula again:\n\n∫ 2*exp(x)*sin(x) dx = 2*exp(x)*sin(x) - ∫ 2*exp(x)*cos(x) dx\n\nNotice that the integral ∫ 2*exp(x)*cos(x) dx appears again, which is the original integral we are trying to solve. Let's denote it by I:\n\nI = 2*exp(x)*cos(x) + 2*exp(x)*sin(x) - I\n\nNow, we can solve for I:\n\n2*I = 2*exp(x)*cos(x) + 2*exp(x)*sin(x)\n\nI = exp(x)*cos(x) + exp(x)*sin(x)\n\nFinally, we add the constant of integration C:\n\nI = exp(x)*cos(x) + exp(x)*sin(x) + C\n\nLet's verify this result using Python to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, exp, cos, sin, integrate\n\nx = symbols('x')\nintegral = integrate(2*exp(x)*cos(x), x)\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The antiderivative of the integral ∫ 2*exp(x)*cos(x) dx is indeed:\n\n<<<exp(x)*sin(x) + exp(x)*cos(x) + C>>>"
