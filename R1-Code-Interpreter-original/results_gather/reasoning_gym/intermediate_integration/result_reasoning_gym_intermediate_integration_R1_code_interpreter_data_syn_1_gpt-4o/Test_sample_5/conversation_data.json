    "To solve the integral ∫ 24*exp(8 - 8*x) dx, we need to find the antiderivative of the function 24*exp(8 - 8*x) with respect to x.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Inner Function**: \n   The function inside the exponential is (8 - 8*x). Let's denote this as u, so u = 8 - 8*x.\n\n2. **Differentiate the Inner Function**:\n   The derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = -8.\n\n3. **Substitute and Simplify**:\n   We can rewrite the integral in terms of u. The differential dx can be expressed in terms of du: dx = du / (-8).\n\n4. **Rewrite the Integral**:\n   Substitute u and dx into the integral:\n   ∫ 24*exp(u) * (du / -8)\n\n5. **Simplify the Integral**:\n   This simplifies to:\n   -3 * ∫ exp(u) du\n\n6. **Integrate**:\n   The integral of exp(u) with respect to u is exp(u). Therefore:\n   -3 * exp(u) + C\n\n7. **Substitute Back**:\n   Replace u with the original expression (8 - 8*x):\n   -3 * exp(8 - 8*x) + C\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, exp, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = 24 * exp(8 - 8*x)\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the antiderivative calculation.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation of the antiderivative. The antiderivative of the function 24*exp(8 - 8*x) with respect to x is:\n\n<<<-3*exp(8 - 8*x) + C>>>"
