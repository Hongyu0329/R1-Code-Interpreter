    "To find the indefinite integral of the function ∫ 2*(x - 8)**2 dx, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand the integrand**: First, we expand the expression (x - 8)**2. This will make it easier to integrate term by term.\n\n2. **Integrate each term**: Once expanded, we integrate each term separately.\n\n3. **Add the constant of integration**: Since this is an indefinite integral, we need to add a constant of integration, C, to the result.\n\nLet's start by expanding the expression (x - 8)**2:\n\n(x - 8)**2 = x**2 - 16*x + 64\n\nNow, multiply the entire expression by 2:\n\n2*(x**2 - 16*x + 64) = 2*x**2 - 32*x + 128\n\nNext, we integrate each term separately:\n\n∫ 2*x**2 dx = (2/3)*x**3\n∫ -32*x dx = -16*x**2\n∫ 128 dx = 128*x\n\nFinally, we combine these results and add the constant of integration, C:\n\n∫ 2*(x - 8)**2 dx = (2/3)*x**3 - 16*x**2 + 128*x + C\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the function to integrate\nfunction = 2 * (x - 8)**2\n\n# Perform the integration\nindefinite_integral = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(indefinite_integral)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the integration result.",
    "The code output confirms our manual integration process. The indefinite integral of the function ∫ 2*(x - 8)**2 dx is:\n\n2*x**3/3 - 16*x**2 + 128*x + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\n<<<2*x**3/3 - 16*x**2 + 128*x + C>>>"
