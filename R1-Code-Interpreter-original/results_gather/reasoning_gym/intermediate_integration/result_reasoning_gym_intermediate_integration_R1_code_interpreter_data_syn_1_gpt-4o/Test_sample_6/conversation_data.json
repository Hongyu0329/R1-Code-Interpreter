    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 6*exp(6*x - 6) dx, we can use the method of substitution. \n\n### Reasoning and Steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   Let's set \\( u = 6*x - 6 \\). Then, the derivative of \\( u \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{du}{dx} = 6 \\). This implies \\( du = 6*dx \\) or \\( dx = \\frac{du}{6} \\).\n\n2. **Substitute in the Integral**:\n   The integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\int 6*exp(u) * \\frac{du}{6}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\int exp(u) \\, du\n   \\]\n\n3. **Integrate**:\n   The integral of \\( exp(u) \\) with respect to \\( u \\) is simply \\( exp(u) + C \\), where \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\n4. **Back-substitute**:\n   Replace \\( u \\) with \\( 6*x - 6 \\) to get the final result:\n   \\[\n   exp(6*x - 6) + C\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, exp, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = 6 * exp(6*x - 6)\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral_result = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the integration result.",
    "The code output confirms the integration result. The indefinite integral of \\( 6*exp(6*x - 6) \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is indeed \\( exp(6*x - 6) + C \\), where \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\n<<<exp(6*x - 6) + C>>>"
