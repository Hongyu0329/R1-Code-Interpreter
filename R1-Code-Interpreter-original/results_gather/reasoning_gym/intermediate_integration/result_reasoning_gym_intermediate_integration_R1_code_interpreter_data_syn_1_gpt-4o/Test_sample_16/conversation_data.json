    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 2*x**3*cos(3*x) dx, we can use the method of integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nWe need to choose u and dv from the integrand 2*x**3*cos(3*x). A good choice is:\n\n- Let u = 2*x**3, which implies that du = 6*x**2 dx.\n- Let dv = cos(3*x) dx, which implies that v = (1/3)*sin(3*x).\n\nNow, we can apply the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ 2*x**3*cos(3*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v du\n\nSubstituting the values of u, v, and du, we get:\n\n∫ 2*x**3*cos(3*x) dx = (2*x**3)*(1/3)*sin(3*x) - ∫ (1/3)*sin(3*x)*(6*x**2) dx\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n= (2/3)*x**3*sin(3*x) - 2*∫ x**2*sin(3*x) dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral ∫ x**2*sin(3*x) dx using integration by parts again. Let's choose:\n\n- Let u = x**2, which implies that du = 2*x dx.\n- Let dv = sin(3*x) dx, which implies that v = -(1/3)*cos(3*x).\n\nApplying integration by parts again:\n\n∫ x**2*sin(3*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v du\n\nSubstituting the values of u, v, and du, we get:\n\n∫ x**2*sin(3*x) dx = (x**2)*(-(1/3)*cos(3*x)) - ∫ (-(1/3)*cos(3*x))*(2*x) dx\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n= -(1/3)*x**2*cos(3*x) + (2/3)*∫ x*cos(3*x) dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral ∫ x*cos(3*x) dx using integration by parts one more time. Let's choose:\n\n- Let u = x, which implies that du = dx.\n- Let dv = cos(3*x) dx, which implies that v = (1/3)*sin(3*x).\n\nApplying integration by parts again:\n\n∫ x*cos(3*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v du\n\nSubstituting the values of u, v, and du, we get:\n\n∫ x*cos(3*x) dx = (x)*(1/3)*sin(3*x) - ∫ (1/3)*sin(3*x) dx\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n= (1/3)*x*sin(3*x) - (1/9)*∫ sin(3*x) dx\n\nThe integral ∫ sin(3*x) dx is straightforward:\n\n∫ sin(3*x) dx = -(1/3)*cos(3*x)\n\nSubstituting back, we have:\n\n∫ x*cos(3*x) dx = (1/3)*x*sin(3*x) + (1/27)*cos(3*x)\n\nNow, substituting back into the previous integrals, we can compute the final result. Let's write a Python script to perform these calculations and simplify the expression.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, cos, sin\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the integrand\nintegrand = 2*x**3*cos(3*x)\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral_result = integrate(integrand, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
