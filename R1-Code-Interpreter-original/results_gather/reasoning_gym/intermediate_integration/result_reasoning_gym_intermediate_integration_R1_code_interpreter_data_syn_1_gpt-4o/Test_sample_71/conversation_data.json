    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ x**3 * exp(x) dx, we can use the method of integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nFor this integral, we will choose:\n- u = x**3, which implies that du = 3*x**2 dx\n- dv = exp(x) dx, which implies that v = exp(x)\n\nNow, applying the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ x**3 * exp(x) dx = x**3 * exp(x) - ∫ exp(x) * 3*x**2 dx\n\nThe new integral ∫ 3*x**2 * exp(x) dx can again be solved using integration by parts. We repeat the process:\n\nFor ∫ 3*x**2 * exp(x) dx, choose:\n- u = x**2, which implies that du = 2*x dx\n- dv = 3*exp(x) dx, which implies that v = 3*exp(x)\n\nApplying integration by parts again:\n\n∫ 3*x**2 * exp(x) dx = 3*(x**2 * exp(x) - ∫ exp(x) * 2*x dx)\n\nNow, we need to solve ∫ 2*x * exp(x) dx using integration by parts:\n\nFor ∫ 2*x * exp(x) dx, choose:\n- u = x, which implies that du = dx\n- dv = 2*exp(x) dx, which implies that v = 2*exp(x)\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\n∫ 2*x * exp(x) dx = 2*(x * exp(x) - ∫ exp(x) dx)\n\nFinally, ∫ exp(x) dx = exp(x).\n\nNow, let's compute the entire expression using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, exp\n\nx = symbols('x')\nintegral = integrate(x**3 * exp(x), x)\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the integral using symbolic computation. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code output provides the evaluated indefinite integral of the function \\( x^3 \\cdot \\exp(x) \\). The result is:\n\n\\[\n(x^3 - 3x^2 + 6x - 6) \\cdot \\exp(x) + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration. This result is obtained by applying the method of integration by parts iteratively, as explained in the reasoning process.\n\n<<<(x**3 - 3*x**2 + 6*x - 6)*exp(x) + C>>>"
