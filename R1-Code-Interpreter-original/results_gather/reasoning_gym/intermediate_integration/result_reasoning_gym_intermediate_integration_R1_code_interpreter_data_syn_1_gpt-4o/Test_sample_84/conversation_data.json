    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 3*exp(x)*sin(x) dx, we can use the method of integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nFor this integral, we can choose:\n- u = sin(x), which implies du = cos(x) dx\n- dv = 3*exp(x) dx, which implies v = 3*exp(x)\n\nNow, applying the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ 3*exp(x)*sin(x) dx = 3*exp(x)*sin(x) - ∫ 3*exp(x)*cos(x) dx\n\nThe new integral ∫ 3*exp(x)*cos(x) dx can also be solved using integration by parts. Let's apply integration by parts again:\n\nFor the integral ∫ 3*exp(x)*cos(x) dx, choose:\n- u = cos(x), which implies du = -sin(x) dx\n- dv = 3*exp(x) dx, which implies v = 3*exp(x)\n\nApplying the integration by parts formula again:\n\n∫ 3*exp(x)*cos(x) dx = 3*exp(x)*cos(x) - ∫ -3*exp(x)*sin(x) dx\n\nThis results in:\n\n∫ 3*exp(x)*cos(x) dx = 3*exp(x)*cos(x) + ∫ 3*exp(x)*sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n1. I = 3*exp(x)*sin(x) - J\n2. J = 3*exp(x)*cos(x) + I\n\nWhere I = ∫ 3*exp(x)*sin(x) dx and J = ∫ 3*exp(x)*cos(x) dx.\n\nSubstituting equation 2 into equation 1:\n\nI = 3*exp(x)*sin(x) - (3*exp(x)*cos(x) + I)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n2I = 3*exp(x)*sin(x) - 3*exp(x)*cos(x)\n\nI = (3/2)*exp(x)*sin(x) - (3/2)*exp(x)*cos(x)\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to verify this result:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, exp, sin, cos, integrate\n\nx = symbols('x')\nintegral = integrate(3*exp(x)*sin(x), x)\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the integral using symbolic computation to verify our manual calculation.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The indefinite integral of ∫ 3*exp(x)*sin(x) dx is:\n\n3*exp(x)*sin(x)/2 - 3*exp(x)*cos(x)/2 + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\n<<<3*exp(x)*sin(x)/2 - 3*exp(x)*cos(x)/2 + C>>>"
