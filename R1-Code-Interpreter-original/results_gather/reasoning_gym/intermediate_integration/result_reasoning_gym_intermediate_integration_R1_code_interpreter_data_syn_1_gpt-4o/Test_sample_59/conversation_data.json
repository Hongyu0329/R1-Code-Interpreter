    "To solve the problem of finding the antiderivative of the function \\(-2*(3*x - 7)^4\\), we need to apply the power rule for integration and the chain rule.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Inner Function and its Derivative:**\n   - The inner function \\(u\\) is \\(3*x - 7\\).\n   - The derivative of \\(u\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is \\(du/dx = 3\\).\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral:**\n   - The integral can be rewritten using substitution. Let \\(u = 3*x - 7\\), then \\(du = 3*dx\\) or \\(dx = du/3\\).\n   - Substitute into the integral: \\(\\int -2*(u)^4 * (du/3)\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral:**\n   - The integral becomes \\(-\\frac{2}{3} \\int u^4 \\, du\\).\n\n4. **Apply the Power Rule for Integration:**\n   - The power rule states that \\(\\int u^n \\, du = \\frac{u^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\\).\n   - Applying this rule: \\(-\\frac{2}{3} * \\frac{u^{5}}{5} + C\\).\n\n5. **Substitute Back the Original Variable:**\n   - Replace \\(u\\) with \\(3*x - 7\\): \\(-\\frac{2}{3} * \\frac{(3*x - 7)^{5}}{5} + C\\).\n\n6. **Simplify the Expression:**\n   - The final expression is \\(-\\frac{2}{15} * (3*x - 7)^{5} + C\\).\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nfunction = -2 * (3*x - 7)**4\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the antiderivative calculation.",
    "The code output provides the expanded form of the antiderivative, which is equivalent to the simplified form we derived. However, let's ensure that the simplified form matches the expanded form by comparing both.\n\n### Simplified Form:\nThe simplified form of the antiderivative is:\n\\[\n-\\frac{2}{15} * (3*x - 7)^{5} + C\n\\]\n\n### Expanded Form:\nThe expanded form from the code output is:\n\\[\n-\\frac{162}{5}*x^5 + 378*x^4 - 1764*x^3 + 4116*x^2 - 4802*x + C\n\\]\n\nBoth forms represent the same antiderivative, but the expanded form is expressed as a polynomial. The code output confirms that the integration was performed correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in its simplified form is:\n\n<<<-2/15 * (3*x - 7)**5 + C>>>"
