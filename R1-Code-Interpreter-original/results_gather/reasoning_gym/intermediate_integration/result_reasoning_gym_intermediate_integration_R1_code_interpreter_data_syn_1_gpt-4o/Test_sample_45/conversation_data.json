    "To find the indefinite integral of the function ∫ exp(x)*sin(x) dx, we can use the method of integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nFor the given integral, we can choose:\n- u = sin(x)  =>  du = cos(x) dx\n- dv = exp(x) dx  =>  v = exp(x)\n\nApplying the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ exp(x)*sin(x) dx = exp(x)*sin(x) - ∫ exp(x)*cos(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to integrate ∫ exp(x)*cos(x) dx. We apply integration by parts again:\n\nFor ∫ exp(x)*cos(x) dx, choose:\n- u = cos(x)  =>  du = -sin(x) dx\n- dv = exp(x) dx  =>  v = exp(x)\n\nApplying the integration by parts formula again:\n\n∫ exp(x)*cos(x) dx = exp(x)*cos(x) + ∫ exp(x)*sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n1. I = exp(x)*sin(x) - J\n2. J = exp(x)*cos(x) + I\n\nWhere I = ∫ exp(x)*sin(x) dx and J = ∫ exp(x)*cos(x) dx.\n\nSubstitute equation 2 into equation 1:\n\nI = exp(x)*sin(x) - (exp(x)*cos(x) + I)\n\nSimplify:\n\nI = exp(x)*sin(x) - exp(x)*cos(x) - I\n\n2I = exp(x)*sin(x) - exp(x)*cos(x)\n\nI = (1/2) * (exp(x)*sin(x) - exp(x)*cos(x))\n\nNow, let's verify this result using Python code to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, exp, sin, cos, integrate\n\nx = symbols('x')\nintegral = integrate(exp(x)*sin(x), x)\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the indefinite integral of exp(x)*sin(x) using symbolic computation. Let's execute it to verify our result.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The indefinite integral of ∫ exp(x)*sin(x) dx is:\n\n<<<(1/2) * (exp(x)*sin(x) - exp(x)*cos(x)) + C>>>\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration."
