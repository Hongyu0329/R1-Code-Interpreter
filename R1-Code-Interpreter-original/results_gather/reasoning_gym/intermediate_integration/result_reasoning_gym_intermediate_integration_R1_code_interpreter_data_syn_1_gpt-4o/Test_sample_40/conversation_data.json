    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 3*(6*x - 9)**3 dx, we can use the method of substitution. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let u = 6*x - 9. Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = 6, or du = 6*dx. This implies that dx = du/6.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**: Substitute u and dx in the integral:\n   ∫ 3*(6*x - 9)**3 dx = ∫ 3*u**3 * (du/6).\n\n3. **Simplify the Integral**: \n   ∫ 3*u**3 * (du/6) = (3/6) * ∫ u**3 du = (1/2) * ∫ u**3 du.\n\n4. **Integrate**: The integral of u**3 with respect to u is (u**4)/4. Therefore:\n   (1/2) * ∫ u**3 du = (1/2) * (u**4)/4 = (1/8) * u**4.\n\n5. **Back-Substitute**: Replace u with the original expression in terms of x:\n   (1/8) * (6*x - 9)**4.\n\n6. **Add the Constant of Integration**: Since this is an indefinite integral, we add a constant C.\n\nThe final expression for the indefinite integral is:\n(1/8) * (6*x - 9)**4 + C.\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = 3 * (6*x - 9)**3\n\n# Calculate the indefinite integral\nindefinite_integral = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(indefinite_integral)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the correctness of the manual integration process.",
    "The code output indicates that the integration was performed directly without substitution, resulting in a polynomial expression. However, the manual substitution method should yield a simpler expression. Let's re-evaluate the integration using the substitution method and verify the result.\n\nThe correct approach using substitution should yield:\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let \\( u = 6x - 9 \\), then \\( du = 6 \\, dx \\) or \\( dx = \\frac{du}{6} \\).\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**: \n   \\[\n   \\int 3(6x - 9)^3 \\, dx = \\int 3u^3 \\cdot \\frac{du}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int u^3 \\, du\n   \\]\n\n3. **Integrate**: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\int u^3 \\, du = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{u^4}{4} = \\frac{1}{8} u^4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Back-Substitute**: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{8} (6x - 9)^4\n   \\]\n\n5. **Add the Constant of Integration**: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{8} (6x - 9)^4 + C\n   \\]\n\nThe discrepancy arises because the direct integration without substitution results in a polynomial expansion, which is equivalent but not in the simplified form obtained through substitution.\n\nThe final answer using substitution is:\n<<<(1/8) * (6*x - 9)**4 + C>>>"
