    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -3*x**3*exp(x) dx, we can use the method of integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nFor this integral, we need to choose u and dv such that the integration becomes simpler. A common strategy is to let u be a polynomial term and dv be the exponential term. Let's choose:\n\n- u = -3*x**3, which implies du = -9*x**2 dx\n- dv = exp(x) dx, which implies v = exp(x)\n\nNow, applying the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ -3*x**3*exp(x) dx = -3*x**3*exp(x) - ∫ exp(x) * (-9*x**2) dx\n\nThis process will need to be repeated for the resulting integral ∫ 9*x**2*exp(x) dx, again using integration by parts. We will continue this process until the polynomial term is reduced to zero.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the integral step by step:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, exp\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = -3*x**3*exp(x)\n\n# Compute the indefinite integral\nintegral_result = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral_result)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the indefinite integral using symbolic computation. Let's execute it to find the result.",

The output indicates the evaluated integral of the function \\(-3*x^3*exp(x)\\).\n\nThe result of the indefinite integral is:\n\n\\[\n\\int -3*x^3*exp(x) \\, dx = (-3*x^3 + 9*x^2 - 18*x + 18)*exp(x) + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n<<<(-3*x**3 + 9*x**2 - 18*x + 18)*exp(x) + C>>>"
