    "To solve the integral \\(\\int -6 \\cdot \\sin(2x + 2) \\cdot \\cos(2x + 2) \\, dx\\), we can use a trigonometric identity to simplify the expression. The identity we will use is:\n\n\\[\n\\sin(2\\theta) = 2 \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot \\cos(\\theta)\n\\]\n\nThis allows us to rewrite the product of sine and cosine in terms of a single sine function. Let's apply this identity to the given integral:\n\n1. Recognize that \\(\\sin(2x + 2) \\cdot \\cos(2x + 2)\\) can be expressed as \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sin(2 \\cdot (2x + 2))\\).\n\n2. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\int -6 \\cdot \\sin(2x + 2) \\cdot \\cos(2x + 2) \\, dx = \\int -6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sin(4x + 4) \\, dx\n   \\]\n\n3. Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   = \\int -3 \\cdot \\sin(4x + 4) \\, dx\n   \\]\n\n4. The antiderivative of \\(\\sin(ax + b)\\) is \\(-\\frac{1}{a} \\cdot \\cos(ax + b)\\). Applying this rule, we find:\n   \\[\n   \\int -3 \\cdot \\sin(4x + 4) \\, dx = -3 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\cos(4x + 4)\\right) + C\n   \\]\n\n5. Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\cos(4x + 4) + C\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, sin, cos\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = -6 * sin(2*x + 2) * cos(2*x + 2)\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will confirm the result and provide the final answer.",
    "The code output indicates that the antiderivative of the given function is \\(-\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\sin^2(2x + 2)\\). This result is consistent with the trigonometric identity approach, as the integral of \\(\\sin(2x + 2) \\cdot \\cos(2x + 2)\\) can also be expressed in terms of \\(\\sin^2(2x + 2)\\).\n\nThe discrepancy between the manual calculation and the code output arises from the different trigonometric identities used. Both results are valid, but they are expressed in different forms. The code output is a simplified form using the identity for \\(\\sin^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\sin^2(2x + 2) + C>>>"
