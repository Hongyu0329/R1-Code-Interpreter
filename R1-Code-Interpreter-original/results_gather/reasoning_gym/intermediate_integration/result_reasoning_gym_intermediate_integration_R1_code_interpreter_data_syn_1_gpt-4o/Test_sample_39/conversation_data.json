    "To find the indefinite integral of the function \\(-a\\sin(x)\\), we need to integrate it with respect to \\(x\\). The integral of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is \\(-\\cos(x)\\), so we can use this information to solve the problem.\n\nLet's break down the integration process:\n\n1. The given function is \\(-a\\sin(x)\\).\n2. The integral of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is \\(-\\cos(x)\\).\n3. Therefore, the integral of \\(-a\\sin(x)\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\int -a\\sin(x) \\, dx = -a \\int \\sin(x) \\, dx = -a(-\\cos(x)) = a\\cos(x)\n   \\]\n4. Since this is an indefinite integral, we add the constant of integration \\(C\\).\n\nThus, the indefinite integral of \\(-a\\sin(x)\\) is \\(a\\cos(x) + C\\).\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a Python script to perform the integration using symbolic computation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, sin, cos\n\n# Define the variable and constant\nx = symbols('x')\na = symbols('a')\n\n# Define the function to integrate\nfunction = -a * sin(x)\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral_result = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the integration result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the indefinite integral of \\(-a\\sin(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is indeed \\(a\\cos(x)\\). Therefore, the final answer, including the constant of integration, is:\n\n<<<a*cos(x) + C>>>"
