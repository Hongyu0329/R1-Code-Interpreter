    "To find the indefinite integral of the function \\(- (2*x + 6)^4\\), we can use the method of substitution. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let \\( u = 2*x + 6 \\). Then, the derivative \\( du = 2*dx \\) or \\( dx = \\frac{du}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Rewrite the Integral**: Substitute \\( u \\) and \\( dx \\) into the integral:\n   \\[\n   \\int -(2*x + 6)^4 \\, dx = \\int -u^4 \\cdot \\frac{du}{2}\n   \\]\n   Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int u^4 \\, du\n   \\]\n\n3. **Integrate**: The integral of \\( u^4 \\) with respect to \\( u \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\int u^4 \\, du = \\frac{u^5}{5} + C\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{1}{2} \\int u^4 \\, du = -\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{u^5}{5} + C = -\\frac{u^5}{10} + C\n   \\]\n\n4. **Back-Substitute**: Replace \\( u \\) with \\( 2*x + 6 \\):\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{(2*x + 6)^5}{10} + C\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure the integration is correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nfunction = -(2*x + 6)**4\n\n# Perform the integration\nindefinite_integral = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(indefinite_integral)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the integration result.",
    "The code output indicates that the integration was performed directly without substitution, resulting in a polynomial expansion of the original expression. This is a valid approach, but it doesn't match the substitution method I initially described. Let's reconcile the two methods:\n\n1. **Direct Integration**: The code output represents the expanded form of the integral:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{16}{5}*x^5 - 48*x^4 - 288*x^3 - 864*x^2 - 1296*x + C\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitution Method**: The result from the substitution method was:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{(2*x + 6)^5}{10} + C\n   \\]\n\nBoth results are equivalent, but they are expressed differently. The substitution method keeps the expression in terms of the original substitution variable, while the direct integration expands it into a polynomial.\n\nThe final answer, using the substitution method, is:\n\n<<<-((2*x + 6)**5)/10 + C>>>"
