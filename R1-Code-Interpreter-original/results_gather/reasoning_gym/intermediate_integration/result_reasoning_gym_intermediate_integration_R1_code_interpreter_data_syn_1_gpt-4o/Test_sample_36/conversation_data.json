    "To solve the indefinite integral ∫ 16*exp(-8*x - 6) dx, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the Exponential Expression**: The expression inside the exponential function is -8*x - 6. We can rewrite the integral as ∫ 16*exp(-8*x)*exp(-6) dx. Since exp(-6) is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral.\n\n2. **Factor Out Constants**: The integral becomes 16*exp(-6) * ∫ exp(-8*x) dx.\n\n3. **Integrate the Exponential Function**: The integral of exp(-8*x) with respect to x is (-1/8)*exp(-8*x), because the derivative of exp(-8*x) is -8*exp(-8*x), and we need to divide by -8 to account for this.\n\n4. **Combine the Results**: Multiply the result of the integration by the constants factored out earlier.\n\n5. **Add the Constant of Integration**: Since this is an indefinite integral, we add a constant of integration, C.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, exp, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = 16 * exp(-8*x - 6)\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral_result = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the indefinite integral.",
    "The output from the code execution indicates that the indefinite integral of the function \\( \\int 16 \\cdot \\exp(-8x - 6) \\, dx \\) is \\(-2 \\cdot \\exp(-8x - 6)\\).\n\nThis result aligns with the steps we outlined:\n\n1. We factored out the constant \\( \\exp(-6) \\) from the integral.\n2. We integrated \\( \\exp(-8x) \\) to get \\(-\\frac{1}{8} \\cdot \\exp(-8x)\\).\n3. We multiplied by the constants \\(16 \\cdot \\exp(-6)\\) to get the final result.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral is:\n\n<<<-2*exp(-8*x - 6) + C>>>"
