    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -x**3*exp(x) dx, we can use the method of integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nFor this integral, we can choose:\n- \\( u = -x^3 \\) which implies \\( du = -3*x^2 \\, dx \\)\n- \\( dv = exp(x) \\, dx \\) which implies \\( v = exp(x) \\)\n\nNow, applying the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ -x**3*exp(x) dx = -x**3*exp(x) - ∫ exp(x) * (-3*x**2) dx\n\nThe new integral ∫ 3*x**2*exp(x) dx can again be solved using integration by parts. We repeat the process:\n\nFor ∫ 3*x**2*exp(x) dx, choose:\n- \\( u = 3*x^2 \\) which implies \\( du = 6*x \\, dx \\)\n- \\( dv = exp(x) \\, dx \\) which implies \\( v = exp(x) \\)\n\nApplying integration by parts again:\n\n∫ 3*x**2*exp(x) dx = 3*x**2*exp(x) - ∫ exp(x) * 6*x dx\n\nNow, we have another integral ∫ 6*x*exp(x) dx. We apply integration by parts one more time:\n\nFor ∫ 6*x*exp(x) dx, choose:\n- \\( u = 6*x \\) which implies \\( du = 6 \\, dx \\)\n- \\( dv = exp(x) \\, dx \\) which implies \\( v = exp(x) \\)\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\n∫ 6*x*exp(x) dx = 6*x*exp(x) - ∫ exp(x) * 6 dx\n\nThe remaining integral ∫ 6*exp(x) dx is straightforward:\n\n∫ 6*exp(x) dx = 6*exp(x)\n\nNow, we can combine all these results to get the final expression for the original integral. Let's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, exp\n\nx = symbols('x')\nintegral = integrate(-x**3 * exp(x), x)\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the integral and provide the result.",
    "The code output provides the evaluated indefinite integral of the function \\(-x^3 \\cdot \\exp(x)\\). The result is:\n\n\\[\n(-x^3 + 3*x^2 - 6*x + 6) \\cdot \\exp(x) + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration. This result is obtained by applying the method of integration by parts iteratively, as explained in the reasoning process.\n\n<<<(-x**3 + 3*x**2 - 6*x + 6)*exp(x) + C>>>"
