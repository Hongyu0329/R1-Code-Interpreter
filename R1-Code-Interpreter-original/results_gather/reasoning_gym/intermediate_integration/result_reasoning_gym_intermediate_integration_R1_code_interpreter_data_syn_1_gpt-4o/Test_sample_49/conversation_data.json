    "To solve the indefinite integral ∫ -2*x**2*cos(3*x) dx, we can use the method of integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nIn this case, we need to choose u and dv such that the integration becomes simpler. A common strategy is to let u be a polynomial and dv be the remaining part of the integrand. Let's choose:\n\n- u = x**2, which implies that du = 2*x dx\n- dv = -2*cos(3*x) dx, which implies that v is the integral of dv\n\nTo find v, we need to integrate dv:\n\n∫ -2*cos(3*x) dx\n\nThe integral of cos(3*x) is (1/3)*sin(3*x), so:\n\nv = -2*(1/3)*sin(3*x) = -(2/3)*sin(3*x)\n\nNow, we can apply the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ -2*x**2*cos(3*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v du\n\nSubstituting the values of u, v, and du:\n\n= x**2*(-(2/3)*sin(3*x)) - ∫ (-(2/3)*sin(3*x))*(2*x) dx\n\n= -(2/3)*x**2*sin(3*x) + (4/3)∫ x*sin(3*x) dx\n\nNow, we need to solve the integral ∫ x*sin(3*x) dx using integration by parts again. Let's choose:\n\n- u = x, which implies that du = dx\n- dv = sin(3*x) dx, which implies that v is the integral of dv\n\nThe integral of sin(3*x) is -(1/3)*cos(3*x), so:\n\nv = -(1/3)*cos(3*x)\n\nNow, apply the integration by parts formula again:\n\n∫ x*sin(3*x) dx = u*v - ∫ v du\n\n= x*(-(1/3)*cos(3*x)) - ∫ (-(1/3)*cos(3*x)) dx\n\n= -(1/3)*x*cos(3*x) + (1/9)*sin(3*x)\n\nSubstitute this back into the original integration by parts result:\n\n∫ -2*x**2*cos(3*x) dx = -(2/3)*x**2*sin(3*x) + (4/3)*(-(1/3)*x*cos(3*x) + (1/9)*sin(3*x))\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n= -(2/3)*x**2*sin(3*x) - (4/9)*x*cos(3*x) + (4/27)*sin(3*x) + C\n\nLet's verify and simplify this using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, cos, sin\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = -2*x**2*cos(3*x)\n\n# Compute the indefinite integral\nintegral = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the indefinite integral using symbolic computation to verify our manual calculation.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The indefinite integral of ∫ -2*x**2*cos(3*x) dx is:\n\n- \\(-\\frac{2}{3}x^2\\sin(3x)\\)\n- \\(-\\frac{4}{9}x\\cos(3x)\\)\n- \\(+\\frac{4}{27}\\sin(3x)\\)\n\nThus, the final answer, including the constant of integration \\(C\\), is:\n\n<<<-2*x**2*sin(3*x)/3 - 4*x*cos(3*x)/9 + 4*sin(3*x)/27 + C>>>"
