    "\nassistant > To find the indefinite integral \\(\\int -\\exp(x) \\cdot \\cos(x) \\, dx\\), we can use the method of integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n\\[\n\\int u \\, dv = uv - \\int v \\, du\n\\]\n\nFor the integral \\(\\int -\\exp(x) \\cdot \\cos(x) \\, dx\\), we can choose:\n- \\(u = \\cos(x)\\) and \\(dv = -\\exp(x) \\, dx\\)\n\nThen, we differentiate and integrate to find \\(du\\) and \\(v\\):\n- \\(du = -\\sin(x) \\, dx\\)\n- \\(v = -\\exp(x)\\)\n\nNow, apply the integration by parts formula:\n\n\\[\n\\int -\\exp(x) \\cdot \\cos(x) \\, dx = -\\exp(x) \\cdot \\cos(x) - \\int (-\\exp(x)) \\cdot (-\\sin(x)) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the integral on the right:\n\n\\[\n= -\\exp(x) \\cdot \\cos(x) - \\int \\exp(x) \\cdot \\sin(x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to solve \\(\\int \\exp(x) \\cdot \\sin(x) \\, dx\\) using integration by parts again. Choose:\n- \\(u = \\sin(x)\\) and \\(dv = \\exp(x) \\, dx\\)\n\nThen, we differentiate and integrate to find \\(du\\) and \\(v\\):\n- \\(du = \\cos(x) \\, dx\\)\n- \\(v = \\exp(x)\\)\n\nApply the integration by parts formula again:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\exp(x) \\cdot \\sin(x) \\, dx = \\exp(x) \\cdot \\sin(x) - \\int \\exp(x) \\cdot \\cos(x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n1. \\(\\int -\\exp(x) \\cdot \\cos(x) \\, dx = -\\exp(x) \\cdot \\cos(x) - \\int \\exp(x) \\cdot \\sin(x) \\, dx\\)\n2. \\(\\int \\exp(x) \\cdot \\sin(x) \\, dx = \\exp(x) \\cdot \\sin(x) - \\int \\exp(x) \\cdot \\cos(x) \\, dx\\)\n\nLet's solve these equations to find the integral.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, exp, cos, sin, integrate, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the integrals\nI1 = symbols('I1')  # Integral of -exp(x)*cos(x)\nI2 = symbols('I2')  # Integral of exp(x)*sin(x)\n\n# Define the equations based on integration by parts\neq1 = Eq(I1, -exp(x)*cos(x) - I2)\neq2 = Eq(I2, exp(x)*sin(x) - I1)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (I1, I2))\nsolution[I1]\nassistant > It seems there was an error in accessing the solution.
