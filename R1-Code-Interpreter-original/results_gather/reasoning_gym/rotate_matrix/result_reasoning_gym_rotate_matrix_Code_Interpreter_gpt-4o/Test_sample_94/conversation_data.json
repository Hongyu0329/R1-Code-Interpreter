    "\nassistant > Rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it 0 degrees clockwise, as 900 degrees is a multiple of 360 degrees (900 % 360 = 180). Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n9 9\n7 3\n```\n\nThe output matrix after a 900-degree clockwise rotation is the same:\n```\n9 9\n7 3\n```\n\nSo, the output in the required format is:\n\n<<<\n9 9\n7 3\n>>>"
