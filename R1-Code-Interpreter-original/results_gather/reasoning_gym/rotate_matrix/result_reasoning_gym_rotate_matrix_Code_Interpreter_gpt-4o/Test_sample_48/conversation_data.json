    "\nassistant > Rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 0 degrees, as 900 degrees is a multiple of 360 degrees (900 % 360 = 180). Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged. \n\nHere is the original matrix:\n\n```\n6 8 6 5 5 8\n6 5 0 8 6 3\n9 0 6 3 2 8\n9 0 2 7 9 2\n2 3 5 5 9 2\n3 4 4 1 5 1\n```\n\nThe output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n6 8 6 5 5 8\n6 5 0 8 6 3\n9 0 6 3 2 8\n9 0 2 7 9 2\n2 3 5 5 9 2\n3 4 4 1 5 1\n>>>"
