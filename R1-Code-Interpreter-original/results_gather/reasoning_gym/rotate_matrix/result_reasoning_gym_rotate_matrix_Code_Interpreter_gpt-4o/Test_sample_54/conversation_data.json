    "\nassistant > Rotating a matrix by 720 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 0 degrees because 720 degrees is a full two rotations (360 degrees each). Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n8 5\n0 1\n```\n\nAfter rotating it by 720 degrees clockwise, the matrix remains the same:\n```\n8 5\n0 1\n```\n\nSo, the output in the required format is:\n\n<<<\n8 5\n0 1\n>>>"
