    "\nassistant > Rotating a matrix by 720 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 0 degrees, as 720 degrees is a full two rotations (360 degrees each). Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n\n```\n3 2 4\n3 7 0\n0 1 5\n```\n\nThe rotated matrix by 720 degrees clockwise is the same:\n\n```\n3 2 4\n3 7 0\n0 1 5\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<\n3 2 4\n3 7 0\n0 1 5\n>>>"
