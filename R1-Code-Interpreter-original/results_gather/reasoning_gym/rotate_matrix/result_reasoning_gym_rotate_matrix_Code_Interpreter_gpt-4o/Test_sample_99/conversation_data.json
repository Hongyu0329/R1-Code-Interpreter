    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given square matrix by 630 degrees clockwise. Since a full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation, we can simplify the problem by calculating the effective rotation:\n\n\\[ 630 \\mod 360 = 270 \\]\n\nThis means we need to rotate the matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n\nLet's perform this rotation on the given matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [5, 8, 1, 6, 4, 0, 6],\n    [1, 5, 9, 9, 1, 2, 3],\n    [8, 7, 7, 3, 3, 8, 0],\n    [2, 7, 9, 3, 6, 1, 0],\n    [7, 4, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2],\n    [1, 9, 5, 1, 8, 9, 6],\n    [3, 2, 9, 7, 5, 0, 2]\n])\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise (equivalent to 270 degrees clockwise)\nrotated_matrix = np.rot90(matrix, k=1)\n\nrotated_matrix.tolist()\nassistant > The matrix rotated by 630 degrees clockwise (or equivalently 270 degrees clockwise) is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n6 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 6 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 2 & 8 & 1 & 1 & 9 & 0 \\\\\n4 & 1 & 3 & 6 & 2 & 8 & 5 \\\\\n6 & 9 & 3 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 7 \\\\\n1 & 9 & 7 & 9 & 6 & 5 & 9 \\\\\n8 & 5 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 9 & 2 \\\\\n5 & 1 & 8 & 2 & 7 & 1 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<\n6 3 0 0 2 6 2\n0 2 8 1 1 9 0\n4 1 3 6 2 8 5\n6 9 3 3 1 1 7\n1 9 7 9 6 5 9\n8 5 7 7 4 9 2\n5 1 8 2 7 1 3\n>>>"
