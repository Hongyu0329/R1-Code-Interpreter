    "\nassistant > Rotating a matrix by 720 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 0 degrees, as 720 degrees is a full two rotations (360 degrees each). Therefore, the matrix will remain unchanged.\n\nHere is the original matrix:\n\n```\n0 8 7 5 6 0\n2 2 6 2 5 7\n0 0 8 6 7 0\n3 1 2 2 7 3\n4 7 7 6 1 0\n9 6 1 9 6 5\n```\n\nThe output matrix after rotating 720 degrees clockwise is:\n\n<<<\n0 8 7 5 6 0\n2 2 6 2 5 7\n0 0 8 6 7 0\n3 1 2 2 7 3\n4 7 7 6 1 0\n9 6 1 9 6 5\n>>>"
