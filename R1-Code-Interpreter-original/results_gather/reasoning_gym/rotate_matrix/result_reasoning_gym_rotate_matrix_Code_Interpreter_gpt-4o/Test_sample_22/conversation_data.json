    "\nassistant > To rotate a matrix clockwise, we need to understand the degree of rotation. A full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation. Therefore, a 630-degree rotation is equivalent to a 630 - 360 = 270-degree rotation clockwise.\n\nA 270-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. Let's perform this rotation on the given matrix:\n\n```\n7 8 4 7\n7 6 3 7\n5 9 6 3\n3 0 7 8\n```\n\nLet's compute the rotated matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [7, 8, 4, 7],\n    [7, 6, 3, 7],\n    [5, 9, 6, 3],\n    [3, 0, 7, 8]\n])\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise (equivalent to 270 degrees clockwise)\nrotated_matrix = np.rot90(matrix, k=1)\n\nrotated_matrix.tolist()\nassistant > The matrix rotated 630 degrees clockwise (or equivalently 270 degrees clockwise) is:\n\n```\n7 7 3 8\n4 3 6 7\n8 6 9 0\n7 7 5 3\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n7 7 3 8\n4 3 6 7\n8 6 9 0\n7 7 5 3\n>>>"
