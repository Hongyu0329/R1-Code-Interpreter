    "\nassistant > Rotating a matrix by 720 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 0 degrees because 720 degrees is a full two rotations (360 degrees each). Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nThe original matrix is:\n\n```\n9 5 2 8\n9 2 6 4\n9 6 9 9\n0 8 8 9\n```\n\nSo, the output matrix after a 720-degree rotation is the same as the input matrix:\n\n<<<\n9 5 2 8\n9 2 6 4\n9 6 9 9\n0 8 8 9\n>>>"
