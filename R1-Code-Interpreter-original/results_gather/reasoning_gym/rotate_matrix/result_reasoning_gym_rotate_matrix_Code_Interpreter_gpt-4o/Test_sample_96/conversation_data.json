    "\nassistant > To rotate a matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we first need to determine how many 90-degree rotations are equivalent to 450 degrees. Since a full rotation (360 degrees) is equivalent to 4 times 90 degrees, we can calculate:\n\n\\[ 450 \\div 90 = 5 \\]\n\nThis means we need to perform 5 rotations of 90 degrees each. However, since 4 rotations bring the matrix back to its original orientation, 5 rotations are equivalent to just 1 rotation of 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nLet's perform a single 90-degree clockwise rotation on the given matrix:\n\n```\n6 8 5 2 7\n0 2 5 8 4\n9 8 4 1 1\n0 4 5 1 7\n2 6 8 5 7\n```\n\nI'll calculate the rotated matrix now.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [6, 8, 5, 2, 7],\n    [0, 2, 5, 8, 4],\n    [9, 8, 4, 1, 1],\n    [0, 4, 5, 1, 7],\n    [2, 6, 8, 5, 7]\n])\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = np.rot90(matrix, -1)\n\nrotated_matrix\nassistant > The matrix rotated 450 degrees clockwise (equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation) is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 & 9 & 0 & 6 \\\\\n6 & 4 & 8 & 2 & 8 \\\\\n8 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 5 \\\\\n5 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 2 \\\\\n7 & 7 & 1 & 4 & 7 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<\n2 0 9 0 6\n6 4 8 2 8\n8 5 4 5 5\n5 1 1 8 2\n7 7 1 4 7\n>>>"
