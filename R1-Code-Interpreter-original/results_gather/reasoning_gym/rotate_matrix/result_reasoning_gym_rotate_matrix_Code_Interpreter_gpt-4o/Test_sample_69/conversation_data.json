    "\nassistant > Rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 180 degrees clockwise, since 900 degrees is equivalent to 2.5 full rotations (360 degrees per full rotation), and the half rotation (180 degrees) is what remains.\n\nTo rotate a matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we can reverse the order of the rows and then reverse the order of the elements in each row.\n\nLet's perform this operation on the given matrix:\n\n```\n8 5 7 0 8\n3 9 3 4 7\n3 5 7 1 4\n3 2 1 7 8\n5 3 7 5 3\n```\n\nWe'll rotate it by 180 degrees clockwise.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [8, 5, 7, 0, 8],\n    [3, 9, 3, 4, 7],\n    [3, 5, 7, 1, 4],\n    [3, 2, 1, 7, 8],\n    [5, 3, 7, 5, 3]\n])\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = np.rot90(matrix, 2)\n\nrotated_matrix.tolist()\nassistant > The matrix rotated by 900 degrees clockwise (equivalent to 180 degrees clockwise) is:\n\n```\n3 5 7 3 5\n8 7 1 2 3\n4 1 7 5 3\n7 4 3 9 3\n8 0 7 5 8\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<\n3 5 7 3 5\n8 7 1 2 3\n4 1 7 5 3\n7 4 3 9 3\n8 0 7 5 8\n>>>"
