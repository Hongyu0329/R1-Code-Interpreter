    "\nassistant > To rotate a matrix by a certain number of degrees, we need to determine how many 90-degree rotations are required. A 630-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to:\n\n\\[ 630 \\div 90 = 7 \\]\n\nThis means we need to perform 7 clockwise 90-degree rotations. However, since a full 360-degree rotation results in the matrix returning to its original orientation, we can simplify this by calculating the remainder when 7 is divided by 4 (since 4 rotations of 90 degrees each make a full 360 degrees):\n\n\\[ 7 \\mod 4 = 3 \\]\n\nThus, a 630-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to three 90-degree clockwise rotations. Let's perform these rotations on the given matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [6, 4, 7, 7, 0, 5, 3, 9, 5, 3],\n    [5, 8, 1, 8, 3, 5, 0, 6, 0, 5],\n    [2, 0, 7, 6, 5, 7, 6, 6, 1, 0],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 2, 9, 4, 1],\n    [2, 2, 1, 7, 6, 1, 4, 6, 6, 1],\n    [5, 8, 2, 2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9],\n    [6, 2, 6, 4, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 8],\n    [5, 8, 7, 9, 3, 8, 2, 9, 4, 0],\n    [5, 8, 0, 0, 9, 6, 5, 7, 7, 8],\n    [1, 9, 1, 4, 0, 5, 7, 4, 2, 5]\n])\n\n# Perform three 90-degree clockwise rotations\nrotated_matrix = np.rot90(matrix, k=-3)\n\nrotated_matrix.tolist()\nassistant > The matrix after rotating it 630 degrees clockwise (equivalent to three 90-degree clockwise rotations) is:\n\n```\n<<<\n3 5 0 1 1 9 8 0 8 5\n5 0 1 4 6 8 2 4 7 2\n9 6 6 9 6 6 2 9 7 4\n3 0 6 2 4 4 3 2 5 7\n5 5 7 8 1 1 3 8 6 5\n0 3 5 2 6 5 6 3 9 0\n7 8 6 8 7 2 4 9 0 4\n7 1 7 8 1 2 6 7 0 1\n4 8 0 8 2 8 2 8 8 9\n6 5 2 8 2 5 6 5 5 1\n>>>\n```"
