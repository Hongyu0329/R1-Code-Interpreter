    "\nassistant > Rotating a matrix by 720 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 0 degrees, as 720 degrees is a full two rotations (360 degrees each). Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nHere is the original matrix:\n\n```\n7 8 7 8 5\n7 0 0 2 5\n2 4 0 2 0\n5 3 7 3 3\n2 2 5 8 5\n```\n\nThe output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n7 8 7 8 5\n7 0 0 2 5\n2 4 0 2 0\n5 3 7 3 3\n2 2 5 8 5\n>>>"
