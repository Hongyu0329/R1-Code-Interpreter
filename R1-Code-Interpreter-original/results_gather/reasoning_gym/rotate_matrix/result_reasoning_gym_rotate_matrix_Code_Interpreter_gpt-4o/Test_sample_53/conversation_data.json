    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given matrix by 810 degrees clockwise. Since a full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation, we can simplify the problem by calculating the effective rotation:\n\n\\[ 810 \\mod 360 = 90 \\]\n\nThis means we need to rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. Let's perform this rotation on the given matrix:\n\n```\n9 1 5 3 3\n7 5 9 3 6\n8 8 3 9 9\n9 7 9 6 1\n0 8 1 6 7\n```\n\nLet's compute the rotated matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [9, 1, 5, 3, 3],\n    [7, 5, 9, 3, 6],\n    [8, 8, 3, 9, 9],\n    [9, 7, 9, 6, 1],\n    [0, 8, 1, 6, 7]\n])\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = np.rot90(matrix, k=-1)\n\nrotated_matrix\nassistant > The matrix rotated by 810 degrees clockwise (which is effectively a 90-degree clockwise rotation) is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 9 & 8 & 7 & 9 \\\\\n8 & 7 & 8 & 5 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 9 & 3 & 9 & 5 \\\\\n6 & 6 & 9 & 3 & 3 \\\\\n7 & 1 & 9 & 6 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<\n0 9 8 7 9\n8 7 8 5 1\n1 9 3 9 5\n6 6 9 3 3\n7 1 9 6 3\n>>>"
