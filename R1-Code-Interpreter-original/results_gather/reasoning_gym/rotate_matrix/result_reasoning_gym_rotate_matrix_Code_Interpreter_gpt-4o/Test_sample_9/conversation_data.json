    "\nassistant > To rotate a matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation. Therefore, a 540-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 180-degree clockwise rotation (since \\(540 - 360 = 180\\)).\n\nLet's perform a 180-degree clockwise rotation on the given matrix. A 180-degree rotation can be achieved by reversing the order of the rows and then reversing the order of the elements in each row.\n\nLet's perform this operation on the given matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [5, 3, 2, 6, 9, 4, 8, 4],\n    [6, 9, 0, 3, 0, 7, 2, 2],\n    [5, 2, 4, 9, 9, 0, 1, 9],\n    [0, 6, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7, 2],\n    [8, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 4],\n    [5, 3, 9, 0, 9, 9, 2, 6],\n    [0, 4, 6, 2, 1, 1, 6, 0],\n    [7, 6, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 7]\n])\n\n# Rotate the matrix 180 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = np.rot90(matrix, 2)\n\nrotated_matrix.tolist()\nassistant > The matrix rotated by 540 degrees clockwise (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation) is:\n\n```\n<<<\n7 1 2 1 0 3 6 7\n0 6 1 1 2 6 4 0\n6 2 9 9 0 9 3 5\n4 0 2 2 1 1 0 8\n2 7 5 1 3 4 6 0\n9 1 0 9 9 4 2 5\n2 2 7 0 3 0 9 6\n4 8 4 9 6 2 3 5\n>>>\n```"
