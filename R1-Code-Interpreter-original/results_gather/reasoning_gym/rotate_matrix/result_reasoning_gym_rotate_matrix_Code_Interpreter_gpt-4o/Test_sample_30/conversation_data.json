    "\nassistant > Rotating a matrix by 720 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 0 degrees, as 720 degrees is a full two rotations (360 degrees each). Therefore, the matrix will remain unchanged.\n\nThe original matrix is:\n\n```\n1 3 7 4\n5 2 8 2\n2 0 4 2\n1 0 7 7\n```\n\nSince the matrix remains unchanged after a 720-degree rotation, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n1 3 7 4\n5 2 8 2\n2 0 4 2\n1 0 7 7\n>>>"
