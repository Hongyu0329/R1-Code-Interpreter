    "\nassistant > To rotate a matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we first need to determine how many 90-degree rotations are equivalent to 450 degrees. Since a full rotation (360 degrees) is equivalent to 4 times 90 degrees, we can calculate:\n\n\\[ 450 \\div 90 = 5 \\]\n\nThis means we need to perform 5 rotations of 90 degrees each. However, since 4 rotations bring the matrix back to its original orientation, 5 rotations are effectively the same as 1 rotation (since \\(5 \\mod 4 = 1\\)).\n\nLet's perform a single 90-degree clockwise rotation on the given matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [9, 3, 6, 7, 4, 8, 1, 8],\n    [6, 8, 5, 0, 1, 8, 1, 2],\n    [7, 0, 8, 6, 9, 3, 4, 4],\n    [5, 5, 8, 1, 6, 8, 7, 4],\n    [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 3, 2, 7],\n    [3, 1, 7, 5, 5, 3, 2, 4],\n    [2, 3, 4, 2, 0, 9, 4, 2],\n    [0, 7, 6, 3, 3, 7, 8, 7]\n])\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = np.rot90(matrix, -1)\n\nrotated_matrix\nassistant > The matrix rotated 450 degrees clockwise (equivalent to a single 90-degree clockwise rotation) is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 5 & 7 & 6 & 9 \\\\\n7 & 3 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 0 & 8 & 3 \\\\\n6 & 4 & 7 & 4 & 8 & 8 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 5 & 6 & 1 & 6 & 0 & 7 \\\\\n3 & 0 & 5 & 7 & 6 & 9 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n7 & 9 & 3 & 3 & 8 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n8 & 4 & 2 & 2 & 7 & 4 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n7 & 2 & 4 & 7 & 4 & 4 & 2 & 8 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<\n0 2 3 2 5 7 6 9\n7 3 1 3 5 0 8 3\n6 4 7 4 8 8 5 6\n3 2 5 6 1 6 0 7\n3 0 5 7 6 9 1 4\n7 9 3 3 8 3 8 8\n8 4 2 2 7 4 1 1\n7 2 4 7 4 4 2 8\n>>>"
