    "\nassistant > Rotating a matrix by 720 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 0 degrees, as 720 degrees is a full two rotations (360 degrees each). Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nHere is the matrix after a 720-degree clockwise rotation:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n5 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n7 & 8 & 9 & 3 & 2 & 8 \\\\\n8 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 7 & 2 \\\\\n3 & 8 & 6 & 2 & 5 & 5 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 8 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n3 & 3 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSo, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n5 3 3 3 1 4\n7 8 9 3 2 8\n8 0 4 0 7 2\n3 8 6 2 5 5\n1 1 8 4 8 7\n3 3 3 1 1 3\n>>>"
