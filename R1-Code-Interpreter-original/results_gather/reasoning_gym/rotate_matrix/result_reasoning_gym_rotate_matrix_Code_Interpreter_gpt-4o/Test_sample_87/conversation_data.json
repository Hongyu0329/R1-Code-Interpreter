    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given matrix by 810 degrees clockwise. Since a full rotation (360 degrees) returns the matrix to its original orientation, we can simplify the problem by calculating the effective rotation:\n\n\\[ 810 \\mod 360 = 90 \\]\n\nThis means we only need to rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.
