    "\nassistant > To rotate a matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we first need to determine how many 90-degree rotations are equivalent to 450 degrees. Since a full rotation (360 degrees) is equivalent to 4 times 90 degrees, we can calculate:\n\n\\[ 450 \\div 90 = 5 \\]\n\nThis means we need to perform 5 rotations of 90 degrees each. However, since 4 rotations bring the matrix back to its original orientation, 5 rotations are effectively the same as 1 rotation (since \\(5 \\mod 4 = 1\\)).\n\nLet's perform a single 90-degree clockwise rotation on the given matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n9 & 2 & 5 \\\\\n8 & 9 & 5 \\\\\n4 & 9 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nAfter a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the matrix should look like this:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n9 & 9 & 2 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nLet's compute this rotation.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [9, 2, 5],\n    [8, 9, 5],\n    [4, 9, 2]\n])\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = np.rot90(matrix, -1)\n\nrotated_matrix\nassistant > The matrix after a 450-degree clockwise rotation (equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation) is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n9 & 9 & 2 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSo, the output in the required format is:\n\n<<<\n4 8 9\n9 9 2\n2 5 5\n>>>"
