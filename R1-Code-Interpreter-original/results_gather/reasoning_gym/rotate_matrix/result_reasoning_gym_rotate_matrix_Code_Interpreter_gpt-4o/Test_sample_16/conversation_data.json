    "\nassistant > To rotate a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation. Therefore, a 720-degree rotation is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, which means the matrix will remain unchanged.\n\nLet's represent the matrix and confirm that the output is the same as the input.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [5, 2, 8, 8, 4, 8, 3, 6, 2, 2],\n    [1, 7, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2, 7, 3],\n    [0, 1, 6, 1, 2, 7, 2, 2, 0, 8],\n    [4, 5, 5, 1, 3, 4, 4, 0, 9, 4],\n    [2, 5, 6, 2, 3, 6, 9, 4, 0, 5],\n    [1, 4, 9, 4, 9, 7, 1, 1, 3, 2],\n    [5, 7, 8, 5, 6, 1, 0, 5, 6, 6],\n    [5, 0, 9, 6, 7, 6, 9, 4, 2, 5],\n    [3, 7, 9, 3, 9, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4],\n    [9, 6, 9, 8, 8, 6, 9, 6, 0, 7]\n])\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 720 degrees (which is equivalent to no rotation)\nrotated_matrix = matrix\n\nrotated_matrix.tolist()\nassistant > It seems there was an issue with executing the code.
