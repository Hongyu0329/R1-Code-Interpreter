    "\nassistant > Rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 180 degrees clockwise, since 900 degrees is equivalent to 2.5 full rotations (360 degrees each), and the half rotation (180 degrees) is what affects the matrix.\n\nTo rotate a matrix 180 degrees clockwise, we can reverse the order of the rows and then reverse the order of the elements in each row.\n\nLet's perform this operation on the given matrix:\n\n```\n8 8 2 3 3\n8 4 6 8 7\n8 8 5 9 5\n6 4 6 0 1\n0 8 4 0 7\n```\n\nWe'll rotate it 180 degrees clockwise.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [8, 8, 2, 3, 3],\n    [8, 4, 6, 8, 7],\n    [8, 8, 5, 9, 5],\n    [6, 4, 6, 0, 1],\n    [0, 8, 4, 0, 7]\n])\n\n# Rotate the matrix 180 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = np.rot90(matrix, 2)\n\nrotated_matrix.tolist()\nassistant > The matrix rotated 180 degrees clockwise is:\n\n```\n7 0 4 8 0\n1 0 6 4 6\n5 9 5 8 8\n7 8 6 4 8\n3 3 2 8 8\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<\n7 0 4 8 0  \n1 0 6 4 6  \n5 9 5 8 8  \n7 8 6 4 8  \n3 3 2 8 8\n>>>"
