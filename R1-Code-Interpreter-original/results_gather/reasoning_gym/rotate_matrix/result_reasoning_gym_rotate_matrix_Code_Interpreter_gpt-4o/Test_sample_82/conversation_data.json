    "\nassistant > Rotating a matrix by 720 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 0 degrees, as 720 degrees is a full two rotations (360 degrees each). Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nThe original matrix is:\n\n```\n9 1 5 3 9\n0 2 8 8 8\n4 9 1 8 5\n5 1 1 7 6\n1 9 8 4 5\n```\n\nThus, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix:\n\n<<<\n9 1 5 3 9  \n0 2 8 8 8  \n4 9 1 8 5  \n5 1 1 7 6  \n1 9 8 4 5  \n>>>"
