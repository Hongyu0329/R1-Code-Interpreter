    "\nassistant > Rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 0 degrees, as 900 degrees is a multiple of 360 degrees (900 % 360 = 180). Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nThe original matrix is:\n```\n4 7 7\n2 5 1\n2 9 3\n```\n\nSo, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix:\n\n<<<\n4 7 7\n2 5 1\n2 9 3\n>>>"
