    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given matrix by 810 degrees clockwise. Since a full rotation (360 degrees) returns the matrix to its original orientation, we can simplify the problem by calculating the effective rotation:\n\n\\[ 810 \\mod 360 = 90 \\]\n\nThis means we need to rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. Let's perform this rotation on the given matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 1 & 5 & 4 \\\\\n0 & 4 & 5 & 0 \\\\\n9 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n5 & 9 & 8 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nLet's compute the rotated matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [4, 1, 5, 4],\n    [0, 4, 5, 0],\n    [9, 7, 8, 9],\n    [5, 9, 8, 2]\n])\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = np.rot90(matrix, -1)\n\nrotated_matrix\nassistant > The matrix rotated by 810 degrees clockwise (which is effectively a 90-degree clockwise rotation) is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n5 & 9 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n9 & 7 & 4 & 1 \\\\\n8 & 8 & 5 & 5 \\\\\n2 & 9 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<\n5 9 0 4\n9 7 4 1\n8 8 5 5\n2 9 0 4\n>>>"
