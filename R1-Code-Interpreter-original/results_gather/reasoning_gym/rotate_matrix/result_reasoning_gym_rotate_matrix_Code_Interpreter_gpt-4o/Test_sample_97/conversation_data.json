    "\nassistant > To rotate a matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we first need to determine how many 90-degree rotations are equivalent to 450 degrees. Since a full rotation (360 degrees) is equivalent to 4 times 90 degrees, we can calculate:\n\n\\[ 450 \\div 90 = 5 \\]\n\nThis means we need to rotate the matrix 5 times by 90 degrees clockwise. However, rotating a matrix 4 times (360 degrees) results in the original matrix, so effectively, we only need to rotate it once by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nLet's perform this rotation on the given matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [4, 0, 6, 3, 5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 2],\n    [4, 9, 3, 2, 7, 9, 7, 2, 1, 4],\n    [1, 4, 1, 6, 0, 3, 9, 2, 1, 3],\n    [7, 0, 4, 9, 4, 5, 2, 5, 7, 8],\n    [9, 1, 8, 2, 3, 2, 8, 7, 2, 9],\n    [5, 4, 9, 5, 9, 7, 5, 5, 2, 8],\n    [2, 6, 3, 0, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 8],\n    [8, 1, 9, 6, 2, 3, 0, 0, 5, 6],\n    [2, 0, 2, 8, 2, 9, 4, 6, 4, 6],\n    [6, 6, 4, 9, 3, 8, 3, 7, 0, 9]\n])\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = np.rot90(matrix, -1)\n\nrotated_matrix\nassistant > The matrix rotated 450 degrees clockwise (or effectively 90 degrees clockwise) is:\n\n```\n[[6, 2, 8, 2, 5, 9, 7, 1, 4, 4],\n [6, 0, 1, 6, 4, 1, 0, 4, 9, 0],\n [4, 2, 9, 3, 9, 8, 4, 1, 3, 6],\n [9, 8, 6, 0, 5, 2, 9, 6, 2, 3],\n [3, 2, 2, 3, 9, 3, 4, 0, 7, 5],\n [8, 9, 3, 2, 7, 2, 5, 3, 9, 3],\n [3, 4, 0, 3, 5, 8, 2, 9, 7, 1],\n [7, 6, 0, 4, 5, 7, 5, 2, 2, 8],\n [0, 4, 5, 3, 2, 2, 7, 1, 1, 2],\n [9, 6, 6, 8, 8, 9, 8, 3, 4, 2]]\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<\n[[6, 2, 8, 2, 5, 9, 7, 1, 4, 4],\n [6, 0, 1, 6, 4, 1, 0, 4, 9, 0],\n [4, 2, 9, 3, 9, 8, 4, 1, 3, 6],\n [9, 8, 6, 0, 5, 2, 9, 6, 2, 3],\n [3, 2, 2, 3, 9, 3, 4, 0, 7, 5],\n [8, 9, 3, 2, 7, 2, 5, 3, 9, 3],\n [3, 4, 0, 3, 5, 8, 2, 9, 7, 1],\n [7, 6, 0, 4, 5, 7, 5, 2, 2, 8],\n [0, 4, 5, 3, 2, 2, 7, 1, 1, 2],\n [9, 6, 6, 8, 8, 9, 8, 3, 4, 2]]\n>>>"
