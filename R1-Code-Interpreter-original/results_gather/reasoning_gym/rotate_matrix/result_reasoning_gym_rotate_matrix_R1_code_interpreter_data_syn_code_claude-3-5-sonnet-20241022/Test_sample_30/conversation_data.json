    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We need to rotate a 4x4 matrix clockwise by 720 degrees\n   - 720 degrees means we need to rotate it 2 complete rotations (360° × 2)\n   - Since we're rotating twice completely, the final result will be the same as the original matrix!\n\n2) Let's verify this with code. I'll write a function that:\n   - Takes a matrix as input\n   - Can rotate it clockwise by 90 degrees\n   - Apply the rotation multiple times for 720 degrees (8 times)\n   - Compare the result with the original matrix\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix of the same size\n    rotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 3, 7, 4],\n    [5, 2, 8, 2],\n    [2, 0, 4, 2],\n    [1, 0, 7, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate 720 degrees (8 times 90 degrees)\nresult = matrix\nfor _ in range(8):\n    result = rotate_90_clockwise(result)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\", end=\"\")\nfor i in range(len(result)):\n    for j in range(len(result[i])):\n        print(result[i][j], end=\"\")\n        if j < len(result[i]) - 1:\n            print(\" \", end=\"\")\n    if i < len(result) - 1:\n        print(\"\\n\", end=\"\")\nprint(\">>>\")\n```\n\nAs we expected, rotating a matrix by 720 degrees (which is 2 complete rotations) will give us back the original matrix. \n\n<<<1 3 7 4\n5 2 8 2\n2 0 4 2\n1 0 7 7>>>",
    "Since there were no errors in the code execution and we got the correct output, let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) A 720-degree rotation is equivalent to two full rotations (360° × 2)\n2) When you rotate something by 360 degrees, it returns to its original position\n3) Therefore, rotating by 720 degrees means:\n   - First 360 degrees brings it back to original position\n   - Second 360 degrees again brings it back to original position\n\nThis is why the output matrix is identical to the input matrix. The code verified this by:\n1) Implementing a 90-degree clockwise rotation function\n2) Applying this rotation 8 times (90° × 8 = 720°)\n3) Confirming that we get back the original matrix\n\nTherefore, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<1 3 7 4\n5 2 8 2\n2 0 4 2\n1 0 7 7>>>"
