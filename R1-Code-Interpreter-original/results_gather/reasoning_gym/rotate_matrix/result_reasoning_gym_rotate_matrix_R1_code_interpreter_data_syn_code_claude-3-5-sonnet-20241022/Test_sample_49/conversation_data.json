    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 10x10 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 540 degrees clockwise\n   - 540 degrees = 360 degrees + 180 degrees = 1.5 full rotations\n   - Since 360 degrees brings us back to the original position, we just need to rotate 180 degrees\n\n2) For a 180-degree rotation:\n   - Each element (i,j) moves to position (n-1-i, n-1-j)\n   - We can do this in a single pass\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix to store the result\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Rotate 180 degrees\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            result[n-1-i][n-1-j] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 5, 8, 8, 6, 7, 0, 2, 2, 7],\n    [9, 0, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4, 2, 9, 1],\n    [3, 8, 4, 9, 8, 2, 5, 2, 6, 3],\n    [7, 3, 7, 0, 8, 6, 5, 4, 5, 4],\n    [9, 5, 1, 2, 0, 6, 4, 4, 2, 3],\n    [7, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 9, 4, 6, 0],\n    [0, 6, 8, 2, 2, 1, 6, 6, 3, 0],\n    [9, 5, 0, 3, 5, 7, 6, 4, 1, 6],\n    [0, 6, 3, 1, 0, 8, 7, 3, 5, 4],\n    [9, 9, 0, 7, 8, 6, 8, 5, 3, 4]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nresult = \"\"\nfor row in rotated:\n    result += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(result.strip())\n```\n\nNow that we have the result, let me format it properly for the answer:\n\n<<<4 3 5 8 6 8 7 0 9 9\n4 5 3 7 8 0 1 3 6 0\n6 1 4 6 7 5 3 0 5 9\n0 3 6 6 1 2 2 8 6 0\n0 6 4 9 2 1 3 3 1 7\n3 2 4 4 6 0 2 1 5 9\n4 5 4 5 6 8 0 7 3 7\n3 6 2 5 2 8 9 4 8 3\n1 9 2 4 3 5 4 5 0 9\n7 2 2 0 7 6 8 8 5 7>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output matches our expected result. Let me explain why this is correct:\n\n1) For a 540-degree rotation:\n   - 540° = 360° + 180°\n   - A 360° rotation brings the matrix back to its original position\n   - So we only needed to perform a 180° rotation\n\n2) In a 180° rotation:\n   - The element at position (0,0) moves to (9,9)\n   - The element at position (0,1) moves to (9,8)\n   - And so on...\n   - Generally, element at (i,j) moves to (n-1-i, n-1-j)\n\n3) Verification:\n   - Looking at some key positions:\n     * Original (0,0) = 7 → rotated (9,9) = 7\n     * Original (0,9) = 7 → rotated (9,0) = 7\n     * Original (9,0) = 9 → rotated (0,9) = 9\n     * Original (9,9) = 4 → rotated (0,0) = 4\n\nThe output is correct, so I can provide the final answer:\n\n<<<4 3 5 8 6 8 7 0 9 9\n4 5 3 7 8 0 1 3 6 0\n6 1 4 6 7 5 3 0 5 9\n0 3 6 6 1 2 2 8 6 0\n0 6 4 9 2 1 3 3 1 7\n3 2 4 4 6 0 2 1 5 9\n4 5 4 5 6 8 0 7 3 7\n3 6 2 5 2 8 9 4 8 3\n1 9 2 4 3 5 4 5 0 9\n7 2 2 0 7 6 8 8 5 7>>>"
