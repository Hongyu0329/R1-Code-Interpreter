    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 6x6 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 810 degrees clockwise\n   - 810 degrees = 810 ÷ 90 = 9 rotations of 90 degrees\n   - Since 360 degrees makes a complete rotation, 810 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees (810 % 360 = 90)\n   - So we only need to rotate the matrix once clockwise\n\n2) Let's write a Python program to:\n   - Convert the input string to a matrix\n   - Create a function to rotate 90 degrees clockwise\n   - Apply the rotation\n   - Format the output properly\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]\n    \n    # Reverse each row\n    for i in range(n):\n        matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]\n    return matrix\n\n# Input matrix\ninput_str = \"\"\"8 0 2 0 6 4\n5 0 5 2 6 4\n6 0 8 7 9 6\n0 3 3 1 6 5\n3 2 6 3 5 8\n4 6 2 1 7 8\"\"\"\n\n# Convert input to matrix\nmatrix = [list(map(int, row.split())) for row in input_str.splitlines()]\n\n# Calculate effective rotation (810 % 360 = 90 degrees)\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format output\noutput = '\\n'.join(' '.join(map(str, row)) for row in rotated_matrix)\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThe process:\n1) The input matrix is converted into a 2D list\n2) For a 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n   - First transpose the matrix (swap elements across the main diagonal)\n   - Then reverse each row\n3) Since 810 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees (one rotation), we only need to rotate once\n4) Format the output with spaces between numbers and newlines between rows\n\nThe output will be the matrix rotated 90 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to 810 degrees clockwise.\n\n<<<4 3 0 6 5 8\n6 2 3 0 0 0\n2 6 3 8 5 2\n1 3 1 7 2 0\n7 5 6 9 6 6\n8 8 5 6 4 4>>>",
    "Since there were no errors and the code executed successfully, I can confirm that this is the correct answer. Let me verify why this is correct:\n\n1) The original rotation of 810 degrees was simplified to 90 degrees because:\n   - 810 ÷ 360 = 2 complete rotations + 90 degrees\n   - Therefore, 810° ≡ 90° (mod 360°)\n\n2) The rotation was performed correctly:\n   - Original first row: 8 0 2 0 6 4\n   - Became the last column: 8 4 4\n   - Original last row: 4 6 2 1 7 8\n   - Became the first row: 4 3 0 6 5 8\n\n3) The pattern of the rotation is consistent throughout the matrix.\n\nTherefore, I can confirm:\n\n<<<4 3 0 6 5 8\n6 2 3 0 0 0\n2 6 3 8 5 2\n1 3 1 7 2 0\n7 5 6 9 6 6\n8 8 5 6 4 4>>>"
