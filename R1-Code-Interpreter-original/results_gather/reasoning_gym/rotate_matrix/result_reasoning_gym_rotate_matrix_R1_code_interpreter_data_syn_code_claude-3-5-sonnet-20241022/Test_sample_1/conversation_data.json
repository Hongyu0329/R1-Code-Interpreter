    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what rotating 360 degrees means:\n   - A 360-degree rotation is equivalent to no rotation at all\n   - This means the output matrix should be exactly the same as the input matrix\n\n2) However, let's write a code that can handle any degree of rotation (90, 180, 270, 360) for future use:\n   - For a 90-degree clockwise rotation: transpose and reverse each row\n   - For multiple rotations: repeat the process\n\n3) Let's write a Python code to implement this:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix(matrix, degrees):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Number of 90-degree rotations needed\n    rotations = (degrees // 90) % 4\n    \n    result = [row[:] for row in matrix]  # Create a copy of input matrix\n    \n    for _ in range(rotations):\n        # Transpose\n        result = [[result[j][i] for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]\n        # Reverse each row\n        for i in range(n):\n            result[i] = result[i][::-1]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 4, 7, 8],\n    [8, 2, 9, 8],\n    [5, 8, 7, 7],\n    [4, 1, 4, 6]\n]\n\n# Rotate 360 degrees\nrotated = rotate_matrix(matrix, 360)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\\n\".join(\" \".join(str(x) for x in row) for row in rotated)\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nSince we're rotating by 360 degrees, which is equivalent to no rotation at all, the output matrix should be identical to the input matrix.\n\n<<<3 4 7 8\n8 2 9 8\n5 8 7 7\n4 1 4 6>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the result is correct. Let me explain why:\n\n1) For a 360-degree rotation:\n   - 360 degrees = 4 Ã— 90 degrees\n   - After 4 rotations of 90 degrees, we get back to the original matrix\n   - Therefore, the output matrix is identical to the input matrix\n\n2) We can verify this mathematically:\n   - Each 90-degree rotation transforms the matrix\n   - After 4 such rotations (360 degrees), we return to the original state\n   - This is because matrix rotation is cyclical with a period of 4\n\n3) The output shows:\n   ```\n   3 4 7 8\n   8 2 9 8\n   5 8 7 7\n   4 1 4 6\n   ```\n   Which is exactly the same as the input matrix, confirming our solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<3 4 7 8\n8 2 9 8\n5 8 7 7\n4 1 4 6>>>"
