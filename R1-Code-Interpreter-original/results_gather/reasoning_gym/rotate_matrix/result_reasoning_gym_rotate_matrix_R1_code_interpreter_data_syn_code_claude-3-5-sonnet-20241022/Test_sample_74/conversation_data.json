    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise means:\n   - The first row becomes the last column\n   - The second row becomes the second-to-last column\n   - And so on...\n\n2) For a 9x9 matrix, we need to:\n   - Parse the input string into a matrix\n   - Perform the rotation\n   - Format the output\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Parse the input matrix\ninput_str = \"\"\"0 8 8 7 0 4 1 3 7\n5 6 7 4 3 7 4 7 2\n2 4 5 7 5 1 4 5 5\n2 2 6 1 0 1 5 1 2\n5 7 8 4 9 4 7 7 6\n3 2 2 7 3 2 3 3 5\n9 8 3 2 5 4 2 9 5\n8 7 8 6 3 6 3 8 5\n6 6 2 2 9 0 5 8 8\"\"\"\n\n# Convert input string to matrix\nmatrix = [list(map(int, row.split())) for row in input_str.strip().split('\\n')]\n\n# Create rotated matrix\nn = len(matrix)\nrotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Perform rotation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Format output\nresult = '\\n'.join(' '.join(str(num) for num in row) for row in rotated)\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThe code:\n1) Parses the input string into a 2D list\n2) Creates a new matrix for the rotated result\n3) Performs the rotation using the formula: rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n4) Formats the output according to the specified format\n\nThe rotation works by:\n- For each element at position (i,j) in the original matrix\n- It goes to position (j,n-1-i) in the rotated matrix\n- This effectively rotates each element 90 degrees clockwise\n\nThe output will be the rotated matrix in the required format.\n\n<<<6 8 9 3 5 2 0 5 0\n6 7 8 2 7 2 8 6 8\n2 8 3 2 8 6 8 7 8\n2 6 2 7 4 1 7 4 7\n9 3 5 3 9 0 5 3 0\n0 6 4 2 4 1 1 7 4\n5 3 2 3 7 5 4 4 1\n8 8 9 3 7 1 5 7 3\n8 5 5 5 6 2 5 2 7>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix. Let me verify if this is correct by checking a few key positions:\n\n1) First row of original (0 8 8 7 0 4 1 3 7) should become last column of rotated matrix (7 8 8 7 0 4 1 3 0)\n2) First column of original (0 5 2 2 5 3 9 8 6) should become first row of rotated (6 8 9 3 5 2 2 5 0)\n3) Last row of original (6 6 2 2 9 0 5 8 8) should become first column of rotated (8 6 2 2 9 0 5 8 8)\n\nThe rotation is correct. The matrix has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise, where:\n- Top row became rightmost column\n- Bottom row became leftmost column\n- Left column became top row\n- Right column became bottom row\n\n<<<6 8 9 3 5 2 2 5 0\n6 7 8 2 7 2 4 6 8\n2 8 3 2 8 6 5 7 8\n2 6 2 7 4 1 7 4 7\n9 3 5 3 9 0 5 3 0\n0 6 4 2 4 1 1 7 4\n5 3 2 3 7 5 4 4 1\n8 8 9 3 7 1 5 7 3\n8 5 5 5 6 2 5 2 7>>>"
