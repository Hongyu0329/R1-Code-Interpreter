    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 10x10 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 450 degrees clockwise\n   - 450 degrees = 360 degrees + 90 degrees, which means we just need to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise\n\n2) For a single 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n   - First row becomes last column\n   - Second row becomes second-to-last column\n   - And so on...\n\n3) Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Create a function to rotate 90 degrees\n   - Apply the rotation equivalent to 450 degrees\n   - Format the output properly\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with dimensions swapped\n    rotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 0, 6, 3, 5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 2],\n    [4, 9, 3, 2, 7, 9, 7, 2, 1, 4],\n    [1, 4, 1, 6, 0, 3, 9, 2, 1, 3],\n    [7, 0, 4, 9, 4, 5, 2, 5, 7, 8],\n    [9, 1, 8, 2, 3, 2, 8, 7, 2, 9],\n    [5, 4, 9, 5, 9, 7, 5, 5, 2, 8],\n    [2, 6, 3, 0, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 8],\n    [8, 1, 9, 6, 2, 3, 0, 0, 5, 6],\n    [2, 0, 2, 8, 2, 9, 4, 6, 4, 6],\n    [6, 6, 4, 9, 3, 8, 3, 7, 0, 9]\n]\n\n# 450 degrees = 360 + 90 degrees = 1 rotation of 90 degrees\nresult = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format and print the result\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in result:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\n4) After executing the code, we can format the output in the required format.\n\n<<<6 2 8 2 5 9 7 1 4 4\n6 0 1 6 4 1 0 4 9 0\n4 2 9 3 9 8 4 1 3 6\n9 8 6 0 5 2 9 6 2 3\n3 2 2 3 9 3 4 0 7 5\n8 9 3 2 7 2 5 3 9 3\n3 4 0 3 5 8 2 9 7 1\n7 6 0 4 5 7 5 2 2 8\n0 4 5 3 2 2 7 1 1 2\n9 6 6 8 8 9 8 3 4 2>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors. Let me verify the solution:\n\n1) The rotation of 450 degrees is equivalent to a rotation of 90 degrees (since 450 = 360 + 90, and 360 degrees brings us back to the original position).\n\n2) Looking at the output matrix, we can verify that:\n   - The first row of the original matrix (4 0 6 3 5 3 1 8 2 2) became the last column of the rotated matrix (read from top to bottom: 4 0 6 3 5 3 1 8 2 2)\n   - The last row of the original matrix (6 6 4 9 3 8 3 7 0 9) became the first column of the rotated matrix (read from top to bottom: 6 6 4 9 3 8 3 7 0 9)\n   - All other rows and columns follow the same pattern\n\n3) The transformation is correct and the output format matches the requirement.\n\n<<<6 2 8 2 5 9 7 1 4 4\n6 0 1 6 4 1 0 4 9 0\n4 2 9 3 9 8 4 1 3 6\n9 8 6 0 5 2 9 6 2 3\n3 2 2 3 9 3 4 0 7 5\n8 9 3 2 7 2 5 3 9 3\n3 4 0 3 5 8 2 9 7 1\n7 6 0 4 5 7 5 2 2 8\n0 4 5 3 2 2 7 1 1 2\n9 6 6 8 8 9 8 3 4 2>>>"
