    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   * We have a 2x2 matrix\n   * We need to rotate it 900 degrees clockwise\n   * 900 degrees = 900/90 = 10 rotations (as each clockwise rotation is 90 degrees)\n   * So we need to rotate the matrix 10 times\n\n2) For a single 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n   * First row becomes last column\n   * Second row becomes first column (from bottom to top)\n\n3) Let's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix of same size\n    rotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    return rotated\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [[9, 9],\n          [7, 3]]\n\n# Rotate 10 times (900 degrees)\nresult = matrix\nfor _ in range(10):\n    result = rotate_90_clockwise(result)\n\n# Print the result in required format\nprint('\\n'.join(' '.join(str(x) for x in row) for row in result))\n```\n\n4) Let's analyze what happens:\n   * 90 degrees rotation: 4 times to get back to original\n   * 900 degrees = 10 rotations\n   * 10 ÷ 4 = 2 remainder 2\n   * This means after 900 degrees, it's the same as rotating 180 degrees (2 rotations)\n\n5) After executing the code, we can see that rotating 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating 180 degrees, which means:\n   * The top-left number (9) will move to bottom-right\n   * The top-right number (9) will move to bottom-left\n   * The bottom-left number (7) will move to top-right\n   * The bottom-right number (3) will move to top-left\n\n<<<3 7\n9 9>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and provided the expected output. Let me confirm why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) A 900-degree rotation can be simplified:\n   * 900° = 90° × 10\n   * One complete rotation is 360°\n   * 900° ÷ 360° = 2.5 complete rotations\n   * 2 complete rotations = 720°\n   * Remaining 180° (equivalent to two 90° rotations)\n\n2) Therefore, a 900° rotation is equivalent to a 180° rotation.\n\n3) For a 180° rotation:\n   * The top-left element (9) moves to bottom-right\n   * The top-right element (9) moves to bottom-left\n   * The bottom-left element (7) moves to top-right\n   * The bottom-right element (3) moves to top-left\n\n4) Original matrix:\n   9 9\n   7 3\n\n5) After 180° rotation (or 900° rotation):\n   3 7\n   9 9\n\nThe code output matches our logical reasoning, so we can confirm the answer.\n\n<<<3 7\n9 9>>>"
