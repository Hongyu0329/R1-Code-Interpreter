    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what a 540-degree rotation means:\n   * 360 degrees = full rotation (back to original)\n   * 540 degrees = 360 + 180 degrees\n   * So, we need to rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\n\n2) For a 180-degree rotation:\n   * Each element (i,j) moves to position (n-1-i, n-1-j)\n   * We can do this in a single pass\n\nLet's write code to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix to store the result\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Rotate 180 degrees\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            result[n-1-i][n-1-j] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 7, 3, 6, 6],\n    [9, 2, 3, 6, 8],\n    [3, 2, 7, 6, 6],\n    [4, 6, 3, 5, 7],\n    [0, 5, 3, 9, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nresult = \"\"\nfor row in rotated:\n    result += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(result.strip())\n```\n\nNow that we have the rotated matrix, let's format it properly for the answer:\n\n<<<7 9 3 5 0\n7 5 3 6 4\n6 6 7 2 3\n8 6 3 2 9\n6 6 3 7 5>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and provided the output. Let me verify if this is the correct answer.\n\nFor a 540-degree rotation:\n1) 540° = 360° + 180°\n2) A 360° rotation brings the matrix back to its original position\n3) Then the additional 180° rotation is what gives us our final result\n4) The 180° rotation moves each element (i,j) to position (n-1-i, n-1-j)\n\nLooking at the output:\n- The original top-left element (5) is now at the bottom-right\n- The original top-right element (6) is now at the bottom-left\n- The original bottom-left element (0) is now at the top-right\n- The original bottom-right element (7) is now at the top-left\n\nThis matches what we expect from a 180° rotation (which is equivalent to a 540° rotation), so our answer is correct.\n\n<<<7 9 3 5 0\n7 5 3 6 4\n6 6 7 2 3\n8 6 3 2 9\n6 6 3 7 5>>>"
