    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what a 0-degree clockwise rotation means:\n   - A 0-degree rotation means the matrix remains unchanged\n   - We just need to return the matrix in the same format\n\n2) Let's write code to handle this:\n   - Read the input matrix\n   - Format it properly for output\n   - No actual rotation needed since it's 0 degrees\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 0, 9],\n    [9, 3, 8],\n    [2, 9, 8]\n]\n\n# For 0-degree rotation, we just format the output\nresult = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    result += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\n\n# Remove the last newline and print\nprint(result.strip())\n```\n\nSince this is a 0-degree rotation, the matrix should remain exactly the same as the input.\n\n<<<6 0 9\n9 3 8\n2 9 8>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Since this was a 0-degree rotation, the matrix remained unchanged from the input:\n6 0 9\n9 3 8\n2 9 8\n\nThis is correct because:\n1) A 0-degree rotation means no change to the original matrix\n2) The elements maintained their original positions\n3) The output format matches the required format with space-separated numbers and newlines between rows\n\n<<<6 0 9\n9 3 8\n2 9 8>>>"
