    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what a 540-degree clockwise rotation means:\n   * 360 degrees = full rotation (back to original)\n   * 540 degrees = 360 + 180 degrees\n   * So, we need to rotate the matrix 1.5 times\n\n2) For matrix rotation:\n   * Each 90-degree clockwise rotation can be achieved by:\n     - First transposing the matrix\n     - Then reversing each row\n\n3) For 540 degrees:\n   * We need to perform 90-degree rotation 6 times\n   * Or we can observe that 540° = 180° (which means flip upside down and left to right)\n\n4) Let's write code to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_540(matrix):\n    # For 540 degrees (180 degrees), we just need to reverse the matrix\n    # both vertically and horizontally\n    n = len(matrix)\n    \n    # Create a string representation of the rotated matrix\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):  # reverse rows\n        row = matrix[i][::-1]  # reverse elements in each row\n        result.append(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n    \n    return '<<<' + '\\n'.join(result) + '>>>'\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 5, 9, 2],\n    [3, 3, 7, 2],\n    [1, 5, 0, 3],\n    [1, 7, 4, 2]\n]\n\nprint(rotate_540(matrix))\n```\n\nLet's understand why this works:\n* A 540° rotation is equivalent to a 180° rotation\n* For a 180° rotation, we just need to:\n  - Reverse the order of rows (top to bottom becomes bottom to top)\n  - Reverse the order of elements in each row (left to right becomes right to left)\n\nThe output will be the matrix rotated by 540° clockwise.\n\n<<<2 4 7 1\n3 0 5 1\n2 7 3 3\n2 9 5 7>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the correct output. Let me verify the result:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n7 5 9 2\n3 3 7 2\n1 5 0 3\n1 7 4 2\n\nAfter 540° clockwise rotation (which is equivalent to 180° rotation):\n2 4 7 1\n3 0 5 1\n2 7 3 3\n2 9 5 7\n\nThe result is correct because:\n1) 540° = 360° + 180° = 180° (since 360° brings us back to the original)\n2) A 180° rotation means:\n   - The top row becomes the bottom row and vice versa\n   - The leftmost column becomes the rightmost column and vice versa\n   - Each element moves to its opposite position in the matrix\n\nWe can verify this by checking a few elements:\n- Top-left 7 moved to bottom-right 7\n- Top-right 2 moved to bottom-left 2\n- Center elements have swapped positions accordingly\n\nTherefore, I can confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<2 4 7 1\n3 0 5 1\n2 7 3 3\n2 9 5 7>>>"
