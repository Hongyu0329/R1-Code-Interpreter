    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 6x6 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 900 degrees clockwise\n   - 900 degrees = 2.5 full rotations (360° × 2 + 180°)\n   - This means we need to rotate it 180° (as half rotation is same as 2.5 rotations)\n\n2) For matrix rotation:\n   - For 180° rotation, we can simply reverse the matrix both horizontally and vertically\n   - Or we can just read the matrix from bottom-right to top-left\n\n3) Let's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 8, 6, 5, 5, 8],\n    [6, 5, 0, 8, 6, 3],\n    [9, 0, 6, 3, 2, 8],\n    [9, 0, 2, 7, 9, 2],\n    [2, 3, 5, 5, 9, 2],\n    [3, 4, 4, 1, 5, 1]\n]\n\n# For 900 degrees (which is equivalent to 180 degrees),\n# we just need to reverse the matrix both row-wise and column-wise\nrotated = matrix[::-1]  # reverse rows\nrotated = [row[::-1] for row in rotated]  # reverse each row\n\n# Format the output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in rotated:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\n4) After executing the code, we can format the output properly.\n\n<<<1 5 1 4 4 3\n2 9 5 5 3 2\n2 9 7 2 0 9\n8 2 3 6 0 9\n3 6 8 0 5 6\n8 5 5 6 8 6>>>",
    "Based on the code execution output, I can confirm that the solution is correct. Let me explain why:\n\n1) For a 900-degree clockwise rotation:\n   - 900° = 360° × 2 + 180°\n   - This means after two full rotations (which bring us back to the original position) plus a half rotation (180°)\n   - Therefore, a 900° rotation is equivalent to a 180° rotation\n\n2) The code correctly:\n   - First reversed the rows (matrix[::-1])\n   - Then reversed each row (row[::-1])\n   - This effectively rotates the matrix 180°\n\n3) Looking at the original matrix and the result:\n   - Original top-left (6) is now bottom-right (6)\n   - Original top-right (8) is now bottom-left (8)\n   - Original bottom-left (3) is now top-right (3)\n   - Original bottom-right (1) is now top-left (1)\n   - All other elements follow the same pattern\n\n4) The output is properly formatted with spaces between numbers and newlines between rows.\n\n<<<1 5 1 4 4 3\n2 9 5 5 3 2\n2 9 7 2 0 9\n8 2 3 6 0 9\n3 6 8 0 5 6\n8 5 5 6 8 6>>>"
