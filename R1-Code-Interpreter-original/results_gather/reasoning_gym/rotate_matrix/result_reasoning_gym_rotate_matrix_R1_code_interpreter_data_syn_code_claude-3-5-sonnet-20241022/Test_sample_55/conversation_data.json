    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise means:\n   - The first row becomes the last column\n   - The second row becomes the second-to-last column\n   - And so on...\n\n2) For a 4Ã—4 matrix, we need to:\n   - First row [3,8,1,4] becomes last column [1,5,5,3]\n   - Second row [5,8,5,1] becomes third column [7,0,8,8]\n   - Third row [5,0,4,6] becomes second column [8,4,5,1]\n   - Fourth row [1,7,8,9] becomes first column [9,6,1,4]\n\n3) Let's write code to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 8, 1, 4],\n    [5, 8, 5, 1],\n    [5, 0, 4, 6],\n    [1, 7, 8, 9]\n]\n\n# Function to rotate matrix\ndef rotate_matrix(mat):\n    n = len(mat)\n    # Create new rotated matrix\n    rotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[j][n-1-i] = mat[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated\n\n# Get rotated matrix\nresult = rotate_matrix(matrix)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in result:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nNow that we have the rotated matrix, let's format it according to the requirements:\n\n<<<1 5 5 3\n7 0 8 8\n8 4 5 1\n9 6 1 4>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Let me verify the rotation:\n\n1) Original matrix:\n   3 8 1 4\n   5 8 5 1\n   5 0 4 6\n   1 7 8 9\n\n2) After 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n   1 5 5 3\n   7 0 8 8\n   8 4 5 1\n   9 6 1 4\n\nThe rotation is correct because:\n- First row [3,8,1,4] became last column [3,8,1,4]\n- Second row [5,8,5,1] became third column [5,8,5,1]\n- Third row [5,0,4,6] became second column [5,0,4,6]\n- Fourth row [1,7,8,9] became first column [1,7,8,9]\n\nTherefore, I can provide the final answer:\n\n<<<1 5 5 3\n7 0 8 8\n8 4 5 1\n9 6 1 4>>>"
