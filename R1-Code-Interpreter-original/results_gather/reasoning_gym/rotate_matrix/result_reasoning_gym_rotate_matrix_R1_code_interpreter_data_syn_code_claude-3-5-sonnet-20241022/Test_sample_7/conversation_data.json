    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what rotating a matrix by 360 degrees means:\n   - A 360-degree rotation means rotating the matrix 4 times by 90 degrees\n   - Or, in other words, returning to the original matrix\n\n2) For this case, since we're rotating 360 degrees, the output should be exactly the same as the input matrix.\n\n3) Let's verify this with code. I'll write a program that:\n   - Creates the input matrix\n   - Implements a rotation function (even though we don't need it for 360 degrees)\n   - Returns the result\n\n```python\n# Create the input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 6, 0, 3, 3],\n    [6, 9, 0, 4, 5],\n    [2, 0, 4, 1, 5],\n    [0, 1, 6, 5, 6],\n    [1, 6, 8, 9, 4]\n]\n\n# For 360 degrees (4 rotations of 90 degrees), we get back the original matrix\n# Let's format it properly for output\nresult = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    result += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\n\n# Remove the last newline and print\nprint(result.strip())\n```\n\nSince we're rotating by 360 degrees, which is equivalent to 4 rotations of 90 degrees each, we'll get back to our original matrix. \n\n<<<4 6 0 3 3\n6 9 0 4 5\n2 0 4 1 5\n0 1 6 5 6\n1 6 8 9 4>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Since we were asked to rotate the matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, and 360 degrees represents a complete rotation (4 times 90-degree rotations), the matrix returns to its original position.\n\nLet me explain why this is correct:\n1) A 90-degree clockwise rotation would change the matrix\n2) A 180-degree rotation (2 times 90 degrees) would change it again\n3) A 270-degree rotation (3 times 90 degrees) would change it once more\n4) Finally, a 360-degree rotation (4 times 90 degrees) brings every element back to its original position\n\nTherefore, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<4 6 0 3 3\n6 9 0 4 5\n2 0 4 1 5\n0 1 6 5 6\n1 6 8 9 4>>>"
