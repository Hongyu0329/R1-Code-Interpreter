    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what 810 degrees clockwise means:\n   * 360 degrees = 1 complete rotation\n   * 810 ÷ 360 = 2 complete rotations + 90 degrees\n   * So we only need to rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\n\n2) To rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise:\n   * First row becomes last column\n   * Second row becomes second-to-last column\n   * And so on...\n\n3) Let's write a Python code to handle this rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with rotated values\n    rotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    return rotated\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 1, 5, 3, 3],\n    [7, 5, 9, 3, 6],\n    [8, 8, 3, 9, 9],\n    [9, 7, 9, 6, 1],\n    [0, 8, 1, 6, 7]\n]\n\n# Since 810° = 2 complete rotations + 90°\n# We only need to rotate once by 90°\nresult = rotate_matrix_90(matrix)\n\n# Format the output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in result:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\n4) After executing this code, we get the rotated matrix.\n\n<<<0 9 8 7 9\n8 7 8 5 1\n1 9 3 9 5\n6 6 9 3 3\n7 1 9 6 3>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and provided the rotated matrix. Let me verify the result:\n\n1) The original matrix was:\n```\n9 1 5 3 3\n7 5 9 3 6\n8 8 3 9 9\n9 7 9 6 1\n0 8 1 6 7\n```\n\n2) After rotating 810 degrees clockwise:\n- 810° = 2 complete rotations (720°) + 90°\n- The 2 complete rotations bring us back to the original position\n- Then we only needed to rotate 90° clockwise\n- In a 90° clockwise rotation:\n  * First row becomes last column\n  * Second row becomes second-to-last column\n  * And so on...\n\n3) The result we got is correct:\n```\n0 9 8 7 9\n8 7 8 5 1\n1 9 3 9 5\n6 6 9 3 3\n7 1 9 6 3\n```\n\nTherefore, I can provide the final answer:\n\n<<<0 9 8 7 9\n8 7 8 5 1\n1 9 3 9 5\n6 6 9 3 3\n7 1 9 6 3>>>"
