    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what a 540-degree clockwise rotation means:\n   - 540 degrees = 360 degrees + 180 degrees\n   - 360 degrees brings us back to the original position\n   - So we only need to rotate by 180 degrees\n\n2) A 180-degree rotation means:\n   - Elements will move to their opposite positions\n   - The first element (0,0) will go to (2,2)\n   - The middle element stays in place\n   - We can achieve this by reversing both rows and columns\n\n3) Let's write code to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a flat list of all numbers\n    flat = [num for row in matrix for num in row]\n    # Reverse the list\n    flat.reverse()\n    # Reconstruct the matrix\n    result = []\n    for i in range(0, len(flat), n):\n        result.append(flat[i:i+n])\n    \n    # Format the output string\n    output = \"\"\n    for row in result:\n        output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\n    output = output.strip()\n    \n    print(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 4, 3],\n    [3, 2, 1],\n    [8, 1, 9]\n]\n\nrotate_180(matrix)\n```\n\nThe code will:\n1. Convert the matrix to a flat list\n2. Reverse the entire list\n3. Reconstruct the matrix\n4. Format the output according to the required format\n\nAfter executing this code, we get the matrix rotated by 180 degrees, which is equivalent to 540 degrees (as 540° = 360° + 180°).\n\nThe output will be automatically formatted with the required triple angle brackets.\n\n<<<9 1 8\n1 2 3\n3 4 0>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the correct answer. Let me explain why this is the correct result:\n\n1) For a 540-degree rotation:\n   - 540° = 360° + 180°\n   - A 360° rotation brings us back to the original position\n   - Then we only need to consider the additional 180° rotation\n\n2) Looking at the original matrix:\n```\n0 4 3\n3 2 1\n8 1 9\n```\n\n3) After a 180° rotation (which is what we need):\n   - The top-left (0) moves to bottom-right (9)\n   - The top-middle (4) moves to bottom-middle (1)\n   - The top-right (3) moves to bottom-left (8)\n   - And so on...\n   - Each element moves to its opposite position in the matrix\n\n4) Therefore, the final answer is correct:\n<<<9 1 8\n1 2 3\n3 4 0>>>"
