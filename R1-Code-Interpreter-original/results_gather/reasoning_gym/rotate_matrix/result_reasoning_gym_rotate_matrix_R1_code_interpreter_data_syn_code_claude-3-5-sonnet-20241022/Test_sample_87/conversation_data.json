    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 6x6 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 810 degrees clockwise\n   - 810 degrees = 810 รท 90 = 9 rotations of 90 degrees\n   - Since 360 degrees makes a complete rotation, 810 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees (810 % 360 = 90)\n   - So we only need to rotate the matrix once clockwise\n\n2) Let's write a Python program to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Create a function to rotate 90 degrees clockwise\n   - Apply the rotation\n   - Format the output\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]\n    \n    # Reverse each row\n    for i in range(n):\n        matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]\n    return matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 8, 8, 6, 1, 1],\n    [6, 3, 2, 4, 4, 3],\n    [7, 9, 0, 6, 4, 6],\n    [0, 5, 3, 2, 7, 0],\n    [8, 8, 7, 6, 1, 0],\n    [3, 3, 7, 6, 7, 8]\n]\n\n# Rotate once (90 degrees clockwise)\nrotated = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in rotated:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\n3) The code:\n   - Takes the input matrix\n   - Performs a 90-degree clockwise rotation by:\n     * First transposing the matrix (swapping elements across the main diagonal)\n     * Then reversing each row\n   - Formats the output as required\n\n4) After the rotation, we get our final answer:\n\n<<<3 8 0 7 6 2\n3 8 5 9 3 8\n7 7 3 0 2 8\n6 6 2 6 4 6\n7 1 7 4 4 1\n8 0 0 6 3 1>>>",
