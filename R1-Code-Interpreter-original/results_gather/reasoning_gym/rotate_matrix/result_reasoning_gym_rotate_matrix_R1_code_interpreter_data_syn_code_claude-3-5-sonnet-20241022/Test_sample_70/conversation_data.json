    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We need to rotate a 4x4 matrix by 720 degrees clockwise\n   - 720 degrees means we need to rotate it 2 complete rotations (360° × 2)\n   - Since we're rotating by a multiple of 360°, the final result will be the same as the original matrix!\n\n2) Let's verify this with code. I'll write a program that:\n   - Creates the initial matrix\n   - Implements a rotation function\n   - Rotates it multiple times to confirm our reasoning\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix of the same size\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # For clockwise rotation:\n    # first row becomes last column\n    # second row becomes second-to-last column\n    # and so on...\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            result[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 5, 2, 8],\n    [9, 2, 6, 4],\n    [9, 6, 9, 9],\n    [0, 8, 8, 9]\n]\n\n# Rotate 720 degrees (2 complete rotations)\nrotations = 2 * 4  # 4 rotations = 360 degrees\ncurrent = matrix\nfor _ in range(rotations):\n    current = rotate_matrix(current)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nresult = \"\"\nfor row in current:\n    result += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(result.strip())\n```\n\n3) After running this code, we can confirm that rotating a matrix by 720 degrees (or any multiple of 360 degrees) will return the original matrix.\n\n<<<9 5 2 8\n9 2 6 4\n9 6 9 9\n0 8 8 9>>>",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) A 720-degree rotation is equivalent to two full rotations (360° × 2)\n2) After each complete 360° rotation, a matrix returns to its original position\n3) Therefore, after 720°, the matrix must be identical to the original matrix\n\nTo break this down further:\n- One 90° clockwise rotation would move:\n  * Top row to right column\n  * Right column to bottom row\n  * Bottom row to left column\n  * Left column to top row\n- Four 90° rotations make one complete 360° rotation\n- Eight 90° rotations make 720°\n- After 8 rotations, every element returns to its original position\n\nThe code execution verified this mathematical principle, showing that the matrix after 720° rotation is exactly the same as the original matrix.\n\n<<<9 5 2 8\n9 2 6 4\n9 6 9 9\n0 8 8 9>>>"
