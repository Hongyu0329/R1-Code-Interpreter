    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what rotating 360 degrees means:\n   - 360 degrees is a full rotation\n   - This means the matrix will return to its original position\n   - So, the output should be exactly the same as the input\n\n2) Let's write code to verify this and format the output properly:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 1, 0, 4, 8, 9, 5],\n    [4, 2, 5, 2, 2, 1, 6],\n    [5, 2, 6, 9, 6, 7, 7],\n    [3, 2, 9, 4, 8, 4, 0],\n    [5, 9, 1, 5, 2, 6, 8],\n    [8, 9, 7, 9, 8, 6, 9],\n    [4, 8, 1, 9, 6, 5, 4]\n]\n\n# Since it's a 360-degree rotation, we just need to format the original matrix\nresult = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    result += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\n\n# Remove the last newline and print\nprint(result.strip())\n```\n\n3) The code above will:\n   - Take the input matrix\n   - Format it with spaces between numbers\n   - Create rows with numbers separated by spaces\n   - Join all rows with newlines\n   - Remove any trailing whitespace\n\n4) Since we're rotating by 360 degrees, which is a complete rotation, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\n<<<9 1 0 4 8 9 5\n4 2 5 2 2 1 6\n5 2 6 9 6 7 7\n3 2 9 4 8 4 0\n5 9 1 5 2 6 8\n8 9 7 9 8 6 9\n4 8 1 9 6 5 4>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Since we were asked to rotate the matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to four 90-degree rotations, the matrix returns to its original position. \n\nThe output matches exactly with the input matrix because:\n1) A 360-degree rotation is a complete turn\n2) After rotating four times by 90 degrees, every element returns to its starting position\n3) This is true for any square matrix\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that the answer is correct.\n\n<<<9 1 0 4 8 9 5\n4 2 5 2 2 1 6\n5 2 6 9 6 7 7\n3 2 9 4 8 4 0\n5 9 1 5 2 6 8\n8 9 7 9 8 6 9\n4 8 1 9 6 5 4>>>"
