    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what a 0-degree rotation means:\n   - A 0-degree rotation means the matrix remains unchanged\n   - We just need to return the same matrix in the required format\n\n2) Let's write code to handle this:\n   - Read the input matrix\n   - Format it properly for output\n   - Return it in the required format\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 7, 9, 9, 4],\n    [5, 7, 9, 4, 4],\n    [7, 4, 5, 1, 8],\n    [2, 0, 6, 5, 7],\n    [1, 2, 8, 8, 2]\n]\n\n# For 0-degree rotation, we just need to format the output\nresult = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    result += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\n\n# Remove the last newline and print\nprint(result.strip())\n```\n\nSince we're rotating by 0 degrees, the matrix remains unchanged. Let's format the answer:\n\n<<<1 7 9 9 4\n5 7 9 4 4\n7 4 5 1 8\n2 0 6 5 7\n1 2 8 8 2>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and provided the expected output. Since this was a 0-degree rotation, the matrix remains exactly the same as the input matrix. \n\nLet me verify that our answer matches the required format and is correct:\n1. The matrix is unchanged (correct for 0-degree rotation)\n2. The numbers are space-separated\n3. Each row is on a new line\n4. The entire matrix is enclosed in triple angle brackets\n\nThe answer I provided is correct and properly formatted:\n\n<<<1 7 9 9 4\n5 7 9 4 4\n7 4 5 1 8\n2 0 6 5 7\n1 2 8 8 2>>>"
