    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise means:\n   - The first row becomes the last column\n   - The second row becomes the second-to-last column\n   - And so on...\n\n2) For an n√ón matrix:\n   - Element at position (i,j) will move to position (j,n-1-i)\n   - Or we can transpose the matrix and then reverse each row\n\n3) Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Rotate it\n   - Format the output\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = '''6 3 9 2 3 3 2 1\n4 6 8 8 1 9 7 3\n6 9 9 3 5 6 3 2\n7 2 9 5 1 8 1 7\n5 6 0 4 8 0 6 3\n5 8 1 7 8 3 9 7\n0 5 2 3 2 7 9 2\n8 2 0 1 0 2 7 6'''\n\n# Convert string to 2D list\nmatrix = [list(map(int, row.split())) for row in matrix.strip().split('\\n')]\n\n# Get dimensions\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create new rotated matrix\nrotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Rotate 90 degrees clockwise\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Format output\noutput = ''\nfor row in rotated:\n    output += ' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\\n'\noutput = output.strip()\n\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThe code:\n1) Takes the input matrix as a string\n2) Converts it to a 2D list of integers\n3) Creates a new matrix for the rotated result\n4) Performs the rotation by mapping each element (i,j) to (j,n-1-i)\n5) Formats the output as requested with spaces between numbers and newlines between rows\n6) Encloses the result in triple angle brackets\n\nThe output shows the matrix rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Each row of the original matrix becomes a column in the new matrix, reading from bottom to top.\n\nThe final answer is what was printed by the code, which shows the rotated matrix in the required format.",
