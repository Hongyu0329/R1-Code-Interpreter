    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 6x6 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 720 degrees clockwise\n   - 720 degrees = 2 complete rotations (360° × 2)\n   - Since we're rotating twice completely, the result will be the same as the original matrix!\n\n2) Let's verify this with code. I'll write a program that:\n   - Creates the matrix\n   - Implements a rotation function (even though we don't need it in this case)\n   - Shows that 720° rotation returns to original position\n\n```python\n# Create the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 8, 7, 5, 6, 0],\n    [2, 2, 6, 2, 5, 7],\n    [0, 0, 8, 6, 7, 0],\n    [3, 1, 2, 2, 7, 3],\n    [4, 7, 7, 6, 1, 0],\n    [9, 6, 1, 9, 6, 5]\n]\n\n# Function to rotate matrix 90 degrees clockwise\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix of the same size\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the result matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            result[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Rotate 720 degrees (8 times 90 degrees)\nrotated = matrix\nfor _ in range(8):  # 8 times because 720/90 = 8\n    rotated = rotate_90_clockwise(rotated)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint('<<<')\nfor row in rotated:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\nprint('>>>')\n```\n\n3) As expected, rotating 720 degrees (which is 2 full rotations) brings us back to the original matrix.\n\n<<<\n0 8 7 5 6 0\n2 2 6 2 5 7\n0 0 8 6 7 0\n3 1 2 2 7 3\n4 7 7 6 1 0\n9 6 1 9 6 5\n>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) When we rotate a matrix by 720 degrees clockwise:\n   - 360 degrees is one complete rotation\n   - 720 degrees is two complete rotations\n   - After each complete rotation, we get back to the original position\n   - Therefore, after 720 degrees, we must get back to the original matrix\n\n2) This is similar to spinning a wheel twice completely - it ends up in the exact same position as it started.\n\n3) The output matrix is identical to the input matrix, which is exactly what we expected:\n   - First 360° rotation brings us back to the original\n   - Second 360° rotation (completing 720°) keeps us at the original position\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that this is the correct answer:\n\n<<<\n0 8 7 5 6 0\n2 2 6 2 5 7\n0 0 8 6 7 0\n3 1 2 2 7 3\n4 7 7 6 1 0\n9 6 1 9 6 5\n>>>"
