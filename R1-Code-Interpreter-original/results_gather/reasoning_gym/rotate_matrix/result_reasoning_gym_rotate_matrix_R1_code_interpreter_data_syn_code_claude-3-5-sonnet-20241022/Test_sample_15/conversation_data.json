    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what rotating 360 degrees means:\n   - 360 degrees is a full rotation\n   - This means the matrix will return to its original position\n   - So, the output should be exactly the same as the input\n\n2) Let's write code to verify this and format the output properly:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 6, 8, 7, 9, 5, 4],\n    [8, 6, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0],\n    [1, 0, 4, 7, 8, 0, 5],\n    [9, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 5],\n    [7, 3, 0, 8, 5, 5, 9],\n    [5, 8, 9, 3, 3, 0, 2],\n    [5, 1, 5, 9, 6, 8, 8]\n]\n\n# Since it's a 360-degree rotation, the matrix remains the same\n# Format the output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\n\n# Remove the last newline and print\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nSince a 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original position, the output will be exactly the same as the input.\n\n<<<1 6 8 7 9 5 4\n8 6 6 9 0 6 0\n1 0 4 7 8 0 5\n9 6 3 3 8 8 5\n7 3 0 8 5 5 9\n5 8 9 3 3 0 2\n5 1 5 9 6 8 8>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Since we were asked to rotate the matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a full rotation, the matrix returns to its original position.\n\nTo break down why this is correct:\n1) A 360-degree rotation is made up of four 90-degree rotations\n2) Each 90-degree rotation would transform the matrix\n3) After four such rotations (360 degrees), we return to the starting position\n4) Therefore, the output matrix is identical to the input matrix\n\nThe output format matches the requirement of being enclosed in triple angle brackets, with each row of numbers separated by spaces and each row on a new line.\n\n<<<1 6 8 7 9 5 4\n8 6 6 9 0 6 0\n1 0 4 7 8 0 5\n9 6 3 3 8 8 5\n7 3 0 8 5 5 9\n5 8 9 3 3 0 2\n5 1 5 9 6 8 8>>>"
