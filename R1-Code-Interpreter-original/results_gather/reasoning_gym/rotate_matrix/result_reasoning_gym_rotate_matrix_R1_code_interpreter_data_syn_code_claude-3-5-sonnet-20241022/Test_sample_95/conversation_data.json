    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what a 0-degree rotation means:\n   - A 0-degree rotation means the matrix remains unchanged\n   - We just need to return the matrix in the same format\n\n2) Let's write code to handle this:\n   - We'll create a function that takes a matrix and returns it in the required format\n   - For 0 degrees, we just need to convert the matrix to a string format\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 9],\n    [9, 1]\n]\n\n# For 0 degree rotation, we just return the matrix in required format\nresult = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    result += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\n\n# Remove the last newline and print\nprint(result.strip())\n```\n\n3) The code above:\n   - Takes the input matrix\n   - Converts each row to a string with numbers separated by spaces\n   - Joins rows with newlines\n   - Removes trailing newline\n   - Prints in the required format\n\nNow I can provide the final answer:\n\n<<<9 9\n9 1>>>",
    "The code execution was successful and matches our expected output. Since this was a 0-degree rotation, the matrix remains unchanged from the input:\n```\n9 9\n9 1\n```\n\nLet me verify that this is correct:\n1) Original matrix was:\n   ```\n   9 9\n   9 1\n   ```\n2) 0-degree rotation means no change to the matrix\n3) The output format matches the requirement (numbers separated by spaces, rows separated by newlines)\n4) The output is exactly the same as the input, which is correct for a 0-degree rotation\n\nTherefore, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<9 9\n9 1>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Given a square matrix, your job is to rotate it clockwise.\n\nYour output should be a matrix in the same format as the input, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the output matrix>>>.\n\nRotate the matrix below by 0 degrees clockwise:\n9 9\n9 1\n",
