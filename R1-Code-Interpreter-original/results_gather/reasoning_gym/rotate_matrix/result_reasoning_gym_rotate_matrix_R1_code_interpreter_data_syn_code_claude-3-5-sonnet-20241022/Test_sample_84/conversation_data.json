    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 10x10 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 450 degrees clockwise\n   - 450 degrees = 360 degrees + 90 degrees, which means we just need to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise\n\n2) For a clockwise rotation:\n   - First, we need to parse the input matrix\n   - Then, for a 90-degree clockwise rotation, we:\n     * Transpose the matrix\n     * Reverse each row\n   - We need to do this rotation once (as 450° ≡ 90° in rotational terms)\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 0, 1, 2, 7, 7, 3, 4, 6, 9],\n    [6, 9, 1, 7, 1, 5, 8, 5, 7, 0],\n    [8, 8, 1, 6, 7, 2, 8, 5, 2, 7],\n    [8, 1, 8, 7, 9, 3, 9, 6, 8, 4],\n    [5, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 3, 5, 9, 1],\n    [0, 6, 5, 4, 3, 5, 7, 6, 2, 4],\n    [0, 6, 6, 1, 0, 4, 0, 2, 5, 4],\n    [0, 7, 0, 2, 4, 8, 7, 0, 9, 9],\n    [2, 7, 3, 8, 7, 6, 8, 7, 6, 8],\n    [4, 5, 6, 9, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8]\n]\n\n# Function to rotate matrix 90 degrees clockwise\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Transpose matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]\n    \n    # Reverse each row\n    for i in range(n):\n        matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]\n    \n    return matrix\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in rotated:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nNow that we have the rotated matrix, let's format it according to the requirements:\n\n<<<4 2 0 0 0 5 8 8 6 4\n5 7 7 6 6 6 1 8 9 0\n6 3 0 6 5 0 8 1 1 1\n9 8 2 1 4 6 7 6 7 2\n0 7 4 0 3 0 9 7 1 7\n1 6 8 4 5 6 3 2 5 7\n3 8 7 0 7 3 9 8 8 3\n4 7 0 2 6 5 6 5 5 4\n5 6 9 5 2 9 8 2 7 6\n8 8 9 4 4 1 4 7 0 9>>>",
    "Based on the code execution output, we have successfully rotated the matrix 450 degrees clockwise (which is equivalent to 90 degrees clockwise). Let me verify the result:\n\n1) The rotation is correct because:\n   - The first row of the original matrix (4 0 1 2 7 7 3 4 6 9) has become the last column of the rotated matrix\n   - The last row of the original matrix (4 5 6 9 0 1 3 4 5 8) has become the first column of the rotated matrix\n   - All other elements have been correctly positioned according to 90-degree clockwise rotation\n\n2) The format is correct:\n   - The matrix maintains its 10x10 dimensions\n   - Numbers are space-separated\n   - The output maintains the required structure\n\nTherefore, I can provide the final answer:\n\n<<<4 2 0 0 0 5 8 8 6 4\n5 7 7 6 6 6 1 8 9 0\n6 3 0 6 5 0 8 1 1 1\n9 8 2 1 4 6 7 6 7 2\n0 7 4 0 3 0 9 7 1 7\n1 6 8 4 5 6 3 2 5 7\n3 8 7 0 7 3 9 8 8 3\n4 7 0 2 6 5 6 5 5 4\n5 6 9 5 2 9 8 2 7 6\n8 8 9 4 4 1 4 7 0 9>>>"
