    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 7x7 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 630 degrees clockwise\n   - 630 degrees = 630 รท 90 = 7 rotations of 90 degrees\n   - Since 360 degrees makes a complete rotation, we only need to do: 630 % 360 = 270 degrees\n   - So we need to rotate the matrix 3 times (90 degrees each)\n\n2) Let's write a Python program to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Create a function to rotate 90 degrees clockwise\n   - Apply the rotation 3 times\n   - Format the output\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]\n    \n    # Reverse each row\n    for i in range(n):\n        matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]\n    \n    return matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 6, 3, 4, 0, 6, 3],\n    [4, 4, 7, 7, 3, 1, 5],\n    [4, 3, 5, 8, 0, 0, 6],\n    [9, 9, 6, 3, 5, 8, 7],\n    [0, 1, 6, 2, 1, 3, 1],\n    [4, 9, 1, 8, 1, 0, 0],\n    [3, 7, 7, 2, 9, 9, 6]\n]\n\n# Rotate 3 times (270 degrees)\nfor _ in range(3):\n    matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nNow that we have rotated the matrix 270 degrees clockwise (equivalent to 630 degrees), let's format the answer according to the requirements:\n\n<<<6 0 1 7 6 5 3\n9 0 3 8 7 1 6\n9 1 1 3 0 3 0\n2 8 2 3 8 7 4\n7 1 6 6 5 7 3\n7 9 1 9 3 4 6\n3 0 4 9 4 4 7>>>",
    "I notice that my output doesn't match the code execution output. Let me analyze what happened:\n\n1) The rotation of 630 degrees clockwise:\n   - 630 รท 90 = 7 rotations\n   - 7 rotations = 1 full rotation (4 times) + 3 additional rotations\n   - So we were correct to do 3 rotations\n\n2) However, it seems my output was reversed. Let's verify the rotation with another program that includes validation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            result[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    return result\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 6, 3, 4, 0, 6, 3],\n    [4, 4, 7, 7, 3, 1, 5],\n    [4, 3, 5, 8, 0, 0, 6],\n    [9, 9, 6, 3, 5, 8, 7],\n    [0, 1, 6, 2, 1, 3, 1],\n    [4, 9, 1, 8, 1, 0, 0],\n    [3, 7, 7, 2, 9, 9, 6]\n]\n\n# Rotate 3 times (270 degrees)\nfor _ in range(3):\n    matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nBased on the code execution output, here's the correct answer:\n\n<<<3 5 6 7 1 0 6\n6 1 0 8 3 0 9\n0 3 0 5 1 1 9\n4 7 8 3 2 8 2\n3 7 5 6 6 1 7\n6 4 3 9 1 9 7\n7 4 4 9 0 4 3>>>",
    "The code execution output matches exactly with what we need. Let me explain why this is correct:\n\n1) For a 630-degree clockwise rotation:\n   - 630 = 360 + 270 degrees\n   - 360 degrees is one complete rotation (back to original)\n   - So we only need to rotate 270 degrees clockwise\n   - 270 degrees clockwise = 3 rotations of 90 degrees each\n\n2) The code correctly:\n   - Takes the input 7x7 matrix\n   - Performs 3 rotations of 90 degrees each\n   - The rotation algorithm properly maps each element to its new position\n   - The output format matches the requirement\n\nTherefore, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<3 5 6 7 1 0 6\n6 1 0 8 3 0 9\n0 3 0 5 1 1 9\n4 7 8 3 2 8 2\n3 7 5 6 6 1 7\n6 4 3 9 1 9 7\n7 4 4 9 0 4 3>>>"
