    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 10x10 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it by 0 degrees clockwise\n   - Actually, 0 degrees rotation means the matrix stays the same\n\n2) We need to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Since it's 0 degrees rotation, we just need to format it properly for output\n   - Return the same matrix in the required format\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 8, 2, 7, 0, 2, 0, 9, 1, 4],\n    [3, 0, 9, 8, 9, 3, 1, 5, 4, 6],\n    [5, 2, 2, 2, 6, 5, 9, 2, 9, 6],\n    [9, 4, 8, 2, 1, 1, 5, 7, 4, 0],\n    [0, 5, 8, 8, 9, 5, 4, 5, 3, 6],\n    [9, 6, 1, 2, 1, 9, 0, 0, 3, 6],\n    [3, 8, 7, 9, 2, 6, 7, 2, 9, 9],\n    [1, 7, 7, 3, 9, 5, 4, 6, 8, 3],\n    [4, 2, 3, 1, 2, 8, 9, 3, 1, 0],\n    [3, 7, 0, 5, 4, 2, 6, 3, 3, 8]\n]\n\n# For 0 degrees rotation, we just need to format the output\nresult = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    result += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\n\n# Remove the last newline\nresult = result.rstrip()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nSince we're rotating by 0 degrees, the matrix remains unchanged. Let's format the answer:\n\n<<<8 8 2 7 0 2 0 9 1 4\n3 0 9 8 9 3 1 5 4 6\n5 2 2 2 6 5 9 2 9 6\n9 4 8 2 1 1 5 7 4 0\n0 5 8 8 9 5 4 5 3 6\n9 6 1 2 1 9 0 0 3 6\n3 8 7 9 2 6 7 2 9 9\n1 7 7 3 9 5 4 6 8 3\n4 2 3 1 2 8 9 3 1 0\n3 7 0 5 4 2 6 3 3 8>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Since we were asked to rotate the matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, the matrix remains unchanged from its original form. The output matches exactly with the input matrix, which is what we want for a 0-degree rotation.\n\nI can confirm that the answer provided is correct:\n\n<<<8 8 2 7 0 2 0 9 1 4\n3 0 9 8 9 3 1 5 4 6\n5 2 2 2 6 5 9 2 9 6\n9 4 8 2 1 1 5 7 4 0\n0 5 8 8 9 5 4 5 3 6\n9 6 1 2 1 9 0 0 3 6\n3 8 7 9 2 6 7 2 9 9\n1 7 7 3 9 5 4 6 8 3\n4 2 3 1 2 8 9 3 1 0\n3 7 0 5 4 2 6 3 3 8>>>"
