    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 9x9 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 450 degrees clockwise\n   - 450 degrees = 360 degrees + 90 degrees, which means we only need to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise\n\n2) For a single 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n   - First row becomes last column\n   - Second row becomes second-to-last column\n   - And so on...\n\n3) Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Create a function to rotate 90 degrees\n   - Apply the rotation once (since 450° ≡ 90° in rotational terms)\n   - Format the output\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with same dimensions\n    rotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 8, 3, 5, 4, 5, 0, 7, 5],\n    [5, 1, 6, 7, 5, 2, 5, 0, 8],\n    [1, 2, 5, 0, 6, 2, 2, 6, 4],\n    [4, 5, 7, 5, 9, 5, 2, 9, 4],\n    [6, 6, 3, 2, 2, 0, 8, 5, 7],\n    [0, 8, 6, 1, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1],\n    [7, 5, 1, 6, 3, 1, 9, 5, 9],\n    [5, 0, 7, 4, 6, 6, 3, 2, 1],\n    [6, 7, 1, 4, 7, 6, 0, 5, 3]\n]\n\n# Rotate once (90 degrees)\nresult = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format and print the result\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in result:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nNow that we have the rotated matrix, let's format it according to the requirements:\n\n<<<6 5 7 0 6 4 5 5 2\n7 0 5 8 6 5 1 1 8\n1 7 1 6 3 7 6 6 3\n4 4 6 1 2 5 7 7 5\n7 6 3 4 2 9 6 5 4\n6 6 1 0 0 5 2 2 5\n0 3 9 6 8 2 5 2 0\n5 2 5 2 5 9 6 0 7\n3 1 9 1 7 4 4 8 5>>>",
    "I notice that my answer had some discrepancies with the actual code output. Let me verify the code output, which is correct according to the rotation rules.\n\nLet's confirm why this is the correct answer:\n1) In a 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n   - The first row becomes the last column\n   - The last row becomes the first column\n   - Each element's new position follows the pattern: (i,j) → (j,n-1-i)\n\n2) The code correctly implements this transformation, and since 450° is equivalent to 90° in terms of rotation (as 450 = 360 + 90), we only need one rotation.\n\nTherefore, I will provide the correct answer based on the code output:\n\n<<<6 5 7 0 6 4 1 5 2\n7 0 5 8 6 5 2 1 8\n1 7 1 6 3 7 5 6 3\n4 4 6 1 2 5 0 7 5\n7 6 3 4 2 9 6 5 4\n6 6 1 0 0 5 2 2 5\n0 3 9 6 8 2 2 5 0\n5 2 5 2 5 9 6 0 7\n3 1 9 1 7 4 4 8 5>>>"
