    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what a 0-degree rotation means:\n   - A 0-degree rotation means the matrix remains unchanged\n   - We just need to format it properly in the output format\n\n2) Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Keep it as is (since it's 0-degree rotation)\n   - Format it properly for output\n\n```python\n# Input matrix as a string\nmatrix_str = \"\"\"6 7 4 1 4 5\n0 1 7 0 1 4\n1 4 0 9 1 2\n4 2 3 6 1 9\n6 2 0 0 2 5\n4 5 5 1 6 1\"\"\"\n\n# Split into rows and convert to integers\nmatrix = [list(map(int, row.split())) for row in matrix_str.splitlines()]\n\n# For 0-degree rotation, matrix stays the same\n# Format the output\noutput = \"\\n\".join(\" \".join(str(num) for num in row) for row in matrix)\n\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThe code will:\n1) Take the input matrix as a string\n2) Convert it into a 2D list of integers\n3) Since it's 0-degree rotation, we keep the matrix as is\n4) Format it back to the required output format with numbers separated by spaces and rows by newlines\n5) Enclose it in triple angle brackets\n\nThe output from this code will be our final answer.\n\n<<<6 7 4 1 4 5\n0 1 7 0 1 4\n1 4 0 9 1 2\n4 2 3 6 1 9\n6 2 0 0 2 5\n4 5 5 1 6 1>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and provided the expected output. Since the task was to rotate the matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, which means no rotation at all, the output matrix is identical to the input matrix.\n\nLet me verify that the output is correct:\n1) The matrix dimensions are preserved (6Ã—6)\n2) All numbers are in their original positions\n3) The format matches the requirement (numbers separated by spaces, rows by newlines, enclosed in <<<>>>)\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that this is the final answer:\n\n<<<6 7 4 1 4 5\n0 1 7 0 1 4\n1 4 0 9 1 2\n4 2 3 6 1 9\n6 2 0 0 2 5\n4 5 5 1 6 1>>>"
