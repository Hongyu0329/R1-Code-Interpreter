    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 10x10 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 900 degrees clockwise\n   - 900 degrees = 2.5 full rotations (360° × 2 + 180°)\n   - This means we need to rotate it 180° (same as rotating 900°)\n\n2) For matrix rotation:\n   - 90° clockwise rotation: transpose + reverse each row\n   - 180° rotation: we can either do two 90° rotations or simply reverse rows and columns\n   - In this case, 180° rotation will give us the same result as 900° rotation\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_180(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with reversed rows and columns\n    rotated = [[matrix[n-1-i][n-1-j] for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]\n    return rotated\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 5, 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 1, 7, 7],\n    [8, 4, 7, 2, 5, 4, 8, 9, 0, 8],\n    [0, 2, 3, 7, 2, 9, 6, 3, 4, 4],\n    [6, 0, 8, 3, 2, 9, 0, 3, 5, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 6, 9, 7, 6, 2, 2, 9],\n    [2, 6, 7, 7, 6, 9, 1, 3, 2, 0],\n    [7, 7, 2, 7, 2, 3, 4, 0, 4, 8],\n    [4, 8, 4, 5, 2, 5, 1, 3, 9, 2],\n    [8, 5, 6, 3, 5, 1, 1, 9, 7, 3],\n    [2, 9, 4, 4, 8, 2, 0, 8, 9, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nresult = rotate_matrix_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in result:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nNow that we have the rotated matrix, let me format the answer properly:\n\n<<<7 9 8 0 2 1 8 9 3 2\n3 7 9 1 5 2 3 4 0 7\n2 9 3 1 5 2 5 3 4 8\n8 4 0 4 3 2 7 7 2 7\n0 2 3 1 9 6 7 7 6 2\n9 2 2 6 7 9 6 1 0 0\n0 5 3 0 9 2 3 8 0 6\n4 4 3 6 9 2 7 3 2 0\n8 0 9 8 4 5 2 7 4 8\n7 7 1 5 3 2 4 1 5 1>>>",
    "I notice that my answer doesn't match the code output. Let me verify the rotation process again.\n\nFor a 900-degree clockwise rotation:\n- 900° = 360° × 2 + 180° = 180° (as rotations are cyclic)\n- So we need a 180° rotation, which means the matrix should be flipped both horizontally and vertically\n- The code is correct, but I made a mistake in transcribing the output\n\nLet me provide the correct answer based on the code output:\n\n<<<7 9 8 0 2 8 4 4 9 2\n3 7 9 1 1 5 3 6 5 8\n2 9 3 1 5 2 5 4 8 4\n8 4 0 4 3 2 7 2 7 7\n0 2 3 1 9 6 7 7 6 2\n9 2 2 6 7 9 6 1 0 0\n0 5 3 0 9 2 3 8 0 6\n4 4 3 6 9 2 7 3 2 0\n8 0 9 8 4 5 2 7 4 8\n7 7 1 5 3 2 4 1 5 1>>>"
