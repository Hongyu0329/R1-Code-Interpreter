    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 9x9 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 720 degrees clockwise\n   - 720 degrees = 2 complete rotations (360° × 2)\n   - Since we're rotating twice, the result will be the same as rotating 0 times\n   - Therefore, the output will be the same as the input matrix!\n\n2) Let's verify this with code. I'll write a program that:\n   - Takes the input matrix\n   - Creates a function to rotate 90 degrees clockwise\n   - Applies the rotation 8 times (to show it returns to original after 4 rotations)\n   - Returns the final result\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with same dimensions\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the result matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            result[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 1, 9, 1, 6, 7, 5, 1, 7],\n    [1, 2, 3, 9, 0, 0, 3, 1, 2],\n    [9, 8, 4, 2, 6, 9, 6, 3, 9],\n    [9, 3, 1, 5, 3, 9, 3, 9, 8],\n    [7, 4, 4, 3, 8, 7, 8, 3, 8],\n    [4, 0, 7, 2, 2, 6, 8, 4, 1],\n    [7, 5, 1, 1, 4, 7, 1, 9, 1],\n    [6, 4, 0, 8, 7, 9, 9, 6, 6],\n    [7, 4, 1, 2, 7, 0, 5, 4, 0]\n]\n\n# Rotate 720 degrees (8 times 90 degrees)\nresult = matrix\nfor _ in range(8):\n    result = rotate_90_clockwise(result)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\")\nfor row in result:\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, row)))\nprint(\">>>\")\n```\n\nAs we predicted, rotating 720 degrees (which is 2 full rotations) brings us back to the original matrix. Therefore:\n\n<<<\n3 1 9 1 6 7 5 1 7\n1 2 3 9 0 0 3 1 2\n9 8 4 2 6 9 6 3 9\n9 3 1 5 3 9 3 9 8\n7 4 4 3 8 7 8 3 8\n4 0 7 2 2 6 8 4 1\n7 5 1 1 4 7 1 9 1\n6 4 0 8 7 9 9 6 6\n7 4 1 2 7 0 5 4 0\n>>>",
    "Since there are no errors in the code execution and the output matches our theoretical prediction, I can confidently provide the final answer.\n\nThe explanation for why the matrix remains unchanged after a 720-degree clockwise rotation is:\n1) A 360-degree rotation brings any matrix back to its original position\n2) 720 degrees = 360 degrees × 2\n3) Therefore, rotating a matrix 720 degrees clockwise is equivalent to not rotating it at all\n\n<<<\n3 1 9 1 6 7 5 1 7\n1 2 3 9 0 0 3 1 2\n9 8 4 2 6 9 6 3 9\n9 3 1 5 3 9 3 9 8\n7 4 4 3 8 7 8 3 8\n4 0 7 2 2 6 8 4 1\n7 5 1 1 4 7 1 9 1\n6 4 0 8 7 9 9 6 6\n7 4 1 2 7 0 5 4 0\n>>>"
