    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   * We have a 3x3 matrix\n   * We need to rotate it by 900 degrees clockwise\n   * 900 degrees = 900/90 = 10 rotations (since each clockwise rotation is 90 degrees)\n   * So we need to rotate the matrix 10 times\n\n2) For a single 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n   * First row becomes last column\n   * Second row becomes second-to-last column\n   * Last row becomes first column\n\n3) Let's write code to:\n   * Parse the input matrix\n   * Create a function to rotate 90 degrees\n   * Apply the rotation 10 times\n   * Format the output\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with dimensions swapped\n    rotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 7, 7],\n    [2, 5, 1],\n    [2, 9, 3]\n]\n\n# Rotate 10 times (900 degrees)\nfor _ in range(10):\n    matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\\n\".join(\" \".join(str(num) for num in row) for row in matrix)\nprint(output)\n```\n\n4) After analyzing the result:\n   * A 90-degree rotation 10 times is equivalent to 2 complete 360-degree rotations plus one 180-degree rotation\n   * After 360 degrees (4 rotations), the matrix returns to its original position\n   * Therefore, 900 degrees rotation is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation\n\nThe final matrix after 900 degrees (which is equivalent to 180 degrees) rotation will be:\n\n<<<3 9 2\n1 5 2\n7 7 4>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) For a 900-degree rotation:\n   * 900° = 2 × 360° + 180°\n   * Since 360° brings the matrix back to its original position\n   * We only need to consider the extra 180° rotation\n\n2) A 180° rotation means:\n   * Elements move to their opposite positions\n   * The matrix is flipped both horizontally and vertically\n   * Each element (i,j) moves to position (n-1-i, n-1-j)\n\n3) Verifying the result:\n   * Original matrix:\n     4 7 7\n     2 5 1\n     2 9 3\n\n   * After 180° rotation:\n     3 9 2\n     1 5 2\n     7 7 4\n\n4) The code correctly performed this transformation, and we can verify that:\n   * 4 moved to 4's opposite position (3)\n   * 7 moved to 7's opposite position (9)\n   * 7 moved to 7's opposite position (2)\n   And so on...\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that the answer is correct:\n\n<<<3 9 2\n1 5 2\n7 7 4>>>"
