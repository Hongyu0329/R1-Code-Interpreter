    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We need to rotate a 8x8 matrix by 0 degrees clockwise\n   - A 0-degree rotation means the matrix stays the same\n   - We need to format the output properly\n\n2) Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Perform the rotation (which in this case is no rotation)\n   - Format the output correctly\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 1, 1, 5, 7, 5, 0, 9],\n    [2, 9, 5, 5, 4, 5, 9, 4],\n    [7, 9, 6, 3, 9, 1, 8, 7],\n    [2, 6, 8, 3, 0, 6, 5, 8],\n    [9, 8, 0, 2, 7, 1, 4, 1],\n    [2, 7, 1, 1, 6, 4, 2, 5],\n    [7, 6, 7, 4, 4, 2, 6, 4],\n    [2, 5, 1, 3, 8, 9, 3, 4]\n]\n\n# For 0 degrees rotation, we just need to format the output\nresult = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    result += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\n\n# Remove the last newline and print with the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + result.strip() + \">>>\")\n```\n\nSince we're rotating by 0 degrees, the matrix remains unchanged. The code simply formats the matrix according to the required output format.\n\n<<<6 1 1 5 7 5 0 9\n2 9 5 5 4 5 9 4\n7 9 6 3 9 1 8 7\n2 6 8 3 0 6 5 8\n9 8 0 2 7 1 4 1\n2 7 1 1 6 4 2 5\n7 6 7 4 4 2 6 4\n2 5 1 3 8 9 3 4>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is correct. Since we were asked to rotate the matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, which means no rotation at all, the output matrix is identical to the input matrix.\n\nLet me verify the result:\n1. The matrix dimensions are preserved (8x8)\n2. All numbers are in their original positions\n3. The format matches the requirement (numbers separated by spaces, rows on new lines, enclosed in <<<>>>)\n\nTherefore, I can confirm this is the final answer:\n\n<<<6 1 1 5 7 5 0 9\n2 9 5 5 4 5 9 4\n7 9 6 3 9 1 8 7\n2 6 8 3 0 6 5 8\n9 8 0 2 7 1 4 1\n2 7 1 1 6 4 2 5\n7 6 7 4 4 2 6 4\n2 5 1 3 8 9 3 4>>>"
