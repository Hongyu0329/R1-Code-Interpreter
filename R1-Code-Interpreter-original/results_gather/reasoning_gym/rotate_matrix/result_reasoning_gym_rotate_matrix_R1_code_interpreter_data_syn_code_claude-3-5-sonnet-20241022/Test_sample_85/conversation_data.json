    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what a 540-degree rotation means:\n   - 540 = 360 + 180 degrees\n   - 360 degrees brings us back to the original position\n   - So we only need to rotate by 180 degrees\n\n2) A 180-degree rotation means:\n   - Elements will move to their opposite positions\n   - First element (0,0) goes to last element (n-1,n-1)\n   - We can achieve this by reversing the matrix and then reversing each row\n\n3) Let's write code to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    # Convert the input string to a matrix\n    matrix = [list(map(int, row.split())) for row in matrix.strip().split('\\n')]\n    \n    # For 180-degree rotation, we can reverse the matrix and then reverse each row\n    n = len(matrix)\n    \n    # First reverse the entire matrix\n    matrix = matrix[::-1]\n    \n    # Then reverse each row\n    for i in range(n):\n        matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]\n    \n    # Format the output\n    result = '\\n'.join(' '.join(map(str, row)) for row in matrix)\n    print(result)\n\n# Input matrix\ninput_matrix = \"\"\"2 2 3 6 2\n8 6 1 8 9\n5 5 7 0 2\n5 6 1 2 6\n6 6 6 0 2\"\"\"\n\nrotate_180(input_matrix)\n```\n\n4) After executing this code, we'll get the matrix rotated by 180 degrees, which is equivalent to 540 degrees (as 540° = 180° + 360°).\n\nNow I can format the answer in the required format:\n\n<<<2 0 6 6 6\n6 2 1 6 5\n2 0 7 5 5\n9 8 1 6 8\n2 6 3 2 2>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Let me verify the answer:\n\n1) The original matrix was:\n2 2 3 6 2\n8 6 1 8 9\n5 5 7 0 2\n5 6 1 2 6\n6 6 6 0 2\n\n2) A 540-degree rotation is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation because:\n   - 540° = 360° + 180°\n   - 360° brings the matrix back to its original position\n   - The additional 180° is what actually determines the final position\n\n3) The code correctly:\n   - Reversed the entire matrix\n   - Reversed each row\n   - Formatted the output properly\n\n4) The result matches what we would expect from a 180-degree rotation:\n   - Top-left (2) moved to bottom-right (2)\n   - Top-right (2) moved to bottom-left (2)\n   - And all other elements similarly moved to their opposite positions\n\nTherefore, I can confirm the answer is correct:\n\n<<<2 0 6 6 6\n6 2 1 6 5\n2 0 7 5 5\n9 8 1 6 8\n2 6 3 2 2>>>"
