    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 6x6 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 720 degrees clockwise\n   - 720 degrees = 2 complete rotations (360° × 2)\n   - Since we're rotating twice, we'll get back to the original matrix!\n\n2) This means that rotating 720 degrees is equivalent to no rotation at all!\n   The matrix should remain exactly the same.\n\n3) Let's verify this with code. I'll write a program that:\n   - Takes the input matrix\n   - Shows that rotating 720 degrees (or any multiple of 360 degrees) returns the same matrix\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix of the same size\n    rotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 3, 3, 3, 1, 4],\n    [7, 8, 9, 3, 2, 8],\n    [8, 0, 4, 0, 7, 2],\n    [3, 8, 6, 2, 5, 5],\n    [1, 1, 8, 4, 8, 7],\n    [3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3]\n]\n\n# Rotate 720 degrees (8 times 90 degrees)\nresult = matrix\nfor _ in range(8):  # 8 rotations of 90 degrees = 720 degrees\n    result = rotate_matrix_90(result)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in result:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nThe mathematical principle here is that rotating a matrix by 360 degrees (or any multiple of 360 degrees) will always return the original matrix. Since 720 degrees is exactly two full rotations, the matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\n<<<5 3 3 3 1 4\n7 8 9 3 2 8\n8 0 4 0 7 2\n3 8 6 2 5 5\n1 1 8 4 8 7\n3 3 3 1 1 3>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and confirmed our reasoning. The output matches exactly with the input matrix, which is what we expected.\n\nTo explain why this is correct:\n1) A 360-degree rotation brings any matrix back to its original position\n2) 720 degrees = 360 degrees × 2\n3) Therefore, rotating a matrix 720 degrees is equivalent to rotating it twice completely\n4) This means the matrix will end up exactly as it started\n\nThe code verified this by:\n1) Implementing a 90-degree rotation function\n2) Applying this rotation 8 times (90° × 8 = 720°)\n3) Showing that we get back the original matrix\n\nTherefore, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<5 3 3 3 1 4\n7 8 9 3 2 8\n8 0 4 0 7 2\n3 8 6 2 5 5\n1 1 8 4 8 7\n3 3 3 1 1 3>>>"
