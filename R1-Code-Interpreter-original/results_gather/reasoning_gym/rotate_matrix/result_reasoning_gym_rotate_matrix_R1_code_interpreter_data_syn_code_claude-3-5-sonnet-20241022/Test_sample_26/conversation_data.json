    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise means:\n   - The first row becomes the last column\n   - The second row becomes the second-to-last column\n   - And so on...\n\n2) For a 5Ã—5 matrix, we need to:\n   - First convert the input string to a matrix\n   - Then perform the rotation\n   - Finally format the output as required\n\n3) Let's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix as string\nmatrix_str = \"\"\"3 3 0 3 7\n6 5 4 4 7\n9 6 4 9 1\n0 7 3 7 1\n7 8 6 5 0\"\"\"\n\n# Convert string to matrix\nmatrix = [list(map(int, row.split())) for row in matrix_str.strip().split('\\n')]\n\n# Rotate matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nn = len(matrix)\nrotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Format output\nresult = []\nfor row in rotated:\n    result.append(' '.join(map(str, row)))\nresult = '\\n'.join(result)\n\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nLet's understand what the code does:\n1) Converts the input string to a 2D list (matrix)\n2) Creates a new matrix for the rotated result\n3) For each element at position (i,j) in the original matrix:\n   - Places it at position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix\n4) Formats the output as required with spaces between numbers and newlines between rows\n\nThe rotation formula (j, n-1-i) works because:\n- j becomes the row (moving elements to columns)\n- n-1-i becomes the column (reversing the order of rows)\n\nThe output will be the rotated matrix enclosed in triple angle brackets, with each row's numbers separated by spaces and rows separated by newlines.\n\n<<<7 0 9 6 3\n8 7 6 5 3\n6 3 4 4 0\n5 7 9 4 3\n0 1 1 7 7>>>",
    "Since the code executed successfully without any errors and produced the correct output, I can confirm that the matrix has been properly rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nLet's verify the rotation is correct:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n3 3 0 3 7\n6 5 4 4 7\n9 6 4 9 1\n0 7 3 7 1\n7 8 6 5 0\n\nRotated matrix (90 degrees clockwise):\n7 0 9 6 3\n8 7 6 5 3\n6 3 4 4 0\n5 7 9 4 3\n0 1 1 7 7\n\nThe rotation is correct because:\n1) The first row of the original matrix (3 3 0 3 7) became the last column of the rotated matrix (reading bottom to top: 7 3 0 3 3)\n2) The last row of the original matrix (7 8 6 5 0) became the first column of the rotated matrix (reading top to bottom: 7 8 6 5 0)\n3) All other elements are correctly positioned according to the 90-degree clockwise rotation rule\n\nTherefore, I can provide the final answer:\n\n<<<7 0 9 6 3\n8 7 6 5 3\n6 3 4 4 0\n5 7 9 4 3\n0 1 1 7 7>>>"
