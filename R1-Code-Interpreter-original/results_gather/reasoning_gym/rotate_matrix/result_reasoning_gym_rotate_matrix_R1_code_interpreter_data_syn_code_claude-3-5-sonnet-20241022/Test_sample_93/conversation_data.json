    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what rotating a matrix by 360 degrees means:\n   - A 360-degree rotation means rotating the matrix 4 times by 90 degrees\n   - Actually, after a 360-degree rotation, the matrix should return to its original state\n\n2) Let's write a Python code to verify this:\n   - First, we'll create a function to rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise\n   - Then we'll apply this rotation 4 times (360 degrees)\n   - Finally, we'll compare with the original matrix\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix of the same size\n    rotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    return rotated\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 9, 4, 9, 2],\n    [5, 2, 9, 4, 9],\n    [0, 1, 2, 7, 8],\n    [6, 1, 4, 4, 2],\n    [7, 2, 7, 2, 0]\n]\n\n# Rotate 360 degrees (4 times 90 degrees)\nresult = matrix\nfor _ in range(4):\n    result = rotate_90_clockwise(result)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\noutput = \"\\n\".join(\" \".join(str(x) for x in row) for row in result)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nAs expected, rotating a matrix by 360 degrees returns the original matrix because:\n- Each 90-degree rotation transforms the matrix\n- After 4 rotations (360 degrees), we get back to the original position\n\nTherefore, the answer is the same as the input matrix:\n\n<<<3 9 4 9 2\n5 2 9 4 9\n0 1 2 7 8\n6 1 4 4 2\n7 2 7 2 0>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. This confirms our reasoning that a 360-degree rotation returns the matrix to its original state.\n\nLet me explain why this is correct:\n1) A 360-degree rotation is equivalent to 4 rotations of 90 degrees each\n2) After each 90-degree rotation:\n   - First rotation (90째): Elements move clockwise\n   - Second rotation (180째): Elements continue moving\n   - Third rotation (270째): Elements continue moving\n   - Fourth rotation (360째): Elements complete a full circle, returning to their original positions\n\nTherefore, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<3 9 4 9 2\n5 2 9 4 9\n0 1 2 7 8\n6 1 4 4 2\n7 2 7 2 0>>>"
