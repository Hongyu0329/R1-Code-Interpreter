    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what a 360-degree clockwise rotation means:\n   - A 360-degree rotation means rotating the matrix 4 times by 90 degrees\n   - After a complete 360-degree rotation, the matrix should return to its original state\n\n2) For verification, let's write a Python code that:\n   - Takes the input matrix\n   - Performs a 360-degree rotation (4 times 90-degree rotations)\n   - Returns the final matrix\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with dimensions reversed\n    rotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the new matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    return rotated\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 8, 7, 9, 2, 7],\n    [4, 9, 1, 7, 6, 8],\n    [8, 3, 7, 1, 0, 4],\n    [6, 0, 6, 5, 8, 6],\n    [7, 8, 6, 2, 0, 4],\n    [9, 9, 3, 1, 7, 5]\n]\n\n# Rotate 360 degrees (4 times 90 degrees)\nresult = matrix\nfor _ in range(4):\n    result = rotate_90_clockwise(result)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(\"Matrix after 360-degree rotation:\")\nfor row in result:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the code execution:\n1) The matrix is rotated 4 times by 90 degrees clockwise\n2) A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original position\n3) Therefore, the output matrix should be exactly the same as the input matrix\n\n<<<1 8 7 9 2 7\n4 9 1 7 6 8\n8 3 7 1 0 4\n6 0 6 5 8 6\n7 8 6 2 0 4\n9 9 3 1 7 5>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my reasoning. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) A 360-degree rotation is equivalent to four 90-degree rotations:\n   - First 90° rotation changes the matrix\n   - Second 90° rotation (180° total) changes it again\n   - Third 90° rotation (270° total) changes it further\n   - Fourth 90° rotation (360° total) brings it back to the original position\n\n2) This is mathematically expected because:\n   - A complete rotation (360 degrees) brings any point back to its original position\n   - This is true for all elements in the matrix\n   - Therefore, the final matrix must be identical to the input matrix\n\n3) The code execution verified this by:\n   - Taking the input matrix\n   - Performing four successive 90-degree rotations\n   - Showing that we indeed get back the original matrix\n\nSince we have confirmation both from mathematical reasoning and code execution, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<1 8 7 9 2 7\n4 9 1 7 6 8\n8 3 7 1 0 4\n6 0 6 5 8 6\n7 8 6 2 0 4\n9 9 3 1 7 5>>>"
