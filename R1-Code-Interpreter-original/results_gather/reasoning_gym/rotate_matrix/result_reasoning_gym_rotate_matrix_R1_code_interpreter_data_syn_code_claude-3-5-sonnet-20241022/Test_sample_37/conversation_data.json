    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what 450 degrees clockwise rotation means:\n   * 360 degrees = full rotation (back to original)\n   * 450 degrees = 360 + 90 degrees\n   * So, 450 degrees clockwise is equivalent to 90 degrees clockwise\n\n2) For a 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n   * First row becomes last column\n   * Second row becomes second-to-last column\n   * And so on...\n\n3) Let's write code to perform this rotation and handle the 450 degrees:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with dimensions swapped\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the new matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            result[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [[1, 2],\n         [1, 9]]\n\n# 450 degrees = 360 + 90 = 1 rotation of 90 degrees\n# (as 360 degrees brings us back to the original)\nrotated = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in rotated:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nLet's analyze what happened:\n1) 450 degrees = 360 degrees (full rotation) + 90 degrees\n2) After one 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n   * 1 1 becomes the first column from bottom to top\n   * 2 9 becomes the second column from bottom to top\n\nThe final result should be:\n\n<<<1 1\n2 9>>>",
    "I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The output I see from the code execution shows:\n1 1\n9 2\n\nHowever, this is not correct according to our rotation rules. Let me verify the rotation again:\n\n1) For 450 degrees clockwise:\n   * 450 = 360 + 90 degrees\n   * 360 degrees brings us back to original position\n   * Then additional 90 degrees clockwise\n\n2) Starting with:\n1 2\n1 9\n\n3) After 90 degrees clockwise:\n   * First row (1,2) becomes last column from top to bottom\n   * Second row (1,9) becomes first column from top to bottom\n   * Result should be:\n   1 1\n   9 2\n\nThe code execution was actually correct! I made a mistake in my final answer format. Let me provide the correct answer:\n\n<<<1 1\n9 2>>>"
