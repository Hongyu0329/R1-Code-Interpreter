    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what 450 degrees clockwise rotation means:\n   * 360 degrees = full rotation (back to original)\n   * 450 degrees = 360 + 90 degrees\n   * So, 450 degrees rotation is equivalent to 90 degrees rotation\n\n2) For a 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n   * First row becomes last column\n   * Second row becomes second-to-last column\n   * Last row becomes first column\n\n3) Let's write code to perform this rotation and handle the input:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 2, 5],\n    [8, 9, 5],\n    [4, 9, 2]\n]\n\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(mat):\n    N = len(mat)\n    # Create new matrix with reversed rows\n    return [[mat[N-1-j][i] for j in range(N)] for i in range(N)]\n\n# Since 450 degrees = 90 degrees (as 450 = 360 + 90)\nrotated = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format output\noutput = '\\n'.join(' '.join(str(x) for x in row) for row in rotated)\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nAfter running this code, we get the matrix rotated 450 degrees (which is same as 90 degrees) clockwise.\n\n<<<4 8 9\n9 9 2\n2 5 5>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the correct answer. Let me explain why this is the correct result:\n\n1) The original matrix was:\n   9 2 5\n   8 9 5\n   4 9 2\n\n2) A 450-degree rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree rotation because:\n   * 450 = 360 + 90\n   * 360 degrees is a full rotation (returns to original position)\n   * So we only needed to perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation\n\n3) In a 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n   * The first column from bottom to top becomes the first row (4,8,9)\n   * The second column from bottom to top becomes the second row (9,9,2)\n   * The third column from bottom to top becomes the third row (2,5,5)\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that the final answer is:\n\n<<<4 8 9\n9 9 2\n2 5 5>>>"
