    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what a 270-degree clockwise rotation means:\n   - It's equivalent to three 90-degree clockwise rotations\n   - Or one 90-degree counterclockwise rotation\n\n2) For the given 2x2 matrix:\n   ```\n   5 9\n   9 0\n   ```\n\n3) Let's write a Python code that can:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Perform the rotation\n   - Format the output correctly\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [[5, 9],\n         [9, 0]]\n\n# For 270 degrees clockwise (or 90 degrees counterclockwise)\n# We can do this in one step rather than three 90-degree rotations\nn = len(matrix)\nrotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated[n-1-j][i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in rotated:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\noutput = output.strip()\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\n4) Let's verify the rotation:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     5 9\n     9 0\n     ```\n   - After 270Â° clockwise rotation:\n     ```\n     9 0\n     5 9\n     ```\n\nThe code has generated the correct output. For a 270-degree clockwise rotation:\n- The first row (5 9) becomes the second column from bottom to top (5 9)\n- The second row (9 0) becomes the first column from bottom to top (9 0)\n\n<<<9 0\n5 9>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Let me verify the answer is correct:\n\n1) For a 270-degree clockwise rotation of a 2x2 matrix:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     5 9\n     9 0\n     ```\n   - After rotation:\n     ```\n     9 0\n     5 9\n     ```\n\n2) This is correct because:\n   - The first row (5 9) becomes the second column reading from bottom to top (5 9)\n   - The second row (9 0) becomes the first column reading from bottom to top (9 0)\n\n3) The output format matches what we see in the code execution:\n   ```\n   9 0\n   5 9\n   ```\n\nTherefore, I will provide the final answer in the requested format:\n\n<<<9 0\n5 9>>>"
