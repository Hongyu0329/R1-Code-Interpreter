    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what rotating a matrix 180 degrees clockwise means:\n   - It's equivalent to flipping the matrix both horizontally and vertically\n   - Or we can say it's reversing all elements when reading from left to right, top to bottom\n\n2) For a 3x3 matrix, the transformation would be:\n   - Elements will move to their opposite positions\n   - First element (0,0) goes to (2,2)\n   - Second element (0,1) goes to (2,1)\n   - And so on...\n\n3) Let's write a Python code to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 6, 1],\n    [5, 8, 8],\n    [0, 0, 4]\n]\n\n# Function to rotate matrix 180 degrees\ndef rotate_180(mat):\n    n = len(mat)\n    # Create a new matrix to store rotated values\n    rotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[i][j] = mat[n-1-i][n-1-j]\n    \n    return rotated\n\n# Get rotated matrix\nresult = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print in required format\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in result:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nNow that we have the rotated matrix, I can provide the final answer:\n\n<<<4 0 0\n8 8 5\n1 6 5>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and provided the expected output. Let me verify the result:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n5 6 1\n5 8 8\n0 0 4\n\nAfter 180-degree clockwise rotation:\n4 0 0\n8 8 5\n1 6 5\n\nThe rotation is correct because:\n1) The top-left 5 moved to bottom-right\n2) The top-middle 6 moved to bottom-middle\n3) The top-right 1 moved to bottom-left\n4) And so on...\n\nEach element has moved to its opposite position in the matrix, which is what we expect in a 180-degree rotation.\n\nTherefore, I can confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<4 0 0\n8 8 5\n1 6 5>>>"
