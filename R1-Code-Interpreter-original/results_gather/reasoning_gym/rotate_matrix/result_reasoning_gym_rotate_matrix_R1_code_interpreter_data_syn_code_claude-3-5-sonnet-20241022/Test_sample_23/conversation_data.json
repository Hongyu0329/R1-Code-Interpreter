    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 3x3 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it clockwise by 720 degrees\n   - 720 degrees means we need to rotate it 2 complete rotations (360° × 2)\n   - Since we're rotating by 720 degrees, the matrix will return to its original position\n\n2) Let's write a Python code to verify this:\n   - First, we'll create a function to rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise\n   - Then we'll apply this rotation 8 times (90° × 8 = 720°)\n   - Finally, we'll format the output as required\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with reversed rows\n    rotated = [[matrix[n-1-j][i] for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]\n    return rotated\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 2, 4],\n    [1, 2, 4],\n    [1, 5, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate 8 times (720 degrees)\nresult = matrix\nfor _ in range(8):\n    result = rotate_90_clockwise(result)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\\n\".join(\" \".join(str(num) for num in row) for row in result)\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\n3) After executing this code, we can confirm that:\n   - A 720-degree rotation is equivalent to no rotation at all\n   - The matrix will be exactly the same as the input matrix\n\nTherefore, I can provide the final answer:\n\n<<<3 2 4\n1 2 4\n1 5 7>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) The reasoning behind the result:\n   - A 360-degree rotation brings any object back to its original position\n   - Therefore, a 720-degree rotation (which is 2 × 360 degrees) will also bring the matrix back to its original position\n   - This is similar to rotating a physical object twice completely - it ends up exactly where it started\n\n2) To verify this, let's break down what happens in each 90-degree rotation:\n   - After 90° rotation: The matrix changes\n   - After 180° rotation: The matrix changes again\n   - After 270° rotation: The matrix changes again\n   - After 360° rotation: The matrix returns to original position\n   - The process repeats for the second 360° rotation\n\nThe answer we got is correct, and we can confirm it matches the input matrix exactly:\n<<<3 2 4\n1 2 4\n1 5 7>>>"
