    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have an 8x8 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 720 degrees clockwise\n   - 720 degrees = 2 complete rotations (360° × 2)\n   - Since we're rotating twice, the result will be the same as rotating 0 times\n   - Therefore, the output will be the same as the input matrix\n\n2) Let's verify this with code. I'll write a program that:\n   - Takes the input matrix\n   - Performs the rotation\n   - Returns the result\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with reversed columns\n    return [[matrix[n-1-j][i] for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 4, 8, 3, 7, 7, 8, 7],\n    [8, 5, 6, 3, 1, 8, 7, 4],\n    [3, 7, 9, 0, 4, 1, 2, 8],\n    [2, 1, 2, 5, 5, 9, 5, 9],\n    [3, 3, 6, 7, 7, 0, 2, 0],\n    [5, 4, 5, 4, 0, 2, 6, 1],\n    [4, 8, 0, 2, 2, 9, 8, 6],\n    [6, 2, 8, 6, 5, 3, 3, 4]\n]\n\n# Rotate 720 degrees (4 times 90 degrees)\nresult = matrix\nfor _ in range(8):  # 720/90 = 8 rotations\n    result = rotate_matrix_90(result)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in result:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\n3) As we predicted mathematically, rotating 720 degrees (which is 8 times 90 degrees) should give us back the original matrix.\n\n<<<4 4 8 3 7 7 8 7\n8 5 6 3 1 8 7 4\n3 7 9 0 4 1 2 8\n2 1 2 5 5 9 5 9\n3 3 6 7 7 0 2 0\n5 4 5 4 0 2 6 1\n4 8 0 2 2 9 8 6\n6 2 8 6 5 3 3 4>>>",
    "The code execution confirms our mathematical reasoning. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) When we rotate a matrix by 720 degrees clockwise:\n   - 720 degrees = 2 full rotations (360° × 2)\n   - Each full rotation (360°) brings the matrix back to its original position\n   - Therefore, after 720 degrees, the matrix returns to its original state\n\n2) We can break this down:\n   - First 360° rotation: 4 × 90° rotations = back to original\n   - Second 360° rotation: another 4 × 90° rotations = back to original again\n\n3) This is why our code showed that after 8 rotations of 90° (720° total), we get back the exact same matrix we started with.\n\nThe output we received matches exactly with the input matrix, which is what we expected mathematically. Therefore, this is the correct answer.\n\n<<<4 4 8 3 7 7 8 7\n8 5 6 3 1 8 7 4\n3 7 9 0 4 1 2 8\n2 1 2 5 5 9 5 9\n3 3 6 7 7 0 2 0\n5 4 5 4 0 2 6 1\n4 8 0 2 2 9 8 6\n6 2 8 6 5 3 3 4>>>"
