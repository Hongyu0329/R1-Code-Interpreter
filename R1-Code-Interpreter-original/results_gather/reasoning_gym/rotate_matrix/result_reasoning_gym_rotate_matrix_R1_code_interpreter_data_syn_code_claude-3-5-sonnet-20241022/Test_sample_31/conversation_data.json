    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 9x9 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it by 0 degrees clockwise\n   - A 0-degree rotation means the matrix stays the same\n\n2) Since we're rotating by 0 degrees, we just need to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Format it properly for output\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix as a string\nmatrix_str = \"\"\"7 4 4 7 1 6 1 1 3\n4 1 4 9 0 3 2 5 3\n4 9 0 0 9 2 3 9 8\n6 6 5 7 3 1 0 0 5\n9 5 1 0 9 2 9 0 6\n7 0 5 0 5 0 5 6 1\n4 8 8 1 3 8 3 9 6\n7 2 0 5 3 6 5 8 2\n4 7 1 6 2 5 2 2 4\"\"\"\n\n# Split into rows and convert to integers\nmatrix = [list(map(int, row.split())) for row in matrix_str.strip().split('\\n')]\n\n# For 0 degree rotation, matrix remains the same\n# Format output\noutput = '\\n'.join(' '.join(str(num) for num in row) for row in matrix)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nSince we're rotating by 0 degrees, the matrix remains exactly the same. Let me provide the final answer:\n\n<<<7 4 4 7 1 6 1 1 3\n4 1 4 9 0 3 2 5 3\n4 9 0 0 9 2 3 9 8\n6 6 5 7 3 1 0 0 5\n9 5 1 0 9 2 9 0 6\n7 0 5 0 5 0 5 6 1\n4 8 8 1 3 8 3 9 6\n7 2 0 5 3 6 5 8 2\n4 7 1 6 2 5 2 2 4>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Since we were asked to rotate the matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, the matrix remains unchanged from its original form. \n\nTo verify our solution:\n1. A 0-degree rotation means no change to the original matrix\n2. The output matrix is exactly the same as the input matrix\n3. The format matches the requirement (9x9 matrix with space-separated numbers)\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that our answer is correct:\n\n<<<7 4 4 7 1 6 1 1 3\n4 1 4 9 0 3 2 5 3\n4 9 0 0 9 2 3 9 8\n6 6 5 7 3 1 0 0 5\n9 5 1 0 9 2 9 0 6\n7 0 5 0 5 0 5 6 1\n4 8 8 1 3 8 3 9 6\n7 2 0 5 3 6 5 8 2\n4 7 1 6 2 5 2 2 4>>>"
