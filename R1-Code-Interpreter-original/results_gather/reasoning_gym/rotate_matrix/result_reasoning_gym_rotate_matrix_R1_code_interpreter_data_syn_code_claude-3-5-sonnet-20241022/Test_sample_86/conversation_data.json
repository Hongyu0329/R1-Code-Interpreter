    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what 810 degrees clockwise means:\n   * 360 degrees = 1 complete rotation (back to original)\n   * 810 รท 360 = 2 complete rotations with 90 degrees remaining\n   * So rotating 810 degrees is equivalent to rotating 90 degrees clockwise\n\n2) For a 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n   * First row becomes last column\n   * Second row becomes second-to-last column\n   * And so on...\n\n3) Let's write code to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with rotated elements\n    rotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    return rotated\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 1, 5, 4],\n    [0, 4, 5, 0],\n    [9, 7, 8, 9],\n    [5, 9, 8, 2]\n]\n\n# Rotate 810 degrees (equivalent to 90 degrees)\nresult = rotate_matrix_90(matrix)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\\n\".join(\" \".join(str(x) for x in row) for row in result)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nAfter executing this code, we get the rotated matrix. Since 810 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees clockwise rotation, this is our final answer:\n\n<<<5 9 0 4\n9 7 4 1\n8 8 5 5\n2 9 0 4>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Let me verify the result:\n\n1) The original matrix was:\n```\n4 1 5 4\n0 4 5 0\n9 7 8 9\n5 9 8 2\n```\n\n2) After rotating 810 degrees clockwise (which is equivalent to 90 degrees clockwise):\n- The first row (4 1 5 4) became the last column (4 1 5 4) read from bottom to top\n- The second row (0 4 5 0) became the third column (0 4 5 0) read from bottom to top\n- The third row (9 7 8 9) became the second column (9 7 8 9) read from bottom to top\n- The fourth row (5 9 8 2) became the first column (5 9 8 2) read from bottom to top\n\n3) The result is correct:\n```\n5 9 0 4\n9 7 4 1\n8 8 5 5\n2 9 0 4\n```\n\nTherefore, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<5 9 0 4\n9 7 4 1\n8 8 5 5\n2 9 0 4>>>"
