    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have an 8x8 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 450 degrees clockwise\n   - 450 degrees = 360 degrees + 90 degrees, which means we only need to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise\n   - One 90-degree clockwise rotation means:\n     * First row becomes last column\n     * Second row becomes second-to-last column\n     * And so on...\n\n2) Let's write a Python code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Create a function to rotate 90 degrees clockwise\n   - Apply the rotation once (since 450° ≡ 90° in terms of rotation)\n   - Format the output properly\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with dimensions swapped\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the new matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            result[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 3, 6, 7, 4, 8, 1, 8],\n    [6, 8, 5, 0, 1, 8, 1, 2],\n    [7, 0, 8, 6, 9, 3, 4, 4],\n    [5, 5, 8, 1, 6, 8, 7, 4],\n    [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 3, 2, 7],\n    [3, 1, 7, 5, 5, 3, 2, 4],\n    [2, 3, 4, 2, 0, 9, 4, 2],\n    [0, 7, 6, 3, 3, 7, 8, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate once (90 degrees)\nrotated = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format and print the output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in rotated:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nNow that we have the rotated matrix, let's format it according to the requirements:\n\n<<<0 2 3 5 2 7 6 9\n7 3 1 5 3 0 8 3\n6 4 7 8 4 8 5 6\n3 2 5 1 6 6 0 7\n3 0 5 6 7 9 1 4\n7 9 3 8 3 3 8 8\n8 4 2 7 2 4 1 1\n7 2 4 4 7 4 2 8>>>",
    "I notice that my output doesn't match the code output. Let me verify the rotation process and provide the correct answer based on the code execution.\n\nThe code has correctly rotated the matrix 90 degrees clockwise (which is equivalent to 450 degrees), and we should trust the code output. Looking at the result:\n\n- The first row of the original matrix (9 3 6 7 4 8 1 8) became the last column of the rotated matrix (reading from top to bottom: 9 3 6 7 4 8 1 8)\n- The transformation is correct for all other elements as well\n\nTherefore, the correct answer based on the code execution is:\n\n<<<0 2 3 2 5 7 6 9\n7 3 1 3 5 0 8 3\n6 4 7 4 8 8 5 6\n3 2 5 6 1 6 0 7\n3 0 5 7 6 9 1 4\n7 9 3 3 8 3 8 8\n8 4 2 2 7 4 1 1\n7 2 4 7 4 4 2 8>>>"
