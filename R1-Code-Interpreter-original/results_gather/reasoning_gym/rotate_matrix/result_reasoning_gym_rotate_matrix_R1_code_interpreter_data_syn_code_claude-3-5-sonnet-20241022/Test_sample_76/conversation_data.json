    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what a 540-degree rotation means:\n   - 540 = 360 + 180\n   - 360 degrees is a full rotation (returns to original)\n   - So 540 degrees is equivalent to 180 degrees\n   - 180 degrees means rotating the matrix twice clockwise (90 degrees each)\n\n2) For a 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n   - First row becomes last column\n   - Second row becomes second-to-last column\n   - And so on...\n\n3) For 180 degrees (our case), we need to do this twice.\n\nLet's write a Python code to handle this:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with dimensions reversed\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the new matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            result[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    return result\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 6, 4, 6],\n    [3, 1, 4, 3],\n    [2, 3, 5, 3],\n    [1, 3, 1, 8]\n]\n\n# Rotate twice for 180 degrees (equivalent to 540 degrees)\nresult = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\nresult = rotate_90_clockwise(result)\n\n# Format the output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in result:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nNow that we have rotated the matrix 180 degrees (equivalent to 540 degrees), let's format the answer:\n\n<<<8 3 3 6\n1 5 4 4\n3 3 1 6\n1 2 3 1>>>",
    "I notice that the output I provided was incorrect. Let me verify the result from the code execution.\n\nFor a 180-degree rotation (which is equivalent to 540 degrees):\n- The bottom-right element becomes top-left\n- The bottom-left element becomes top-right\n- The top-right element becomes bottom-left\n- The top-left element becomes bottom-right\n- And so on...\n\nLooking at the code output:\n8 1 3 1\n3 5 3 2\n3 4 1 3\n6 4 6 1\n\nThis is indeed correct because:\n1) Original matrix:\n   1 6 4 6\n   3 1 4 3\n   2 3 5 3\n   1 3 1 8\n\n2) After 180-degree rotation:\n   - 8 (bottom-right) moves to top-left\n   - 1 (top-left) moves to bottom-right\n   - And all other elements follow the same pattern\n\nTherefore, I can now provide the correct answer:\n\n<<<8 1 3 1\n3 5 3 2\n3 4 1 3\n6 4 6 1>>>"
