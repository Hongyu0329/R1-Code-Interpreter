    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We need to rotate a 8x8 matrix by 540 degrees clockwise\n   - 540 degrees = 360 degrees + 180 degrees\n   - This means we need to rotate the matrix 1.5 times\n   - Since one full rotation (360 degrees) brings us back to the original, we just need to rotate 180 degrees\n   - A 180-degree rotation means each element will move to its opposite position\n\n2) Let's write code to handle this:\n   - First, we'll create a function to parse the input matrix\n   - Then, we'll implement the rotation\n   - Finally, format the output as required\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\ninput_str = \"\"\"5 3 2 6 9 4 8 4\n6 9 0 3 0 7 2 2\n5 2 4 9 9 0 1 9\n0 6 4 3 1 5 7 2\n8 0 1 1 2 2 0 4\n5 3 9 0 9 9 2 6\n0 4 6 2 1 1 6 0\n7 6 3 0 1 2 1 7\"\"\"\n\n# Convert input string to matrix\nmatrix = [list(map(int, row.split())) for row in input_str.splitlines()]\n\n# For 180-degree rotation, we can simply reverse the matrix both horizontally and vertically\n# or we can directly map each element to its opposite position\nn = len(matrix)\nrotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Rotate 180 degrees\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated[i][j] = matrix[n-1-i][n-1-j]\n\n# Format output\noutput = '\\n'.join(' '.join(str(num) for num in row) for row in rotated)\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nLet me explain what the code does:\n1) We first convert the input string into a 2D matrix\n2) For a 180-degree rotation, each element at position (i,j) moves to position (n-1-i, n-1-j)\n3) We create a new matrix to store the rotated values\n4) Finally, we format the output as required with triple angle brackets\n\nThe output shows the matrix rotated by 540 degrees (which is equivalent to 180 degrees) clockwise.\n\n<<<7 1 2 1 0 3 6 7\n0 6 1 1 2 6 4 0\n6 2 9 9 0 9 3 5\n4 0 2 2 1 1 0 8\n2 7 5 1 3 4 6 0\n9 1 0 9 9 4 2 5\n2 2 7 0 3 0 9 6\n4 8 4 9 6 2 3 5>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors. Let me verify the solution:\n\n1) For a 540-degree rotation:\n   - 540° = 360° + 180°\n   - One complete rotation (360°) brings the matrix back to its original position\n   - Then we need an additional 180° rotation\n   - The code correctly implemented the 180° rotation by mapping each element to its opposite position\n\n2) To verify the result:\n   - The original top-left element (5) is now at the bottom-right position\n   - The original top-right element (4) is now at the bottom-left position\n   - The original bottom-left element (7) is now at the top-right position\n   - The original bottom-right element (7) is now at the top-left position\n   - All other elements follow the same pattern\n\nThe output is correct, so I can provide the final answer:\n\n<<<7 1 2 1 0 3 6 7\n0 6 1 1 2 6 4 0\n6 2 9 9 0 9 3 5\n4 0 2 2 1 1 0 8\n2 7 5 1 3 4 6 0\n9 1 0 9 9 4 2 5\n2 2 7 0 3 0 9 6\n4 8 4 9 6 2 3 5>>>"
