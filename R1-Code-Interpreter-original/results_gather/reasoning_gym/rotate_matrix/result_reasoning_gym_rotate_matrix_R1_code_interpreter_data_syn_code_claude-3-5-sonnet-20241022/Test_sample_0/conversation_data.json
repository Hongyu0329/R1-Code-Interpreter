    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 3x3 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it clockwise by 720 degrees\n   - 720 degrees means we need to rotate it 2 complete rotations (360° × 2)\n\n2) Key observations:\n   - A 720-degree rotation is equivalent to no rotation at all, as we're rotating the matrix completely twice\n   - This means our output matrix should be exactly the same as the input matrix\n\n3) Let's write code to verify this. We'll:\n   - Create the matrix\n   - Create a function to rotate 90 degrees clockwise (just for demonstration)\n   - Show that rotating 8 times (90° × 8 = 720°) gives us back the original matrix\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with same dimensions\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            result[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 2, 4],\n    [3, 7, 0],\n    [0, 1, 5]\n]\n\n# Rotate 8 times (720 degrees)\nresult = matrix\nfor _ in range(8):\n    result = rotate_90_clockwise(result)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\", end=\"\")\nfor i in range(len(result)):\n    for j in range(len(result[i])):\n        print(result[i][j], end=\"\")\n        if j < len(result[i]) - 1:\n            print(\" \", end=\"\")\n    if i < len(result) - 1:\n        print(\"\\n\", end=\"\")\nprint(\">>>\")\n```\n\nAs expected, rotating a matrix by 720 degrees (or any multiple of 360 degrees) will return the same matrix.\n\n<<<3 2 4\n3 7 0\n0 1 5>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) The rotation of 720 degrees clockwise can be broken down as follows:\n   - One complete rotation is 360 degrees\n   - 720 degrees = 360 degrees × 2\n   - Therefore, we're rotating the matrix completely twice\n\n2) When we rotate a matrix by 360 degrees (one complete rotation):\n   - The matrix returns to its original position\n   - Doing this twice (720 degrees) will still give us the original matrix\n\n3) This is similar to rotating a physical object:\n   - If you rotate an object by 360 degrees, it comes back to its starting position\n   - Rotating it again by another 360 degrees (total 720 degrees) keeps it in the same position\n\nTherefore, the output matrix is identical to the input matrix:\n\n<<<3 2 4\n3 7 0\n0 1 5>>>"
