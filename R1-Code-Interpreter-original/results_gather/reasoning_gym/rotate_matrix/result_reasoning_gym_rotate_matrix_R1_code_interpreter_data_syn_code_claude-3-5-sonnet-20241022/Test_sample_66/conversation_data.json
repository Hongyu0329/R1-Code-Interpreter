    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what rotating a matrix 180 degrees clockwise means:\n   - It's equivalent to flipping the matrix both horizontally and vertically\n   - Or simply reversing all elements from start to end\n\n2) For a matrix rotation by 180 degrees:\n   - Each element at position (i,j) will move to position (n-1-i, n-1-j)\n   - Where n is the size of the matrix\n\n3) Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Rotate it 180 degrees\n   - Format the output properly\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 0, 5, 6, 0, 7, 4],\n    [8, 1, 7, 3, 6, 0, 5],\n    [0, 0, 6, 4, 5, 0, 7],\n    [3, 8, 2, 6, 2, 9, 8],\n    [3, 4, 9, 8, 2, 3, 8],\n    [3, 6, 8, 1, 8, 2, 6],\n    [2, 5, 7, 2, 4, 8, 1]\n]\n\n# Function to rotate matrix 180 degrees\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix to store rotated values\n    rotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the rotated matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[i][j] = matrix[n-1-i][n-1-j]\n    \n    return rotated\n\n# Get rotated matrix\nresult = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Format and print the result\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in result:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\n4) After executing the code, we can format the output according to the requirements.\n\n<<<1 8 4 2 7 5 2\n6 2 8 1 8 6 3\n8 3 2 8 9 4 3\n8 9 2 6 2 8 3\n7 0 5 4 6 0 0\n5 0 6 3 7 1 8\n4 7 0 6 5 0 9>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Let me verify the result:\n\n1) The original matrix was:\n```\n9 0 5 6 0 7 4\n8 1 7 3 6 0 5\n0 0 6 4 5 0 7\n3 8 2 6 2 9 8\n3 4 9 8 2 3 8\n3 6 8 1 8 2 6\n2 5 7 2 4 8 1\n```\n\n2) After rotating 180 degrees clockwise:\n- The first row becomes the last row (reversed)\n- The second row becomes the second-to-last row (reversed)\n- And so on...\n\n3) The output matches what we expect from a 180-degree rotation:\n- Each element has moved to its opposite position\n- The transformation is correct for all elements\n- The matrix dimensions are preserved (7x7)\n\nTherefore, I can confirm the answer is correct.\n\n<<<1 8 4 2 7 5 2\n6 2 8 1 8 6 3\n8 3 2 8 9 4 3\n8 9 2 6 2 8 3\n7 0 5 4 6 0 0\n5 0 6 3 7 1 8\n4 7 0 6 5 0 9>>>"
