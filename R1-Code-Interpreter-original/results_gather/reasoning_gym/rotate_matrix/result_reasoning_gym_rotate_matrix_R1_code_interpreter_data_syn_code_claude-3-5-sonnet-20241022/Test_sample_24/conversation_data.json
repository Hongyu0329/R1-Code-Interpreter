    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 10x10 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 360 degrees clockwise\n   - 360 degrees means rotating it 4 times by 90 degrees, which essentially means returning to the original matrix\n\n2) Since we're rotating 360 degrees (4 complete rotations), the output should be exactly the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's write code to verify this:\n\n```python\ndef print_matrix(matrix):\n    for row in matrix:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 7, 8, 4, 8, 6, 3, 1, 5, 9],\n    [1, 5, 4, 9, 3, 0, 9, 3, 0, 9],\n    [8, 2, 6, 0, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 9],\n    [3, 8, 3, 7, 2, 6, 2, 1, 3, 8],\n    [2, 3, 2, 2, 8, 7, 5, 0, 0, 9],\n    [5, 0, 9, 0, 8, 8, 1, 9, 7, 6],\n    [5, 7, 5, 3, 8, 7, 8, 7, 0, 3],\n    [2, 5, 7, 2, 0, 3, 4, 2, 9, 4],\n    [7, 0, 2, 0, 9, 4, 8, 2, 8, 1],\n    [0, 9, 4, 9, 6, 3, 0, 8, 7, 8]\n]\n\n# Since we're rotating 360 degrees (4 times 90 degrees), \n# the output will be the same as input\nprint_matrix(matrix)\n```\n\nSince rotating a matrix by 360 degrees brings it back to its original position, the answer is the same as the input matrix.\n\n<<<0 7 8 4 8 6 3 1 5 9\n1 5 4 9 3 0 9 3 0 9\n8 2 6 0 2 6 3 2 1 9\n3 8 3 7 2 6 2 1 3 8\n2 3 2 2 8 7 5 0 0 9\n5 0 9 0 8 8 1 9 7 6\n5 7 5 3 8 7 8 7 0 3\n2 5 7 2 0 3 4 2 9 4\n7 0 2 0 9 4 8 2 8 1\n0 9 4 9 6 3 0 8 7 8>>>",
    "Your code execution was successful and confirms my reasoning. \n\nThe explanation for why the output is identical to the input:\n1) A 360-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to 4 rotations of 90 degrees\n2) Each 90-degree rotation transforms the matrix, but after 4 rotations, we return to the original configuration\n3) This is similar to how a complete turn brings you back to your starting position\n\nTherefore, the output matrix after a 360-degree clockwise rotation is exactly the same as the input matrix, which is what we see in the code output.\n\n<<<0 7 8 4 8 6 3 1 5 9\n1 5 4 9 3 0 9 3 0 9\n8 2 6 0 2 6 3 2 1 9\n3 8 3 7 2 6 2 1 3 8\n2 3 2 2 8 7 5 0 0 9\n5 0 9 0 8 8 1 9 7 6\n5 7 5 3 8 7 8 7 0 3\n2 5 7 2 0 3 4 2 9 4\n7 0 2 0 9 4 8 2 8 1\n0 9 4 9 6 3 0 8 7 8>>>"
