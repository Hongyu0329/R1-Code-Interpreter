    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what rotating a matrix 180 degrees means:\n   - It's equivalent to flipping the matrix both horizontally and vertically\n   - Or we can say each element (i,j) moves to position (n-1-i, n-1-j) where n is the size of matrix\n\n2) Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Rotate it 180 degrees\n   - Format the output properly\n\n```python\n# Input matrix as string\nmatrix_str = \"\"\"8 8 1 2 6 3 4 0\n3 1 9 0 1 2 8 4\n6 9 6 5 5 1 5 4\n9 2 1 8 1 9 1 4\n5 1 4 0 5 6 1 7\n7 3 3 2 4 3 0 0\n6 0 5 5 7 7 9 8\n2 3 7 7 5 9 0 4\"\"\"\n\n# Convert string to 2D list\nmatrix = [list(map(int, row.split())) for row in matrix_str.strip().split('\\n')]\n\n# Get dimensions\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create rotated matrix\nrotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Rotate 180 degrees\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated[i][j] = matrix[n-1-i][n-1-j]\n\n# Format output\noutput = '\\n'.join(' '.join(str(num) for num in row) for row in rotated)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nNow that we have the rotated matrix, let's format it according to the requirements.\n\n<<<4 0 9 5 7 7 3 2\n8 9 7 7 5 5 0 6\n0 0 3 4 2 3 3 7\n7 1 6 5 0 4 1 5\n4 1 9 1 8 1 2 9\n4 5 1 5 5 6 9 6\n4 8 2 1 0 9 1 3\n0 4 3 6 2 1 8 8>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Let me verify the result:\n\n1) The original matrix's corners were:\n   - Top-left: 8\n   - Top-right: 0\n   - Bottom-left: 2\n   - Bottom-right: 4\n\n2) After 180-degree rotation:\n   - Top-left: 4 (original bottom-right)\n   - Top-right: 2 (original bottom-left)\n   - Bottom-left: 0 (original top-right)\n   - Bottom-right: 8 (original top-left)\n\n3) The middle elements have also been correctly rotated 180 degrees.\n\nThe output matches what we expect from a 180-degree clockwise rotation. Therefore, I can confirm the answer is correct.\n\n<<<4 0 9 5 7 7 3 2\n8 9 7 7 5 5 0 6\n0 0 3 4 2 3 3 7\n7 1 6 5 0 4 1 5\n4 1 9 1 8 1 2 9\n4 5 1 5 5 6 9 6\n4 8 2 1 0 9 1 3\n0 4 3 6 2 1 8 8>>>"
