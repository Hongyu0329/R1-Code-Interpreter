    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 9x9 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 360 degrees clockwise\n   - 360 degrees means 4 rotations of 90 degrees each\n   - Actually, 360 degrees rotation means the matrix will return to its original state\n\n2) Let's write a code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Rotate it 360 degrees (which means no change)\n   - Format the output properly\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 5, 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 6, 1],\n    [2, 9, 0, 9, 8, 1, 9, 5, 6],\n    [1, 1, 3, 3, 7, 2, 9, 4, 9],\n    [4, 5, 3, 7, 1, 1, 0, 2, 9],\n    [1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 3, 9, 3, 9],\n    [6, 2, 5, 7, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8],\n    [2, 8, 1, 4, 5, 9, 1, 8, 0],\n    [4, 8, 0, 6, 8, 0, 0, 9, 7],\n    [0, 0, 8, 6, 2, 8, 4, 8, 2]\n]\n\n# Since we're rotating 360 degrees (4 times 90 degrees),\n# the matrix will return to its original state\n# Let's format it properly for output\n\nresult = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    result += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\n\n# Remove the last newline and print\nprint(result.strip())\n```\n\nSince we're rotating the matrix by 360 degrees, which means four 90-degree rotations, the matrix will return to its original state. Therefore, the output will be the same as the input.\n\n<<<9 5 1 1 5 2 2 6 1\n2 9 0 9 8 1 9 5 6\n1 1 3 3 7 2 9 4 9\n4 5 3 7 1 1 0 2 9\n1 1 1 4 0 3 9 3 9\n6 2 5 7 1 7 6 2 8\n2 8 1 4 5 9 1 8 0\n4 8 0 6 8 0 0 9 7\n0 0 8 6 2 8 4 8 2>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Since we're rotating the matrix by 360 degrees (which is equivalent to 4 complete 90-degree clockwise rotations), the matrix returns to its original position. This is because:\n\n1) 360° = 4 × 90°\n2) Each 90° rotation transforms the matrix, but after 4 such rotations, we get back to the original configuration\n3) This is similar to making a complete turn and ending up where you started\n\nTherefore, the answer is correct. The matrix after a 360-degree clockwise rotation is identical to the original matrix.\n\n<<<9 5 1 1 5 2 2 6 1\n2 9 0 9 8 1 9 5 6\n1 1 3 3 7 2 9 4 9\n4 5 3 7 1 1 0 2 9\n1 1 1 4 0 3 9 3 9\n6 2 5 7 1 7 6 2 8\n2 8 1 4 5 9 1 8 0\n4 8 0 6 8 0 0 9 7\n0 0 8 6 2 8 4 8 2>>>"
