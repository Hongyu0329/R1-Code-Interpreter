    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 9x9 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 180 degrees clockwise\n   - A 180-degree rotation means each element will move to its opposite position\n   - This is equivalent to reversing the matrix both row-wise and column-wise\n\n2) Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Rotate it 180 degrees\n   - Format the output properly\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 9, 4, 7, 6, 2, 5, 3, 8],\n    [7, 0, 6, 9, 3, 7, 7, 4, 5],\n    [3, 3, 9, 2, 7, 8, 5, 6, 9],\n    [6, 4, 0, 1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 1],\n    [9, 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 7, 0, 4],\n    [6, 8, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 8, 9],\n    [1, 3, 9, 4, 3, 9, 9, 2, 6],\n    [6, 3, 9, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 9],\n    [1, 8, 5, 1, 7, 1, 7, 8, 8]\n]\n\n# For 180-degree rotation, we can simply reverse the matrix and then reverse each row\nrotated = matrix[::-1]  # Reverse the rows\nrotated = [row[::-1] for row in rotated]  # Reverse each row\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in rotated:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\n3) After running the code, we can format the output in the required format.\n\n<<<8 8 7 1 7 1 5 8 1\n9 1 9 5 1 2 9 3 6\n6 2 9 9 3 4 9 3 1\n9 8 2 6 8 4 2 8 6\n4 0 7 8 4 3 1 0 9\n1 6 4 3 1 1 0 4 6\n9 6 5 8 7 2 9 3 3\n5 4 7 7 3 9 6 0 7\n8 3 5 2 6 7 4 9 9>>>",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
