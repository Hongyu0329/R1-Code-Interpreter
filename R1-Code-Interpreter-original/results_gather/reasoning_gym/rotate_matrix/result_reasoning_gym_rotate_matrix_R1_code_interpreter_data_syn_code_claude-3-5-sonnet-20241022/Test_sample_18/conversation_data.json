    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 9x9 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it by 0 degrees clockwise\n   - A 0-degree rotation means the matrix stays the same\n\n2) Since we're rotating by 0 degrees, we just need to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Format it properly for output\n\n3) Let's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix as a string\nmatrix_str = \"\"\"4 5 3 7 5 1 8 5 3\n8 1 2 5 1 5 5 3 3\n1 5 9 9 6 1 1 9 5\n6 0 3 5 4 6 1 3 7\n4 9 7 2 4 9 3 8 9\n1 6 9 1 8 7 6 8 8\n2 7 9 8 4 1 5 8 2\n0 5 0 9 6 7 8 3 2\n9 1 2 4 6 3 5 0 8\"\"\"\n\n# Split into rows and convert to matrix\nmatrix = [row.split() for row in matrix_str.strip().split('\\n')]\n\n# Format output\noutput = '\\n'.join(' '.join(row) for row in matrix)\nprint(output)\n```\n\n4) Since we're rotating by 0 degrees, the matrix remains unchanged. Let's format the answer with triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<4 5 3 7 5 1 8 5 3\n8 1 2 5 1 5 5 3 3\n1 5 9 9 6 1 1 9 5\n6 0 3 5 4 6 1 3 7\n4 9 7 2 4 9 3 8 9\n1 6 9 1 8 7 6 8 8\n2 7 9 8 4 1 5 8 2\n0 5 0 9 6 7 8 3 2\n9 1 2 4 6 3 5 0 8>>>",
    "The code executed correctly without any errors. Since we were asked to rotate the matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, which means no rotation at all, the output matrix is identical to the input matrix. \n\nI'll provide the final answer:\n\n<<<4 5 3 7 5 1 8 5 3\n8 1 2 5 1 5 5 3 3\n1 5 9 9 6 1 1 9 5\n6 0 3 5 4 6 1 3 7\n4 9 7 2 4 9 3 8 9\n1 6 9 1 8 7 6 8 8\n2 7 9 8 4 1 5 8 2\n0 5 0 9 6 7 8 3 2\n9 1 2 4 6 3 5 0 8>>>"
