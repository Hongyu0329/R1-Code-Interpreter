    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what rotating a matrix 180 degrees means:\n   - It's equivalent to flipping the matrix both horizontally and vertically\n   - Or we can say each element (i,j) moves to position (n-1-i, n-1-j) where n is the size of matrix\n\n2) Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Rotate it 180 degrees\n   - Format the output properly\n\n```python\n# Input matrix as string\nmatrix_str = \"\"\"8 9 8 8 9 4 1 9\n8 7 2 1 9 5 0 0\n0 2 9 2 9 9 2 6\n7 2 1 2 7 1 6 5\n6 0 4 2 2 3 9 2\n3 9 2 7 0 6 4 4\n4 1 9 8 0 5 6 2\n9 9 4 5 1 1 7 7\"\"\"\n\n# Convert string to 2D list\nmatrix = [list(map(int, row.split())) for row in matrix_str.split('\\n')]\n\n# Get matrix dimensions\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create rotated matrix\nrotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Rotate 180 degrees\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated[i][j] = matrix[n-1-i][n-1-j]\n\n# Format output\noutput = '\\n'.join(' '.join(str(num) for num in row) for row in rotated)\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThe code:\n1) Takes the input matrix as a string\n2) Converts it into a 2D list of integers\n3) Creates a new matrix for the rotated result\n4) Performs 180-degree rotation by mapping each element to its new position\n5) Formats the output according to the specified format\n\nThe result will be the matrix rotated 180 degrees clockwise, with each row's numbers separated by spaces and rows separated by newlines, all enclosed in triple angle brackets.\n\n<<<7 7 1 1 5 4 9 9\n2 6 5 0 8 9 1 4\n4 4 6 0 7 2 9 3\n2 9 3 2 2 4 0 6\n5 6 1 7 2 1 2 7\n6 2 9 9 2 9 2 0\n0 0 5 9 1 2 7 8\n9 1 4 9 8 8 9 8>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors. Let me verify the result:\n\n1) To check if the rotation is correct, we can verify a few key points:\n   - The corners should be correctly rotated:\n     * Original top-left (8) → rotated bottom-right (8)\n     * Original top-right (9) → rotated bottom-left (9)\n     * Original bottom-left (9) → rotated top-right (9)\n     * Original bottom-right (7) → rotated top-left (7)\n   - The middle elements should be correctly positioned\n   - The pattern should be completely inverted\n\n2) After checking these points, I can confirm that the matrix has been correctly rotated 180 degrees clockwise. Each element has moved to its opposite position in the matrix.\n\nTherefore, I can provide the final answer:\n\n<<<7 7 1 1 5 4 9 9\n2 6 5 0 8 9 1 4\n4 4 6 0 7 2 9 3\n2 9 3 2 2 4 0 6\n5 6 1 7 2 1 2 7\n6 2 9 9 2 9 2 0\n0 0 5 9 1 2 7 8\n9 1 4 9 8 8 9 8>>>"
