    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what a 360-degree clockwise rotation means:\n   - A 360-degree rotation means rotating the matrix 4 times by 90 degrees\n   - After a 360-degree rotation, the matrix should return to its original state\n\n2) Let's verify this with code:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with dimensions reversed\n    rotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the new matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    return rotated\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 4, 2],\n    [5, 1, 2],\n    [6, 5, 3]\n]\n\n# Rotate 4 times (360 degrees)\nresult = matrix\nfor _ in range(4):\n    result = rotate_90_clockwise(result)\n\n# Print in required format\nprint('\\n'.join(' '.join(str(x) for x in row) for row in result))\n```\n\n3) After executing this code, we can see that a 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original state.\n\n4) Therefore, the matrix after 360-degree clockwise rotation will be exactly the same as the input matrix.\n\n<<<9 4 2\n5 1 2\n6 5 3>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and confirmed our reasoning. \n\nLet me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) A 360-degree rotation is equivalent to four 90-degree rotations:\n   - First 90° rotation changes the matrix\n   - Second 90° rotation (180° total) changes it again\n   - Third 90° rotation (270° total) changes it further\n   - Fourth 90° rotation (360° total) brings it back to the original position\n\n2) This is similar to turning a piece of paper all the way around - when you complete a full circle, you end up exactly where you started.\n\n3) The code verified this by:\n   - Implementing a 90-degree clockwise rotation function\n   - Applying this rotation four times\n   - Showing that we get back the original matrix\n\n4) Therefore, the output matrix is identical to the input matrix, which is mathematically expected for a 360-degree rotation.\n\n<<<9 4 2\n5 1 2\n6 5 3>>>"
