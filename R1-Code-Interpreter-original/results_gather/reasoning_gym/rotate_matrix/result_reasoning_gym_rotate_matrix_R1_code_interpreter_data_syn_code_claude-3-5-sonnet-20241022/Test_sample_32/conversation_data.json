    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 9x9 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 0 degrees clockwise\n   - A 0-degree rotation means the matrix stays the same\n\n2) Since we're rotating by 0 degrees, we just need to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Format it properly for output\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix as a string\nmatrix_str = \"\"\"1 9 6 8 0 3 4 3 2\n1 6 7 3 0 1 6 0 1\n2 1 9 0 9 4 3 8 3\n1 0 7 6 3 4 2 8 6\n5 8 4 5 7 8 2 0 0\n3 7 2 3 3 0 4 3 3\n0 4 1 2 4 3 9 3 3\n2 9 4 6 7 4 5 2 4\n2 2 4 0 2 0 1 1 8\"\"\"\n\n# Split into rows and convert to matrix\nmatrix = [row.split() for row in matrix_str.split('\\n')]\n\n# Format output\noutput = '\\n'.join(' '.join(row) for row in matrix)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nSince we're rotating by 0 degrees, the matrix remains unchanged. Let's format the answer:\n\n<<<1 9 6 8 0 3 4 3 2\n1 6 7 3 0 1 6 0 1\n2 1 9 0 9 4 3 8 3\n1 0 7 6 3 4 2 8 6\n5 8 4 5 7 8 2 0 0\n3 7 2 3 3 0 4 3 3\n0 4 1 2 4 3 9 3 3\n2 9 4 6 7 4 5 2 4\n2 2 4 0 2 0 1 1 8>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Since we were asked to rotate the matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, the matrix remains unchanged from its original form. The output matches exactly with the input matrix, which is correct for a 0-degree rotation.\n\nLet me confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<1 9 6 8 0 3 4 3 2\n1 6 7 3 0 1 6 0 1\n2 1 9 0 9 4 3 8 3\n1 0 7 6 3 4 2 8 6\n5 8 4 5 7 8 2 0 0\n3 7 2 3 3 0 4 3 3\n0 4 1 2 4 3 9 3 3\n2 9 4 6 7 4 5 2 4\n2 2 4 0 2 0 1 1 8>>>"
