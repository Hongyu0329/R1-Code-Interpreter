    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 9x9 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 0 degrees clockwise\n   - A 0-degree rotation means the matrix stays the same\n\n2) We need to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Since it's a 0-degree rotation, we just need to format it properly\n   - Return the same matrix in the required format\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix as a string\nmatrix_str = \"\"\"8 1 9 9 3 6 7 4 5\n7 8 5 2 8 1 0 8 7\n1 5 0 1 9 2 3 3 0\n8 6 7 8 6 8 2 8 0\n9 2 9 9 5 2 1 0 7\n6 9 4 1 3 6 6 6 6\n1 4 6 2 0 0 6 6 2\n3 1 5 5 4 9 9 3 7\n6 7 7 8 8 7 6 4 0\"\"\"\n\n# Split into rows and process each row\nmatrix = [row.split() for row in matrix_str.strip().split('\\n')]\n\n# Format the output\noutput = '\\n'.join(' '.join(row) for row in matrix)\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nSince we're rotating by 0 degrees, the matrix remains unchanged. Let me format the answer according to the requirements:\n\n<<<8 1 9 9 3 6 7 4 5\n7 8 5 2 8 1 0 8 7\n1 5 0 1 9 2 3 3 0\n8 6 7 8 6 8 2 8 0\n9 2 9 9 5 2 1 0 7\n6 9 4 1 3 6 6 6 6\n1 4 6 2 0 0 6 6 2\n3 1 5 5 4 9 9 3 7\n6 7 7 8 8 7 6 4 0>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Since we were asked to rotate the matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, the matrix remains unchanged from its original form. \n\nThe output matches our answer format, and we can confirm that this is correct because:\n1) A 0-degree rotation means the matrix stays exactly the same\n2) All numbers are in their original positions\n3) The matrix maintains its 9x9 dimensions\n4) The formatting is preserved with single spaces between numbers\n\nTherefore, I can confidently confirm that our answer is correct:\n\n<<<8 1 9 9 3 6 7 4 5\n7 8 5 2 8 1 0 8 7\n1 5 0 1 9 2 3 3 0\n8 6 7 8 6 8 2 8 0\n9 2 9 9 5 2 1 0 7\n6 9 4 1 3 6 6 6 6\n1 4 6 2 0 0 6 6 2\n3 1 5 5 4 9 9 3 7\n6 7 7 8 8 7 6 4 0>>>"
