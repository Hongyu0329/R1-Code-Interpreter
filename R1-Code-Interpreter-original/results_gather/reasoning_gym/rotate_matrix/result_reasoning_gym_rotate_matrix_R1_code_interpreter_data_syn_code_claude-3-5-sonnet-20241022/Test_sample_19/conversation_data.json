    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 5x5 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it by 900 degrees clockwise\n   - 900 degrees = 2.5 complete rotations (360° × 2 + 180°)\n   - This means we need to rotate it 2 full times plus half a rotation\n\n2) For matrix rotation:\n   - Each 90° clockwise rotation can be achieved by:\n     * First transposing the matrix (swapping elements across the main diagonal)\n     * Then reversing each row\n\n3) Let's write code to perform this operation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Transpose\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]\n    # Reverse rows\n    for i in range(n):\n        matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]\n    return matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 8, 2, 3, 3],\n    [8, 4, 6, 8, 7],\n    [8, 8, 5, 9, 5],\n    [6, 4, 6, 0, 1],\n    [0, 8, 4, 0, 7]\n]\n\n# For 900 degrees = 2 complete rotations (720°) + half rotation (180°)\n# We need to rotate 2 times\n\n# First rotation (90°)\nmatrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n# Second rotation (180°)\nmatrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n# Third rotation (270°)\nmatrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n# Fourth rotation (360°)\nmatrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n# Fifth rotation (450°)\nmatrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n# Sixth rotation (540°)\nmatrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n# Seventh rotation (630°)\nmatrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n# Eighth rotation (720°)\nmatrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n# Ninth rotation (810°)\nmatrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n# Tenth rotation (900°)\nmatrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nNow that we have rotated the matrix 900 degrees (10 × 90°), let's format the answer:\n\n<<<7 1 5 7 3\n0 0 9 8 3\n4 6 5 6 2\n8 4 8 4 8\n0 6 8 8 8>>>",
    "I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Let me verify the output.\n\nThe code executed correctly, and the output shows the matrix rotated by 900 degrees clockwise. Let me explain why this is correct:\n\n1) 900 degrees = 2 complete rotations (720°) + half rotation (180°)\n2) After 10 rotations of 90° each, we get the correct result\n3) The output shows:\n   ```\n   7 0 4 8 0\n   1 0 6 4 6\n   5 9 5 8 8\n   7 8 6 4 8\n   3 3 2 8 8\n   ```\n\nThis is indeed the correct result after rotating the original matrix by 900 degrees clockwise.\n\n<<<7 0 4 8 0\n1 0 6 4 6\n5 9 5 8 8\n7 8 6 4 8\n3 3 2 8 8>>>"
