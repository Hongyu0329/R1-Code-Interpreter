    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what a 0-degree rotation means:\n   - A 0-degree rotation means the matrix remains unchanged\n   - We just need to return the matrix in the same format\n\n2) Let's write code to handle this:\n   - Read the matrix\n   - Format it properly for output\n   - The output should be in the same format as input (space-separated numbers on each row)\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 7, 0, 2, 4],\n    [0, 9, 0, 7, 6],\n    [7, 8, 4, 2, 9],\n    [5, 2, 8, 1, 1],\n    [5, 0, 5, 4, 1]\n]\n\n# For 0-degree rotation, we just format the output\nresult = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    result += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\n\n# Remove the last newline and print\nprint(result.strip())\n```\n\nSince we got the output, we can now format it as the final answer:\n\n<<<1 7 0 2 4\n0 9 0 7 6\n7 8 4 2 9\n5 2 8 1 1\n5 0 5 4 1>>>",
    "The code execution was successful and produced the expected output. Since this was a 0-degree rotation, the matrix remains unchanged from its original form. Let me confirm why this is correct:\n\n1) A 0-degree clockwise rotation means:\n   - The matrix stays exactly as it is\n   - No transformation is needed\n   - Each element maintains its original position\n\n2) Verifying the result:\n   - The first row is still \"1 7 0 2 4\"\n   - The second row is still \"0 9 0 7 6\"\n   - The third row is still \"7 8 4 2 9\"\n   - The fourth row is still \"5 2 8 1 1\"\n   - The fifth row is still \"5 0 5 4 1\"\n\nThe output matches exactly with the input matrix, which is what we want for a 0-degree rotation. Therefore, I can confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<1 7 0 2 4\n0 9 0 7 6\n7 8 4 2 9\n5 2 8 1 1\n5 0 5 4 1>>>"
