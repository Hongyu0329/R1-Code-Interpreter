    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what a 360-degree clockwise rotation means:\n   - A 360-degree rotation means rotating the matrix 4 times by 90 degrees\n   - After a 360-degree rotation, the matrix should return to its original state\n\n2) Let's verify this with code:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix with dimensions reversed\n    rotated = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Fill the new matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j]\n    return rotated\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 8, 0],\n    [5, 7, 8],\n    [1, 7, 9]\n]\n\n# Rotate 4 times (360 degrees)\nresult = matrix\nfor _ in range(4):\n    result = rotate_90_clockwise(result)\n\n# Print in required format\nprint('\\n'.join(' '.join(str(x) for x in row) for row in result))\n```\n\n3) After executing this code, we can see that a 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original state.\n\n4) This makes sense mathematically because:\n   - Each 90-degree rotation is a transformation\n   - Four 90-degree rotations complete a full circle (360 degrees)\n   - The matrix should return to its original state\n\nTherefore, the answer is the same as the input matrix:\n\n<<<9 8 0\n5 7 8\n1 7 9>>>",
    "The code output confirms my reasoning. \n\nLet me explain why this is correct:\n\n1) A 360-degree rotation is equivalent to 4 rotations of 90 degrees each.\n\n2) Let's break down what happens in each 90-degree rotation:\n   - First 90° rotation: The matrix changes\n   - Second 90° rotation (180° total): The matrix changes again\n   - Third 90° rotation (270° total): The matrix changes again\n   - Fourth 90° rotation (360° total): The matrix returns to its original state\n\n3) This is because 360 degrees represents a complete rotation, bringing every element back to its starting position.\n\n4) The code confirmed this by:\n   - Taking the input matrix [9,8,0; 5,7,8; 1,7,9]\n   - Performing four 90-degree rotations\n   - Returning to the original matrix\n\nTherefore, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<9 8 0\n5 7 8\n1 7 9>>>"
