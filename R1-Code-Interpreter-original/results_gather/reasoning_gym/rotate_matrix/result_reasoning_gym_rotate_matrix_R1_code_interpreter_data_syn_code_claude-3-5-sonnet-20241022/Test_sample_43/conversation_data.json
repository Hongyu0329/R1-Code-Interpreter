    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 9x9 matrix\n   - We need to rotate it 450 degrees clockwise\n   - 450 degrees = 360 degrees + 90 degrees, which means we only need to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise\n\n2) For rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise:\n   - First transpose the matrix (swap elements across the main diagonal)\n   - Then reverse each row\n\n3) Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Create a function to rotate 90 degrees\n   - Apply the rotation once (as 450째 = 360째 + 90째, and 360째 brings us back to the original position)\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Transpose\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]\n    \n    # Reverse each row\n    for i in range(n):\n        matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]\n    return matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 6, 7, 0, 8, 7, 5, 1, 5],\n    [1, 4, 4, 7, 5, 9, 7, 4, 6],\n    [0, 6, 8, 9, 7, 3, 2, 3, 2],\n    [4, 7, 9, 2, 7, 0, 4, 9, 0],\n    [1, 0, 4, 5, 3, 0, 1, 6, 1],\n    [4, 5, 8, 1, 7, 4, 4, 9, 3],\n    [3, 6, 0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 4, 0],\n    [8, 2, 8, 8, 7, 0, 4, 8, 5],\n    [2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 7, 1, 6, 4]\n]\n\n# Rotate once (90 degrees)\nresult = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in result:\n    output += \" \".join(map(str, row)) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nNow that we have the rotated matrix, let's format it according to the requirements.\n\n<<<2 8 3 4 1 4 0 1 9\n5 2 6 5 0 7 6 4 6\n4 8 0 8 4 9 8 4 7\n6 8 0 1 5 2 9 7 0\n7 7 4 7 3 7 7 5 8\n7 0 5 4 0 0 3 9 7\n1 4 7 4 1 4 2 7 5\n6 8 4 9 6 9 3 4 1\n4 5 0 3 1 0 2 6 5>>>",
    "Let me verify if this is the correct answer for a 450-degree rotation.\n\nLet's think about this:\n1) 450 degrees = 360 degrees + 90 degrees\n2) A 360-degree rotation brings us back to the original position\n3) So effectively, we only needed a 90-degree clockwise rotation, which is what we did\n\nThe code executed correctly and produced the matrix rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Let's verify the transformation:\n- The first row of the original matrix (9 6 7 0 8 7 5 1 5) became the last column read from top to bottom\n- The last column of the rotated matrix (9 6 7 0 8 7 5 1 5) is indeed the first row of the original matrix read from left to right\n- Other elements follow the same pattern\n\nTherefore, I can confirm this is the correct answer.\n\n<<<2 8 3 4 1 4 0 1 9\n5 2 6 5 0 7 6 4 6\n4 8 0 8 4 9 8 4 7\n6 8 0 1 5 2 9 7 0\n7 7 4 7 3 7 7 5 8\n7 0 5 4 0 0 3 9 7\n1 4 7 4 1 4 2 7 5\n6 8 4 9 6 9 3 4 1\n4 5 0 3 1 0 2 6 5>>>"
