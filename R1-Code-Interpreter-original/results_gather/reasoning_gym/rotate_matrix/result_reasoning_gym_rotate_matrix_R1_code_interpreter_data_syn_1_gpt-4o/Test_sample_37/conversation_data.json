    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the following:\n\n1. A 450-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation because 450 degrees is 90 degrees more than a full 360-degree rotation (450 - 360 = 90).\n\n2. For a 2x2 matrix, a 90-degree clockwise rotation involves swapping the elements in a specific manner:\n   - The element at the first row, first column moves to the first row, second column.\n   - The element at the first row, second column moves to the second row, second column.\n   - The element at the second row, second column moves to the second row, first column.\n   - The element at the second row, first column moves to the first row, first column.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n1 2\n1 9\n```\n\nWe will apply the 90-degree clockwise rotation to this matrix. Let's write a Python script to perform this operation.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # For a 2x2 matrix, the rotation can be done by rearranging the elements\n    return [\n        [matrix[1][0], matrix[0][0]],\n        [matrix[1][1], matrix[0][1]]\n    ]\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 2],\n    [1, 9]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix after a 90-degree clockwise rotation is `[[1, 1], [9, 2]]`.\n\nThis result is consistent with the expected transformation for a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the given 2x2 matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[1, 1], [9, 2]]>>>"
