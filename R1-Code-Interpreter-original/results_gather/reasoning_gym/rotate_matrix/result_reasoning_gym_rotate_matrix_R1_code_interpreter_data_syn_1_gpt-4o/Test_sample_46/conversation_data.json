    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. \n\nThe steps to achieve this are:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Swap rows with columns.\n2. Reverse the order of the rows.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to rotate the given matrix.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n```\n1 4 4 6 0\n2 6 3 7 6\n8 0 3 2 5\n6 5 6 2 2\n5 5 0 3 1\n```\n\nWe will write a Python script to perform the rotation.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_270_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = [list(row) for row in zip(*matrix)]\n    # Reverse the order of the rows\n    rotated_matrix = transposed_matrix[::-1]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 4, 4, 6, 0],\n    [2, 6, 3, 7, 6],\n    [8, 0, 3, 2, 5],\n    [6, 5, 6, 2, 2],\n    [5, 5, 0, 3, 1]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_270_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nfor row in rotated_matrix:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will output the matrix rotated by 270 degrees clockwise. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is the result of rotating the original matrix by 270 degrees clockwise. \n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n[0, 6, 5, 2, 1]\n[6, 7, 2, 2, 3]\n[4, 3, 3, 6, 0]\n[4, 6, 0, 5, 5]\n[1, 2, 8, 6, 5]\n```\n\nThis matrix is the correct transformation of the original matrix after a 270-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n<<<\n[0, 6, 5, 2, 1]\n[6, 7, 2, 2, 3]\n[4, 3, 3, 6, 0]\n[4, 6, 0, 5, 5]\n[1, 2, 8, 6, 5]\n>>>"
