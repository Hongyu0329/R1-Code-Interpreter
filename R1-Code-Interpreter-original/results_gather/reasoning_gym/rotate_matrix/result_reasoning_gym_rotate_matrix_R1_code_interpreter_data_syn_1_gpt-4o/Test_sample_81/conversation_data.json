    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the following:\n\n1. A 450-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation because 450 degrees is 360 + 90 degrees. A full 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original position, so we only need to perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n2. For a 2x2 matrix, a 90-degree clockwise rotation involves swapping the elements in a specific manner:\n   - The element at the first row, first column (top-left) moves to the first row, second column (top-right).\n   - The element at the first row, second column (top-right) moves to the second row, second column (bottom-right).\n   - The element at the second row, second column (bottom-right) moves to the second row, first column (bottom-left).\n   - The element at the second row, first column (bottom-left) moves to the first row, first column (top-left).\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n4 0\n7 8\n```\n\nWe will apply the 90-degree clockwise rotation to get the new matrix.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 0],\n    [7, 8]\n]\n\n# Function to rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(mat):\n    n = len(mat)\n    # Create a new matrix to store the rotated result\n    rotated = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated[j][n - 1 - i] = mat[i][j]\n    return rotated\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix after a 90-degree clockwise rotation is `[[7, 4], [8, 0]]`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, which is the matrix rotated by 450 degrees clockwise, is:\n\n<<<[[7, 4], [8, 0]]>>>"
