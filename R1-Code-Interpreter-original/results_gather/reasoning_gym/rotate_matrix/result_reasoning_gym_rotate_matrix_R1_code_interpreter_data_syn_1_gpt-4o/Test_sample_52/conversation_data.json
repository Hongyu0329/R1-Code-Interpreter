    "To rotate a matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Transpose the matrix**: This means converting all rows to columns and vice versa.\n2. **Reverse each row**: After transposing, reverse the order of elements in each row.\n\nHowever, for a 180-degree rotation, we can directly reverse the order of elements in each row and then reverse the order of the rows themselves. This is because a 180-degree rotation is equivalent to flipping the matrix upside down and then reversing each row.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    # Reverse each row\n    for i in range(len(matrix)):\n        matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]\n    \n    # Reverse the order of rows\n    matrix = matrix[::-1]\n    \n    return matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 7, 0, 8, 5, 3],\n    [7, 7, 8, 5, 9, 2],\n    [8, 4, 8, 7, 6, 5],\n    [9, 3, 2, 7, 0, 8],\n    [0, 2, 0, 7, 8, 4],\n    [8, 1, 0, 3, 3, 6]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix by 180 degrees clockwise. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output matrix as requested:\n\nThe rotated matrix by 180 degrees clockwise is:\n\n```\n6 3 3 0 1 8\n4 8 7 0 2 0\n8 0 7 2 3 9\n5 6 7 8 4 8\n2 9 5 8 7 7\n3 5 8 0 7 0\n```\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\n6 3 3 0 1 8\n4 8 7 0 2 0\n8 0 7 2 3 9\n5 6 7 8 4 8\n2 9 5 8 7 7\n3 5 8 0 7 0\n>>>"
