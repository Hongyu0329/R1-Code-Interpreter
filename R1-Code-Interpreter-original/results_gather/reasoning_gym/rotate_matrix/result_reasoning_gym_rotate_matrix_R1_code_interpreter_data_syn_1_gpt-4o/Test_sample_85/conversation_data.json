    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of rotation on a matrix:\n\n1. A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves:\n   - Transposing the matrix (converting rows to columns).\n   - Reversing the order of columns.\n\n2. A 180-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to two 90-degree rotations.\n\n3. A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to three 90-degree rotations.\n\n4. A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n5. A 540-degree rotation is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation (since 540 = 360 + 180).\n\nGiven this, we need to perform a 180-degree rotation on the matrix. Let's write the code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    # Reverse the order of rows and then reverse each row\n    return [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 2, 3, 6, 2],\n    [8, 6, 1, 8, 9],\n    [5, 5, 7, 0, 2],\n    [5, 6, 1, 2, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 0, 2]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the matrix rotated by 540 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation. \n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<\n2 0 6 6 6\n6 2 1 6 5\n2 0 7 5 5\n9 8 1 6 8\n2 6 3 2 2\n>>>"
