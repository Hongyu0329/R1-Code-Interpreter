    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. \n\nThe steps to achieve this are:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Swap rows with columns.\n2. Reverse the order of columns.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to rotate the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_270_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = [list(row) for row in zip(*matrix)]\n    # Reverse the order of columns\n    rotated_matrix = [row[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 9, 2, 4, 3, 7],\n    [7, 5, 0, 1, 2, 2],\n    [6, 0, 3, 0, 6, 2],\n    [2, 4, 9, 2, 8, 9],\n    [8, 9, 0, 9, 9, 1],\n    [4, 2, 0, 9, 3, 4]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 270 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_270_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we have obtained the rotated matrix. The matrix has been rotated 270 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<\n4 8 2 6 7 4\n2 9 4 0 5 9\n0 0 9 3 0 2\n9 9 2 0 1 4\n3 9 8 6 2 3\n4 1 9 2 2 7\n>>>"
