    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of rotation on the matrix. A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation. Therefore, a 720-degree rotation, which is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, will also bring the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n3 2 4\n3 7 0\n0 1 5\n```\n\nWe can conclude that rotating it by 720 degrees will result in the same matrix. However, let's verify this by implementing a function to rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise and applying it twice to see if it returns to the original matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix to store the rotated result\n    rotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 2, 4],\n    [3, 7, 0],\n    [0, 1, 5]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise twice\nrotated_once = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\nrotated_twice = rotate_90_clockwise(rotated_once)\n\n# Print the result after two 90-degree rotations (180 degrees)\nprint(rotated_twice)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code output shows the result of rotating the matrix by 180 degrees, which is not what we need. Since a 720-degree rotation is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, the matrix should remain unchanged. Therefore, the final answer should be the original matrix itself.\n\n<<<\n3 2 4\n3 7 0\n0 1 5\n>>>"
