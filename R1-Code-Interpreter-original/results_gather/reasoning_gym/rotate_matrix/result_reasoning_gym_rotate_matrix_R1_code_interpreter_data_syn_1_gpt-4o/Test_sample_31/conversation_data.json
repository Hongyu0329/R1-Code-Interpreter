    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 0-degree rotation means the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's represent the input matrix in a structured format and then output it as the result since no rotation is needed.\n\nHere's the input matrix:\n\n```\n7 4 4 7 1 6 1 1 3\n4 1 4 9 0 3 2 5 3\n4 9 0 0 9 2 3 9 8\n6 6 5 7 3 1 0 0 5\n9 5 1 0 9 2 9 0 6\n7 0 5 0 5 0 5 6 1\n4 8 8 1 3 8 3 9 6\n7 2 0 5 3 6 5 8 2\n4 7 1 6 2 5 2 2 4\n```\n\nSince the matrix is not rotated, the output will be the same as the input. Let's format the output matrix accordingly.\n\n<<<\n7 4 4 7 1 6 1 1 3\n4 1 4 9 0 3 2 5 3\n4 9 0 0 9 2 3 9 8\n6 6 5 7 3 1 0 0 5\n9 5 1 0 9 2 9 0 6\n7 0 5 0 5 0 5 6 1\n4 8 8 1 3 8 3 9 6\n7 2 0 5 3 6 5 8 2\n4 7 1 6 2 5 2 2 4\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
