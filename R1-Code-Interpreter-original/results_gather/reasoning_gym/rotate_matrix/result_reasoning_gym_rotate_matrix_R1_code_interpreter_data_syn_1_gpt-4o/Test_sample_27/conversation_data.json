    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise. Rotating a matrix by 0 degrees means that the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's represent the matrix in a list of lists format and then print it as the output.\n\n```python\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 7, 0, 2, 4],\n    [0, 9, 0, 7, 6],\n    [7, 8, 4, 2, 9],\n    [5, 2, 8, 1, 1],\n    [5, 0, 5, 4, 1]\n]\n\n# Print the matrix as it is, since 0 degree rotation means no change\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the same as the input matrix, as expected for a 0-degree rotation. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<\n1 7 0 2 4\n0 9 0 7 6\n7 8 4 2 9\n5 2 8 1 1\n5 0 5 4 1\n>>>"
