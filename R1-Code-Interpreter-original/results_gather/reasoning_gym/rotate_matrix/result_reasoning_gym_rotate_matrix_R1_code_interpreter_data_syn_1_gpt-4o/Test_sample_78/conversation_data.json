    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the following:\n\n1. A 450-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation (since 450 - 360 = 90).\n2. Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n\n```\n9 3 6 7 4 8 1 8\n6 8 5 0 1 8 1 2\n7 0 8 6 9 3 4 4\n5 5 8 1 6 8 7 4\n2 3 4 6 7 3 2 7\n3 1 7 5 5 3 2 4\n2 3 4 2 0 9 4 2\n0 7 6 3 3 7 8 7\n```\n\nWe will write a Python script to perform the 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix to store the rotated result\n    rotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n    \n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 3, 6, 7, 4, 8, 1, 8],\n    [6, 8, 5, 0, 1, 8, 1, 2],\n    [7, 0, 8, 6, 9, 3, 4, 4],\n    [5, 5, 8, 1, 6, 8, 7, 4],\n    [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 3, 2, 7],\n    [3, 1, 7, 5, 5, 3, 2, 4],\n    [2, 3, 4, 2, 0, 9, 4, 2],\n    [0, 7, 6, 3, 3, 7, 8, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the matrix rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix was rotated correctly based on the logic provided in the code. \n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n\n```\n0 2 3 2 5 7 6 9\n7 3 1 3 5 0 8 3\n6 4 7 4 8 8 5 6\n3 2 5 6 1 6 0 7\n3 0 5 7 6 9 1 4\n7 9 3 3 8 3 8 8\n8 4 2 2 7 4 1 1\n7 2 4 7 4 4 2 8\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n0 2 3 2 5 7 6 9\n7 3 1 3 5 0 8 3\n6 4 7 4 8 8 5 6\n3 2 5 6 1 6 0 7\n3 0 5 7 6 9 1 4\n7 9 3 3 8 3 8 8\n8 4 2 2 7 4 1 1\n7 2 4 7 4 4 2 8\n>>>"
