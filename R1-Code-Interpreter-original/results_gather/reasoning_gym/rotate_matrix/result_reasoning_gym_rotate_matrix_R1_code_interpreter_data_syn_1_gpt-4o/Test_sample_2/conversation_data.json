    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given square matrix by 450 degrees clockwise. \n\nFirst, let's break down the problem:\n1. A 450-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation (since 450 = 360 + 90, and a full 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation).\n2. We need to perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation on the matrix.\n\nThe steps to rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise are:\n- Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n- Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\n    rotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 9, 0, 3, 0, 6, 5, 1, 6, 4],\n    [5, 1, 9, 8, 2, 1, 4, 5, 9, 0],\n    [2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 4, 8, 0, 6, 2],\n    [9, 4, 4, 6, 5, 3, 3, 7, 8, 2],\n    [9, 2, 9, 6, 8, 6, 3, 3, 1, 9],\n    [1, 7, 4, 6, 1, 9, 4, 3, 2, 6],\n    [5, 7, 1, 8, 7, 6, 7, 5, 2, 7],\n    [4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 1, 4, 8, 1],\n    [9, 8, 4, 6, 3, 6, 4, 8, 5, 9],\n    [7, 1, 1, 0, 5, 6, 5, 2, 2, 6]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we obtained the rotated matrix. The matrix was rotated 90 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a 450-degree clockwise rotation due to the periodicity of rotations (450 = 360 + 90).\n\nNow, let's format the output matrix as requested, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n<<<[[7, 9, 4, 5, 1, 9, 9, 2, 5, 5], [1, 8, 2, 7, 7, 2, 4, 8, 1, 9], [1, 4, 3, 1, 4, 9, 4, 1, 9, 0], [0, 6, 2, 8, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 3], [5, 3, 4, 7, 1, 8, 5, 5, 2, 0], [6, 6, 4, 6, 9, 6, 3, 4, 1, 6], [5, 4, 1, 7, 4, 3, 3, 8, 4, 5], [2, 8, 4, 5, 3, 3, 7, 0, 5, 1], [2, 5, 8, 2, 2, 1, 8, 6, 9, 6], [6, 9, 1, 7, 6, 9, 2, 2, 0, 4]]>>>"
