    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of multiple 90-degree rotations. \n\n1. A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves:\n   - Transposing the matrix (converting rows to columns).\n   - Reversing the order of columns.\n\n2. Rotating a matrix by 360 degrees (4 times 90 degrees) results in the original matrix.\n\n3. Therefore, rotating a matrix by 900 degrees is equivalent to rotating it by 900 % 360 = 180 degrees.\n\n4. A 180-degree rotation can be achieved by:\n   - Reversing the order of rows.\n   - Reversing the order of elements in each row.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to rotate the given matrix by 900 degrees clockwise.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    # Reverse the order of rows and then reverse each row\n    return [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 5, 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 1, 7, 7],\n    [8, 4, 7, 2, 5, 4, 8, 9, 0, 8],\n    [0, 2, 3, 7, 2, 9, 6, 3, 4, 4],\n    [6, 0, 8, 3, 2, 9, 0, 3, 5, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 6, 9, 7, 6, 2, 2, 9],\n    [2, 6, 7, 7, 6, 9, 1, 3, 2, 0],\n    [7, 7, 2, 7, 2, 3, 4, 0, 4, 8],\n    [4, 8, 4, 5, 2, 5, 1, 3, 9, 2],\n    [8, 5, 6, 3, 5, 1, 1, 9, 7, 3],\n    [2, 9, 4, 4, 8, 2, 0, 8, 9, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the matrix rotated by 900 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation. The matrix has been reversed in both row order and element order within each row.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<\n[[7, 9, 8, 0, 2, 8, 4, 4, 9, 2],\n [3, 7, 9, 1, 1, 5, 3, 6, 5, 8],\n [2, 9, 3, 1, 5, 2, 5, 4, 8, 4],\n [8, 4, 0, 4, 3, 2, 7, 2, 7, 7],\n [0, 2, 3, 1, 9, 6, 7, 7, 6, 2],\n [9, 2, 2, 6, 7, 9, 6, 1, 0, 0],\n [0, 5, 3, 0, 9, 2, 3, 8, 0, 6],\n [4, 4, 3, 6, 9, 2, 7, 3, 2, 0],\n [8, 0, 9, 8, 4, 5, 2, 7, 4, 8],\n [7, 7, 1, 5, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5, 1]]\n>>>"
