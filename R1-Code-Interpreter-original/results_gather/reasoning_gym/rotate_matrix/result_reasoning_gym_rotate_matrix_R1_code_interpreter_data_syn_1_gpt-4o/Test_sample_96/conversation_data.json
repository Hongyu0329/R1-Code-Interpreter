    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the following:\n\n1. A 450-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation (since 450 - 360 = 90).\n2. A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves:\n   - Transposing the matrix (converting rows to columns).\n   - Reversing the order of elements in each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n\n```\n6 8 5 2 7\n0 2 5 8 4\n9 8 4 1 1\n0 4 5 1 7\n2 6 8 5 7\n```\n\nWe will perform the following steps:\n\n- Transpose the matrix.\n- Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\n    rotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 8, 5, 2, 7],\n    [0, 2, 5, 8, 4],\n    [9, 8, 4, 1, 1],\n    [0, 4, 5, 1, 7],\n    [2, 6, 8, 5, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we obtained the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output matrix as required.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n\n```\n2 0 9 0 6\n6 4 8 2 8\n8 5 4 5 5\n5 1 1 8 2\n7 7 1 4 7\n```\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<\n2 0 9 0 6\n6 4 8 2 8\n8 5 4 5 5\n5 1 1 8 2\n7 7 1 4 7\n>>>"
