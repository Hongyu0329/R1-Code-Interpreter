    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the rotation process:\n\n1. A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n2. A 540-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation (since 540 = 360 + 180, and a full 360-degree rotation returns the matrix to its original orientation).\n\nFor a 180-degree rotation:\n- The first row becomes the last row in reverse order.\n- The second row becomes the second last row in reverse order, and so on.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to rotate the given matrix by 180 degrees.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    # Reverse the order of rows and then reverse each row\n    return [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 6, 4, 6],\n    [3, 1, 4, 3],\n    [2, 3, 5, 3],\n    [1, 3, 1, 8]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the matrix rotated by 180 degrees. This is the correct transformation for a 540-degree clockwise rotation, as explained earlier.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n8 1 3 1\n3 5 3 2\n3 4 1 3\n6 4 6 1\n```\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<[[8, 1, 3, 1], [3, 5, 3, 2], [3, 4, 1, 3], [6, 4, 6, 1]]>>>"
