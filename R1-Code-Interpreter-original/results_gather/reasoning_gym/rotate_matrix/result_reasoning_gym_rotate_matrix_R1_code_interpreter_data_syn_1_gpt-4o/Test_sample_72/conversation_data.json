    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 0-degree rotation means the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's break down the input:\n\n- The first line \"3 3\" indicates the dimensions of the matrix, which is 3x3.\n- The subsequent lines represent the matrix itself.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n6 5\n```\n\nSince the matrix is supposed to be 3x3, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the input format. However, based on the provided input, the matrix is actually 2x2. \n\nFor a 0-degree rotation, the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's proceed to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<\n6 5\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Given a square matrix, your job is to rotate it clockwise.\n\nYour output should be a matrix in the same format as the input, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the output matrix>>>.\n\nRotate the matrix below by 0 degrees clockwise:\n3 3\n6 5\n"
