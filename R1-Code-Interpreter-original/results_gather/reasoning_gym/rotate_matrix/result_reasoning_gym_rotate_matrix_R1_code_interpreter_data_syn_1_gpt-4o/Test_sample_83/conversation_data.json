    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. \n\nThe steps to achieve this are:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Swap rows with columns.\n2. Reverse the order of columns.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to rotate the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_270_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse the order of columns\n    rotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 1, 8, 1, 5, 8],\n    [4, 4, 5, 7, 0, 8],\n    [8, 2, 2, 0, 4, 2],\n    [7, 9, 3, 2, 2, 2],\n    [8, 3, 2, 6, 0, 3],\n    [8, 5, 9, 3, 4, 9]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 270 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_270_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the matrix rotated by 270 degrees clockwise. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is the result of rotating the original matrix by 270 degrees clockwise. \n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[[8, 8, 7, 8, 4, 3],\n [5, 3, 9, 2, 4, 1],\n [9, 2, 3, 2, 5, 8],\n [3, 6, 2, 0, 7, 1],\n [4, 0, 2, 4, 0, 5],\n [9, 3, 2, 2, 8, 8]]\n```\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<[[8, 8, 7, 8, 4, 3], [5, 3, 9, 2, 4, 1], [9, 2, 3, 2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 2, 0, 7, 1], [4, 0, 2, 4, 0, 5], [9, 3, 2, 2, 8, 8]]>>>"
