    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that each element undergoes. In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix moves to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the size of the matrix.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n\n```\n3 8 1 4\n5 8 5 1\n5 0 4 6\n1 7 8 9\n```\n\nWe can represent it as a 2D list in Python:\n\n```\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 8, 1, 4],\n    [5, 8, 5, 1],\n    [5, 0, 4, 6],\n    [1, 7, 8, 9]\n]\n```\n\nThe size of the matrix, n, is 4. We will create a new matrix of the same size and fill it according to the transformation rule mentioned above.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 8, 1, 4],\n    [5, 8, 5, 1],\n    [5, 0, 4, 6],\n    [1, 7, 8, 9]\n]\n\n# Size of the matrix\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix, which we will then format as required.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output matrix as required by the problem statement. The matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n\n```\n1 5 5 3\n7 0 8 8\n8 4 5 1\n9 6 1 4\n```\n\nNow, let's present it in the required format:\n\n<<<\n1 5 5 3\n7 0 8 8\n8 4 5 1\n9 6 1 4\n>>>"
