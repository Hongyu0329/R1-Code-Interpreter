    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of rotation on the matrix. A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation. Therefore, a 720-degree rotation, which is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, will also bring the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\nGiven this understanding, the matrix will remain unchanged after a 720-degree rotation. Let's verify this by considering the matrix and checking its dimensions to ensure it's a square matrix, then simply returning the original matrix as the result.\n\nHere's the matrix provided:\n\n```\n5 3 3 3 1 4\n7 8 9 3 2 8\n8 0 4 0 7 2\n3 8 6 2 5 5\n1 1 8 4 8 7\n3 3 3 1 1 3\n```\n\nThis is a 6x6 matrix, which is indeed square. Since a 720-degree rotation results in the same matrix, we can directly return the original matrix as the output.\n\nLet's proceed to generate the final answer.\n\n<<<\n5 3 3 3 1 4\n7 8 9 3 2 8\n8 0 4 0 7 2\n3 8 6 2 5 5\n1 1 8 4 8 7\n3 3 3 1 1 3\n>>>"
