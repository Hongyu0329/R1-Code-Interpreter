    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 360-degree rotation will bring the matrix back to its original orientation. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's verify this by considering the input matrix:\n\n```\n3 4 7 8\n8 2 9 8\n5 8 7 7\n4 1 4 6\n```\n\nSince a 360-degree rotation results in the same matrix, we can directly provide the output as the input matrix itself.\n\nHere is the matrix after a 360-degree clockwise rotation:\n\n```\n3 4 7 8\n8 2 9 8\n5 8 7 7\n4 1 4 6\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n3 4 7 8\n8 2 9 8\n5 8 7 7\n4 1 4 6\n>>>"
