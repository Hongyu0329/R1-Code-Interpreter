    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of such a rotation. A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation. Therefore, a 720-degree rotation, which is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, will also result in the matrix being in its original orientation.\n\nThus, the matrix will remain unchanged after a 720-degree rotation. Let's verify this by considering the matrix and ensuring that the output is the same as the input.\n\nHere's the matrix given:\n\n```\n5 2 8 8 4 8 3 6 2 2\n1 7 3 3 8 8 8 2 7 3\n0 1 6 1 2 7 2 2 0 8\n4 5 5 1 3 4 4 0 9 4\n2 5 6 2 3 6 9 4 0 5\n1 4 9 4 9 7 1 1 3 2\n5 7 8 5 6 1 0 5 6 6\n5 0 9 6 7 6 9 4 2 5\n3 7 9 3 9 2 3 2 2 4\n9 6 9 8 8 6 9 6 0 7\n```\n\nSince a 720-degree rotation results in the same matrix, the output will be identical to the input matrix.\n\nLet's format the output matrix correctly:\n\n<<<\n5 2 8 8 4 8 3 6 2 2\n1 7 3 3 8 8 8 2 7 3\n0 1 6 1 2 7 2 2 0 8\n4 5 5 1 3 4 4 0 9 4\n2 5 6 2 3 6 9 4 0 5\n1 4 9 4 9 7 1 1 3 2\n5 7 8 5 6 1 0 5 6 6\n5 0 9 6 7 6 9 4 2 5\n3 7 9 3 9 2 3 2 2 4\n9 6 9 8 8 6 9 6 0 7\n>>>"
