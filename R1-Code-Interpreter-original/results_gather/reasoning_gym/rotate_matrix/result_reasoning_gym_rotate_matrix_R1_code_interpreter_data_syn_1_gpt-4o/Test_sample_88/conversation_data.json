    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. \n\nThe steps to achieve this are:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Swap rows with columns.\n2. Reverse the order of columns in the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to rotate the given matrix:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_270_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = [list(row) for row in zip(*matrix)]\n    # Reverse the order of columns in the transposed matrix\n    rotated_matrix = [row[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 3, 9, 7, 1, 5, 3, 3, 4, 5],\n    [5, 2, 1, 5, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 3],\n    [3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0],\n    [7, 6, 6, 9, 6, 6, 8, 6, 1, 0],\n    [0, 6, 5, 4, 9, 3, 2, 6, 6, 9],\n    [5, 7, 4, 5, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 8],\n    [8, 5, 0, 5, 8, 3, 8, 3, 5, 5],\n    [8, 4, 2, 8, 9, 1, 0, 5, 3, 9],\n    [1, 3, 2, 6, 0, 9, 2, 7, 1, 7],\n    [0, 1, 9, 3, 2, 8, 5, 5, 3, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_270_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
