    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given square matrix by 450 degrees clockwise. \n\nFirst, let's understand the rotation:\n- A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n- A 450-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation (since 450 = 360 + 90, and a 360-degree rotation returns the matrix to its original orientation).\n\nGiven this, we only need to perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation on the matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Swap rows with columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix to achieve a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to perform the rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\n    rotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 1, 4, 4, 6, 0, 7, 5, 4, 6],\n    [9, 4, 8, 0, 6, 0, 6, 5, 7, 5],\n    [3, 0, 6, 7, 2, 4, 2, 1, 4, 7],\n    [4, 1, 5, 6, 5, 0, 8, 0, 4, 3],\n    [0, 7, 5, 3, 4, 2, 0, 2, 7, 9],\n    [3, 7, 0, 3, 8, 8, 1, 9, 9, 4],\n    [0, 2, 8, 2, 3, 3, 0, 6, 9, 9],\n    [9, 2, 3, 2, 3, 7, 2, 8, 6, 3],\n    [5, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9, 2, 9, 5, 6],\n    [2, 7, 2, 8, 5, 5, 4, 8, 0, 5]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nfor row in rotated_matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a 450-degree clockwise rotation. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix as expected.
