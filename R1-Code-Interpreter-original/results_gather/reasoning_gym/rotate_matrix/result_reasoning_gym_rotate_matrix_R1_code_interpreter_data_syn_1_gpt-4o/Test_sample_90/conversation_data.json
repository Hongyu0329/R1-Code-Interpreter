    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of rotation on the matrix:\n\n1. A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves:\n   - Transposing the matrix (converting rows to columns).\n   - Reversing the order of elements in each row.\n\n2. A 540-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 180-degree clockwise rotation (since 540 = 360 + 180, and a full 360-degree rotation returns the matrix to its original orientation).\n\n3. A 180-degree clockwise rotation can be achieved by:\n   - Reversing the order of elements in each row.\n   - Reversing the order of rows in the matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to rotate the given matrix by 540 degrees clockwise.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    # Reverse each row\n    matrix = [row[::-1] for row in matrix]\n    # Reverse the order of rows\n    matrix.reverse()\n    return matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 9, 4, 1, 5, 3, 7, 9, 2, 1],\n    [4, 7, 3, 8, 6, 6, 2, 5, 4, 7],\n    [1, 6, 1, 8, 7, 9, 1, 8, 9, 7],\n    [4, 5, 9, 0, 8, 5, 6, 6, 2, 5],\n    [6, 1, 7, 1, 9, 0, 0, 3, 7, 6],\n    [4, 5, 7, 9, 3, 0, 3, 9, 5, 7],\n    [1, 7, 5, 9, 1, 3, 0, 7, 1, 5],\n    [1, 4, 4, 9, 8, 3, 6, 9, 9, 3],\n    [3, 2, 2, 6, 5, 5, 7, 2, 6, 5],\n    [0, 6, 1, 8, 9, 6, 2, 0, 7, 2]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, which is effectively a 180-degree rotation. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
