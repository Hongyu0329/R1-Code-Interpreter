    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 180-degree rotation is equivalent to flipping the matrix upside down and then reversing each row. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n\n```\n9 0 5 6 0 7 4\n8 1 7 3 6 0 5\n0 0 6 4 5 0 7\n3 8 2 6 2 9 8\n3 4 9 8 2 3 8\n3 6 8 1 8 2 6\n2 5 7 2 4 8 1\n```\n\nThe steps to rotate it by 180 degrees are:\n1. Reverse the order of the rows.\n2. Reverse each row.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 0, 5, 6, 0, 7, 4],\n    [8, 1, 7, 3, 6, 0, 5],\n    [0, 0, 6, 4, 5, 0, 7],\n    [3, 8, 2, 6, 2, 9, 8],\n    [3, 4, 9, 8, 2, 3, 8],\n    [3, 6, 8, 1, 8, 2, 6],\n    [2, 5, 7, 2, 4, 8, 1]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will reverse the order of the rows and then reverse each row, effectively rotating the matrix by 180 degrees. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the rotated matrix. The matrix has been rotated by 180 degrees clockwise, as required. \n\nThe output matrix is:\n\n```\n1 8 4 2 7 5 2\n6 2 8 1 8 6 3\n8 3 2 8 9 4 3\n8 9 2 6 2 8 3\n7 0 5 4 6 0 0\n5 0 6 3 7 1 8\n4 7 0 6 5 0 9\n```\n\nThis is the final rotated matrix. \n\n<<<[[1, 8, 4, 2, 7, 5, 2], [6, 2, 8, 1, 8, 6, 3], [8, 3, 2, 8, 9, 4, 3], [8, 9, 2, 6, 2, 8, 3], [7, 0, 5, 4, 6, 0, 0], [5, 0, 6, 3, 7, 1, 8], [4, 7, 0, 6, 5, 0, 9]]>>>"
