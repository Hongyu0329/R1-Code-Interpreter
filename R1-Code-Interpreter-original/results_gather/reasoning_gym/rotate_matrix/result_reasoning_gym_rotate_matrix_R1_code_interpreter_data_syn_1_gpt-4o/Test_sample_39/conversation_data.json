    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that each element in the matrix undergoes. For a given element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, its new position in the rotated matrix will be (j, n-1-i), where n is the size of the matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: First, we need to parse the input matrix from the given string format into a 2D list (list of lists in Python).\n\n2. **Matrix Rotation**: Using the transformation rule mentioned above, we will create a new matrix that represents the original matrix rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n3. **Output Formatting**: Finally, we will format the rotated matrix back into the required string format for output.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the input matrix as a list of lists\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 9, 0, 4, 2, 3, 4],\n    [1, 3, 8, 0, 9, 3, 8],\n    [0, 8, 5, 7, 2, 5, 2],\n    [0, 5, 9, 0, 6, 9, 3],\n    [2, 5, 6, 7, 1, 0, 3],\n    [9, 2, 2, 3, 8, 5, 4],\n    [9, 0, 4, 5, 3, 6, 0]\n]\n\n# Get the size of the matrix\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Format the output\noutput = \"\\n\".join(\" \".join(map(str, row)) for row in rotated_matrix)\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix by 90 degrees clockwise and print the result in the specified format.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the rotated matrix as expected. The matrix has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the output is formatted correctly within triple angle brackets. \n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n9 9 2 0 0 1 8\n0 2 5 5 8 3 9\n4 2 6 9 5 8 0\n5 3 7 0 7 0 4\n3 8 1 6 2 9 2\n6 5 0 9 5 3 3\n0 4 3 3 2 8 4\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation of the input matrix. \n\n<<<9 9 2 0 0 1 8\n0 2 5 5 8 3 9\n4 2 6 9 5 8 0\n5 3 7 0 7 0 4\n3 8 1 6 2 9 2\n6 5 0 9 5 3 3\n0 4 3 3 2 8 4>>>"
