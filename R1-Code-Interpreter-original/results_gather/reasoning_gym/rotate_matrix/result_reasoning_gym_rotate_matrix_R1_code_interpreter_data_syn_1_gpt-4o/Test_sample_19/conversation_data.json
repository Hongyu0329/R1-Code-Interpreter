    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of multiple 90-degree rotations. A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\nRotating a matrix by 360 degrees (4 times 90 degrees) results in the original matrix. Therefore, rotating a matrix by 900 degrees is equivalent to rotating it by 900 % 360 = 180 degrees.\n\nA 180-degree rotation of a matrix involves reversing the order of the rows and then reversing the order of the elements in each row.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to rotate the given matrix by 180 degrees.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    # Reverse the order of rows and then reverse each row\n    return [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 8, 2, 3, 3],\n    [8, 4, 6, 8, 7],\n    [8, 8, 5, 9, 5],\n    [6, 4, 6, 0, 1],\n    [0, 8, 4, 0, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix by 180 degrees, which is equivalent to a 900-degree clockwise rotation. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is the result of rotating the original matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation. \n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n\n```\n7 0 4 8 0\n1 0 6 4 6\n5 9 5 8 8\n7 8 6 4 8\n3 3 2 8 8\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n7 0 4 8 0\n1 0 6 4 6\n5 9 5 8 8\n7 8 6 4 8\n3 3 2 8 8\n>>>"
