    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of rotation on the matrix:\n\n1. A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transposing the matrix and then reversing each row.\n2. A 540-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 180-degree clockwise rotation (since 540 = 360 + 180, and a 360-degree rotation results in the original matrix).\n\nFor a 180-degree clockwise rotation:\n- We can achieve this by reversing each row and then reversing the order of the rows.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to rotate the given matrix by 540 degrees clockwise.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    # Reverse each row\n    matrix = [row[::-1] for row in matrix]\n    # Reverse the order of rows\n    matrix.reverse()\n    return matrix\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 7, 3, 6, 6],\n    [9, 2, 3, 6, 8],\n    [3, 2, 7, 6, 6],\n    [4, 6, 3, 5, 7],\n    [0, 5, 3, 9, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix by 180 degrees, which is equivalent to a 540-degree clockwise rotation. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
