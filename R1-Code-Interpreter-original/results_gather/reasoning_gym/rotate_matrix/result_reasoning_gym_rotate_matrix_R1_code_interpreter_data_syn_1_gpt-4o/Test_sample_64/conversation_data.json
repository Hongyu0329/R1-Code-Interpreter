    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 810 degrees clockwise, we need to first understand the effect of rotating a matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. Each 90-degree clockwise rotation involves:\n\n1. Transposing the matrix (converting rows to columns).\n2. Reversing the order of elements in each row.\n\nGiven that 810 degrees is equivalent to 810 / 90 = 9 rotations of 90 degrees, we can simplify this by noting that every 4 rotations (360 degrees) return the matrix to its original orientation. Therefore, 9 rotations are equivalent to 1 rotation (since 9 % 4 = 1).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to rotate the given matrix by 90 degrees clockwise once.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row to get the 90-degree clockwise rotation\n    rotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 6, 3, 1, 5, 0, 0],\n    [2, 6, 5, 1, 4, 5, 5],\n    [4, 2, 8, 0, 9, 7, 8],\n    [7, 7, 5, 3, 5, 8, 8],\n    [5, 0, 2, 0, 1, 7, 8],\n    [3, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 8],\n    [4, 9, 4, 4, 3, 6, 6]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we obtained the rotated matrix. The matrix was rotated 90 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to rotating it 810 degrees clockwise due to the periodic nature of rotations (every 360 degrees returns the matrix to its original orientation).\n\nHere is the final rotated matrix:\n\n<<<\n[[4, 3, 5, 7, 4, 2, 5], \n [9, 5, 0, 7, 2, 6, 6], \n [4, 1, 2, 5, 8, 5, 3], \n [4, 2, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1], \n [3, 9, 1, 5, 9, 4, 5], \n [6, 1, 7, 8, 7, 5, 0], \n [6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0]]\n>>>"
