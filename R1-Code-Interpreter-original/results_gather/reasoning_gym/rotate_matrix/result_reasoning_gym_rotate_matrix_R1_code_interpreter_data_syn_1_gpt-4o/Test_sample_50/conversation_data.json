    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nFor a given element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, its new position in the rotated matrix will be (j, n-1-i), where n is the size of the matrix. This transformation effectively rotates the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Read the input matrix.\n2. Determine the size of the matrix (n x n).\n3. Create a new matrix of the same size to store the rotated elements.\n4. Apply the transformation to each element and place it in the new matrix.\n5. Print the rotated matrix in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 8, 4, 2],\n    [2, 4, 2, 0],\n    [6, 7, 9, 1],\n    [3, 4, 8, 2]\n]\n\n# Determine the size of the matrix\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix to store the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Apply the transformation to rotate the matrix\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix by 90 degrees clockwise and output the result. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output matrix as required by the problem statement. The matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[[3, 6, 2, 7], \n [4, 7, 4, 8], \n [8, 9, 2, 4], \n [2, 1, 0, 2]]\n```\n\nNow, let's format it properly for the final answer.\n\n<<<\n3 6 2 7\n4 7 4 8\n8 9 2 4\n2 1 0 2\n>>>"
