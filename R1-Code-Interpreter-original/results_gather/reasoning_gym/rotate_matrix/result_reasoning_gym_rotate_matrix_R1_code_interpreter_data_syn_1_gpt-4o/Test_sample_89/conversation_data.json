    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs. Rotating a matrix by 180 degrees is equivalent to flipping it upside down and then reversing each row.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n3 9 6\n2 9 8\n2 5 4\n```\n\nThe steps to rotate it by 180 degrees are:\n1. Reverse the order of the rows.\n2. Reverse the order of the elements in each row.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 9, 6],\n    [2, 9, 8],\n    [2, 5, 4]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the rotated matrix. The matrix has been rotated by 180 degrees clockwise, resulting in the following transformation:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n3 9 6\n2 9 8\n2 5 4\n```\n\nRotated matrix:\n```\n4 5 2\n8 9 2\n6 9 3\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation for a 180-degree clockwise rotation. \n\n<<<\n4 5 2\n8 9 2\n6 9 3\n>>>"
