    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise. Rotating a matrix by 0 degrees means that the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's represent the matrix in a structured format and then output it as is.\n\n```python\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 1, 9, 9, 3, 6, 7, 4, 5],\n    [7, 8, 5, 2, 8, 1, 0, 8, 7],\n    [1, 5, 0, 1, 9, 2, 3, 3, 0],\n    [8, 6, 7, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 0],\n    [9, 2, 9, 9, 5, 2, 1, 0, 7],\n    [6, 9, 4, 1, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [1, 4, 6, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 2],\n    [3, 1, 5, 5, 4, 9, 9, 3, 7],\n    [6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 6, 4, 0]\n]\n\n# Print the matrix as is\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output.",
