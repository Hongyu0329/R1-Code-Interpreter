    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we need to first understand the implications of the rotation angle. A 450-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation because 450 degrees is 90 degrees more than a full 360-degree rotation (450 - 360 = 90).\n\nThe steps to rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise are as follows:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Swap rows with columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to rotate the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = [list(row) for row in zip(*matrix)]\n    # Reverse each row\n    rotated_matrix = [row[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 6, 7, 0, 8, 7, 5, 1, 5],\n    [1, 4, 4, 7, 5, 9, 7, 4, 6],\n    [0, 6, 8, 9, 7, 3, 2, 3, 2],\n    [4, 7, 9, 2, 7, 0, 4, 9, 0],\n    [1, 0, 4, 5, 3, 0, 1, 6, 1],\n    [4, 5, 8, 1, 7, 4, 4, 9, 3],\n    [3, 6, 0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 4, 0],\n    [8, 2, 8, 8, 7, 0, 4, 8, 5],\n    [2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 7, 1, 6, 4]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we have obtained the rotated matrix. The matrix was rotated 90 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a 450-degree clockwise rotation due to the periodic nature of rotations.\n\nHere is the final rotated matrix:\n\n<<<\n[[2, 8, 3, 4, 1, 4, 0, 1, 9],\n [5, 2, 6, 5, 0, 7, 6, 4, 6],\n [4, 8, 0, 8, 4, 9, 8, 4, 7],\n [6, 8, 0, 1, 5, 2, 9, 7, 0],\n [7, 7, 4, 7, 3, 7, 7, 5, 8],\n [7, 0, 5, 4, 0, 0, 3, 9, 7],\n [1, 4, 7, 4, 1, 4, 2, 7, 5],\n [6, 8, 4, 9, 6, 9, 3, 4, 1],\n [4, 5, 0, 3, 1, 0, 2, 6, 5]]\n>>>"
