    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of rotation on the matrix:\n\n1. A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n2. A 360-degree rotation results in the matrix returning to its original orientation.\n3. Therefore, a 720-degree rotation, which is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, will also result in the matrix returning to its original orientation.\n\nGiven this understanding, we can conclude that rotating the matrix by 720 degrees clockwise will result in the same matrix as the original. Thus, we don't need to perform any actual rotation operations.\n\nLet's represent the matrix in a structured format and return it as the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 4, 8, 3, 7, 7, 8, 7],\n    [8, 5, 6, 3, 1, 8, 7, 4],\n    [3, 7, 9, 0, 4, 1, 2, 8],\n    [2, 1, 2, 5, 5, 9, 5, 9],\n    [3, 3, 6, 7, 7, 0, 2, 0],\n    [5, 4, 5, 4, 0, 2, 6, 1],\n    [4, 8, 0, 2, 2, 9, 8, 6],\n    [6, 2, 8, 6, 5, 3, 3, 4]\n]\n\n# Print the matrix as the output\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the original matrix, as expected after a 720-degree rotation.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matches the original matrix, as expected after a 720-degree rotation. Since a 720-degree rotation is equivalent to two full rotations (360 degrees each), the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n4 4 8 3 7 7 8 7\n8 5 6 3 1 8 7 4\n3 7 9 0 4 1 2 8\n2 1 2 5 5 9 5 9\n3 3 6 7 7 0 2 0\n5 4 5 4 0 2 6 1\n4 8 0 2 2 9 8 6\n6 2 8 6 5 3 3 4\n>>>"
