    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 810 degrees clockwise, we need to first understand the relationship between degrees of rotation and the number of 90-degree rotations. \n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Understanding Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Calculating Effective Rotation:**\n   - 810 degrees is equivalent to \\(810 \\mod 360 = 90\\) degrees.\n   - Therefore, rotating the matrix by 810 degrees clockwise is effectively the same as rotating it by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n3. **Matrix Rotation:**\n   - We will perform a single 90-degree clockwise rotation on the given matrix.\n\n### Matrix Rotation Implementation:\n\nTo rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can use the following steps:\n- Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n- Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\n    rotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 1, 5, 4],\n    [0, 4, 5, 0],\n    [9, 7, 8, 9],\n    [5, 9, 8, 2]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, which is the effective rotation needed for 810 degrees. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix after rotating the given matrix by 810 degrees (effectively 90 degrees) clockwise is:\n\n```\n[[5, 9, 0, 4], \n [9, 7, 4, 1], \n [8, 8, 5, 5], \n [2, 9, 0, 4]]\n```\n\nThis is the final rotated matrix. \n\n<<<[[5, 9, 0, 4], [9, 7, 4, 1], [8, 8, 5, 5], [2, 9, 0, 4]]>>>"
