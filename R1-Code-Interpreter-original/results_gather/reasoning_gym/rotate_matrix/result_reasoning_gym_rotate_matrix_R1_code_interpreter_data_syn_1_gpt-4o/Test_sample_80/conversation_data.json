    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 180-degree rotation is equivalent to flipping the matrix upside down and then reversing each row. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Reverse the order of the rows in the matrix.\n2. Reverse the order of the elements in each row.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n9 9 4 7 6 2 5 3 8\n7 0 6 9 3 7 7 4 5\n3 3 9 2 7 8 5 6 9\n6 4 0 1 1 3 4 6 1\n9 0 1 3 4 8 7 0 4\n6 8 2 4 8 6 2 8 9\n1 3 9 4 3 9 9 2 6\n6 3 9 2 1 5 9 1 9\n1 8 5 1 7 1 7 8 8\n```\n\nWe will implement the steps in Python to achieve the desired rotation.\n\n```python\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 9, 4, 7, 6, 2, 5, 3, 8],\n    [7, 0, 6, 9, 3, 7, 7, 4, 5],\n    [3, 3, 9, 2, 7, 8, 5, 6, 9],\n    [6, 4, 0, 1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 1],\n    [9, 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 7, 0, 4],\n    [6, 8, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 8, 9],\n    [1, 3, 9, 4, 3, 9, 9, 2, 6],\n    [6, 3, 9, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 9],\n    [1, 8, 5, 1, 7, 1, 7, 8, 8]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will reverse the order of the rows and then reverse each row, effectively rotating the matrix by 180 degrees. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output matrix as requested, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n8 8 7 1 7 1 5 8 1\n9 1 9 5 1 2 9 3 6\n6 2 9 9 3 4 9 3 1\n9 8 2 6 8 4 2 8 6\n4 0 7 8 4 3 1 0 9\n1 6 4 3 1 1 0 4 6\n9 6 5 8 7 2 9 3 3\n5 4 7 7 3 9 6 0 7\n8 3 5 2 6 7 4 9 9\n```\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\n8 8 7 1 7 1 5 8 1\n9 1 9 5 1 2 9 3 6\n6 2 9 9 3 4 9 3 1\n9 8 2 6 8 4 2 8 6\n4 0 7 8 4 3 1 0 9\n1 6 4 3 1 1 0 4 6\n9 6 5 8 7 2 9 3 3\n5 4 7 7 3 9 6 0 7\n8 3 5 2 6 7 4 9 9\n>>>"
