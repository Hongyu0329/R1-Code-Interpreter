    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of rotation on the matrix:\n\n1. A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n2. A 540-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 180-degree clockwise rotation because 540 degrees is 1.5 full rotations (540 % 360 = 180).\n\n3. A 180-degree clockwise rotation can be achieved by reversing the order of the rows and then reversing the order of the elements in each row.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to rotate the given matrix by 540 degrees clockwise.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    # Reverse the order of rows and then reverse each row\n    return [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 3, 2, 6, 9, 4, 8, 4],\n    [6, 9, 0, 3, 0, 7, 2, 2],\n    [5, 2, 4, 9, 9, 0, 1, 9],\n    [0, 6, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7, 2],\n    [8, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 4],\n    [5, 3, 9, 0, 9, 9, 2, 6],\n    [0, 4, 6, 2, 1, 1, 6, 0],\n    [7, 6, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we have obtained the rotated matrix. The matrix was rotated by 540 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation. The output matrix is:\n\n```\n[[7, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 6, 7],\n [0, 6, 1, 1, 2, 6, 4, 0],\n [6, 2, 9, 9, 0, 9, 3, 5],\n [4, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 8],\n [2, 7, 5, 1, 3, 4, 6, 0],\n [9, 1, 0, 9, 9, 4, 2, 5],\n [2, 2, 7, 0, 3, 0, 9, 6],\n [4, 8, 4, 9, 6, 2, 3, 5]]\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[7, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 6, 7], [0, 6, 1, 1, 2, 6, 4, 0], [6, 2, 9, 9, 0, 9, 3, 5], [4, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 8], [2, 7, 5, 1, 3, 4, 6, 0], [9, 1, 0, 9, 9, 4, 2, 5], [2, 2, 7, 0, 3, 0, 9, 6], [4, 8, 4, 9, 6, 2, 3, 5]]>>>"
