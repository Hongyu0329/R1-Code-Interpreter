    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. \n\nFor a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation, the transformation can be described as follows:\n- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n- The second row of the original matrix becomes the second-to-last column of the rotated matrix, and so on.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n0 0 4 1 0 8 2\n3 4 6 5 8 4 8\n1 9 6 7 6 5 6\n3 6 2 1 8 7 3\n8 4 2 7 9 5 8\n2 0 9 6 7 2 3\n6 5 3 7 4 9 0\n```\n\nWe will implement a function to perform this transformation and output the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_270_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row to get the 270-degree clockwise rotation\n    rotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 8, 2],\n    [3, 4, 6, 5, 8, 4, 8],\n    [1, 9, 6, 7, 6, 5, 6],\n    [3, 6, 2, 1, 8, 7, 3],\n    [8, 4, 2, 7, 9, 5, 8],\n    [2, 0, 9, 6, 7, 2, 3],\n    [6, 5, 3, 7, 4, 9, 0]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_270_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nfor row in rotated_matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix represents the original matrix rotated by 270 degrees clockwise. The transformation was achieved by transposing the matrix and then reversing each row, which effectively rotates the matrix as required.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n6 2 8 3 1 3 0\n5 0 4 6 9 4 0\n3 9 2 2 6 6 4\n7 6 7 1 7 5 1\n4 7 9 8 6 8 0\n9 2 5 7 5 4 8\n0 3 8 3 6 8 2\n```\n\nThis is the final rotated matrix. \n\n<<<\n6 2 8 3 1 3 0\n5 0 4 6 9 4 0\n3 9 2 2 6 6 4\n7 6 7 1 7 5 1\n4 7 9 8 6 8 0\n9 2 5 7 5 4 8\n0 3 8 3 6 8 2\n>>>"
