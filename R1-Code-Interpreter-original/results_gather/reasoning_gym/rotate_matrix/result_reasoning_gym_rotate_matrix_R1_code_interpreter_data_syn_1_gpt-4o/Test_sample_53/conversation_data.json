    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 810 degrees clockwise, we need to first understand the effect of rotation on the matrix. A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Determine the Effective Rotation**: \n   - Since 360 degrees is a full rotation, rotating by 810 degrees is equivalent to rotating by \\(810 \\mod 360 = 90\\) degrees. This means we only need to perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n2. **Perform the 90-degree Clockwise Rotation**:\n   - For a given matrix, a 90-degree clockwise rotation can be achieved by transposing the matrix and then reversing each row.\n\n3. **Implement the Rotation**:\n   - We will write a Python script to perform the 90-degree clockwise rotation on the given matrix.\n\nLet's implement the code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row to get the 90-degree rotated matrix\n    rotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 1, 5, 3, 3],\n    [7, 5, 9, 3, 6],\n    [8, 8, 3, 9, 9],\n    [9, 7, 9, 6, 1],\n    [0, 8, 1, 6, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the matrix after rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, which is the effective rotation needed for 810 degrees. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the matrix rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Since 810 degrees is effectively a 90-degree rotation, this output is the final result.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[[0, 9, 8, 7, 9],\n [8, 7, 8, 5, 1],\n [1, 9, 3, 9, 5],\n [6, 6, 9, 3, 3],\n [7, 1, 9, 6, 3]]\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[0, 9, 8, 7, 9], [8, 7, 8, 5, 1], [1, 9, 3, 9, 5], [6, 6, 9, 3, 3], [7, 1, 9, 6, 3]]>>>"
