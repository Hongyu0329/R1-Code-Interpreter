    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we need to first understand the rotation process. A 450-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation (since 450 - 360 = 90). \n\nThe steps to rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise are as follows:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Swap rows with columns.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's apply this logic to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n9 2 5\n8 9 5\n4 9 2\n```\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform the 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\n    rotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 2, 5],\n    [8, 9, 5],\n    [4, 9, 2]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the matrix after a 90-degree clockwise rotation. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix after a 90-degree clockwise rotation is:\n\n```\n4 8 9\n9 9 2\n2 5 5\n```\n\nSince a 450-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation, this is the final rotated matrix.\n\n<<<\n4 8 9\n9 9 2\n2 5 5\n>>>"
