    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given square matrix by 450 degrees clockwise. \n\nFirst, let's understand the rotation:\n- A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the element at position (i, j) to position (j, n-1-i), where n is the size of the matrix.\n- A 450-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation (since 450 % 360 = 90).\n\nGiven this, we only need to perform a single 90-degree clockwise rotation on the matrix.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    rotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 0, 6, 3, 5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 2],\n    [4, 9, 3, 2, 7, 9, 7, 2, 1, 4],\n    [1, 4, 1, 6, 0, 3, 9, 2, 1, 3],\n    [7, 0, 4, 9, 4, 5, 2, 5, 7, 8],\n    [9, 1, 8, 2, 3, 2, 8, 7, 2, 9],\n    [5, 4, 9, 5, 9, 7, 5, 5, 2, 8],\n    [2, 6, 3, 0, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 8],\n    [8, 1, 9, 6, 2, 3, 0, 0, 5, 6],\n    [2, 0, 2, 8, 2, 9, 4, 6, 4, 6],\n    [6, 6, 4, 9, 3, 8, 3, 7, 0, 9]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a 450-degree clockwise rotation. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
