    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 0-degree rotation means the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a 3x3 matrix:\n   ```\n   6 0 9\n   9 3 8\n   2 9 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Rotation by 0 Degrees**: Since rotating by 0 degrees means no change, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\n3. **Output the Matrix**: We will format the output matrix in the same way as the input, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's proceed to the final answer.\n\n<<<\n6 0 9\n9 3 8\n2 9 8\n>>>"
