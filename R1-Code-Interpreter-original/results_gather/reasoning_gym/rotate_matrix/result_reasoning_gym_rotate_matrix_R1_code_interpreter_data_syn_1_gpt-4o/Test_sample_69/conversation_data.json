    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of multiple 90-degree rotations. \n\n1. **Understanding Rotations**: \n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - Rotating a matrix 360 degrees (4 times 90 degrees) results in the original matrix.\n   - Therefore, rotating a matrix 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it 900 % 360 = 180 degrees clockwise.\n\n2. **180-degree Rotation**:\n   - A 180-degree rotation of a matrix can be achieved by reversing the order of the rows and then reversing the order of the elements in each row.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to rotate the given matrix by 180 degrees.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    # Reverse the order of rows and then reverse each row\n    return [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 5, 7, 0, 8],\n    [3, 9, 3, 4, 7],\n    [3, 5, 7, 1, 4],\n    [3, 2, 1, 7, 8],\n    [5, 3, 7, 5, 3]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the matrix rotated by 180 degrees. Now, let's format the output matrix as required.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n3 5 7 3 5\n8 7 1 2 3\n4 1 7 5 3\n7 4 3 9 3\n8 0 7 5 8\n```\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\n3 5 7 3 5\n8 7 1 2 3\n4 1 7 5 3\n7 4 3 9 3\n8 0 7 5 8\n>>>"
