    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 0-degree rotation means the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's first represent the input matrix in a structured format:\n\n```\n6 1 1 5 7 5 0 9\n2 9 5 5 4 5 9 4\n7 9 6 3 9 1 8 7\n2 6 8 3 0 6 5 8\n9 8 0 2 7 1 4 1\n2 7 1 1 6 4 2 5\n7 6 7 4 4 2 6 4\n2 5 1 3 8 9 3 4\n```\n\nThis matrix is an 8x8 matrix. Since the rotation is 0 degrees, the output will be the same as the input. Therefore, we can directly provide the output matrix.\n\n<<<\n6 1 1 5 7 5 0 9\n2 9 5 5 4 5 9 4\n7 9 6 3 9 1 8 7\n2 6 8 3 0 6 5 8\n9 8 0 2 7 1 4 1\n2 7 1 1 6 4 2 5\n7 6 7 4 4 2 6 4\n2 5 1 3 8 9 3 4\n>>>"
