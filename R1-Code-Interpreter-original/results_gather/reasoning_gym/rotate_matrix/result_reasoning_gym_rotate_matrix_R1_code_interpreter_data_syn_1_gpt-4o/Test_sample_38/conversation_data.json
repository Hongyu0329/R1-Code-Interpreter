    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of multiple 90-degree rotations. A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\nHowever, rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 900 % 360 = 180 degrees clockwise, because a full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\nLet's break down the steps to rotate the matrix by 180 degrees clockwise:\n\n1. Reverse each row of the matrix.\n2. Reverse the order of the rows.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n4 7 7\n2 5 1\n2 9 3\n```\n\nWe will apply the above steps to achieve the 180-degree rotation.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    # Reverse each row\n    matrix = [row[::-1] for row in matrix]\n    # Reverse the order of rows\n    matrix.reverse()\n    return matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 7, 7],\n    [2, 5, 1],\n    [2, 9, 3]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is the result of rotating the original matrix by 180 degrees clockwise. \n\nThe original matrix:\n```\n4 7 7\n2 5 1\n2 9 3\n```\n\nAfter rotating it by 180 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\n3 9 2\n1 5 2\n7 7 4\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[3, 9, 2], [1, 5, 2], [7, 7, 4]]>>>"
