    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given square matrix by 540 degrees clockwise. \n\nFirst, let's understand the rotation:\n- A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n- A 540-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation because 540 % 360 = 180.\n\nFor a 180-degree rotation:\n- The first row becomes the last row in reverse order.\n- The second row becomes the second last row in reverse order, and so on.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform a 180-degree rotation on the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    # Reverse the order of rows and then reverse each row\n    return [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 5, 9, 2],\n    [3, 3, 7, 2],\n    [1, 5, 0, 3],\n    [1, 7, 4, 2]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we have obtained the rotated matrix. The matrix has been rotated by 180 degrees, which is equivalent to a 540-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<\n2 4 7 1\n3 0 5 1\n2 7 3 3\n2 9 5 7\n>>>"
