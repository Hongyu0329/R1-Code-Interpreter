    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs. Rotating a matrix by 180 degrees is equivalent to flipping it upside down and then reversing each row.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n\n```\n8 9 8 8 9 4 1 9\n8 7 2 1 9 5 0 0\n0 2 9 2 9 9 2 6\n7 2 1 2 7 1 6 5\n6 0 4 2 2 3 9 2\n3 9 2 7 0 6 4 4\n4 1 9 8 0 5 6 2\n9 9 4 5 1 1 7 7\n```\n\nThe steps to rotate it by 180 degrees are:\n1. Reverse the order of the rows.\n2. Reverse the order of elements in each row.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 9, 8, 8, 9, 4, 1, 9],\n    [8, 7, 2, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 9, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6],\n    [7, 2, 1, 2, 7, 1, 6, 5],\n    [6, 0, 4, 2, 2, 3, 9, 2],\n    [3, 9, 2, 7, 0, 6, 4, 4],\n    [4, 1, 9, 8, 0, 5, 6, 2],\n    [9, 9, 4, 5, 1, 1, 7, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will reverse the order of the rows and then reverse each row, effectively rotating the matrix by 180 degrees. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output matrix as requested, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n\n```\n[[7, 7, 1, 1, 5, 4, 9, 9],\n [2, 6, 5, 0, 8, 9, 1, 4],\n [4, 4, 6, 0, 7, 2, 9, 3],\n [2, 9, 3, 2, 2, 4, 0, 6],\n [5, 6, 1, 7, 2, 1, 2, 7],\n [6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 0],\n [0, 0, 5, 9, 1, 2, 7, 8],\n [9, 1, 4, 9, 8, 8, 9, 8]]\n```\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\n7 7 1 1 5 4 9 9\n2 6 5 0 8 9 1 4\n4 4 6 0 7 2 9 3\n2 9 3 2 2 4 0 6\n5 6 1 7 2 1 2 7\n6 2 9 9 2 9 2 0\n0 0 5 9 1 2 7 8\n9 1 4 9 8 8 9 8\n>>>"
