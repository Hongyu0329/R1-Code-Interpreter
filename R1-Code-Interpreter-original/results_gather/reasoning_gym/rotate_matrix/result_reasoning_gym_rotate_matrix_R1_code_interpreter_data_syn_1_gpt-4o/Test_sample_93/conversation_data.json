    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 360-degree rotation will result in the matrix being the same as the original. Therefore, the output matrix should be identical to the input matrix.\n\nLet's represent the matrix in a 2D list format and then print it as the output.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 9, 4, 9, 2],\n    [5, 2, 9, 4, 9],\n    [0, 1, 2, 7, 8],\n    [6, 1, 4, 4, 2],\n    [7, 2, 7, 2, 0]\n]\n\n# Since a 360-degree rotation results in the same matrix, we can directly print the original matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the original matrix, as expected for a 360-degree rotation. Therefore, the rotated matrix is the same as the input matrix.\n\n<<<\n3 9 4 9 2\n5 2 9 4 9\n0 1 2 7 8\n6 1 4 4 2\n7 2 7 2 0\n>>>"
