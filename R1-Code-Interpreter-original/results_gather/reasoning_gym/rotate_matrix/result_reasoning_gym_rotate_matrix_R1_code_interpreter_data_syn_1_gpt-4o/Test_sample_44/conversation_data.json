    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given square matrix by 630 degrees clockwise. \n\nFirst, let's understand the rotation:\n- A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n- Rotating a matrix by 360 degrees results in the same matrix, as it completes a full circle.\n- Therefore, rotating by 630 degrees is equivalent to rotating by \\(630 \\mod 360 = 270\\) degrees clockwise.\n\nA 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. This means:\n- The first column becomes the first row, the second column becomes the second row, and so on.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to perform the rotation.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_270_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix and then reverse each row to achieve 270-degree clockwise rotation\n    return [list(row) for row in zip(*matrix[::-1])]\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 6, 3, 4, 0, 6, 3],\n    [4, 4, 7, 7, 3, 1, 5],\n    [4, 3, 5, 8, 0, 0, 6],\n    [9, 9, 6, 3, 5, 8, 7],\n    [0, 1, 6, 2, 1, 3, 1],\n    [4, 9, 1, 8, 1, 0, 0],\n    [3, 7, 7, 2, 9, 9, 6]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_270_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to the required 630 degrees. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix. The matrix was rotated by 270 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to the required 630 degrees clockwise rotation. \n\nHere is the final rotated matrix:\n\n<<<\n[[3, 4, 0, 9, 4, 4, 7], \n [7, 9, 1, 9, 3, 4, 6], \n [7, 1, 6, 6, 5, 7, 3], \n [2, 8, 2, 3, 8, 7, 4], \n [9, 1, 1, 5, 0, 3, 0], \n [9, 0, 3, 8, 0, 1, 6], \n [6, 0, 1, 7, 6, 5, 3]]\n>>>"
