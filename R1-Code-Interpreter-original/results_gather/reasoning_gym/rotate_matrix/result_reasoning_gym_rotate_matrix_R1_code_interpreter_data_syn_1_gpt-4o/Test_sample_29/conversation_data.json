    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the following:\n\n1. A 450-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation (since 450 = 360 + 90, and a full 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation).\n\n2. To rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n   - Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n   - Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to rotate the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row of the transposed matrix\n    rotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 8, 3, 5, 4, 5, 0, 7, 5],\n    [5, 1, 6, 7, 5, 2, 5, 0, 8],\n    [1, 2, 5, 0, 6, 2, 2, 6, 4],\n    [4, 5, 7, 5, 9, 5, 2, 9, 4],\n    [6, 6, 3, 2, 2, 0, 8, 5, 7],\n    [0, 8, 6, 1, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1],\n    [7, 5, 1, 6, 3, 1, 9, 5, 9],\n    [5, 0, 7, 4, 6, 6, 3, 2, 1],\n    [6, 7, 1, 4, 7, 6, 0, 5, 3]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a 450-degree clockwise rotation. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output matrix as requested, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n<<<\n[[6, 5, 7, 0, 6, 4, 1, 5, 2],\n [7, 0, 5, 8, 6, 5, 2, 1, 8],\n [1, 7, 1, 6, 3, 7, 5, 6, 3],\n [4, 4, 6, 1, 2, 5, 0, 7, 5],\n [7, 6, 3, 4, 2, 9, 6, 5, 4],\n [6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 5, 2, 2, 5],\n [0, 3, 9, 6, 8, 2, 2, 5, 0],\n [5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 9, 6, 0, 7],\n [3, 1, 9, 1, 7, 4, 4, 8, 5]]\n>>>"
