    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given matrix by 540 degrees clockwise. \n\nFirst, let's understand the rotation:\n- A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n- A 180-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to two 90-degree rotations.\n- A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to three 90-degree rotations.\n- A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\nGiven that 540 degrees is equivalent to 1.5 full rotations (540 / 360 = 1.5), we can simplify this to a 180-degree rotation (since 540 - 360 = 180).\n\nLet's perform a 180-degree rotation on the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n0 4 3\n3 2 1\n8 1 9\n```\n\nTo rotate this matrix 180 degrees, we can follow these steps:\n1. Reverse each row.\n2. Reverse the order of the rows.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 4, 3],\n    [3, 2, 1],\n    [8, 1, 9]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix. The matrix has been rotated 180 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a 540-degree clockwise rotation due to the periodicity of rotations.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n```\n9 1 8\n1 2 3\n3 4 0\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<\n9 1 8\n1 2 3\n3 4 0\n>>>"
