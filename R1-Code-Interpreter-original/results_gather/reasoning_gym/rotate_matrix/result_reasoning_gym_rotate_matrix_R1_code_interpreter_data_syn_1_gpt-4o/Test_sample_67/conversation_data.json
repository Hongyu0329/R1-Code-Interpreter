    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that each element in the matrix undergoes. For a given element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, its new position in the rotated matrix will be (j, n-1-i), where n is the size of the matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Transpose the matrix**: This involves swapping elements at positions (i, j) with (j, i). This step converts rows into columns.\n\n2. **Reverse each row**: After transposing, reversing each row will give us the desired 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n\n```\n6 3 9 2 3 3 2 1\n4 6 8 8 1 9 7 3\n6 9 9 3 5 6 3 2\n7 2 9 5 1 8 1 7\n5 6 0 4 8 0 6 3\n5 8 1 7 8 3 9 7\n0 5 2 3 2 7 9 2\n8 2 0 1 0 2 7 6\n```\n\nWe will implement the above steps in Python to rotate the matrix.\n\n```python\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 3, 9, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1],\n    [4, 6, 8, 8, 1, 9, 7, 3],\n    [6, 9, 9, 3, 5, 6, 3, 2],\n    [7, 2, 9, 5, 1, 8, 1, 7],\n    [5, 6, 0, 4, 8, 0, 6, 3],\n    [5, 8, 1, 7, 8, 3, 9, 7],\n    [0, 5, 2, 3, 2, 7, 9, 2],\n    [8, 2, 0, 1, 0, 2, 7, 6]\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\nn = len(matrix)\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(i, n):\n        matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]\n\n# Reverse each row\nfor i in range(n):\n    matrix[i].reverse()\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the matrix rotated by 90 degrees clockwise. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output matrix as requested, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n\n```\n8 0 5 5 7 6 4 6\n2 5 8 6 2 9 6 3\n0 2 1 0 9 9 8 9\n1 3 7 4 5 3 8 2\n0 2 8 8 1 5 1 3\n2 7 3 0 8 6 9 3\n7 9 9 6 1 3 7 2\n6 2 7 3 7 2 3 1\n```\n\nNow, I'll provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\n8 0 5 5 7 6 4 6\n2 5 8 6 2 9 6 3\n0 2 1 0 9 9 8 9\n1 3 7 4 5 3 8 2\n0 2 8 8 1 5 1 3\n2 7 3 0 8 6 9 3\n7 9 9 6 1 3 7 2\n6 2 7 3 7 2 3 1\n>>>"
