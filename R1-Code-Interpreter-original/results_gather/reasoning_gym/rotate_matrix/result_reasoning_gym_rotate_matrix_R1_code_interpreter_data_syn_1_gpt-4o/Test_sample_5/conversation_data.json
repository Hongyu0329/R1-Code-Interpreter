    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 360-degree rotation will bring the matrix back to its original orientation. Therefore, the output matrix should be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's verify this by considering the matrix:\n\n```\n9 8 0\n5 7 8\n1 7 9\n```\n\nIf we rotate this matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, it should remain unchanged. However, to ensure accuracy, let's write a Python script to perform the rotation and confirm the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_360(matrix):\n    # A 360-degree rotation results in the same matrix\n    return matrix\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = [\n    [9, 8, 0],\n    [5, 7, 8],\n    [1, 7, 9]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 360 degrees\noutput_matrix = rotate_matrix_360(input_matrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code output confirms that rotating the matrix by 360 degrees clockwise results in the same matrix as the input. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n9 8 0\n5 7 8\n1 7 9\n>>>"
