    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 900-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to rotating the matrix 2.5 full rotations (since 360 degrees is a full rotation). However, in terms of matrix operations, a 900-degree rotation is effectively the same as a 180-degree rotation because 900 % 360 = 180.\n\nA 180-degree rotation of a matrix can be achieved by reversing the order of the rows and then reversing the order of the elements in each row. Let's implement this logic in Python to rotate the given matrix.\n\nHere's the matrix provided:\n\n```\n6 8 6 5 5 8\n6 5 0 8 6 3\n9 0 6 3 2 8\n9 0 2 7 9 2\n2 3 5 5 9 2\n3 4 4 1 5 1\n```\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform a 180-degree rotation on this matrix.\n\n```python\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 8, 6, 5, 5, 8],\n    [6, 5, 0, 8, 6, 3],\n    [9, 0, 6, 3, 2, 8],\n    [9, 0, 2, 7, 9, 2],\n    [2, 3, 5, 5, 9, 2],\n    [3, 4, 4, 1, 5, 1]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we have obtained the rotated matrix. The matrix has been rotated 180 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a 900-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n\n```\n1 5 1 4 4 3\n2 9 5 5 3 2\n2 9 7 2 0 9\n8 2 3 6 0 9\n3 6 8 0 5 6\n8 5 5 6 8 6\n```\n\nNow, let's format the output as requested:\n\n<<<\n1 5 1 4 4 3\n2 9 5 5 3 2\n2 9 7 2 0 9\n8 2 3 6 0 9\n3 6 8 0 5 6\n8 5 5 6 8 6\n>>>"
