    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 0-degree rotation means the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix should be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's represent the matrix in a format that can be easily processed and then output it as is.\n\nHere's the matrix given:\n\n```\n8 8 2 7 0 2 0 9 1 4\n3 0 9 8 9 3 1 5 4 6\n5 2 2 2 6 5 9 2 9 6\n9 4 8 2 1 1 5 7 4 0\n0 5 8 8 9 5 4 5 3 6\n9 6 1 2 1 9 0 0 3 6\n3 8 7 9 2 6 7 2 9 9\n1 7 7 3 9 5 4 6 8 3\n4 2 3 1 2 8 9 3 1 0\n3 7 0 5 4 2 6 3 3 8\n```\n\nSince the rotation is 0 degrees, the output will be the same as the input. Let's format the output accordingly.\n\n```python\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 8, 2, 7, 0, 2, 0, 9, 1, 4],\n    [3, 0, 9, 8, 9, 3, 1, 5, 4, 6],\n    [5, 2, 2, 2, 6, 5, 9, 2, 9, 6],\n    [9, 4, 8, 2, 1, 1, 5, 7, 4, 0],\n    [0, 5, 8, 8, 9, 5, 4, 5, 3, 6],\n    [9, 6, 1, 2, 1, 9, 0, 0, 3, 6],\n    [3, 8, 7, 9, 2, 6, 7, 2, 9, 9],\n    [1, 7, 7, 3, 9, 5, 4, 6, 8, 3],\n    [4, 2, 3, 1, 2, 8, 9, 3, 1, 0],\n    [3, 7, 0, 5, 4, 2, 6, 3, 3, 8]\n]\n\nfor row in matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output.",
    "The code executed correctly without any errors, and the output matches the input matrix, as expected for a 0-degree rotation. Therefore, the final answer is the matrix itself.\n\n<<<\n8 8 2 7 0 2 0 9 1 4\n3 0 9 8 9 3 1 5 4 6\n5 2 2 2 6 5 9 2 9 6\n9 4 8 2 1 1 5 7 4 0\n0 5 8 8 9 5 4 5 3 6\n9 6 1 2 1 9 0 0 3 6\n3 8 7 9 2 6 7 2 9 9\n1 7 7 3 9 5 4 6 8 3\n4 2 3 1 2 8 9 3 1 0\n3 7 0 5 4 2 6 3 3 8\n>>>"
