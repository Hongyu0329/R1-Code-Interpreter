    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of rotations on the matrix. A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\nRotating a matrix by 360 degrees results in the matrix returning to its original orientation. Therefore, rotating a matrix by 720 degrees, which is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, will also result in the matrix returning to its original orientation.\n\nGiven this understanding, we can conclude that the matrix will remain unchanged after a 720-degree rotation. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's write the code to confirm this:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_720_degrees(matrix):\n    # Since 720 degrees is equivalent to two full rotations (360 * 2),\n    # the matrix will remain unchanged.\n    return matrix\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 8, 7, 8, 5],\n    [7, 0, 0, 2, 5],\n    [2, 4, 0, 2, 0],\n    [5, 3, 7, 3, 3],\n    [2, 2, 5, 8, 5]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 720 degrees\nresult = rotate_matrix_720_degrees(matrix)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matches the expected result. Since rotating the matrix by 720 degrees results in the matrix returning to its original orientation, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix.\n\n<<<[[7, 8, 7, 8, 5], [7, 0, 0, 2, 5], [2, 4, 0, 2, 0], [5, 3, 7, 3, 3], [2, 2, 5, 8, 5]]>>>"
