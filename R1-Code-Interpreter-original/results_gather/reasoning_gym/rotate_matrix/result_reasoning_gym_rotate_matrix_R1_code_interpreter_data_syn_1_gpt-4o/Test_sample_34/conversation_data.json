    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs. Rotating a matrix by 180 degrees is equivalent to flipping it upside down and then reversing each row.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n4 6 3\n7 4 4\n8 1 7\n```\n\nThe steps to rotate it by 180 degrees are:\n1. Reverse the order of the rows.\n2. Reverse the order of the elements in each row.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 6, 3],\n    [7, 4, 4],\n    [8, 1, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the result of rotating the original matrix by 180 degrees clockwise. The transformation involved reversing the order of the rows and then reversing the order of the elements in each row.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n7 1 8\n4 4 7\n3 6 4\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n7 1 8\n4 4 7\n3 6 4\n>>>"
