    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nFor a given element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, its new position in the rotated matrix will be (j, n-1-i), where n is the size of the matrix. This transformation effectively rotates the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Read the input matrix.\n2. Determine the size of the matrix (n x n).\n3. Create a new matrix of the same size to store the rotated elements.\n4. Apply the transformation to each element and place it in the new matrix.\n5. Print the rotated matrix.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 3, 0, 3, 7],\n    [6, 5, 4, 4, 7],\n    [9, 6, 4, 9, 1],\n    [0, 7, 3, 7, 1],\n    [7, 8, 6, 5, 0]\n]\n\n# Get the size of the matrix\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix, which we will then format as required.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output matrix as required by the problem statement. The matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[[7, 0, 9, 6, 3], \n [8, 7, 6, 5, 3], \n [6, 3, 4, 4, 0], \n [5, 7, 9, 4, 3], \n [0, 1, 1, 7, 7]]\n```\n\nNow, let's format it as the final answer:\n\n<<<\n7 0 9 6 3\n8 7 6 5 3\n6 3 4 4 0\n5 7 9 4 3\n0 1 1 7 7\n>>>"
