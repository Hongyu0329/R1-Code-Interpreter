    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs. Rotating a matrix by 180 degrees is equivalent to flipping it upside down and then reversing each row.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Flip the matrix upside down**: This means reversing the order of the rows.\n2. **Reverse each row**: After flipping, each row should be reversed to complete the 180-degree rotation.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to transform the given matrix.\n\n```python\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 2, 5, 2, 4, 6, 4, 9, 0, 8],\n    [4, 5, 9, 1, 5, 0, 8, 0, 1, 7],\n    [5, 0, 5, 7, 0, 0, 3, 5, 1, 2],\n    [5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 5, 1, 4, 2, 9],\n    [1, 2, 8, 7, 7, 5, 6, 9, 6, 0],\n    [4, 9, 7, 8, 8, 0, 1, 5, 8, 7],\n    [1, 1, 6, 6, 3, 7, 6, 0, 4, 9],\n    [3, 3, 9, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0],\n    [2, 7, 9, 9, 0, 7, 8, 2, 8, 4],\n    [8, 7, 6, 0, 6, 8, 9, 4, 8, 8]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix by 180 degrees and print the result. Let's execute it to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix. The matrix was rotated by 180 degrees clockwise, which involves flipping the matrix upside down and then reversing each row.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n\n```\n[[8, 8, 4, 9, 8, 6, 0, 6, 7, 8],\n [4, 8, 2, 8, 7, 0, 9, 9, 7, 2],\n [0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 9, 3, 3],\n [9, 4, 0, 6, 7, 3, 6, 6, 1, 1],\n [7, 8, 5, 1, 0, 8, 8, 7, 9, 4],\n [0, 6, 9, 6, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 1],\n [9, 2, 4, 1, 5, 7, 1, 9, 2, 5],\n [2, 1, 5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 5],\n [7, 1, 0, 8, 0, 5, 1, 9, 5, 4],\n [8, 0, 9, 4, 6, 4, 2, 5, 2, 5]]\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[8, 8, 4, 9, 8, 6, 0, 6, 7, 8], [4, 8, 2, 8, 7, 0, 9, 9, 7, 2], [0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 9, 3, 3], [9, 4, 0, 6, 7, 3, 6, 6, 1, 1], [7, 8, 5, 1, 0, 8, 8, 7, 9, 4], [0, 6, 9, 6, 5, 7, 7, 8, 2, 1], [9, 2, 4, 1, 5, 7, 1, 9, 2, 5], [2, 1, 5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 5], [7, 1, 0, 8, 0, 5, 1, 9, 5, 4], [8, 0, 9, 4, 6, 4, 2, 5, 2, 5]]>>>"
