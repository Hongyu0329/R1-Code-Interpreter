    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of rotation on the matrix. A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original position. Therefore, a 720-degree rotation, which is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, will also bring the matrix back to its original position.\n\nGiven this understanding, we can conclude that the matrix will remain unchanged after a 720-degree rotation. Let's verify this by considering the matrix:\n\n```\n1 3 7 4\n5 2 8 2\n2 0 4 2\n1 0 7 7\n```\n\nSince a 720-degree rotation is equivalent to no rotation, the output matrix should be the same as the input matrix. Let's write a Python script to confirm this:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_720_degrees(matrix):\n    # Since 720 degrees is equivalent to two full rotations (360 * 2),\n    # the matrix remains unchanged.\n    return matrix\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = [\n    [1, 3, 7, 4],\n    [5, 2, 8, 2],\n    [2, 0, 4, 2],\n    [1, 0, 7, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 720 degrees\noutput_matrix = rotate_matrix_720_degrees(input_matrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected. This confirms that a 720-degree rotation results in the matrix remaining unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n1 3 7 4\n5 2 8 2\n2 0 4 2\n1 0 7 7\n>>>"
