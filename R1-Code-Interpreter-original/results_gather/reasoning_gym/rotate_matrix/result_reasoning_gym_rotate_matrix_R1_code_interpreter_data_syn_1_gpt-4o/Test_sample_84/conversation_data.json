    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given square matrix by 450 degrees clockwise. \n\nFirst, let's understand the rotation:\n- A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the element at position (i, j) to position (j, n-1-i), where n is the size of the matrix.\n- A 450-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree rotation (since 450 % 360 = 90).\n\nGiven this, we only need to perform a single 90-degree clockwise rotation on the matrix.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    rotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 0, 1, 2, 7, 7, 3, 4, 6, 9],\n    [6, 9, 1, 7, 1, 5, 8, 5, 7, 0],\n    [8, 8, 1, 6, 7, 2, 8, 5, 2, 7],\n    [8, 1, 8, 7, 9, 3, 9, 6, 8, 4],\n    [5, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 3, 5, 9, 1],\n    [0, 6, 5, 4, 3, 5, 7, 6, 2, 4],\n    [0, 6, 6, 1, 0, 4, 0, 2, 5, 4],\n    [0, 7, 0, 2, 4, 8, 7, 0, 9, 9],\n    [2, 7, 3, 8, 7, 6, 8, 7, 6, 8],\n    [4, 5, 6, 9, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nfor row in rotated_matrix:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a 450-degree rotation. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
