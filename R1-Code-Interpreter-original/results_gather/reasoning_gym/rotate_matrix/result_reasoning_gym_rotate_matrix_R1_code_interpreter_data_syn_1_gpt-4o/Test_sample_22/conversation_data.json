    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 630 degrees clockwise, we need to first understand the relationship between degrees of rotation and the number of 90-degree rotations. A full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation. Therefore, we can simplify the problem by calculating the effective rotation:\n\n1. Calculate the effective rotation: 630 degrees % 360 degrees = 270 degrees.\n2. A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.\n\nTo perform a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation, we can follow these steps:\n- Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n- Reverse the order of the rows.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_counterclockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse the order of the rows\n    rotated_matrix = transposed_matrix[::-1]\n    return [list(row) for row in rotated_matrix]\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 8, 4, 7],\n    [7, 6, 3, 7],\n    [5, 9, 6, 3],\n    [3, 0, 7, 8]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_90_counterclockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix. The matrix was rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, which is equivalent to a 270-degree clockwise rotation. This matches the effective rotation needed for a 630-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<[[7, 7, 3, 8], [4, 3, 6, 7], [8, 6, 9, 0], [7, 7, 5, 3]]>>>"
