    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 360-degree rotation will result in the matrix looking exactly the same as the original. Therefore, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\nLet's represent the matrix in a structured format and then return it as the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 6, 8, 7, 9, 5, 4],\n    [8, 6, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0],\n    [1, 0, 4, 7, 8, 0, 5],\n    [9, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 5],\n    [7, 3, 0, 8, 5, 5, 9],\n    [5, 8, 9, 3, 3, 0, 2],\n    [5, 1, 5, 9, 6, 8, 8]\n]\n\n# Since a 360-degree rotation results in the same matrix, we print the original matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the original matrix, which is the result of a 360-degree rotation.\n\n<<<[[1, 6, 8, 7, 9, 5, 4], [8, 6, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0], [1, 0, 4, 7, 8, 0, 5], [9, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 5], [7, 3, 0, 8, 5, 5, 9], [5, 8, 9, 3, 3, 0, 2], [5, 1, 5, 9, 6, 8, 8]]>>>",
    "The code executed correctly without any errors, and the output matches the expected result of a 360-degree rotation, which is the original matrix itself. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[1, 6, 8, 7, 9, 5, 4], [8, 6, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0], [1, 0, 4, 7, 8, 0, 5], [9, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 5], [7, 3, 0, 8, 5, 5, 9], [5, 8, 9, 3, 3, 0, 2], [5, 1, 5, 9, 6, 8, 8]]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
