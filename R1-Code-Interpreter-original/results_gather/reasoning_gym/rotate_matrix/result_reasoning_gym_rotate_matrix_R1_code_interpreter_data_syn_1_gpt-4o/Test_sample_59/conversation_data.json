    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. \n\nFor a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on. \n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n9 2 2\n6 7 7\n7 7 4\n```\n\nWe can follow these steps to achieve the desired rotation:\n1. Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n2. Reverse the order of the rows in the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 2, 2],\n    [6, 7, 7],\n    [7, 7, 4]\n]\n\n# Step 1: Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n\n# Step 2: Reverse the order of the rows in the transposed matrix\nrotated_matrix = [list(row) for row in transposed_matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is the result of rotating the original matrix by 270 degrees clockwise. \n\nThe original matrix:\n```\n9 2 2\n6 7 7\n7 7 4\n```\n\nAfter rotating it by 270 degrees clockwise, the resulting matrix is:\n```\n2 7 4\n2 7 7\n9 6 7\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[2, 7, 4], [2, 7, 7], [9, 6, 7]]>>>"
