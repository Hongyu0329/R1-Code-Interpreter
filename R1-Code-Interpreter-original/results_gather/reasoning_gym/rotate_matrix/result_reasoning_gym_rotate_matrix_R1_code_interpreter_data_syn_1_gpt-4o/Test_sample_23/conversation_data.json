    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of rotation on the matrix. A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original position. Therefore, a 720-degree rotation is equivalent to two full rotations, which also results in the matrix returning to its original position.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n3 2 4\n1 2 4\n1 5 7\n```\n\nWe can conclude that after rotating it by 720 degrees, the matrix will remain unchanged. However, let's verify this by implementing the rotation logic in Python.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix to store the rotated result\n    rotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 2, 4],\n    [1, 2, 4],\n    [1, 5, 7]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise four times (360 degrees)\nfor _ in range(4):\n    matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise four times, effectively rotating it by 360 degrees twice (720 degrees). Let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected. This confirms that rotating the matrix by 720 degrees results in the matrix returning to its original position.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n3 2 4\n1 2 4\n1 5 7\n>>>"
