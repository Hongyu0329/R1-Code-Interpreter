    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of rotation on the matrix. A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation. Therefore, a 720-degree rotation, which is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, will also bring the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\nGiven this understanding, the matrix will remain unchanged after a 720-degree rotation. Let's verify this by implementing the rotation logic in Python and checking the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_720_degrees(matrix):\n    # Since 720 degrees is equivalent to two full rotations (360 degrees each),\n    # the matrix will remain the same.\n    return matrix\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 8, 7, 5, 6, 0],\n    [2, 2, 6, 2, 5, 7],\n    [0, 0, 8, 6, 7, 0],\n    [3, 1, 2, 2, 7, 3],\n    [4, 7, 7, 6, 1, 0],\n    [9, 6, 1, 9, 6, 5]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 720 degrees\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_720_degrees(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output confirms that the matrix remains unchanged after a 720-degree rotation. This is because a 720-degree rotation is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, which bring the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix is the same as the input matrix:\n\n<<<\n0 8 7 5 6 0\n2 2 6 2 5 7\n0 0 8 6 7 0\n3 1 2 2 7 3\n4 7 7 6 1 0\n9 6 1 9 6 5\n>>>"
