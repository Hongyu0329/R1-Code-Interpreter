    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 360-degree rotation will bring the matrix back to its original orientation. Therefore, the output matrix should be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's verify this by considering the matrix:\n\n```\n9 4 2\n5 1 2\n6 5 3\n```\n\nIf we rotate this matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, it should remain unchanged. However, to ensure accuracy, let's write a Python script to perform the rotation and confirm the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_360(matrix):\n    # A 360-degree rotation results in the same matrix\n    return matrix\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = [\n    [9, 4, 2],\n    [5, 1, 2],\n    [6, 5, 3]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 360 degrees\noutput_matrix = rotate_matrix_360(input_matrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will confirm that the matrix remains unchanged after a 360-degree rotation. Let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected for a 360-degree rotation. Therefore, the rotated matrix is:\n\n```\n9 4 2\n5 1 2\n6 5 3\n```\n\nThis confirms that the matrix remains unchanged after a 360-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n<<<\n9 4 2\n5 1 2\n6 5 3\n>>>"
