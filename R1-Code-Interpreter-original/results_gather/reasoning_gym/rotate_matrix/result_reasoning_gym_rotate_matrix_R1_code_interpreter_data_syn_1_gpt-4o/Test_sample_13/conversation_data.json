    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 0-degree rotation means the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's represent the input matrix and then provide the output matrix, which will be identical since no rotation is applied.\n\nThe input matrix is:\n```\n6 7 4 1 4 5\n0 1 7 0 1 4\n1 4 0 9 1 2\n4 2 3 6 1 9\n6 2 0 0 2 5\n4 5 5 1 6 1\n```\n\nSince a 0-degree rotation does not alter the matrix, the output will be the same as the input.\n\n<<<\n6 7 4 1 4 5\n0 1 7 0 1 4\n1 4 0 9 1 2\n4 2 3 6 1 9\n6 2 0 0 2 5\n4 5 5 1 6 1\n>>>"
