    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nFor a given element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, its new position in the rotated matrix will be (j, n-1-i), where n is the size of the matrix. This transformation effectively rotates the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nLet's break down the given matrix:\n\n```\n4 1\n6 4\n```\n\nThis is a 2x2 matrix. After rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, the element at position (0, 0) will move to (0, 1), the element at (0, 1) will move to (1, 1), and so on.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 1],\n    [6, 4]\n]\n\n# Size of the matrix\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix to store the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output as required and provide the final answer.\n\nThe original matrix:\n```\n4 1\n6 4\n```\n\nAfter rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n```\n6 4\n4 1\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n6 4\n4 1\n>>>"
