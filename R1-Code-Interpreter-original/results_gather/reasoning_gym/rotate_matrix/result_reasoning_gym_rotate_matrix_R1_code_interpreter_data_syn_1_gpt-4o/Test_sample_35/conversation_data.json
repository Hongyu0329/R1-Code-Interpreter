    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 360-degree rotation will result in the matrix looking exactly the same as the original. This is because a full rotation brings each element back to its original position.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix**: The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   1 6 7\n   6 4 9\n   6 7 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Rotation by 360 Degrees**: A 360-degree rotation means the matrix will remain unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\n3. **Output the Result**: We will output the matrix in the required format.\n\nNow, let's proceed to output the matrix in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 6, 7],\n    [6, 4, 9],\n    [6, 7, 9]\n]\n\n# Since a 360-degree rotation results in the same matrix, we print the original matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the matrix in the same format as the input. Let's see the result.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output is the matrix in the same format as the input. Since a 360-degree rotation results in the matrix remaining unchanged, the output is exactly the same as the input matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n1 6 7\n6 4 9\n6 7 9\n>>>"
