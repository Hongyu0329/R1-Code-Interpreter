    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. \n\nThe steps to achieve this are:\n1. Transpose the matrix: Swap rows with columns.\n2. Reverse the order of the rows.\n\nLet's break down the steps with the given matrix:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n```\n6 5 0 9 0\n8 0 0 4 5\n0 1 7 7 1\n5 3 4 2 4\n6 8 3 2 1\n```\n\n1. Transpose the matrix:\n   - The first row becomes the first column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on.\n\n2. Reverse the order of the rows:\n   - After transposing, reverse the order of the rows to achieve the 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_270_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse the order of the rows\n    rotated_matrix = transposed_matrix[::-1]\n    # Convert tuples back to lists\n    rotated_matrix = [list(row) for row in rotated_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 5, 0, 9, 0],\n    [8, 0, 0, 4, 5],\n    [0, 1, 7, 7, 1],\n    [5, 3, 4, 2, 4],\n    [6, 8, 3, 2, 1]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 270 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_270_clockwise(matrix)\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the matrix rotated by 270 degrees clockwise. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is the result of rotating the original matrix by 270 degrees clockwise. \n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n0 5 1 4 1\n9 4 7 2 2\n0 0 7 4 3\n5 0 1 3 8\n6 8 0 5 6\n```\n\nThis matrix is the correct transformation of the original matrix after a 270-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n<<<\n0 5 1 4 1\n9 4 7 2 2\n0 0 7 4 3\n5 0 1 3 8\n6 8 0 5 6\n>>>"
