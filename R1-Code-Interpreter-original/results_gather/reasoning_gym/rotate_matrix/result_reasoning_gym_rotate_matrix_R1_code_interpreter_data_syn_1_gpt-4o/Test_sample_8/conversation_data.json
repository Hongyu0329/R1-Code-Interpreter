    "To solve this problem, we need to rotate the given square matrix by 810 degrees clockwise. \n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - Rotating a matrix 360 degrees results in the same matrix as the original.\n\n2. **Calculating Effective Rotation:**\n   - 810 degrees is equivalent to \\(810 \\mod 360 = 90\\) degrees. This means we only need to perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n3. **Matrix Rotation Logic:**\n   - For a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix moves to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the size of the matrix.\n\n4. **Implementation:**\n   - We will implement the logic to rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise using Python.\n\nLet's write the code to perform this rotation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    rotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 8, 0, 3, 4, 3, 2, 5, 4],\n    [7, 0, 8, 2, 0, 3, 9, 7, 0],\n    [2, 9, 5, 1, 4, 5, 2, 8, 8],\n    [1, 6, 0, 5, 5, 3, 2, 4, 2],\n    [8, 4, 4, 7, 2, 9, 3, 7, 6],\n    [8, 1, 2, 9, 3, 9, 9, 0, 1],\n    [7, 9, 4, 1, 3, 3, 7, 7, 1],\n    [7, 5, 9, 7, 4, 8, 9, 3, 1],\n    [0, 2, 9, 6, 2, 7, 1, 6, 3]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, which is the effective rotation needed for 810 degrees. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
