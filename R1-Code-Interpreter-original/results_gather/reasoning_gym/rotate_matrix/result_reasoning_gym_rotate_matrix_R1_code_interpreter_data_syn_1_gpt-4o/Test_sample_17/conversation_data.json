    "To rotate a matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we need to reverse the order of the elements both row-wise and column-wise. This is equivalent to rotating the matrix twice by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n5 6 1\n5 8 8\n0 0 4\n```\n\nThe steps to rotate it by 180 degrees are:\n1. Reverse each row.\n2. Reverse the order of the rows.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 6, 1],\n    [5, 8, 8],\n    [0, 0, 4]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is the result of rotating the original matrix by 180 degrees clockwise. \n\nThe original matrix:\n```\n5 6 1\n5 8 8\n0 0 4\n```\n\nAfter rotating it by 180 degrees, the matrix becomes:\n```\n4 0 0\n8 8 5\n1 6 5\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[4, 0, 0], [8, 8, 5], [1, 6, 5]]>>>"
