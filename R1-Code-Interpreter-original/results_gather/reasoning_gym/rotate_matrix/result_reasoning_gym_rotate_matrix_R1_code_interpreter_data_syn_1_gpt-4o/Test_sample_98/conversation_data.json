    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 630 degrees clockwise, we need to first understand the effective rotation. A full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation. Therefore, rotating by 630 degrees is equivalent to rotating by \\(630 \\mod 360 = 270\\) degrees clockwise.\n\nRotating a matrix by 270 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise. The steps to achieve this are:\n1. Transpose the matrix.\n2. Reverse the order of columns.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the rotated matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_270_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse the order of columns\n    rotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 4, 7, 7, 0, 5, 3, 9, 5, 3],\n    [5, 8, 1, 8, 3, 5, 0, 6, 0, 5],\n    [2, 0, 7, 6, 5, 7, 6, 6, 1, 0],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 2, 9, 4, 1],\n    [2, 2, 1, 7, 6, 1, 4, 6, 6, 1],\n    [5, 8, 2, 2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9],\n    [6, 2, 6, 4, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 8],\n    [5, 8, 7, 9, 3, 8, 2, 9, 4, 0],\n    [5, 8, 0, 0, 9, 6, 5, 7, 7, 8],\n    [1, 9, 1, 4, 0, 5, 7, 4, 2, 5]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_270_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the rotated matrix.",
