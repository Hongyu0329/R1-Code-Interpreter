    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs to the indices of the matrix elements. \n\nFor a given element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, its new position in the rotated matrix will be (j, n-1-i), where n is the size of the matrix. This transformation effectively rotates the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Read the input matrix.\n2. Determine the size of the matrix (n x n).\n3. Create a new matrix of the same size to store the rotated elements.\n4. Apply the transformation to each element and place it in the new matrix.\n5. Print the rotated matrix.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 9, 6, 7, 4],\n    [2, 6, 8, 1, 4],\n    [4, 9, 0, 4, 5],\n    [3, 2, 9, 3, 2],\n    [8, 2, 3, 5, 1]\n]\n\n# Determine the size of the matrix\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix to store the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Apply the rotation transformation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the given matrix by 90 degrees clockwise and print the result. Let's execute it to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix as output. Now, let's format the output matrix as required and present it in the final answer.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n8 3 4 2 9\n2 2 9 6 9\n3 9 0 8 6\n5 3 4 1 7\n1 2 5 4 4\n```\n\nNow, let's format this matrix within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<\n8 3 4 2 9\n2 2 9 6 9\n3 9 0 8 6\n5 3 4 1 7\n1 2 5 4 4\n>>>"
