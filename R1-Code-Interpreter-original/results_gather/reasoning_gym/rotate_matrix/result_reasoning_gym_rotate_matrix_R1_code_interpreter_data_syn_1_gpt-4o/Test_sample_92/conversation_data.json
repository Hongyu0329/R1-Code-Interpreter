    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 810 degrees clockwise, we need to first understand the rotation process and how the degrees translate into the number of 90-degree rotations.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Understanding Rotation Degrees:**\n   - A full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n   - 810 degrees is equivalent to \\(810 \\mod 360 = 90\\) degrees.\n   - Therefore, rotating the matrix by 810 degrees clockwise is the same as rotating it by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n2. **Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves:\n     - Transposing the matrix (converting rows to columns).\n     - Reversing the order of columns.\n\n3. **Implementation:**\n   - We will implement a function to rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.\n   - The input matrix is a 6x6 matrix, and we will apply the rotation logic to it.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform this operation:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row to get the 90-degree rotated matrix\n    rotated_matrix = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed_matrix]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 0, 2, 0, 6, 4],\n    [5, 0, 5, 2, 6, 4],\n    [6, 0, 8, 7, 9, 6],\n    [0, 3, 3, 1, 6, 5],\n    [3, 2, 6, 3, 5, 8],\n    [4, 6, 2, 1, 7, 8]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we obtained the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output matrix as required.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[[4, 3, 0, 6, 5, 8],\n [6, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 6, 3, 8, 5, 2],\n [1, 3, 1, 7, 2, 0],\n [7, 5, 6, 9, 6, 6],\n [8, 8, 5, 6, 4, 4]]\n```\n\nLet's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\n4 3 0 6 5 8\n6 2 3 0 0 0\n2 6 3 8 5 2\n1 3 1 7 2 0\n7 5 6 9 6 6\n8 8 5 6 4 4\n>>>"
