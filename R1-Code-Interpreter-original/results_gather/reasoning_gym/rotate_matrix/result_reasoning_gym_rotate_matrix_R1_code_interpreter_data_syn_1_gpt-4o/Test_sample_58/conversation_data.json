    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 0-degree rotation means the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's represent the input matrix and then directly provide the output since no rotation is needed.\n\nThe input matrix is:\n```\n1 7 9 9 4\n5 7 9 4 4\n7 4 5 1 8\n2 0 6 5 7\n1 2 8 8 2\n```\n\nSince a 0-degree rotation does not alter the matrix, the output will be the same as the input.\n\n<<<\n1 7 9 9 4\n5 7 9 4 4\n7 4 5 1 8\n2 0 6 5 7\n1 2 8 8 2\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Given a square matrix, your job is to rotate it clockwise.\n\nYour output should be a matrix in the same format as the input, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the output matrix>>>.\n\nRotate the matrix below by 0 degrees clockwise:\n1 7 9 9 4\n5 7 9 4 4\n7 4 5 1 8\n2 0 6 5 7\n1 2 8 8 2\n"
