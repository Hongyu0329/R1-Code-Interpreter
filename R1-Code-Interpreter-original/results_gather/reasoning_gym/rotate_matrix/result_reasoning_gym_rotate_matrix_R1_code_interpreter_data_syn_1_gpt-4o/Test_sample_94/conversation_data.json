    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of multiple 90-degree rotations. \n\n1. A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n2. Rotating a matrix by 360 degrees (4 times 90 degrees) results in the original matrix.\n3. Therefore, rotating a matrix by 900 degrees is equivalent to rotating it by 900 % 360 = 180 degrees.\n\nFor a 180-degree rotation:\n- The first row becomes the last row in reverse order.\n- The second row becomes the second last row in reverse order, and so on.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n9 9\n7 3\n```\n\nLet's perform a 180-degree rotation:\n\n1. Reverse the order of the rows:\n   - The first row (9, 9) becomes the last row.\n   - The second row (7, 3) becomes the first row.\n\n2. Reverse the order of elements in each row:\n   - The first row (7, 3) becomes (3, 7).\n   - The second row (9, 9) becomes (9, 9).\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure correctness:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    # Reverse the order of rows and then reverse each row\n    return [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 9],\n    [7, 3]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix after rotating the original matrix by 900 degrees clockwise (equivalent to 180 degrees) is:\n\n```\n3 7\n9 9\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n3 7\n9 9\n>>>"
