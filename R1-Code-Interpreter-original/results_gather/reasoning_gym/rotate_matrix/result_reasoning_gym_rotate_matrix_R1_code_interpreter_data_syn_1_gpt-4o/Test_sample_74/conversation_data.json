    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that each element in the matrix undergoes. For a given element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, its new position in the rotated matrix will be (j, n-1-i), where n is the size of the matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: First, we need to parse the input matrix from the given string format into a 2D list (list of lists) in Python.\n\n2. **Matrix Rotation**: Using the transformation rule mentioned above, we will create a new matrix that represents the original matrix rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n3. **Output Formatting**: Finally, we will format the rotated matrix into the required output format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the input matrix as a list of lists\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 8, 8, 7, 0, 4, 1, 3, 7],\n    [5, 6, 7, 4, 3, 7, 4, 7, 2],\n    [2, 4, 5, 7, 5, 1, 4, 5, 5],\n    [2, 2, 6, 1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 2],\n    [5, 7, 8, 4, 9, 4, 7, 7, 6],\n    [3, 2, 2, 7, 3, 2, 3, 3, 5],\n    [9, 8, 3, 2, 5, 4, 2, 9, 5],\n    [8, 7, 8, 6, 3, 6, 3, 8, 5],\n    [6, 6, 2, 2, 9, 0, 5, 8, 8]\n]\n\n# Get the size of the matrix\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Create a new matrix for the rotated result\nrotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Perform the rotation\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the rotated matrix, which we will then format into the required output format.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the rotated matrix. Now, let's format the output matrix into the required format, which is enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n[[6, 8, 9, 3, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0],\n [6, 7, 8, 2, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8],\n [2, 8, 3, 2, 8, 6, 5, 7, 8],\n [2, 6, 2, 7, 4, 1, 7, 4, 7],\n [9, 3, 5, 3, 9, 0, 5, 3, 0],\n [0, 6, 4, 2, 4, 1, 1, 7, 4],\n [5, 3, 2, 3, 7, 5, 4, 4, 1],\n [8, 8, 9, 3, 7, 1, 5, 7, 3],\n [8, 5, 5, 5, 6, 2, 5, 2, 7]]\n```\n\nNow, let's format it as required:\n\n<<<\n6 8 9 3 5 2 2 5 0\n6 7 8 2 7 2 4 6 8\n2 8 3 2 8 6 5 7 8\n2 6 2 7 4 1 7 4 7\n9 3 5 3 9 0 5 3 0\n0 6 4 2 4 1 1 7 4\n5 3 2 3 7 5 4 4 1\n8 8 9 3 7 1 5 7 3\n8 5 5 5 6 2 5 2 7\n>>>"
