    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of rotation on the matrix:\n\n1. A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n2. A 540-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 180-degree clockwise rotation because 540 degrees is equivalent to 1.5 full rotations (540 % 360 = 180).\n\nThus, we need to perform a 180-degree rotation on the matrix. A 180-degree rotation can be achieved by reversing the order of the rows and then reversing the order of the elements in each row.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_180(matrix):\n    # Reverse the order of rows and then reverse each row\n    return [row[::-1] for row in matrix[::-1]]\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 7, 7, 8, 0, 1],\n    [3, 8, 7, 4, 9, 8],\n    [1, 3, 7, 8, 4, 6],\n    [2, 4, 8, 8, 5, 1],\n    [8, 2, 0, 5, 9, 3],\n    [2, 9, 2, 6, 7, 2]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = rotate_180(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the rotated matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we obtained the rotated matrix. The matrix was rotated by 180 degrees, which is equivalent to a 540-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<\n2 7 6 2 9 2\n3 9 5 0 2 8\n1 5 8 8 4 2\n6 4 8 7 3 1\n8 9 4 7 8 3\n1 0 8 7 7 3\n>>>"
