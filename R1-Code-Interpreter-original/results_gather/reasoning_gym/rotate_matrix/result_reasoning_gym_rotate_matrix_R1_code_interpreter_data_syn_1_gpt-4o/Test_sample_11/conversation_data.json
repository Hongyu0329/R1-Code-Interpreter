    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of multiple 90-degree rotations. \n\nA 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves:\n- Transposing the matrix (converting rows to columns).\n- Reversing the order of elements in each row.\n\nRotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 90 degrees clockwise 10 times (since 900 / 90 = 10). However, since a full 360-degree rotation returns the matrix to its original orientation, we only need to perform 2 additional 90-degree rotations (as 900 % 360 = 180).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise twice.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n4 2\n7 5\n```\n\nFirst 90-degree rotation:\n```\n7 4\n5 2\n```\n\nSecond 90-degree rotation:\n```\n5 7\n2 4\n```\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to verify the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse each row\n    rotated = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed]\n    return rotated\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 2],\n    [7, 5]\n]\n\n# Rotate 90 degrees clockwise twice\nfor _ in range(2):\n    matrix = rotate_90_clockwise(matrix)\n\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix after rotating the original matrix by 900 degrees clockwise is:\n\n```\n5 7\n2 4\n```\n\nThis confirms that the matrix has been rotated correctly. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5 7\n2 4>>>"
