    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 360-degree rotation will result in the matrix being the same as the original. Therefore, the output matrix should be identical to the input matrix.\n\nLet's verify this by considering the properties of matrix rotation:\n\n1. A 90-degree clockwise rotation involves transposing the matrix and then reversing each row.\n2. A 180-degree rotation is equivalent to two 90-degree rotations.\n3. A 270-degree rotation is equivalent to three 90-degree rotations.\n4. A 360-degree rotation is equivalent to four 90-degree rotations, which brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\nGiven this understanding, we can conclude that the matrix remains unchanged after a 360-degree rotation.\n\nLet's represent the input matrix and confirm that the output is the same as the input.\n\n```python\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 7, 8, 4, 8, 6, 3, 1, 5, 9],\n    [1, 5, 4, 9, 3, 0, 9, 3, 0, 9],\n    [8, 2, 6, 0, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 9],\n    [3, 8, 3, 7, 2, 6, 2, 1, 3, 8],\n    [2, 3, 2, 2, 8, 7, 5, 0, 0, 9],\n    [5, 0, 9, 0, 8, 8, 1, 9, 7, 6],\n    [5, 7, 5, 3, 8, 7, 8, 7, 0, 3],\n    [2, 5, 7, 2, 0, 3, 4, 2, 9, 4],\n    [7, 0, 2, 0, 9, 4, 8, 2, 8, 1],\n    [0, 9, 4, 9, 6, 3, 0, 8, 7, 8]\n]\n\n# Since a 360-degree rotation results in the same matrix, we print the original matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm that the matrix remains unchanged after a 360-degree rotation.\n\n<<<[[0, 7, 8, 4, 8, 6, 3, 1, 5, 9], [1, 5, 4, 9, 3, 0, 9, 3, 0, 9], [8, 2, 6, 0, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 9], [3, 8, 3, 7, 2, 6, 2, 1, 3, 8], [2, 3, 2, 2, 8, 7, 5, 0, 0, 9], [5, 0, 9, 0, 8, 8, 1, 9, 7, 6], [5, 7, 5, 3, 8, 7, 8, 7, 0, 3], [2, 5, 7, 2, 0, 3, 4, 2, 9, 4], [7, 0, 2, 0, 9, 4, 8, 2, 8, 1], [0, 9, 4, 9, 6, 3, 0, 8, 7, 8]]>>>",
