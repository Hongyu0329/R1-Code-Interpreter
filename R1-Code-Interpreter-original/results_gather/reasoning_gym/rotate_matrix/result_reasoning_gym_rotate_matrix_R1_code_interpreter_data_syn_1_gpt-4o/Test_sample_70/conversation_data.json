    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of rotation on the matrix. A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation. Therefore, a 720-degree rotation, which is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, will also bring the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\nGiven this understanding, the matrix will remain unchanged after a 720-degree rotation. Let's confirm this by implementing the rotation logic in Python and verifying the result.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Create a new matrix to store the rotated result\n    rotated_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            rotated_matrix[j][n - 1 - i] = matrix[i][j]\n    return rotated_matrix\n\ndef rotate_matrix_720_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Rotate the matrix 4 times by 90 degrees to achieve 360 degrees twice (720 degrees)\n    for _ in range(4):\n        matrix = rotate_matrix_90_clockwise(matrix)\n    return matrix\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 5, 2, 8],\n    [9, 2, 6, 4],\n    [9, 6, 9, 9],\n    [0, 8, 8, 9]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 720 degrees\nresult_matrix = rotate_matrix_720_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, which confirms our reasoning that a 720-degree rotation results in the matrix returning to its original orientation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n9 5 2 8\n9 2 6 4\n9 6 9 9\n0 8 8 9\n>>>"
