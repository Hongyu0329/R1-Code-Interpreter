    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 360-degree rotation will result in the matrix being the same as the original. Therefore, the output matrix should be identical to the input matrix.\n\nLet's first represent the input matrix in a structured format and then confirm that a 360-degree rotation results in the same matrix.\n\nThe input matrix is:\n```\n9 1 0 4 8 9 5\n4 2 5 2 2 1 6\n5 2 6 9 6 7 7\n3 2 9 4 8 4 0\n5 9 1 5 2 6 8\n8 9 7 9 8 6 9\n4 8 1 9 6 5 4\n```\n\nSince a 360-degree rotation results in the same matrix, the output will be the same as the input. Let's format the output matrix accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 1, 0, 4, 8, 9, 5],\n    [4, 2, 5, 2, 2, 1, 6],\n    [5, 2, 6, 9, 6, 7, 7],\n    [3, 2, 9, 4, 8, 4, 0],\n    [5, 9, 1, 5, 2, 6, 8],\n    [8, 9, 7, 9, 8, 6, 9],\n    [4, 8, 1, 9, 6, 5, 4]\n]\n\n# Since a 360-degree rotation results in the same matrix, we print the matrix as is\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm that the output matrix is the same as the input matrix.\n\n<<<[[9, 1, 0, 4, 8, 9, 5], [4, 2, 5, 2, 2, 1, 6], [5, 2, 6, 9, 6, 7, 7], [3, 2, 9, 4, 8, 4, 0], [5, 9, 1, 5, 2, 6, 8], [8, 9, 7, 9, 8, 6, 9], [4, 8, 1, 9, 6, 5, 4]]>>>",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected for a 360-degree rotation. There were no errors in the execution.\n\nThe final answer, which is the rotated matrix, is:\n\n<<<[[9, 1, 0, 4, 8, 9, 5], [4, 2, 5, 2, 2, 1, 6], [5, 2, 6, 9, 6, 7, 7], [3, 2, 9, 4, 8, 4, 0], [5, 9, 1, 5, 2, 6, 8], [8, 9, 7, 9, 8, 6, 9], [4, 8, 1, 9, 6, 5, 4]]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
