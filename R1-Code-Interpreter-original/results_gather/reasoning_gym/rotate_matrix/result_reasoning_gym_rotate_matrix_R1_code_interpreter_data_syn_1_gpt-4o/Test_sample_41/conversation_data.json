    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand that a 360-degree rotation will result in the matrix being the same as the original. This is because a full rotation brings each element back to its original position.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix**: The given matrix is a 6x6 matrix.\n2. **Rotation by 360 Degrees**: A 360-degree rotation means the matrix will look exactly the same as the original matrix.\n\nGiven this understanding, we can directly conclude that the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's write the code to confirm this:\n\n```python\ndef rotate_matrix_360(matrix):\n    # A 360-degree rotation results in the same matrix\n    return matrix\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 8, 7, 9, 2, 7],\n    [4, 9, 1, 7, 6, 8],\n    [8, 3, 7, 1, 0, 4],\n    [6, 0, 6, 5, 8, 6],\n    [7, 8, 6, 2, 0, 4],\n    [9, 9, 3, 1, 7, 5]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix by 360 degrees\nrotated_matrix = rotate_matrix_360(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the original matrix, as expected for a 360-degree rotation. Therefore, the rotated matrix is the same as the input matrix.\n\n<<<[[1, 8, 7, 9, 2, 7], [4, 9, 1, 7, 6, 8], [8, 3, 7, 1, 0, 4], [6, 0, 6, 5, 8, 6], [7, 8, 6, 2, 0, 4], [9, 9, 3, 1, 7, 5]]>>>"
