    "To rotate a matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we need to reverse the order of the elements both row-wise and column-wise. This is equivalent to flipping the matrix upside down and then reversing each row.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Reverse the order of the rows in the matrix.\n2. Reverse the order of the elements in each row.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n\n```\n8 8 1 2 6 3 4 0\n3 1 9 0 1 2 8 4\n6 9 6 5 5 1 5 4\n9 2 1 8 1 9 1 4\n5 1 4 0 5 6 1 7\n7 3 3 2 4 3 0 0\n6 0 5 5 7 7 9 8\n2 3 7 7 5 9 0 4\n```\n\nWe will apply the above steps to rotate it by 180 degrees clockwise.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 8, 1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 0],\n    [3, 1, 9, 0, 1, 2, 8, 4],\n    [6, 9, 6, 5, 5, 1, 5, 4],\n    [9, 2, 1, 8, 1, 9, 1, 4],\n    [5, 1, 4, 0, 5, 6, 1, 7],\n    [7, 3, 3, 2, 4, 3, 0, 0],\n    [6, 0, 5, 5, 7, 7, 9, 8],\n    [2, 3, 7, 7, 5, 9, 0, 4]\n]\n\n# Step 1: Reverse the order of the rows\nmatrix.reverse()\n\n# Step 2: Reverse the order of elements in each row\nfor row in matrix:\n    row.reverse()\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix by 180 degrees clockwise. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the rotated matrix. The matrix has been rotated by 180 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to flipping it upside down and reversing each row.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n\n```\n4 0 9 5 7 7 3 2\n8 9 7 7 5 5 0 6\n0 0 3 4 2 3 3 7\n7 1 6 5 0 4 1 5\n4 1 9 1 8 1 2 9\n4 5 1 5 5 6 9 6\n4 8 2 1 0 9 1 3\n0 4 3 6 2 1 8 8\n```\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n4 0 9 5 7 7 3 2\n8 9 7 7 5 5 0 6\n0 0 3 4 2 3 3 7\n7 1 6 5 0 4 1 5\n4 1 9 1 8 1 2 9\n4 5 1 5 5 6 9 6\n4 8 2 1 0 9 1 3\n0 4 3 6 2 1 8 8\n>>>"
