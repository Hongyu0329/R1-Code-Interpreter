    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 630 degrees clockwise, we need to first understand the effective rotation. A full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation. Therefore, rotating by 630 degrees is equivalent to rotating by \\(630 \\mod 360 = 270\\) degrees clockwise.\n\nRotating a matrix by 270 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise. The steps to achieve this are:\n1. Transpose the matrix.\n2. Reverse the order of columns.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to rotate the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_270_clockwise(matrix):\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed = list(zip(*matrix))\n    # Reverse the order of columns\n    rotated = [list(row)[::-1] for row in transposed]\n    return rotated\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 8, 1, 6, 4, 0, 6],\n    [1, 5, 9, 9, 1, 2, 3],\n    [8, 7, 7, 3, 3, 8, 0],\n    [2, 7, 9, 3, 6, 1, 0],\n    [7, 4, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2],\n    [1, 9, 5, 1, 8, 9, 6],\n    [3, 2, 9, 7, 5, 0, 2]\n]\n\n# Rotate the matrix\nrotated_matrix = rotate_270_clockwise(matrix)\n\n# Print the rotated matrix\nprint(rotated_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, which is the same as rotating it by 630 degrees clockwise. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the rotated matrix. The matrix was rotated by 270 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to rotating it by 630 degrees clockwise. \n\nHere is the final rotated matrix:\n\n<<<\n3 1 7 2 8 1 5\n2 9 4 7 7 5 8\n9 5 6 9 7 9 1\n7 1 1 3 3 9 6\n5 8 2 6 3 1 4\n0 9 1 1 8 2 0\n2 6 2 0 0 3 6\n>>>"
