    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of rotation on the matrix:\n\n1. **Understanding Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - A 180-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to two 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to three 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Rotation by 720 Degrees:**\n   - Rotating a matrix by 720 degrees is equivalent to rotating it by 360 degrees twice.\n   - Since a 360-degree rotation results in the matrix returning to its original orientation, a 720-degree rotation will also result in the matrix being in its original orientation.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that a 720-degree rotation results in the matrix being unchanged, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\n4. **Formatting the Output:**\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nNow, let's present the original matrix as the output:\n\n```\n3 1 9 1 6 7 5 1 7\n1 2 3 9 0 0 3 1 2\n9 8 4 2 6 9 6 3 9\n9 3 1 5 3 9 3 9 8\n7 4 4 3 8 7 8 3 8\n4 0 7 2 2 6 8 4 1\n7 5 1 1 4 7 1 9 1\n6 4 0 8 7 9 9 6 6\n7 4 1 2 7 0 5 4 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n3 1 9 1 6 7 5 1 7\n1 2 3 9 0 0 3 1 2\n9 8 4 2 6 9 6 3 9\n9 3 1 5 3 9 3 9 8\n7 4 4 3 8 7 8 3 8\n4 0 7 2 2 6 8 4 1\n7 5 1 1 4 7 1 9 1\n6 4 0 8 7 9 9 6 6\n7 4 1 2 7 0 5 4 0\n>>>"
