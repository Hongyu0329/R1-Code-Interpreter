    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of such a rotation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation**: \n   - A 360-degree rotation means the matrix will be rotated all the way around back to its original position. \n   - Therefore, a 360-degree rotation of a matrix results in the matrix remaining unchanged.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 square matrix. This is important to note because the rotation operation is defined for square matrices.\n\n3. **Matrix Representation**:\n   - The matrix is given as:\n     ```\n     4 6 0 3 3\n     6 9 0 4 5\n     2 0 4 1 5\n     0 1 6 5 6\n     1 6 8 9 4\n     ```\n\n4. **Rotation Analysis**:\n   - Since a 360-degree rotation results in the matrix being the same as the original, we do not need to perform any element swaps or transformations.\n\n5. **Output Format**:\n   - The output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified: <<<output matrix>>>\n\n6. **Final Output**:\n   - Since the matrix remains unchanged after a 360-degree rotation, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, with the matrix enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<\n4 6 0 3 3\n6 9 0 4 5\n2 0 4 1 5\n0 1 6 5 6\n1 6 8 9 4\n>>>"
