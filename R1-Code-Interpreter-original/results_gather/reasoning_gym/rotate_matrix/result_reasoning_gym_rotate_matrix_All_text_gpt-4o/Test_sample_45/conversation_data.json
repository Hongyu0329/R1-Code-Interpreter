    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the element at position (i, j) to position (j, n-1-i), where n is the size of the matrix.\n   - A 180-degree rotation is equivalent to two 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 270-degree rotation is equivalent to three 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 360-degree rotation returns the matrix to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Determine the Effective Rotation:**\n   - Rotating a matrix by 360 degrees results in the same matrix as the original.\n   - Therefore, rotating by 720 degrees (which is 2 full rotations) will also result in the matrix being the same as the original.\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation:**\n   - Since 720 degrees is equivalent to 0 degrees (or a full cycle), the matrix remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Format the Output:**\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n5 3 3 3 1 4\n7 8 9 3 2 8\n8 0 4 0 7 2\n3 8 6 2 5 5\n1 1 8 4 8 7\n3 3 3 1 1 3\n```\n\nAfter a 720-degree rotation, the matrix remains the same:\n```\n5 3 3 3 1 4\n7 8 9 3 2 8\n8 0 4 0 7 2\n3 8 6 2 5 5\n1 1 8 4 8 7\n3 3 3 1 1 3\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n<<<\n5 3 3 3 1 4\n7 8 9 3 2 8\n8 0 4 0 7 2\n3 8 6 2 5 5\n1 1 8 4 8 7\n3 3 3 1 1 3\n>>>"
