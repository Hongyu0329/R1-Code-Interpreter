    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to carefully analyze the requirements and the implications of a 0-degree rotation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is a 6x6 square matrix:\n     ```\n     6 7 4 1 4 5\n     0 1 7 0 1 4\n     1 4 0 9 1 2\n     4 2 3 6 1 9\n     6 2 0 0 2 5\n     4 5 5 1 6 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Understanding Rotation:**\n   - A rotation of 0 degrees means that the matrix remains unchanged. There is no transformation applied to the matrix elements.\n\n3. **Output Format:**\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the output matrix>>>.\n\n4. **Final Output:**\n   - Since a 0-degree rotation does not alter the matrix, the output will be the same as the input matrix.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe matrix after a 0-degree clockwise rotation is:\n\n```\n<<<\n6 7 4 1 4 5\n0 1 7 0 1 4\n1 4 0 9 1 2\n4 2 3 6 1 9\n6 2 0 0 2 5\n4 5 5 1 6 1\n>>>\n```"
