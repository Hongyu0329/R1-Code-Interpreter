    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of a 0-degree rotation. A 0-degree rotation means that the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Input Matrix:**\n   The input matrix is a 9x9 square matrix:\n   ```\n   4 5 3 7 5 1 8 5 3\n   8 1 2 5 1 5 5 3 3\n   1 5 9 9 6 1 1 9 5\n   6 0 3 5 4 6 1 3 7\n   4 9 7 2 4 9 3 8 9\n   1 6 9 1 8 7 6 8 8\n   2 7 9 8 4 1 5 8 2\n   0 5 0 9 6 7 8 3 2\n   9 1 2 4 6 3 5 0 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Understand the Rotation Requirement:**\n   - A 0-degree rotation means no change to the matrix.\n   - The matrix remains in its original form.\n\n3. **Output the Matrix:**\n   - The output should be formatted as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nGiven these points, the final output matrix is the same as the input matrix. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<\n4 5 3 7 5 1 8 5 3\n8 1 2 5 1 5 5 3 3\n1 5 9 9 6 1 1 9 5\n6 0 3 5 4 6 1 3 7\n4 9 7 2 4 9 3 8 9\n1 6 9 1 8 7 6 8 8\n2 7 9 8 4 1 5 8 2\n0 5 0 9 6 7 8 3 2\n9 1 2 4 6 3 5 0 8\n>>>"
