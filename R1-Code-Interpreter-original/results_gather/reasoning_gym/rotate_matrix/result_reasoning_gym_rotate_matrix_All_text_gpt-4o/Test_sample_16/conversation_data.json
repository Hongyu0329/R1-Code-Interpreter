    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of the rotation and how it affects the matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - A 180-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees twice.\n   - A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees three times.\n   - A 360-degree clockwise rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Rotation by 720 Degrees:**\n   - Rotating a matrix by 720 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 360 degrees twice.\n   - Since a 360-degree rotation results in the matrix returning to its original orientation, a 720-degree rotation will also result in the matrix being in its original orientation.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that a 720-degree rotation is equivalent to two full rotations (360 degrees each), the matrix will remain unchanged.\n\n4. **Output Format:**\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, as specified.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe matrix remains unchanged after a 720-degree clockwise rotation. Therefore, the output is:\n\n```\n<<<\n5 2 8 8 4 8 3 6 2 2\n1 7 3 3 8 8 8 2 7 3\n0 1 6 1 2 7 2 2 0 8\n4 5 5 1 3 4 4 0 9 4\n2 5 6 2 3 6 9 4 0 5\n1 4 9 4 9 7 1 1 3 2\n5 7 8 5 6 1 0 5 6 6\n5 0 9 6 7 6 9 4 2 5\n3 7 9 3 9 2 3 2 2 4\n9 6 9 8 8 6 9 6 0 7\n>>>\n```"
