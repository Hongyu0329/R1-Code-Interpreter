    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, we need to break down the task into manageable steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, a 90-degree clockwise rotation can be visualized as:\n     ```\n     [a, b]      [c, a]\n     [c, d]  =>  [d, b]\n     ```\n\n2. **Matrix Given:**\n   - The matrix provided is:\n     ```\n     [9, 9]\n     [7, 3]\n     ```\n\n3. **Rotation by 900 Degrees:**\n   - Rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 90 degrees clockwise 10 times (since 900 / 90 = 10).\n   - However, since a full 360-degree rotation returns the matrix to its original orientation, we only need to consider the remainder when 900 is divided by 360.\n   - 900 % 360 = 180, so we need to perform a 180-degree rotation.\n\n4. **Performing a 180-Degree Rotation:**\n   - A 180-degree rotation involves flipping the matrix such that the first row becomes the last row in reverse order, and the last row becomes the first row in reverse order.\n   - For the given matrix:\n     ```\n     Original:   [9, 9]\n                 [7, 3]\n     180-degree: [3, 7]\n                 [9, 9]\n     ```\n\n5. **Formatting the Output:**\n   - The final output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the final rotated matrix.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<[3, 7], [9, 9]>>>"
