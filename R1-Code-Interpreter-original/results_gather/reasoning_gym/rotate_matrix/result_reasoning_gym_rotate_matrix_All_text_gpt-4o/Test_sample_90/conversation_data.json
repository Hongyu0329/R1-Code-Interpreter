    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we need to break down the task into manageable steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - A 180-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to two 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to three 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Degrees of Rotation:**\n   - The problem asks for a 540-degree clockwise rotation.\n   - Since 540 degrees is equivalent to 1.5 full rotations (540 รท 360 = 1.5), we can simplify this to a 180-degree rotation (540 - 360 = 180).\n\n3. **Performing a 180-degree Rotation:**\n   - A 180-degree rotation can be achieved by reversing the order of the rows and then reversing the order of the elements in each row.\n   - Alternatively, it can be seen as flipping the matrix upside down and then flipping it left to right.\n\n4. **Applying the Rotation to the Given Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is a 10x10 matrix:\n     ```\n     3 9 4 1 5 3 7 9 2 1\n     4 7 3 8 6 6 2 5 4 7\n     1 6 1 8 7 9 1 8 9 7\n     4 5 9 0 8 5 6 6 2 5\n     6 1 7 1 9 0 0 3 7 6\n     4 5 7 9 3 0 3 9 5 7\n     1 7 5 9 1 3 0 7 1 5\n     1 4 4 9 8 3 6 9 9 3\n     3 2 2 6 5 5 7 2 6 5\n     0 6 1 8 9 6 2 0 7 2\n     ```\n   - Reverse the order of the rows:\n     ```\n     0 6 1 8 9 6 2 0 7 2\n     3 2 2 6 5 5 7 2 6 5\n     1 4 4 9 8 3 6 9 9 3\n     1 7 5 9 1 3 0 7 1 5\n     4 5 7 9 3 0 3 9 5 7\n     6 1 7 1 9 0 0 3 7 6\n     4 5 9 0 8 5 6 6 2 5\n     1 6 1 8 7 9 1 8 9 7\n     4 7 3 8 6 6 2 5 4 7\n     3 9 4 1 5 3 7 9 2 1\n     ```\n   - Reverse the order of elements in each row:\n     ```\n     2 7 0 2 6 9 8 1 6 0\n     5 6 2 7 5 5 6 2 2 3\n     3 9 9 6 3 8 9 4 4 1\n     5 1 7 0 3 1 9 5 7 1\n     7 5 9 3 0 3 9 7 5 4\n     6 7 3 0 0 9 1 7 1 6\n     5 2 6 6 5 8 0 9 5 4\n     7 9 8 1 9 7 8 1 6 1\n     7 4 5 2 6 6 8 3 7 4\n     1 2 9 7 3 5 1 4 9 3\n     ```\n\n5. **Formatting the Output:**\n   - The final rotated matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```\n<<<\n2 7 0 2 6 9 8 1 6 0\n5 6 2 7 5 5 6 2 2 3\n3 9 9 6 3 8 9 4 4 1\n5 1 7 0 3 1 9 5 7 1\n7 5 9 3 0 3 9 7 5 4\n6 7 3 0 0 9 1 7 1 6\n5 2 6 6 5 8 0 9 5 4\n7 9 8 1 9 7 8 1 6 1\n7 4 5 2 6 6 8 3 7 4\n1 2 9 7 3 5 1 4 9 3\n>>>\n```"
