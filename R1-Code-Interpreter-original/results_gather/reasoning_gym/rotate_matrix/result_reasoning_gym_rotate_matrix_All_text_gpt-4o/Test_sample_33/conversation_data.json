    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of the rotation:\n\n1. **Understanding 720 Degrees Rotation:**\n   - A full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n   - Therefore, a 720-degree rotation is equivalent to two full rotations (2 x 360 degrees).\n   - This means that after rotating the matrix 720 degrees, it will look exactly the same as the original matrix.\n\n2. **Matrix Representation:**\n   - The given matrix is an 8x8 matrix:\n     ```\n     4 4 8 3 7 7 8 7\n     8 5 6 3 1 8 7 4\n     3 7 9 0 4 1 2 8\n     2 1 2 5 5 9 5 9\n     3 3 6 7 7 0 2 0\n     5 4 5 4 0 2 6 1\n     4 8 0 2 2 9 8 6\n     6 2 8 6 5 3 3 4\n     ```\n\n3. **Final Output:**\n   - Since a 720-degree rotation results in the matrix being the same as the original, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\n4. **Formatting the Output:**\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n4 4 8 3 7 7 8 7\n8 5 6 3 1 8 7 4\n3 7 9 0 4 1 2 8\n2 1 2 5 5 9 5 9\n3 3 6 7 7 0 2 0\n5 4 5 4 0 2 6 1\n4 8 0 2 2 9 8 6\n6 2 8 6 5 3 3 4\n>>>"
