    "To rotate a square matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is an 8x8 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation by 180 Degrees**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 180 degrees clockwise is equivalent to flipping the matrix upside down and then reversing each row.\n   - This can also be thought of as reversing the order of the rows and then reversing the order of the elements in each row.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - **Reverse the Order of Rows**: The last row becomes the first row, the second last becomes the second, and so on.\n   - **Reverse Each Row**: After reversing the order of the rows, reverse the order of elements in each row.\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Start with the original matrix:\n     ```\n     8 8 1 2 6 3 4 0\n     3 1 9 0 1 2 8 4\n     6 9 6 5 5 1 5 4\n     9 2 1 8 1 9 1 4\n     5 1 4 0 5 6 1 7\n     7 3 3 2 4 3 0 0\n     6 0 5 5 7 7 9 8\n     2 3 7 7 5 9 0 4\n     ```\n   - **Reverse the Order of Rows**:\n     ```\n     2 3 7 7 5 9 0 4\n     6 0 5 5 7 7 9 8\n     7 3 3 2 4 3 0 0\n     5 1 4 0 5 6 1 7\n     9 2 1 8 1 9 1 4\n     6 9 6 5 5 1 5 4\n     3 1 9 0 1 2 8 4\n     8 8 1 2 6 3 4 0\n     ```\n   - **Reverse Each Row**:\n     ```\n     4 0 9 5 7 7 3 2\n     8 9 7 7 5 5 0 6\n     0 0 3 4 2 3 3 7\n     7 1 6 5 0 4 1 5\n     4 1 9 1 8 1 2 9\n     4 5 1 5 5 6 9 6\n     4 8 2 1 0 9 1 3\n     0 4 3 6 2 1 8 8\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - Enclose the final matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<\n4 0 9 5 7 7 3 2\n8 9 7 7 5 5 0 6\n0 0 3 4 2 3 3 7\n7 1 6 5 0 4 1 5\n4 1 9 1 8 1 2 9\n4 5 1 5 5 6 9 6\n4 8 2 1 0 9 1 3\n0 4 3 6 2 1 8 8\n>>>"
