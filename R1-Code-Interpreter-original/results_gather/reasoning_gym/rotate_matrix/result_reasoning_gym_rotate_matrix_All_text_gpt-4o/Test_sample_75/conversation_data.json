    "To rotate a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix. \n   - It has 5 rows and 5 columns.\n\n2. **Identify the Rotation Process**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves moving elements from one position to another in a specific pattern.\n   - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the size of the matrix.\n\n3. **Create an Empty Matrix for the Result**:\n   - We will create a new 5x5 matrix to store the rotated values.\n\n4. **Perform the Rotation**:\n   - Iterate over each element of the original matrix.\n   - For each element at position (i, j), place it in the new matrix at position (j, n-1-i).\n\n5. **Fill the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Start with the first row of the original matrix and place its elements in the last column of the new matrix, from top to bottom.\n   - Continue this process for each row, moving left to right in the original matrix and top to bottom in the new matrix.\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Ensure that all elements are correctly placed in the new matrix.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal Matrix:\n```\n9 9 6 7 4\n2 6 8 1 4\n4 9 0 4 5\n3 2 9 3 2\n8 2 3 5 1\n```\n\nRotated Matrix:\n- First row of the original becomes the last column of the new matrix:\n  - 9 -> (0, 4)\n  - 9 -> (1, 4)\n  - 6 -> (2, 4)\n  - 7 -> (3, 4)\n  - 4 -> (4, 4)\n\n- Second row of the original becomes the second last column of the new matrix:\n  - 2 -> (0, 3)\n  - 6 -> (1, 3)\n  - 8 -> (2, 3)\n  - 1 -> (3, 3)\n  - 4 -> (4, 3)\n\n- Third row of the original becomes the middle column of the new matrix:\n  - 4 -> (0, 2)\n  - 9 -> (1, 2)\n  - 0 -> (2, 2)\n  - 4 -> (3, 2)\n  - 5 -> (4, 2)\n\n- Fourth row of the original becomes the second column of the new matrix:\n  - 3 -> (0, 1)\n  - 2 -> (1, 1)\n  - 9 -> (2, 1)\n  - 3 -> (3, 1)\n  - 2 -> (4, 1)\n\n- Fifth row of the original becomes the first column of the new matrix:\n  - 8 -> (0, 0)\n  - 2 -> (1, 0)\n  - 3 -> (2, 0)\n  - 5 -> (3, 0)\n  - 1 -> (4, 0)\n\nThe rotated matrix is:\n```\n8 3 4 2 9\n2 2 9 6 9\n3 9 0 8 6\n5 3 4 1 7\n1 2 5 4 4\n```\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<\n8 3 4 2 9\n2 2 9 6 9\n3 9 0 8 6\n5 3 4 1 7\n1 2 5 4 4\n>>>"
