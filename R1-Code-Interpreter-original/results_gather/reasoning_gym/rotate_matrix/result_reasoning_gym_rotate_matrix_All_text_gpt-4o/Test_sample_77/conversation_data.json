    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation**: \n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the element at position (i, j) to position (j, n-1-i), where n is the size of the matrix.\n   - A 540-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 180-degree clockwise rotation because 540 degrees is 1.5 full rotations (540 = 360 + 180). Therefore, we only need to perform a 180-degree rotation.\n\n2. **180-degree Rotation**:\n   - A 180-degree rotation involves flipping the matrix such that the element at position (i, j) moves to position (n-1-i, n-1-j).\n   - This can be achieved by reversing the order of the rows and then reversing the order of the elements in each row.\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Given the matrix:\n     ```\n     3 7 7 8 0 1\n     3 8 7 4 9 8\n     1 3 7 8 4 6\n     2 4 8 8 5 1\n     8 2 0 5 9 3\n     2 9 2 6 7 2\n     ```\n   - Reverse the order of the rows:\n     ```\n     2 9 2 6 7 2\n     8 2 0 5 9 3\n     2 4 8 8 5 1\n     1 3 7 8 4 6\n     3 8 7 4 9 8\n     3 7 7 8 0 1\n     ```\n   - Reverse the order of elements in each row:\n     ```\n     2 7 6 2 9 2\n     3 9 5 0 2 8\n     1 5 8 8 4 2\n     6 4 8 7 3 1\n     8 9 4 7 8 3\n     1 0 8 7 7 3\n     ```\n\n4. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final rotated matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n2 7 6 2 9 2\n3 9 5 0 2 8\n1 5 8 8 4 2\n6 4 8 7 3 1\n8 9 4 7 8 3\n1 0 8 7 7 3\n>>>"
