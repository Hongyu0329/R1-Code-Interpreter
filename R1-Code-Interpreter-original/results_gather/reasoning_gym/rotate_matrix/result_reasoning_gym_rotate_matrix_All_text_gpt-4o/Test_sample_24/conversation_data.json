    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of such a rotation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding 360-degree Rotation**: \n   - A 360-degree rotation means turning the matrix around a full circle. \n   - After a full 360-degree rotation, the matrix will look exactly the same as it did initially. \n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - The given matrix is a 10x10 square matrix. \n   - Since the matrix is square, rotating it will not change its dimensions.\n\n3. **Rotation Effect**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 360 degrees clockwise results in the matrix remaining unchanged.\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\n4. **Output Format**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, as specified.\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - Since the matrix remains unchanged after a 360-degree rotation, we will output the matrix in the same format as the input.\n\nGiven these points, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n0 7 8 4 8 6 3 1 5 9\n1 5 4 9 3 0 9 3 0 9\n8 2 6 0 2 6 3 2 1 9\n3 8 3 7 2 6 2 1 3 8\n2 3 2 2 8 7 5 0 0 9\n5 0 9 0 8 8 1 9 7 6\n5 7 5 3 8 7 8 7 0 3\n2 5 7 2 0 3 4 2 9 4\n7 0 2 0 9 4 8 2 8 1\n0 9 4 9 6 3 0 8 7 8\n>>>"
