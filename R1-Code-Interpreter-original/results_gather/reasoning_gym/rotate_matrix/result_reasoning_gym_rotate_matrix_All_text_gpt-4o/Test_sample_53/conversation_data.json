    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 810 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n2. **Determine Effective Rotation:**\n   - Rotating a matrix by 360 degrees results in the same matrix. Therefore, we can reduce the number of rotations by taking the modulo of the given degrees with 360.\n   - Calculate \\(810 \\mod 360\\), which equals 90. This means rotating the matrix by 810 degrees is effectively the same as rotating it by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n3. **Perform the 90-Degree Clockwise Rotation:**\n   - Given the matrix:\n     ```\n     9 1 5 3 3\n     7 5 9 3 6\n     8 8 3 9 9\n     9 7 9 6 1\n     0 8 1 6 7\n     ```\n   - To rotate it 90 degrees clockwise:\n     - The first row `[9, 1, 5, 3, 3]` becomes the last column.\n     - The second row `[7, 5, 9, 3, 6]` becomes the second last column.\n     - The third row `[8, 8, 3, 9, 9]` becomes the middle column.\n     - The fourth row `[9, 7, 9, 6, 1]` becomes the second column.\n     - The fifth row `[0, 8, 1, 6, 7]` becomes the first column.\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix:**\n   - The resulting matrix after a 90-degree clockwise rotation is:\n     ```\n     0 9 8 7 9\n     8 7 8 5 1\n     1 9 3 9 5\n     6 6 9 3 3\n     7 1 9 6 3\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n<<<\n0 9 8 7 9\n8 7 8 5 1\n1 9 3 9 5\n6 6 9 3 3\n7 1 9 6 3\n>>>"
