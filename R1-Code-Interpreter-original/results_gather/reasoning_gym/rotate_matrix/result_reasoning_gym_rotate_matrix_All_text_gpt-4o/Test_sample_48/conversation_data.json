    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of such a rotation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n   - Therefore, a 900-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations plus an additional 180-degree rotation (since 900 = 2*360 + 180).\n\n2. **180-Degree Rotation:**\n   - A 180-degree rotation of a matrix involves flipping the matrix upside down and then reversing each row.\n   - This can be visualized as rotating the matrix twice by 90 degrees clockwise or simply flipping it.\n\n3. **Applying the 180-Degree Rotation:**\n   - Given the matrix:\n     ```\n     6 8 6 5 5 8\n     6 5 0 8 6 3\n     9 0 6 3 2 8\n     9 0 2 7 9 2\n     2 3 5 5 9 2\n     3 4 4 1 5 1\n     ```\n   - We first reverse the order of the rows:\n     ```\n     3 4 4 1 5 1\n     2 3 5 5 9 2\n     9 0 2 7 9 2\n     9 0 6 3 2 8\n     6 5 0 8 6 3\n     6 8 6 5 5 8\n     ```\n   - Then, reverse each row:\n     ```\n     1 5 1 4 4 3\n     2 9 5 5 3 2\n     2 9 7 2 0 9\n     8 2 3 6 0 9\n     3 6 8 0 5 6\n     8 5 5 6 8 6\n     ```\n\n4. **Final Output:**\n   - The matrix after a 900-degree clockwise rotation is:\n     ```\n     1 5 1 4 4 3\n     2 9 5 5 3 2\n     2 9 7 2 0 9\n     8 2 3 6 0 9\n     3 6 8 0 5 6\n     8 5 5 6 8 6\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n1 5 1 4 4 3\n2 9 5 5 3 2\n2 9 7 2 0 9\n8 2 3 6 0 9\n3 6 8 0 5 6\n8 5 5 6 8 6\n>>>"
