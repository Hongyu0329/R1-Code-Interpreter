    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of such a rotation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves moving the elements of the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - A 900-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise 10 times, as 900 divided by 90 equals 10.\n\n2. **Identifying the Pattern:**\n   - Rotating a matrix 360 degrees (or four 90-degree rotations) results in the matrix returning to its original orientation.\n   - Therefore, rotating a matrix 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it 900 mod 360 = 180 degrees clockwise (since 900 - 720 = 180).\n\n3. **180-Degree Clockwise Rotation:**\n   - A 180-degree rotation of a matrix is equivalent to flipping the matrix upside down and then reversing each row.\n   - For a 3x3 matrix, this means:\n     - The first row becomes the last row, reversed.\n     - The second row becomes the second row, reversed.\n     - The last row becomes the first row, reversed.\n\n4. **Applying the 180-Degree Rotation:**\n   - Given the matrix:\n     ```\n     4 7 7\n     2 5 1\n     2 9 3\n     ```\n   - After a 180-degree rotation, the matrix becomes:\n     - The first row (4, 7, 7) becomes the last row reversed (3, 9, 2).\n     - The second row (2, 5, 1) becomes the second row reversed (1, 5, 2).\n     - The last row (2, 9, 3) becomes the first row reversed (7, 7, 4).\n\n5. **Final Rotated Matrix:**\n   - The matrix after a 180-degree clockwise rotation is:\n     ```\n     3 9 2\n     1 5 2\n     7 7 4\n     ```\n\n6. **Formatting the Output:**\n   - The final output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<3 9 2\n1 5 2\n7 7 4>>>"
