    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of a 360-degree rotation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding 360-degree Rotation**: \n   - A 360-degree rotation means turning the matrix all the way around to its original position. Therefore, a 360-degree rotation results in the matrix looking exactly the same as it did initially.\n\n2. **Matrix Representation**:\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     3 4 7 8\n     8 2 9 8\n     5 8 7 7\n     4 1 4 6\n     ```\n\n3. **Rotation Analysis**:\n   - Since a 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\n4. **Output Format**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified: <<<the output matrix>>>.\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - The matrix after a 360-degree rotation is the same as the input matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n3 4 7 8\n8 2 9 8\n5 8 7 7\n4 1 4 6\n>>>"
