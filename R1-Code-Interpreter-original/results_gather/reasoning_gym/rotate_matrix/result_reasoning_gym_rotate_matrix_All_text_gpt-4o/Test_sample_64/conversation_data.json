    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 810 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation Requirement**: \n   - A full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n   - Therefore, 810 degrees can be simplified by finding the remainder when divided by 360.\n   - 810 รท 360 = 2 with a remainder of 90.\n   - Thus, rotating the matrix by 810 degrees is equivalent to rotating it by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n2. **Matrix Rotation by 90 Degrees Clockwise**:\n   - To rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to:\n     - Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n     - Reverse the order of elements in each row of the transposed matrix.\n\n3. **Transpose the Matrix**:\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     5 6 3 1 5 0 0\n     2 6 5 1 4 5 5\n     4 2 8 0 9 7 8\n     7 7 5 3 5 8 8\n     5 0 2 0 1 7 8\n     3 5 1 2 9 1 8\n     4 9 4 4 3 6 6\n     ```\n   - Transpose the matrix by swapping rows with columns:\n     ```\n     5 2 4 7 5 3 4\n     6 6 2 7 0 5 9\n     3 5 8 5 2 1 4\n     1 1 0 3 0 2 4\n     5 4 9 5 1 9 3\n     0 5 7 8 7 1 6\n     0 5 8 8 8 8 6\n     ```\n\n4. **Reverse the Order of Elements in Each Row**:\n   - Reverse each row of the transposed matrix:\n     ```\n     4 3 5 7 4 2 5\n     9 5 0 7 2 6 6\n     4 1 2 5 8 5 3\n     4 2 0 3 0 1 1\n     3 9 1 5 9 4 5\n     6 1 7 8 7 5 0\n     6 8 8 8 8 5 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final rotated matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n4 3 5 7 4 2 5\n9 5 0 7 2 6 6\n4 1 2 5 8 5 3\n4 2 0 3 0 1 1\n3 9 1 5 9 4 5\n6 1 7 8 7 5 0\n6 8 8 8 8 5 0\n>>>"
