    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Matrix Rotation\n- A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n- A 180-degree rotation is equivalent to two 90-degree rotations.\n- A 270-degree rotation is equivalent to three 90-degree rotations.\n- A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Effective Rotation\n- The problem asks for a 720-degree clockwise rotation.\n- Since 360 degrees is a full rotation, 720 degrees is equivalent to two full rotations (720 รท 360 = 2).\n- Therefore, a 720-degree rotation results in the matrix being in the same orientation as the original matrix.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Rotation\n- Given that a 720-degree rotation results in no change to the matrix, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\n### Step 4: Format the Output\n- The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe original matrix is:\n```\n3 2 4\n1 2 4\n1 5 7\n```\n\nAfter a 720-degree clockwise rotation, the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<\n3 2 4\n1 2 4\n1 5 7\n>>>"
