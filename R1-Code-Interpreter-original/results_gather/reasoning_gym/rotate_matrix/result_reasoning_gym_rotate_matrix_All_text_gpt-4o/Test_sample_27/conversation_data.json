    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of a 0-degree rotation. A 0-degree rotation means that the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Input Matrix:**\n   The input matrix is a 5x5 square matrix:\n   ```\n   1 7 0 2 4\n   0 9 0 7 6\n   7 8 4 2 9\n   5 2 8 1 1\n   5 0 5 4 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Understand the Rotation Requirement:**\n   - A 0-degree rotation means no change to the matrix.\n   - The matrix will remain in its original form.\n\n3. **Output the Matrix:**\n   - Since the matrix is not altered, the output will be the same as the input matrix.\n\n4. **Format the Output:**\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified: <<<...>>>\n\nNow, let's present the final answer:\n\n```\n<<<\n1 7 0 2 4\n0 9 0 7 6\n7 8 4 2 9\n5 2 8 1 1\n5 0 5 4 1\n>>>\n```"
