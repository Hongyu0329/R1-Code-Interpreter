    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. Let's break down the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Layout**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     9 2 2\n     6 7 7\n     7 7 4\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation by 90 Degrees Counterclockwise**:\n   - To rotate a matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - Let's apply this transformation step by step.\n\n3. **Transform Each Row to Column**:\n   - The first row `[9, 2, 2]` becomes the last column of the new matrix:\n     ```\n     ? ? 9\n     ? ? 2\n     ? ? 2\n     ```\n   - The second row `[6, 7, 7]` becomes the second-to-last column:\n     ```\n     ? 6 9\n     ? 7 2\n     ? 7 2\n     ```\n   - The third row `[7, 7, 4]` becomes the first column:\n     ```\n     7 6 9\n     7 7 2\n     4 7 2\n     ```\n\n4. **Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the transformation, the matrix rotated 270 degrees clockwise (or 90 degrees counterclockwise) is:\n     ```\n     7 6 9\n     7 7 2\n     4 7 2\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final step is to format the output matrix within triple angle brackets as specified:\n     ```\n     <<<7 6 9\n     7 7 2\n     4 7 2>>>\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the matrix rotated 270 degrees clockwise is:\n\n<<<7 6 9\n7 7 2\n4 7 2>>>"
