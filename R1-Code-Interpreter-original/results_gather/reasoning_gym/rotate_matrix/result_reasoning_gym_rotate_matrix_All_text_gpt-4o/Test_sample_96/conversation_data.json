    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation Requirement**: \n   - A full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n   - Therefore, rotating by 450 degrees is equivalent to rotating by \\(450 - 360 = 90\\) degrees clockwise.\n\n2. **Matrix Rotation by 90 Degrees Clockwise**:\n   - To rotate a matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, we need to:\n     - Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n     - Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\n3. **Transpose the Matrix**:\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     6 8 5 2 7\n     0 2 5 8 4\n     9 8 4 1 1\n     0 4 5 1 7\n     2 6 8 5 7\n     ```\n   - Transpose the matrix by swapping rows with columns:\n     ```\n     6 0 9 0 2\n     8 2 8 4 6\n     5 5 4 5 8\n     2 8 1 1 5\n     7 4 1 7 7\n     ```\n\n4. **Reverse Each Row of the Transposed Matrix**:\n   - Reverse each row to achieve the 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n     ```\n     2 0 9 0 6\n     6 4 8 2 8\n     8 5 4 5 5\n     5 1 1 8 2\n     7 7 1 4 7\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final rotated matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n2 0 9 0 6\n6 4 8 2 8\n8 5 4 5 5\n5 1 1 8 2\n7 7 1 4 7\n>>>\n```"
