    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of a 360-degree rotation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding 360-degree Rotation**: \n   - A 360-degree rotation means that the matrix will be rotated all the way around back to its original position. \n   - Therefore, a 360-degree rotation of a matrix results in the matrix looking exactly the same as it did initially.\n\n2. **Matrix Representation**:\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     9 8 0\n     5 7 8\n     1 7 9\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n3. **Applying the Rotation**:\n   - Since a 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\n4. **Formatting the Output**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified in the problem statement.\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - The matrix after a 360-degree clockwise rotation is the same as the input matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n9 8 0\n5 7 8\n1 7 9\n>>>"
