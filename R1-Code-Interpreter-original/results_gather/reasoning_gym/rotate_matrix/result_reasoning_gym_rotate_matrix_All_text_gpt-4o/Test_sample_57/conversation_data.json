    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of a 360-degree rotation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding 360-degree Rotation**: \n   - A 360-degree rotation means that the matrix will be rotated all the way around back to its original position. Therefore, the matrix will look exactly the same after a 360-degree rotation as it did initially.\n\n2. **Matrix Representation**:\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     9 4 2\n     5 1 2\n     6 5 3\n     ```\n\n3. **Analyzing the Rotation**:\n   - Since a 360-degree rotation results in the matrix returning to its original orientation, we do not need to change the positions of any elements. The matrix remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Output Format**:\n   - The output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified: <<<the output matrix>>>.\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - The matrix after a 360-degree rotation is the same as the input matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n9 4 2\n5 1 2\n6 5 3\n>>>"
