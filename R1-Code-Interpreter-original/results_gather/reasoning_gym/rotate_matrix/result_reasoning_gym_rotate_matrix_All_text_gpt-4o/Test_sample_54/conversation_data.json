    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     8 5\n     0 1\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Understand Rotation**:\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves moving the elements in such a way that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, a 90-degree clockwise rotation looks like this:\n     ```\n     Original:      8 5\n                    0 1\n\n     90-degree:     0 8\n                    1 5\n     ```\n\n3. **Calculate Effective Rotation**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 360 degrees results in the matrix returning to its original orientation.\n   - Therefore, rotating by 720 degrees (which is 2 full rotations) will also result in the matrix returning to its original orientation.\n   - Mathematically, 720 degrees is equivalent to 0 degrees of rotation (since 720 % 360 = 0).\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Since 720 degrees is effectively 0 degrees, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The output should be formatted as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8 5\n0 1>>>"
