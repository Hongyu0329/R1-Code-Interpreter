    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     4 1\n     6 4\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Identify the Rotation Process**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix.\n   - Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, the transformation can be visualized as follows:\n     - The element at position (0,0) in the original matrix moves to position (0,1) in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at position (0,1) in the original matrix moves to position (1,1) in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at position (1,0) in the original matrix moves to position (0,0) in the rotated matrix.\n     - The element at position (1,1) in the original matrix moves to position (1,0) in the rotated matrix.\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Based on the above transformation, the rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     6 4\n     4 1\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified:\n     - <<<6 4\n         4 1>>>\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the matrix is correctly rotated and formatted as required.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<6 4\n4 1>>>"
