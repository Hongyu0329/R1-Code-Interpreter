    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of a 360-degree rotation. A 360-degree rotation means that the matrix will return to its original orientation. Therefore, the matrix will look exactly the same after the rotation as it did before.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 6x6 square matrix. This is important because the rotation operation is defined for square matrices.\n\n2. **Rotation by 360 Degrees**: A 360-degree rotation means that the matrix will be rotated all the way around to its original position. In other words, the matrix will look the same after the rotation as it did before.\n\n3. **Matrix Elements**: Since the matrix will remain unchanged, each element in the matrix will stay in its original position.\n\n4. **Output Format**: The output should be formatted as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nGiven these points, the matrix after a 360-degree clockwise rotation will be the same as the original matrix. Therefore, the output matrix is:\n\n```\n1 8 7 9 2 7\n4 9 1 7 6 8\n8 3 7 1 0 4\n6 0 6 5 8 6\n7 8 6 2 0 4\n9 9 3 1 7 5\n```\n\nEnclosing this matrix within triple angle brackets, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n1 8 7 9 2 7\n4 9 1 7 6 8\n8 3 7 1 0 4\n6 0 6 5 8 6\n7 8 6 2 0 4\n9 9 3 1 7 5\n>>>"
