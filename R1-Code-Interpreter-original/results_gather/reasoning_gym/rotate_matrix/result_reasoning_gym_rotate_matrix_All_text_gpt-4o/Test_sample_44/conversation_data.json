    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 630 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation**: \n   - A full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n   - Therefore, 630 degrees is equivalent to 630 - 360 = 270 degrees clockwise.\n\n2. **Determine the Effective Rotation**:\n   - Since 270 degrees clockwise is equivalent to 90 degrees counterclockwise, we can rotate the matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise instead.\n\n3. **Matrix Rotation Logic**:\n   - To rotate a matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:\n     - Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n     - Reverse the order of the rows in the transposed matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Given the matrix:\n     ```\n     7 6 3 4 0 6 3\n     4 4 7 7 3 1 5\n     4 3 5 8 0 0 6\n     9 9 6 3 5 8 7\n     0 1 6 2 1 3 1\n     4 9 1 8 1 0 0\n     3 7 7 2 9 9 6\n     ```\n   - Transpose the matrix:\n     ```\n     7 4 4 9 0 4 3\n     6 4 3 9 1 9 7\n     3 7 5 6 6 1 7\n     4 7 8 3 2 8 2\n     0 3 0 5 1 1 9\n     6 1 0 8 3 0 9\n     3 5 6 7 1 0 6\n     ```\n   - Reverse the order of the rows:\n     ```\n     3 5 6 7 1 0 6\n     6 1 0 8 3 0 9\n     0 3 0 5 1 1 9\n     4 7 8 3 2 8 2\n     3 7 5 6 6 1 7\n     6 4 3 9 1 9 7\n     7 4 4 9 0 4 3\n     ```\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - The final rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     3 5 6 7 1 0 6\n     6 1 0 8 3 0 9\n     0 3 0 5 1 1 9\n     4 7 8 3 2 8 2\n     3 7 5 6 6 1 7\n     6 4 3 9 1 9 7\n     7 4 4 9 0 4 3\n     ```\n\nThe answer to the question is:\n<<<\n3 5 6 7 1 0 6\n6 1 0 8 3 0 9\n0 3 0 5 1 1 9\n4 7 8 3 2 8 2\n3 7 5 6 6 1 7\n6 4 3 9 1 9 7\n7 4 4 9 0 4 3\n>>>"
