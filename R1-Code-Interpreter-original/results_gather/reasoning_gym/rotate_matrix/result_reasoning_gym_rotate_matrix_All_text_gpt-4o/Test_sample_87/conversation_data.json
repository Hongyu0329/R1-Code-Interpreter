    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 810 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation Requirement**: \n   - A full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n   - Therefore, 810 degrees can be simplified by finding the remainder when divided by 360.\n   - 810 รท 360 = 2 with a remainder of 90.\n   - Thus, rotating the matrix by 810 degrees is equivalent to rotating it by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n2. **Matrix Rotation by 90 Degrees Clockwise**:\n   - To rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - Specifically, for a matrix element at position (i, j), it moves to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the size of the matrix.\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation to the Given Matrix**:\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     2 8 8 6 1 1\n     6 3 2 4 4 3\n     7 9 0 6 4 6\n     0 5 3 2 7 0\n     8 8 7 6 1 0\n     3 3 7 6 7 8\n     ```\n   - This is a 6x6 matrix.\n\n4. **Perform the 90-Degree Clockwise Rotation**:\n   - The first row [2, 8, 8, 6, 1, 1] becomes the last column.\n   - The second row [6, 3, 2, 4, 4, 3] becomes the second last column.\n   - Continue this process for all rows.\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     3 8 0 7 6 2\n     3 8 5 9 3 8\n     7 7 3 0 2 8\n     6 6 2 6 4 6\n     7 1 7 4 4 1\n     8 0 0 6 3 1\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<\n3 8 0 7 6 2\n3 8 5 9 3 8\n7 7 3 0 2 8\n6 6 2 6 4 6\n7 1 7 4 4 1\n8 0 0 6 3 1\n>>>"
