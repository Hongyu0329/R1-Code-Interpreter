    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation**: \n   - A 360-degree rotation of a matrix results in the matrix looking exactly the same as the original. \n   - Therefore, a 720-degree rotation, which is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, will also result in the matrix looking exactly the same as the original.\n\n2. **Matrix Representation**:\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     0 8 7 5 6 0\n     2 2 6 2 5 7\n     0 0 8 6 7 0\n     3 1 2 2 7 3\n     4 7 7 6 1 0\n     9 6 1 9 6 5\n     ```\n\n3. **Rotation Analysis**:\n   - Since a 720-degree rotation is equivalent to two 360-degree rotations, the matrix will remain unchanged.\n\n4. **Output Format**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - The matrix after a 720-degree rotation is the same as the original matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n0 8 7 5 6 0\n2 2 6 2 5 7\n0 0 8 6 7 0\n3 1 2 2 7 3\n4 7 7 6 1 0\n9 6 1 9 6 5\n>>>"
