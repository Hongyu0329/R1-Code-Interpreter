    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the concept of matrix rotation and how multiple rotations affect the matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n2. **Rotation by 900 Degrees:**\n   - Rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 90 degrees clockwise 10 times (since 900 / 90 = 10).\n   - However, due to the cyclical nature of rotations, rotating a matrix by 360 degrees results in the original matrix. Therefore, we only need to consider the remainder when 900 is divided by 360.\n   - 900 % 360 = 180. Thus, rotating the matrix by 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 180 degrees clockwise.\n\n3. **180-Degree Clockwise Rotation:**\n   - A 180-degree rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) results in the matrix being flipped both horizontally and vertically.\n   - This means the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (n-i-1, n-j-1) in the rotated matrix, where n is the size of the matrix.\n\n4. **Applying the 180-Degree Rotation:**\n   - Given the matrix:\n     ```\n     8 5 7 0 8\n     3 9 3 4 7\n     3 5 7 1 4\n     3 2 1 7 8\n     5 3 7 5 3\n     ```\n   - We will flip it both horizontally and vertically to achieve the 180-degree rotation.\n\n5. **Constructing the Rotated Matrix:**\n   - The rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     3 5 7 3 5\n     8 7 1 2 3\n     4 1 7 5 3\n     7 4 3 9 3\n     8 0 7 5 8\n     ```\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe matrix rotated by 900 degrees clockwise is:\n\n<<<\n3 5 7 3 5\n8 7 1 2 3\n4 1 7 5 3\n7 4 3 9 3\n8 0 7 5 8\n>>>"
