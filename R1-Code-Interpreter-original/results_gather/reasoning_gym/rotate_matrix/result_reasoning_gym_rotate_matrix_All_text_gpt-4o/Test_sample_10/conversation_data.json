    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we need to break down the steps and understand the rotation process:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - A 180-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees twice.\n   - A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees three times.\n   - A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Degrees of Rotation:**\n   - The problem asks for a 540-degree clockwise rotation.\n   - Since 540 degrees is equivalent to 1.5 full rotations (540 รท 360 = 1.5), we can simplify this to a 180-degree rotation (540 - 360 = 180).\n\n3. **Matrix Rotation by 180 Degrees:**\n   - To rotate a matrix by 180 degrees, each element in the matrix is moved to its diametrically opposite position.\n   - For a 3x3 matrix, this means:\n     - The element at position (0,0) moves to (2,2).\n     - The element at position (0,1) moves to (2,1).\n     - The element at position (0,2) moves to (2,0).\n     - The element at position (1,0) moves to (1,2).\n     - The element at position (1,1) remains in place.\n     - The element at position (1,2) moves to (1,0).\n     - The element at position (2,0) moves to (0,2).\n     - The element at position (2,1) moves to (0,1).\n     - The element at position (2,2) moves to (0,0).\n\n4. **Applying the 180-degree Rotation:**\n   - Start with the original matrix:\n     ```\n     0 4 3\n     3 2 1\n     8 1 9\n     ```\n   - After rotating 180 degrees, the matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     9 1 8\n     1 2 3\n     3 4 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Formatting the Output:**\n   - The final output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<9 1 8\n1 2 3\n3 4 0>>>"
