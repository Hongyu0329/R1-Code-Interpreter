    "To rotate a matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is an 8x8 square matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation by 180 Degrees**: Rotating a matrix by 180 degrees is equivalent to flipping it upside down and then reversing each row. This can be achieved by reversing the order of the rows and then reversing the order of the elements in each row.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - **Reverse the Order of Rows**: Start by reversing the order of the rows in the matrix. The first row becomes the last, the second row becomes the second last, and so on.\n   - **Reverse Each Row**: After reversing the order of the rows, reverse the order of elements in each row.\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Original Matrix:\n     ```\n     8 9 8 8 9 4 1 9\n     8 7 2 1 9 5 0 0\n     0 2 9 2 9 9 2 6\n     7 2 1 2 7 1 6 5\n     6 0 4 2 2 3 9 2\n     3 9 2 7 0 6 4 4\n     4 1 9 8 0 5 6 2\n     9 9 4 5 1 1 7 7\n     ```\n   - Reverse the order of rows:\n     ```\n     9 9 4 5 1 1 7 7\n     4 1 9 8 0 5 6 2\n     3 9 2 7 0 6 4 4\n     6 0 4 2 2 3 9 2\n     7 2 1 2 7 1 6 5\n     0 2 9 2 9 9 2 6\n     8 7 2 1 9 5 0 0\n     8 9 8 8 9 4 1 9\n     ```\n   - Reverse each row:\n     ```\n     7 7 1 1 5 4 9 9\n     2 6 5 0 8 9 1 4\n     4 4 6 0 7 2 9 3\n     2 9 3 2 2 4 0 6\n     5 6 1 7 2 1 2 7\n     6 2 9 9 2 9 2 0\n     0 0 5 9 1 2 7 8\n     9 1 4 9 8 8 9 8\n     ```\n\n5. **Final Output**: Present the rotated matrix enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n7 7 1 1 5 4 9 9\n2 6 5 0 8 9 1 4\n4 4 6 0 7 2 9 3\n2 9 3 2 2 4 0 6\n5 6 1 7 2 1 2 7\n6 2 9 9 2 9 2 0\n0 0 5 9 1 2 7 8\n9 1 4 9 8 8 9 8\n>>>\n```"
