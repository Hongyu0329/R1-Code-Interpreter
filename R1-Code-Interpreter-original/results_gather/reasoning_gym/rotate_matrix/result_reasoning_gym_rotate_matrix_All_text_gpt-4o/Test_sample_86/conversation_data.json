    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 810 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves moving the elements from the top row to the rightmost column, the rightmost column to the bottom row, the bottom row to the leftmost column, and the leftmost column to the top row.\n\n2. **Determine Effective Rotation:**\n   - Rotating a matrix by 360 degrees results in the same matrix. Therefore, we can reduce the number of rotations by taking the remainder of the total degrees divided by 360.\n   - 810 degrees % 360 degrees = 90 degrees.\n   - This means rotating the matrix by 810 degrees clockwise is effectively the same as rotating it by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n3. **Perform the 90-degree Clockwise Rotation:**\n   - Given the matrix:\n     ```\n     4 1 5 4\n     0 4 5 0\n     9 7 8 9\n     5 9 8 2\n     ```\n   - The steps to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise are:\n     - The first row `[4, 1, 5, 4]` becomes the last column from top to bottom.\n     - The second row `[0, 4, 5, 0]` becomes the third column from top to bottom.\n     - The third row `[9, 7, 8, 9]` becomes the second column from top to bottom.\n     - The fourth row `[5, 9, 8, 2]` becomes the first column from top to bottom.\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix:**\n   - After performing the 90-degree rotation, the new matrix will be:\n     ```\n     5 9 0 4\n     9 7 4 1\n     8 8 5 5\n     2 9 0 4\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<\n5 9 0 4\n9 7 4 1\n8 8 5 5\n2 9 0 4\n>>>"
