    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     4 0\n     7 8\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Understand the Rotation**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 450 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 450 % 360 = 90 degrees clockwise. This is because a full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation, so we only need to consider the remainder when 450 is divided by 360.\n\n3. **Rotation by 90 Degrees Clockwise**:\n   - To rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to:\n     - Take the first column of the original matrix and make it the first row of the new matrix, but in reverse order.\n     - Take the second column of the original matrix and make it the second row of the new matrix, but in reverse order.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     4 0\n     7 8\n     ```\n   - First column (4, 7) becomes the first row (7, 4) in the rotated matrix.\n   - Second column (0, 8) becomes the second row (8, 0) in the rotated matrix.\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix after 90 degrees clockwise rotation is:\n     ```\n     7 4\n     8 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<7 4\n8 0>>>"
