    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation**: \n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n   - Therefore, a 720-degree rotation, which is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, will also bring the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Matrix Representation**:\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     9 5 2 8\n     9 2 6 4\n     9 6 9 9\n     0 8 8 9\n     ```\n\n3. **Rotation Analysis**:\n   - Since 720 degrees is equivalent to two full rotations (2 x 360 degrees), the matrix will remain unchanged after the rotation.\n\n4. **Final Output**:\n   - The matrix after a 720-degree clockwise rotation will be the same as the original matrix.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n9 5 2 8\n9 2 6 4\n9 6 9 9\n0 8 8 9\n>>>"
