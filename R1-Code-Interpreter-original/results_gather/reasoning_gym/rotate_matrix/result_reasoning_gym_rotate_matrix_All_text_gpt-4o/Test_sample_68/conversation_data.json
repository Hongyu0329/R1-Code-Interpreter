    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. Let's break down the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Layout**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     7 7 2 6\n     5 6 8 1\n     8 1 1 7\n     4 0 3 5\n     ```\n   - This is a 4x4 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation by 90 Degrees Counterclockwise**:\n   - To rotate a matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - The transformation can be described as: \n     - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix moves to position (n-j-1, i) in the new matrix, where n is the size of the matrix.\n\n3. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Let's apply this transformation to the given matrix:\n     - Original first row: [7, 7, 2, 6] becomes the last column: [6, 1, 7, 5]\n     - Original second row: [5, 6, 8, 1] becomes the second-to-last column: [2, 8, 1, 3]\n     - Original third row: [8, 1, 1, 7] becomes the third-to-last column: [7, 1, 1, 0]\n     - Original fourth row: [4, 0, 3, 5] becomes the first column: [4, 5, 8, 7]\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the transformation, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     6 1 7 5\n     2 8 1 3\n     7 1 1 0\n     4 5 8 7\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix by 270 degrees clockwise is:\n\n<<<\n6 1 7 5\n2 8 1 3\n7 1 1 0\n4 5 8 7\n>>>"
