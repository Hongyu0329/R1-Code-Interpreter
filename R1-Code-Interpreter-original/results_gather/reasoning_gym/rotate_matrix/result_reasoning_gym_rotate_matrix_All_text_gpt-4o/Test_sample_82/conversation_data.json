    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation**: \n   - A 360-degree rotation of a matrix results in the matrix looking exactly the same as the original. \n   - Therefore, a 720-degree rotation, which is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, will also result in the matrix looking the same as the original.\n\n2. **Matrix Representation**:\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     9 1 5 3 9\n     0 2 8 8 8\n     4 9 1 8 5\n     5 1 1 7 6\n     1 9 8 4 5\n     ```\n\n3. **Rotation Analysis**:\n   - Since 720 degrees is equivalent to two full rotations (2 x 360 degrees), the matrix will remain unchanged after the rotation.\n\n4. **Output Format**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - The matrix after a 720-degree clockwise rotation is the same as the original matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n9 1 5 3 9\n0 2 8 8 8\n4 9 1 8 5\n5 1 1 7 6\n1 9 8 4 5\n>>>"
