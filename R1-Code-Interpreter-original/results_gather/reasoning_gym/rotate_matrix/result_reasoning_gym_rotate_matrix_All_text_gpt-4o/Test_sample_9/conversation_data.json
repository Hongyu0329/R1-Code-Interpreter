    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the concept of matrix rotation and how degrees of rotation translate into operations on the matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - A 180-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees twice.\n   - A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees three times.\n   - A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Degrees of Rotation:**\n   - Given that we need to rotate the matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we should first reduce this to an equivalent smaller rotation.\n   - 540 degrees is equivalent to 540 - 360 = 180 degrees, because a full 360-degree rotation returns the matrix to its original position.\n\n3. **Performing the 180-degree Rotation:**\n   - A 180-degree rotation can be achieved by reversing the order of the rows and then reversing the order of the elements in each row.\n   - Alternatively, it can be visualized as flipping the matrix upside down and then flipping it left to right.\n\n4. **Applying the Rotation:**\n   - Start with the given matrix:\n     ```\n     5 3 2 6 9 4 8 4\n     6 9 0 3 0 7 2 2\n     5 2 4 9 9 0 1 9\n     0 6 4 3 1 5 7 2\n     8 0 1 1 2 2 0 4\n     5 3 9 0 9 9 2 6\n     0 4 6 2 1 1 6 0\n     7 6 3 0 1 2 1 7\n     ```\n   - Reverse the order of the rows:\n     ```\n     7 6 3 0 1 2 1 7\n     0 4 6 2 1 1 6 0\n     5 3 9 0 9 9 2 6\n     8 0 1 1 2 2 0 4\n     0 6 4 3 1 5 7 2\n     5 2 4 9 9 0 1 9\n     6 9 0 3 0 7 2 2\n     5 3 2 6 9 4 8 4\n     ```\n   - Reverse the order of elements in each row:\n     ```\n     7 1 2 1 0 3 6 7\n     0 6 1 1 2 6 4 0\n     6 2 9 9 0 9 3 5\n     4 0 2 2 1 1 0 8\n     2 7 5 1 3 4 6 0\n     9 1 0 9 9 4 2 5\n     2 2 7 0 3 0 9 6\n     4 8 4 9 6 2 3 5\n     ```\n\n5. **Final Output:**\n   - The matrix after a 540-degree clockwise rotation is:\n     ```\n     7 1 2 1 0 3 6 7\n     0 6 1 1 2 6 4 0\n     6 2 9 9 0 9 3 5\n     4 0 2 2 1 1 0 8\n     2 7 5 1 3 4 6 0\n     9 1 0 9 9 4 2 5\n     2 2 7 0 3 0 9 6\n     4 8 4 9 6 2 3 5\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n7 1 2 1 0 3 6 7\n0 6 1 1 2 6 4 0\n6 2 9 9 0 9 3 5\n4 0 2 2 1 1 0 8\n2 7 5 1 3 4 6 0\n9 1 0 9 9 4 2 5\n2 2 7 0 3 0 9 6\n4 8 4 9 6 2 3 5\n>>>"
