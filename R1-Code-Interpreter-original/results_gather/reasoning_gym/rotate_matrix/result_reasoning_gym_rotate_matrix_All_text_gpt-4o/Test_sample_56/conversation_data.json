    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of the rotation degree and how it affects the matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - A 180-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees twice.\n   - A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees three times.\n   - A 360-degree clockwise rotation results in the matrix returning to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Rotation by 720 Degrees:**\n   - Rotating a matrix by 720 degrees is equivalent to rotating it by 360 degrees twice.\n   - Since a 360-degree rotation returns the matrix to its original state, rotating by 720 degrees will also return the matrix to its original state.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that a 720-degree rotation results in the matrix being in its original orientation, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\n4. **Formatting the Output:**\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe matrix after rotating 720 degrees clockwise is the same as the input matrix:\n\n<<<\n3 5 2 0 8 0 5 7\n2 3 1 2 9 2 7 6\n5 6 2 4 2 1 7 5\n0 2 3 7 3 3 2 0\n3 8 7 8 0 7 6 8\n6 7 8 1 7 2 6 0\n2 2 6 4 0 2 1 8\n8 1 6 4 5 3 6 5\n>>>"
