    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. Let's break down the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 5x5 square matrix. This means it has 5 rows and 5 columns.\n\n2. **Identify the Rotation Transformation**: Rotating a matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise involves:\n   - Transposing the matrix (converting rows to columns).\n   - Reversing the order of the rows in the transposed matrix.\n\n3. **Transpose the Matrix**: Transposing involves swapping the rows and columns. For a matrix element at position (i, j), it will move to position (j, i).\n\n4. **Reverse the Rows**: After transposing, reverse the order of the rows to achieve the 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.\n\n5. **Apply the Steps to the Given Matrix**:\n   - Original Matrix:\n     ```\n     1 4 4 6 0\n     2 6 3 7 6\n     8 0 3 2 5\n     6 5 6 2 2\n     5 5 0 3 1\n     ```\n\n   - Transpose the Matrix:\n     ```\n     1 2 8 6 5\n     4 6 0 5 5\n     4 3 3 6 0\n     6 7 2 2 3\n     0 6 5 2 1\n     ```\n\n   - Reverse the Rows:\n     ```\n     5 6 2 7 6\n     5 5 0 6 4\n     0 6 3 3 4\n     1 2 5 0 8\n     1 3 2 6 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final rotated matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n5 6 2 7 6\n5 5 0 6 4\n0 6 3 3 4\n1 2 5 0 8\n1 3 2 6 0\n>>>\n```"
