    "To rotate a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 7x7 square matrix.\n\n2. **Identify the Rotation Process**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the position of elements. Specifically, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the size of the matrix.\n\n3. **Create an Empty Matrix for the Result**:\n   - We will create a new 7x7 matrix to store the rotated values.\n\n4. **Perform the Rotation**:\n   - Iterate over each element of the original matrix.\n   - For each element at position (i, j), place it in the new matrix at position (j, n-1-i).\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After processing all elements, the new matrix will be the original matrix rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final rotated matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal Matrix:\n```\n8 9 0 4 2 3 4\n1 3 8 0 9 3 8\n0 8 5 7 2 5 2\n0 5 9 0 6 9 3\n2 5 6 7 1 0 3\n9 2 2 3 8 5 4\n9 0 4 5 3 6 0\n```\n\nRotated Matrix:\n```\n9 9 2 0 0 1 8\n0 2 5 5 8 3 9\n4 2 6 9 5 8 0\n5 3 7 0 7 0 4\n3 8 1 6 2 9 2\n6 5 0 9 5 3 3\n0 4 3 3 2 8 4\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n\n<<<\n9 9 2 0 0 1 8\n0 2 5 5 8 3 9\n4 2 6 9 5 8 0\n5 3 7 0 7 0 4\n3 8 1 6 2 9 2\n6 5 0 9 5 3 3\n0 4 3 3 2 8 4\n>>>"
