    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to carefully analyze the requirements and the implications of a 0-degree rotation.\n\n1. **Understanding the Rotation**: \n   - A 0-degree rotation means that the matrix remains unchanged. There is no actual rotation happening, so the output matrix should be identical to the input matrix.\n\n2. **Matrix Format**:\n   - The matrix is given in a specific format, with rows of numbers separated by spaces. We need to ensure that the output matrix maintains this format.\n\n3. **Output Requirements**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the output matrix>>>.\n\n4. **Steps to Solve**:\n   - Since a 0-degree rotation does not alter the matrix, we simply need to reproduce the input matrix as the output.\n   - Ensure that the matrix is formatted correctly with each row on a new line and numbers separated by spaces.\n   - Enclose the entire matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - Carefully format the matrix as described and enclose it within the required brackets.\n\nGiven these points, the final output matrix, which is identical to the input matrix, is:\n\n```\n<<<\n6 1 1 5 7 5 0 9\n2 9 5 5 4 5 9 4\n7 9 6 3 9 1 8 7\n2 6 8 3 0 6 5 8\n9 8 0 2 7 1 4 1\n2 7 1 1 6 4 2 5\n7 6 7 4 4 2 6 4\n2 5 1 3 8 9 3 4\n>>>\n```"
