    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to carefully analyze the requirements and the input format. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Format:**\n   - The input consists of a square matrix.\n   - The first line of the input specifies the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, \"3 3\" indicates a 3x3 matrix.\n   - The subsequent lines provide the elements of the matrix. Here, the matrix is:\n     ```\n     6 5\n     ```\n\n2. **Understand the Rotation Requirement:**\n   - Rotating a matrix by 0 degrees means that the matrix remains unchanged. There is no transformation needed.\n\n3. **Output Format:**\n   - The output should be the matrix in the same format as the input, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n4. **Steps to Solve:**\n   - Since the rotation is 0 degrees, the matrix remains the same.\n   - We need to format the output correctly by enclosing the matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Construct the Output:**\n   - The matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     6 5\n     ```\n   - Enclose the matrix within triple angle brackets to form the final output.\n\n6. **Final Output:**\n   - The final output should be:\n     ```\n     <<<6 5>>>\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the matrix is correctly rotated (or in this case, remains unchanged) and formatted according to the problem's requirements.\n\n**Answer:**\n<<<6 5>>>"
