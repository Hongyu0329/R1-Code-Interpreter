    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of a 0-degree rotation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     6 0 9\n     9 3 8\n     2 9 8\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n2. **Understanding Rotation by 0 Degrees**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 0 degrees means that the matrix remains unchanged. There is no transformation applied to the matrix elements.\n\n3. **Output Format**:\n   - The output should be in the same format as the input, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n4. **Final Output**:\n   - Since a 0-degree rotation does not alter the matrix, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\n5. **Constructing the Output**:\n   - We will format the matrix as required, ensuring it is enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the final output for the given problem.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```\n<<<\n6 0 9\n9 3 8\n2 9 8\n>>>\n```"
