    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the transformation that occurs during this rotation. A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. Let's break down the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     5 9\n     9 0\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation by 270 Degrees Clockwise**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 270 degrees clockwise is the same as rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n   - For a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation, the transformation involves:\n     - The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n     - The second row of the original matrix becomes the first column of the new matrix.\n\n3. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     [5, 9]\n     [9, 0]\n     ```\n   - After 90-degree counterclockwise rotation (or 270-degree clockwise):\n     - The first row `[5, 9]` becomes the last column `[9, 5]`.\n     - The second row `[9, 0]` becomes the first column `[0, 9]`.\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix will be:\n     ```\n     [9, 5]\n     [0, 9]\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the final rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<9 5\n0 9>>>"
