    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of such a rotation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation**: \n   - A 360-degree rotation means the matrix will end up in the same orientation as it started. This is because a full rotation brings every element back to its original position.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - The given matrix is a 7x7 square matrix. This is important because the rotation rules apply to square matrices, and the dimensions confirm that it is indeed square.\n\n3. **Rotation Analysis**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 90 degrees clockwise involves moving elements from one row to a column, effectively transposing and then reversing each row.\n   - A 180-degree rotation involves two 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 270-degree rotation involves three 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 360-degree rotation involves four 90-degree rotations, which returns the matrix to its original state.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since a 360-degree rotation results in the matrix being unchanged, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\n5. **Output Format**:\n   - The output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nGiven these points, the final answer is that the matrix remains unchanged after a 360-degree rotation. Therefore, the output matrix is:\n\n```\n<<<\n9 1 0 4 8 9 5\n4 2 5 2 2 1 6\n5 2 6 9 6 7 7\n3 2 9 4 8 4 0\n5 9 1 5 2 6 8\n8 9 7 9 8 6 9\n4 8 1 9 6 5 4\n>>>\n```"
