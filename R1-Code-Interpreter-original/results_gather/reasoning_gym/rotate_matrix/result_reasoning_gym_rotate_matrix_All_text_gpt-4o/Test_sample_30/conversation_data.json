    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a series of logical steps. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - A 180-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to two 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to three 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 360-degree clockwise rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Degrees of Rotation:**\n   - The problem asks for a 720-degree clockwise rotation.\n   - Since 720 degrees is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, the matrix will end up in the same orientation as it started.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Rotating the matrix by 720 degrees clockwise is equivalent to not rotating it at all, as it completes two full cycles.\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\n4. **Formatting the Output:**\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nGiven the input matrix:\n```\n1 3 7 4\n5 2 8 2\n2 0 4 2\n1 0 7 7\n```\n\nThe output matrix, after a 720-degree clockwise rotation, will be the same:\n```\n<<<\n1 3 7 4\n5 2 8 2\n2 0 4 2\n1 0 7 7\n>>>\n```\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<\n1 3 7 4\n5 2 8 2\n2 0 4 2\n1 0 7 7\n>>>"
