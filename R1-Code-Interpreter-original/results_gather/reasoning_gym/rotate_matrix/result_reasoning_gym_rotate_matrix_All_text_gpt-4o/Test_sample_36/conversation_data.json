    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of a 0-degree rotation. A 0-degree rotation means that the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation Requirement**: \n   - A 0-degree rotation means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains in its original form.\n\n2. **Input Matrix**:\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     8 1 9 9 3 6 7 4 5\n     7 8 5 2 8 1 0 8 7\n     1 5 0 1 9 2 3 3 0\n     8 6 7 8 6 8 2 8 0\n     9 2 9 9 5 2 1 0 7\n     6 9 4 1 3 6 6 6 6\n     1 4 6 2 0 0 6 6 2\n     3 1 5 5 4 9 9 3 7\n     6 7 7 8 8 7 6 4 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Output Matrix**:\n   - Since the rotation is 0 degrees, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix.\n\n4. **Format the Output**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - The output matrix is:\n     ```\n     <<<8 1 9 9 3 6 7 4 5\n     7 8 5 2 8 1 0 8 7\n     1 5 0 1 9 2 3 3 0\n     8 6 7 8 6 8 2 8 0\n     9 2 9 9 5 2 1 0 7\n     6 9 4 1 3 6 6 6 6\n     1 4 6 2 0 0 6 6 2\n     3 1 5 5 4 9 9 3 7\n     6 7 7 8 8 7 6 4 0>>>\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8 1 9 9 3 6 7 4 5\n7 8 5 2 8 1 0 8 7\n1 5 0 1 9 2 3 3 0\n8 6 7 8 6 8 2 8 0\n9 2 9 9 5 2 1 0 7\n6 9 4 1 3 6 6 6 6\n1 4 6 2 0 0 6 6 2\n3 1 5 5 4 9 9 3 7\n6 7 7 8 8 7 6 4 0>>>"
