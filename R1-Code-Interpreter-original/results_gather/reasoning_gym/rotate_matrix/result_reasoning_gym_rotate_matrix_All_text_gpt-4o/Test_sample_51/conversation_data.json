    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of the rotation:\n\n1. **Understanding 900 Degrees Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves moving the elements such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - A 900-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise 10 times (since 900 / 90 = 10).\n   - However, rotating a matrix 360 degrees (or any multiple of 360) results in the matrix returning to its original orientation.\n   - Therefore, 900 degrees is equivalent to 900 % 360 = 180 degrees. This means we need to rotate the matrix 180 degrees clockwise.\n\n2. **Rotating 180 Degrees Clockwise:**\n   - A 180-degree rotation can be achieved by reversing the order of the elements in the matrix both row-wise and column-wise.\n   - This means the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (n-i-1, n-j-1) in the rotated matrix, where n is the size of the matrix.\n\n3. **Applying the Rotation:**\n   - Given the matrix is 9x9, we will apply the 180-degree rotation to each element.\n   - We will create a new matrix of the same size and fill it according to the 180-degree rotation rule.\n\n4. **Constructing the Output:**\n   - After computing the rotated matrix, we will format it as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal Matrix:\n```\n7 1 2 6 0 0 3 3 2\n4 1 0 6 2 5 4 8 3\n7 3 7 2 0 0 0 7 5\n6 9 2 8 5 7 7 9 5\n7 3 2 6 8 8 2 9 2\n0 5 7 3 7 9 0 1 7\n9 8 6 2 3 4 4 1 5\n1 2 1 9 6 9 9 1 2\n4 7 4 5 6 7 2 9 5\n```\n\nRotated Matrix (180 degrees):\n```\n5 9 2 7 6 5 4 7 4\n2 1 9 9 6 9 1 2 1\n5 1 4 4 3 2 6 8 9\n7 1 0 9 7 3 7 5 0\n2 9 2 8 8 6 2 3 7\n5 9 7 7 5 8 2 9 6\n5 7 0 0 0 2 7 3 7\n3 8 4 5 2 6 0 1 4\n2 3 3 0 0 6 2 1 7\n```\n\nFinal output:\n```\n<<<\n5 9 2 7 6 5 4 7 4\n2 1 9 9 6 9 1 2 1\n5 1 4 4 3 2 6 8 9\n7 1 0 9 7 3 7 5 0\n2 9 2 8 8 6 2 3 7\n5 9 7 7 5 8 2 9 6\n5 7 0 0 0 2 7 3 7\n3 8 4 5 2 6 0 1 4\n2 3 3 0 0 6 2 1 7\n>>>\n```"
