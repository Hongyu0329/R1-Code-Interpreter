    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Rotation**: \n   - Rotating a matrix by 270 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n   - For a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - The given matrix is a 6x6 matrix, which means it has 6 rows and 6 columns.\n\n3. **Matrix Representation**:\n   - The matrix is represented as:\n     ```\n     3 1 8 1 5 8\n     4 4 5 7 0 8\n     8 2 2 0 4 2\n     7 9 3 2 2 2\n     8 3 2 6 0 3\n     8 5 9 3 4 9\n     ```\n\n4. **Rotation Process**:\n   - To rotate the matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise, we need to:\n     - Take the first row `[3, 1, 8, 1, 5, 8]` and make it the last column of the new matrix.\n     - Take the second row `[4, 4, 5, 7, 0, 8]` and make it the second last column of the new matrix.\n     - Continue this process for all rows.\n\n5. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The rotated matrix will be constructed as follows:\n     - Last column: `[3, 1, 8, 1, 5, 8]`\n     - Second last column: `[4, 4, 5, 7, 0, 8]`\n     - Third last column: `[8, 2, 2, 0, 4, 2]`\n     - Fourth last column: `[7, 9, 3, 2, 2, 2]`\n     - Fifth last column: `[8, 3, 2, 6, 0, 3]`\n     - First column: `[8, 5, 9, 3, 4, 9]`\n\n6. **Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The final matrix after rotating 270 degrees clockwise (or 90 degrees counterclockwise) is:\n     ```\n     8 9 2 2 3 9\n     5 3 3 9 2 5\n     9 2 2 3 5 8\n     3 6 0 2 7 1\n     4 0 4 2 0 8\n     9 3 2 2 8 8\n     ```\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - The output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n8 9 2 2 3 9\n5 3 3 9 2 5\n9 2 2 3 5 8\n3 6 0 2 7 1\n4 0 4 2 0 8\n9 3 2 2 8 8\n>>>"
