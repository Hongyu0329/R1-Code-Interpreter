    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Matrix Rotation\n- A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n- A 180-degree rotation is equivalent to two 90-degree rotations.\n- A 270-degree rotation is equivalent to three 90-degree rotations.\n- A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Effective Rotation\n- Rotating a matrix by 720 degrees is equivalent to rotating it by 720 % 360 = 0 degrees.\n- This means that a 720-degree rotation results in the matrix remaining in its original orientation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Given Matrix\nThe given matrix is:\n```\n3 2 4\n3 7 0\n0 1 5\n```\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Effective Rotation\nSince a 720-degree rotation is effectively a 0-degree rotation, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\n### Step 5: Format the Output\nThe output should be formatted as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe matrix after a 720-degree clockwise rotation is:\n```\n<<<\n3 2 4\n3 7 0\n0 1 5\n>>>\n```"
