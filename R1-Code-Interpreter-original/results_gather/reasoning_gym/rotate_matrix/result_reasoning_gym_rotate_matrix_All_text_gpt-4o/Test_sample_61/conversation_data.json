    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of such a rotation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation**: \n   - A 360-degree rotation means the matrix will end up in the same orientation as it started. This is because a full rotation brings every element back to its original position.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - The given matrix is a 9x9 square matrix. This is important because the rotation rules apply to square matrices, and the dimensions confirm that the matrix is indeed square.\n\n3. **Rotation Effect**:\n   - Since a 360-degree rotation results in no change to the matrix, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\n4. **Output Format**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, as specified in the problem statement.\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - We will present the matrix in the required format, ensuring that the matrix is displayed correctly.\n\nGiven these points, the final answer is simply the original matrix enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n```\n<<<\n9 5 1 1 5 2 2 6 1\n2 9 0 9 8 1 9 5 6\n1 1 3 3 7 2 9 4 9\n4 5 3 7 1 1 0 2 9\n1 1 1 4 0 3 9 3 9\n6 2 5 7 1 7 6 2 8\n2 8 1 4 5 9 1 8 0\n4 8 0 6 8 0 0 9 7\n0 0 8 6 2 8 4 8 2\n>>>\n```"
