    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of a 0-degree rotation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     9 9\n     9 1\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Understanding Rotation by 0 Degrees**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 0 degrees means that the matrix remains unchanged. There is no transformation applied to the matrix elements.\n\n3. **Output Format**:\n   - The output should be in the same format as the input, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n4. **Final Output**:\n   - Since a 0-degree rotation does not alter the matrix, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\n5. **Formatting the Output**:\n   - The matrix should be presented in the same row-column format as the input, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the final output for the given matrix rotated by 0 degrees clockwise.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n9 9\n9 1\n>>>"
