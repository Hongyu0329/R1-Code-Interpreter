    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 810 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation**: \n   - A full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n   - Therefore, 810 degrees can be simplified by finding the remainder when divided by 360.\n   - 810 รท 360 = 2 remainder 90. This means 810 degrees is equivalent to two full rotations (720 degrees) plus an additional 90 degrees.\n   - Thus, we only need to rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n2. **Matrix Rotation by 90 Degrees Clockwise**:\n   - To rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - Specifically, for a matrix element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, it will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the size of the matrix.\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Given the matrix:\n     ```\n     8 0 2 0 6 4\n     5 0 5 2 6 4\n     6 0 8 7 9 6\n     0 3 3 1 6 5\n     3 2 6 3 5 8\n     4 6 2 1 7 8\n     ```\n   - The size of the matrix (n) is 6.\n   - We will create a new 6x6 matrix and fill it by applying the 90-degree rotation rule.\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The first row of the original matrix `[8, 0, 2, 0, 6, 4]` becomes the last column of the new matrix.\n   - The second row `[5, 0, 5, 2, 6, 4]` becomes the second last column of the new matrix.\n   - Continue this process for all rows.\n\n5. **Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the rotation, the new matrix is:\n     ```\n     4 8 6 5 4 8\n     6 2 3 0 0 0\n     2 6 3 8 5 2\n     1 3 1 7 2 0\n     7 5 6 9 6 6\n     8 8 5 6 4 4\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```\n<<<\n4 8 6 5 4 8\n6 2 3 0 0 0\n2 6 3 8 5 2\n1 3 1 7 2 0\n7 5 6 9 6 6\n8 8 5 6 4 4\n>>>\n```"
