    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of such a rotation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding 360-degree Rotation**: \n   - A 360-degree rotation means turning the matrix around completely, which effectively brings it back to its original orientation. Therefore, a 360-degree rotation of a matrix results in the matrix itself.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - The given matrix is a 7x7 square matrix. This is important to note because the rotation operation is defined for square matrices.\n\n3. **Matrix Representation**:\n   - The matrix is represented as follows:\n     ```\n     1 6 8 7 9 5 4\n     8 6 6 9 0 6 0\n     1 0 4 7 8 0 5\n     9 6 3 3 8 8 5\n     7 3 0 8 5 5 9\n     5 8 9 3 3 0 2\n     5 1 5 9 6 8 8\n     ```\n\n4. **Output Format**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the output matrix>>>.\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - Since a 360-degree rotation results in the matrix itself, the output will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\n1 6 8 7 9 5 4\n8 6 6 9 0 6 0\n1 0 4 7 8 0 5\n9 6 3 3 8 8 5\n7 3 0 8 5 5 9\n5 8 9 3 3 0 2\n5 1 5 9 6 8 8\n>>>\n```"
