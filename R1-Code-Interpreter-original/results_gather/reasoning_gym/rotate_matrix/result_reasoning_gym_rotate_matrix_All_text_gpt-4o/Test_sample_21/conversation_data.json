    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 720 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the element at position (i, j) to position (j, n-1-i), where n is the size of the matrix.\n   - A 180-degree rotation is equivalent to two 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 270-degree rotation is equivalent to three 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Determine the Effective Rotation:**\n   - Since 720 degrees is equivalent to two full 360-degree rotations, the matrix will return to its original orientation.\n   - Therefore, rotating the matrix by 720 degrees clockwise results in the same matrix as the original.\n\n3. **Verify the Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     7 8 7 8 5\n     7 0 0 2 5\n     2 4 0 2 0\n     5 3 7 3 3\n     2 2 5 8 5\n     ```\n   - Since a 720-degree rotation is equivalent to no rotation, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\n4. **Format the Output:**\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we conclude that the matrix remains unchanged after a 720-degree rotation. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n7 8 7 8 5\n7 0 0 2 5\n2 4 0 2 0\n5 3 7 3 3\n2 2 5 8 5\n>>>"
