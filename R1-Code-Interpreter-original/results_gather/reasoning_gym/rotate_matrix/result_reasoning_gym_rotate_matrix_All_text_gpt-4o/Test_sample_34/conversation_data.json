    "To rotate a square matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Layout**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     4 6 3\n     7 4 4\n     8 1 7\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation by 180 Degrees**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 180 degrees clockwise is equivalent to flipping it upside down and then reversing each row.\n   - Alternatively, it can be seen as reversing the order of elements in the matrix as if it were a single list.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - **Flip the Matrix Upside Down**: Swap the first row with the last row, the second row with the second last row, and so on.\n     ```\n     8 1 7\n     7 4 4\n     4 6 3\n     ```\n   - **Reverse Each Row**: Reverse the order of elements in each row.\n     - First row: `8 1 7` becomes `7 1 8`\n     - Second row: `7 4 4` becomes `4 4 7`\n     - Third row: `4 6 3` becomes `3 6 4`\n\n4. **Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After performing the above transformations, the matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     7 1 8\n     4 4 7\n     3 6 4\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the matrix rotated by 180 degrees clockwise is:\n\n<<<\n7 1 8\n4 4 7\n3 6 4\n>>>"
