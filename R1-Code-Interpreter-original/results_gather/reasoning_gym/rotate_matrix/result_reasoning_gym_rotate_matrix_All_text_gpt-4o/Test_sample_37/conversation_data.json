    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - For a 450-degree rotation, we need to determine how many 90-degree rotations are equivalent to 450 degrees.\n\n2. **Calculate the Effective Rotation:**\n   - Since 450 degrees is more than a full 360-degree rotation, we can simplify the problem by finding the equivalent rotation within a single 360-degree cycle.\n   - 450 degrees modulo 360 degrees gives us 90 degrees (450 % 360 = 90).\n   - Therefore, rotating the matrix by 450 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n3. **Perform the 90-Degree Clockwise Rotation:**\n   - Given the matrix:\n     ```\n     1 2\n     1 9\n     ```\n   - To rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise:\n     - The first row `[1, 2]` becomes the last column `[1, 2]`.\n     - The second row `[1, 9]` becomes the first column `[9, 1]`.\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix:**\n   - After performing the 90-degree clockwise rotation, the matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     1 1\n     9 2\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<1 1\n9 2>>>"
