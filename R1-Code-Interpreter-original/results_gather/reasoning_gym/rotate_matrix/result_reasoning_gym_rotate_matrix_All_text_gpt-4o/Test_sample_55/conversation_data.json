    "To rotate a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     3 8 1 4\n     5 8 5 1\n     5 0 4 6\n     1 7 8 9\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify the Rotation Process**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the original matrix into columns of the new matrix. Specifically, the first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the new matrix, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - **First Row to Last Column**:\n     - Original first row: `3 8 1 4`\n     - Becomes the last column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       ? ? ? 3\n       ? ? ? 8\n       ? ? ? 1\n       ? ? ? 4\n       ```\n   - **Second Row to Second Last Column**:\n     - Original second row: `5 8 5 1`\n     - Becomes the second last column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       ? ? 5 3\n       ? ? 8 8\n       ? ? 5 1\n       ? ? 1 4\n       ```\n   - **Third Row to Third Last Column**:\n     - Original third row: `5 0 4 6`\n     - Becomes the third last column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       ? 5 5 3\n       ? 0 8 8\n       ? 4 5 1\n       ? 6 1 4\n       ```\n   - **Fourth Row to First Column**:\n     - Original fourth row: `1 7 8 9`\n     - Becomes the first column of the new matrix:\n       ```\n       1 5 5 3\n       7 0 8 8\n       8 4 5 1\n       9 6 1 4\n       ```\n\n4. **Final Output**:\n   - The rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     1 5 5 3\n     7 0 8 8\n     8 4 5 1\n     9 6 1 4\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - Enclose the matrix within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n<<<\n1 5 5 3\n7 0 8 8\n8 4 5 1\n9 6 1 4\n>>>"
