    "To rotate a square matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 6x6 square matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation by 180 Degrees**: Rotating a matrix by 180 degrees clockwise is equivalent to flipping it upside down and then reversing each row. This can also be thought of as rotating it twice by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - **Flip the Matrix Upside Down**: This means reversing the order of the rows.\n   - **Reverse Each Row**: After flipping the matrix, reverse the elements in each row.\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Start with the original matrix:\n     ```\n     0 7 0 8 5 3\n     7 7 8 5 9 2\n     8 4 8 7 6 5\n     9 3 2 7 0 8\n     0 2 0 7 8 4\n     8 1 0 3 3 6\n     ```\n   - Flip the matrix upside down:\n     ```\n     8 1 0 3 3 6\n     0 2 0 7 8 4\n     9 3 2 7 0 8\n     8 4 8 7 6 5\n     7 7 8 5 9 2\n     0 7 0 8 5 3\n     ```\n   - Reverse each row:\n     ```\n     6 3 3 0 1 8\n     4 8 7 0 2 0\n     8 0 7 2 3 9\n     5 6 7 8 4 8\n     2 9 5 8 7 7\n     3 5 8 0 7 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The final rotated matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n6 3 3 0 1 8\n4 8 7 0 2 0\n8 0 7 2 3 9\n5 6 7 8 4 8\n2 9 5 8 7 7\n3 5 8 0 7 0\n>>>"
