    "To solve the problem of rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, we need to break down the steps and analyze the requirements carefully.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     4 2\n     7 5\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Understanding Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves moving the elements in such a way that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - For a 2x2 matrix, a 90-degree clockwise rotation would transform the matrix as follows:\n     ```\n     Original:      Rotated 90 degrees:\n     4 2            7 4\n     7 5            5 2\n     ```\n\n3. **Calculating 900 Degrees Rotation:**\n   - Rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 900 mod 360 degrees, because a full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n   - 900 mod 360 = 180 degrees.\n   - Therefore, rotating the matrix by 900 degrees clockwise is the same as rotating it by 180 degrees clockwise.\n\n4. **Performing 180 Degrees Rotation:**\n   - A 180-degree rotation involves flipping the matrix such that the first row becomes the last row in reverse order, and the last row becomes the first row in reverse order.\n   - For the given 2x2 matrix, a 180-degree rotation would transform it as follows:\n     ```\n     Original:      Rotated 180 degrees:\n     4 2            5 7\n     7 5            2 4\n     ```\n\n5. **Formatting the Output:**\n   - The final rotated matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified in the problem statement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe matrix rotated by 900 degrees clockwise is:\n\n<<<\n5 7\n2 4\n>>>"
