    "To rotate a square matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is an 8x8 square matrix. This means it has 8 rows and 8 columns.\n\n2. **Identify the Rotation Process**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the position of elements such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Matrix Index Mapping**:\n   - For a given element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, its new position in the rotated matrix will be (j, n-1-i), where n is the size of the matrix (in this case, 8).\n\n4. **Create the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Initialize an empty matrix of the same size (8x8).\n   - Iterate over each element of the original matrix and place it in its new position in the rotated matrix using the index mapping.\n\n5. **Fill the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Start with the first row of the original matrix and place its elements in the last column of the rotated matrix.\n   - Continue this process for each row, moving from top to bottom in the original matrix and filling from right to left in the rotated matrix.\n\n6. **Output the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Format the rotated matrix as required, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal Matrix:\n```\n6 3 9 2 3 3 2 1\n4 6 8 8 1 9 7 3\n6 9 9 3 5 6 3 2\n7 2 9 5 1 8 1 7\n5 6 0 4 8 0 6 3\n5 8 1 7 8 3 9 7\n0 5 2 3 2 7 9 2\n8 2 0 1 0 2 7 6\n```\n\nRotated Matrix:\n```\n8 0 5 5 7 6 4 6\n2 5 8 6 2 9 6 3\n0 2 1 0 9 9 8 9\n1 3 7 4 5 3 8 2\n0 2 8 1 1 5 1 3\n2 7 3 8 8 6 9 3\n7 9 9 0 1 3 7 2\n6 2 7 3 7 2 3 1\n```\n\nTherefore, the final rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<\n8 0 5 5 7 6 4 6\n2 5 8 6 2 9 6 3\n0 2 1 0 9 9 8 9\n1 3 7 4 5 3 8 2\n0 2 8 1 1 5 1 3\n2 7 3 8 8 6 9 3\n7 9 9 0 1 3 7 2\n6 2 7 3 7 2 3 1\n>>>"
