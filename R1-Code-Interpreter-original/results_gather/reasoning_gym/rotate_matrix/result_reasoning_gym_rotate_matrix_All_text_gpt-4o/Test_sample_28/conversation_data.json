    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 6x6 square matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation by 270 Degrees Clockwise**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 270 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n   - Alternatively, it can be seen as rotating the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise three times.\n\n3. **Steps to Rotate 90 Degrees Clockwise**:\n   - Transpose the matrix: Swap rows with columns.\n   - Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the 90-Degree Clockwise Rotation Three Times**:\n   - We will perform the 90-degree clockwise rotation three times to achieve a 270-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n5. **Matrix Transposition**:\n   - Swap the element at position (i, j) with the element at position (j, i).\n\n6. **Reverse Rows**:\n   - After transposing, reverse each row to complete the 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n7. **Repeat the Process**:\n   - Perform the above two steps (transpose and reverse rows) three times.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n**Original Matrix**:\n```\n4 9 2 4 3 7\n7 5 0 1 2 2\n6 0 3 0 6 2\n2 4 9 2 8 9\n8 9 0 9 9 1\n4 2 0 9 3 4\n```\n\n**First 90-Degree Clockwise Rotation**:\n1. Transpose the matrix.\n2. Reverse each row.\n\n**Second 90-Degree Clockwise Rotation**:\n1. Transpose the resulting matrix.\n2. Reverse each row.\n\n**Third 90-Degree Clockwise Rotation**:\n1. Transpose the resulting matrix.\n2. Reverse each row.\n\nAfter performing these operations, the final matrix after a 270-degree clockwise rotation is:\n\n```\n7 2 2 9 1 4\n3 2 8 6 2 3\n4 9 0 0 0 2\n9 9 2 3 6 7\n9 0 9 0 2 9\n8 6 7 4 4 4\n```\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<\n7 2 2 9 1 4\n3 2 8 6 2 3\n4 9 0 0 0 2\n9 9 2 3 6 7\n9 0 9 0 2 9\n8 6 7 4 4 4\n>>>"
