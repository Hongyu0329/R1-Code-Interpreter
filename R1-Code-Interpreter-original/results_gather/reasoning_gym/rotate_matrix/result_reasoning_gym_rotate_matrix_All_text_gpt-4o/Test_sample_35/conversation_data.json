    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 360 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of a 360-degree rotation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation**:\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves moving elements from the top row to the rightmost column, elements from the rightmost column to the bottom row, elements from the bottom row to the leftmost column, and elements from the leftmost column to the top row.\n   - A 180-degree rotation is equivalent to performing a 90-degree rotation twice.\n   - A 270-degree rotation is equivalent to performing a 90-degree rotation three times.\n   - A 360-degree rotation is equivalent to performing a 90-degree rotation four times.\n\n2. **Effect of a 360-degree Rotation**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 360 degrees means that each element returns to its original position. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Matrix Analysis**:\n   - Given matrix:\n     ```\n     1 6 7\n     6 4 9\n     6 7 9\n     ```\n   - Since a 360-degree rotation does not alter the matrix, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\n4. **Output Format**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - The matrix remains the same after a 360-degree rotation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n1 6 7\n6 4 9\n6 7 9\n>>>"
