    "To rotate a square matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 7x7 square matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation by 180 Degrees**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 180 degrees clockwise is equivalent to flipping it upside down and then reversing each row.\n   - This can also be thought of as rotating the matrix twice by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - **Flip the Matrix Upside Down**: Reverse the order of the rows.\n   - **Reverse Each Row**: After flipping, reverse the order of elements in each row.\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Start with the original matrix:\n     ```\n     9 0 5 6 0 7 4\n     8 1 7 3 6 0 5\n     0 0 6 4 5 0 7\n     3 8 2 6 2 9 8\n     3 4 9 8 2 3 8\n     3 6 8 1 8 2 6\n     2 5 7 2 4 8 1\n     ```\n   - **Flip the Matrix Upside Down**:\n     ```\n     2 5 7 2 4 8 1\n     3 6 8 1 8 2 6\n     3 4 9 8 2 3 8\n     3 8 2 6 2 9 8\n     0 0 6 4 5 0 7\n     8 1 7 3 6 0 5\n     9 0 5 6 0 7 4\n     ```\n   - **Reverse Each Row**:\n     ```\n     1 8 4 2 7 5 2\n     6 2 8 1 8 6 3\n     8 3 2 8 9 4 3\n     8 9 2 6 2 8 3\n     7 0 5 4 6 0 0\n     5 0 6 3 7 1 8\n     4 7 0 6 5 0 9\n     ```\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - The matrix after a 180-degree clockwise rotation is:\n     ```\n     1 8 4 2 7 5 2\n     6 2 8 1 8 6 3\n     8 3 2 8 9 4 3\n     8 9 2 6 2 8 3\n     7 0 5 4 6 0 0\n     5 0 6 3 7 1 8\n     4 7 0 6 5 0 9\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<\n1 8 4 2 7 5 2\n6 2 8 1 8 6 3\n8 3 2 8 9 4 3\n8 9 2 6 2 8 3\n7 0 5 4 6 0 0\n5 0 6 3 7 1 8\n4 7 0 6 5 0 9\n>>>"
