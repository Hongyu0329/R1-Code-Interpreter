    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Rotation**: \n   - Rotating a matrix by 270 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n   - Alternatively, it can be seen as rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise three times.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**:\n   - The given matrix is a 7x7 square matrix.\n\n3. **Rotation Process**:\n   - To rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix moves to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the size of the matrix.\n   - For a 270-degree clockwise rotation, we can apply the 90-degree clockwise rotation three times.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Rotation**:\n   - **First 90-degree Clockwise Rotation**:\n     - The first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - **Second 90-degree Clockwise Rotation**:\n     - Apply the same transformation to the result of the first rotation.\n   - **Third 90-degree Clockwise Rotation**:\n     - Apply the same transformation to the result of the second rotation.\n\n5. **Perform the Rotations**:\n   - Let's perform the rotations step by step on the given matrix.\n\n**Original Matrix**:\n```\n0 0 4 1 0 8 2\n3 4 6 5 8 4 8\n1 9 6 7 6 5 6\n3 6 2 1 8 7 3\n8 4 2 7 9 5 8\n2 0 9 6 7 2 3\n6 5 3 7 4 9 0\n```\n\n**After First 90-degree Clockwise Rotation**:\n```\n6 2 8 3 1 3 0\n5 0 4 6 9 4 0\n3 9 2 2 6 6 4\n7 6 7 1 7 5 1\n4 7 9 8 6 8 0\n9 2 5 7 5 4 8\n0 3 8 3 6 8 2\n```\n\n**After Second 90-degree Clockwise Rotation**:\n```\n0 9 4 7 3 5 6\n3 2 7 6 9 0 2\n8 5 9 7 2 4 8\n3 7 8 1 2 6 3\n6 5 6 7 6 9 1\n8 4 8 5 7 6 3\n2 8 0 1 4 0 0\n```\n\n**After Third 90-degree Clockwise Rotation (Final 270-degree Clockwise Rotation)**:\n```\n2 8 0 3 6 8 0\n8 4 5 7 5 0 0\n0 8 6 8 6 4 4\n1 5 7 1 7 2 6\n4 7 8 2 6 9 1\n0 6 2 6 9 0 3\n0 3 3 3 1 8 2\n```\n\n6. **Output the Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - The final matrix after a 270-degree clockwise rotation is:\n\n```\n<<<\n2 8 0 3 6 8 0\n8 4 5 7 5 0 0\n0 8 6 8 6 4 4\n1 5 7 1 7 2 6\n4 7 8 2 6 9 1\n0 6 2 6 9 0 3\n0 3 3 3 1 8 2\n>>>\n```\n\nThis is the matrix rotated 270 degrees clockwise."
