    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to understand what a 0-degree rotation means. A 0-degree rotation implies that the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\nLet's go through the steps to ensure we understand the process:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input is a 9x9 square matrix. Each row contains 9 elements, and there are 9 such rows.\n\n2. **Rotation by 0 Degrees**: Rotating a matrix by 0 degrees means that the matrix remains in its original orientation. There is no change in the position of any elements.\n\n3. **Output Format**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the output matrix>>>.\n\n4. **Construct the Output**: Since the matrix remains unchanged, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nNow, let's write down the output matrix in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\n1 9 6 8 0 3 4 3 2\n1 6 7 3 0 1 6 0 1\n2 1 9 0 9 4 3 8 3\n1 0 7 6 3 4 2 8 6\n5 8 4 5 7 8 2 0 0\n3 7 2 3 3 0 4 3 3\n0 4 1 2 4 3 9 3 3\n2 9 4 6 7 4 5 2 4\n2 2 4 0 2 0 1 1 8\n>>>\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n1 9 6 8 0 3 4 3 2\n1 6 7 3 0 1 6 0 1\n2 1 9 0 9 4 3 8 3\n1 0 7 6 3 4 2 8 6\n5 8 4 5 7 8 2 0 0\n3 7 2 3 3 0 4 3 3\n0 4 1 2 4 3 9 3 3\n2 9 4 6 7 4 5 2 4\n2 2 4 0 2 0 1 1 8\n>>>"
