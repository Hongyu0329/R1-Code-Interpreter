    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 630 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation**: \n   - A full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n   - 630 degrees is equivalent to 630 - 360 = 270 degrees clockwise because 630 degrees is 1 full rotation (360 degrees) plus an additional 270 degrees.\n\n2. **Determine the Effective Rotation**:\n   - Since 630 degrees is effectively 270 degrees clockwise, we need to rotate the matrix by 270 degrees clockwise.\n\n3. **Matrix Rotation by 270 Degrees Clockwise**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 270 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n   - To rotate a matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:\n     - Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n     - Reverse the order of the rows in the transposed matrix.\n\n4. **Apply the Rotation to the Given Matrix**:\n   - Start with the given matrix:\n     ```\n     5 8 1 6 4 0 6\n     1 5 9 9 1 2 3\n     8 7 7 3 3 8 0\n     2 7 9 3 6 1 0\n     7 4 6 1 2 1 2\n     1 9 5 1 8 9 6\n     3 2 9 7 5 0 2\n     ```\n\n   - **Transpose the Matrix**:\n     ```\n     5 1 8 2 7 1 3\n     8 5 7 7 4 9 2\n     1 9 7 9 6 5 9\n     6 9 3 3 1 1 7\n     4 1 3 6 2 8 5\n     0 2 8 1 1 9 0\n     6 3 0 0 2 6 2\n     ```\n\n   - **Reverse the Order of the Rows**:\n     ```\n     6 3 0 0 2 6 2\n     0 2 8 1 1 9 0\n     4 1 3 6 2 8 5\n     6 9 3 3 1 1 7\n     1 9 7 9 6 5 9\n     8 5 7 7 4 9 2\n     5 1 8 2 7 1 3\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final rotated matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n6 3 0 0 2 6 2\n0 2 8 1 1 9 0\n4 1 3 6 2 8 5\n6 9 3 3 1 1 7\n1 9 7 9 6 5 9\n8 5 7 7 4 9 2\n5 1 8 2 7 1 3\n>>>"
