    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to carefully analyze the requirements and the implications of a 0-degree rotation.\n\n1. **Understanding the Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is a 9x9 square matrix. \n   - A square matrix has the same number of rows and columns.\n\n2. **Rotation by 0 Degrees**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 0 degrees means that the matrix remains unchanged.\n   - Therefore, the output matrix should be identical to the input matrix.\n\n3. **Output Format**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the output matrix>>>.\n   - The matrix should be presented in the same format as the input, with each row on a new line.\n\n4. **Final Output**:\n   - Since the matrix is not altered by a 0-degree rotation, we simply need to format the original matrix according to the specified output format.\n\nGiven these points, the final answer is:\n\n```\n<<<\n7 4 4 7 1 6 1 1 3\n4 1 4 9 0 3 2 5 3\n4 9 0 0 9 2 3 9 8\n6 6 5 7 3 1 0 0 5\n9 5 1 0 9 2 9 0 6\n7 0 5 0 5 0 5 6 1\n4 8 8 1 3 8 3 9 6\n7 2 0 5 3 6 5 8 2\n4 7 1 6 2 5 2 2 4\n>>>\n```"
