    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of a 0-degree rotation. A 0-degree rotation means that the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\nLet's go through the steps to ensure we understand the process:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation Requirement**: \n   - A 0-degree rotation means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains in its original form.\n\n2. **Input Matrix**:\n   - The given matrix is a 10x10 square matrix:\n     ```\n     8 8 2 7 0 2 0 9 1 4\n     3 0 9 8 9 3 1 5 4 6\n     5 2 2 2 6 5 9 2 9 6\n     9 4 8 2 1 1 5 7 4 0\n     0 5 8 8 9 5 4 5 3 6\n     9 6 1 2 1 9 0 0 3 6\n     3 8 7 9 2 6 7 2 9 9\n     1 7 7 3 9 5 4 6 8 3\n     4 2 3 1 2 8 9 3 1 0\n     3 7 0 5 4 2 6 3 3 8\n     ```\n\n3. **Output Matrix**:\n   - Since the rotation is 0 degrees, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix.\n\n4. **Format the Output**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - Present the matrix in the required format.\n\nThe final answer, with the matrix enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n```\n<<<\n8 8 2 7 0 2 0 9 1 4\n3 0 9 8 9 3 1 5 4 6\n5 2 2 2 6 5 9 2 9 6\n9 4 8 2 1 1 5 7 4 0\n0 5 8 8 9 5 4 5 3 6\n9 6 1 2 1 9 0 0 3 6\n3 8 7 9 2 6 7 2 9 9\n1 7 7 3 9 5 4 6 8 3\n4 2 3 1 2 8 9 3 1 0\n3 7 0 5 4 2 6 3 3 8\n>>>\n```"
