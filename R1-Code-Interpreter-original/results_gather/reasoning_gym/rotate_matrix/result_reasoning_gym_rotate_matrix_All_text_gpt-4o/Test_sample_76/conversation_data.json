    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we need to break down the task into manageable steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - A 180-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees twice.\n   - A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees three times.\n   - A 360-degree clockwise rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Degrees of Rotation:**\n   - The problem asks for a 540-degree clockwise rotation.\n   - Since 540 degrees is equivalent to 1.5 full rotations (540 รท 360 = 1.5), we can simplify this to a 180-degree rotation (540 - 360 = 180).\n\n3. **Matrix Rotation by 180 Degrees:**\n   - To rotate a matrix by 180 degrees, each element in the matrix is moved to its diametrically opposite position.\n   - This can be achieved by reversing the order of both rows and columns.\n\n4. **Applying the Rotation:**\n   - Given the matrix:\n     ```\n     1 6 4 6\n     3 1 4 3\n     2 3 5 3\n     1 3 1 8\n     ```\n   - Reverse the order of the rows:\n     ```\n     1 3 1 8\n     2 3 5 3\n     3 1 4 3\n     1 6 4 6\n     ```\n   - Reverse the order of the columns in each row:\n     ```\n     8 1 3 1\n     3 5 3 2\n     3 4 1 3\n     6 4 6 1\n     ```\n\n5. **Formatting the Output:**\n   - The final rotated matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer, after rotating the matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, is:\n\n<<<\n8 1 3 1\n3 5 3 2\n3 4 1 3\n6 4 6 1\n>>>"
