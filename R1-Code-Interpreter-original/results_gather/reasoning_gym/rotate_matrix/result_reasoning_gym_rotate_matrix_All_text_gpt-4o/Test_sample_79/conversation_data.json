    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - A 180-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to two 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to three 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Degrees and Rotations:**\n   - 540 degrees is equivalent to 1.5 full rotations (since 540 / 360 = 1.5).\n   - However, in terms of practical matrix rotation, 540 degrees is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation because 540 - 360 = 180. This is because a full 360-degree rotation results in the matrix being in its original position.\n\n3. **Performing a 180-degree Rotation:**\n   - A 180-degree rotation can be achieved by reversing the order of the rows and then reversing the order of the elements in each row.\n   - Alternatively, it can be seen as flipping the matrix upside down and then flipping it left to right.\n\n4. **Applying the Rotation to the Given Matrix:**\n   - Start with the original matrix:\n     ```\n     5 7 3 6 6\n     9 2 3 6 8\n     3 2 7 6 6\n     4 6 3 5 7\n     0 5 3 9 7\n     ```\n   - Reverse the order of the rows:\n     ```\n     0 5 3 9 7\n     4 6 3 5 7\n     3 2 7 6 6\n     9 2 3 6 8\n     5 7 3 6 6\n     ```\n   - Reverse the order of elements in each row:\n     ```\n     7 9 3 5 0\n     7 5 3 6 4\n     6 6 7 2 3\n     8 6 3 2 9\n     6 6 3 7 5\n     ```\n\n5. **Final Output:**\n   - The matrix after a 540-degree clockwise rotation is:\n     ```\n     7 9 3 5 0\n     7 5 3 6 4\n     6 6 7 2 3\n     8 6 3 2 9\n     6 6 3 7 5\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer, enclosed within triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<\n7 9 3 5 0\n7 5 3 6 4\n6 6 7 2 3\n8 6 3 2 9\n6 6 3 7 5\n>>>"
