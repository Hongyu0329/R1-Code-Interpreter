    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the concept of matrix rotation:\n\n1. **Understanding Rotation**: \n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - A 180-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to two 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to three 90-degree rotations.\n   - A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Rotation by 900 Degrees**:\n   - Since 900 degrees is equivalent to 2.5 full rotations (900 / 360 = 2.5), we need to consider the effective rotation.\n   - The effective rotation is 900 % 360 = 180 degrees.\n   - Therefore, rotating the matrix by 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 180 degrees clockwise.\n\n3. **Performing a 180-degree Rotation**:\n   - A 180-degree rotation can be achieved by reversing the order of the rows and then reversing the order of the elements in each row.\n   - Alternatively, it can be seen as flipping the matrix upside down and then flipping it left to right.\n\n4. **Applying the Rotation**:\n   - Given the matrix:\n     ```\n     1 5 1 4 2 3 5 1 7 7\n     8 4 7 2 5 4 8 9 0 8\n     0 2 3 7 2 9 6 3 4 4\n     6 0 8 3 2 9 0 3 5 0\n     0 0 1 6 9 7 6 2 2 9\n     2 6 7 7 6 9 1 3 2 0\n     7 7 2 7 2 3 4 0 4 8\n     4 8 4 5 2 5 1 3 9 2\n     8 5 6 3 5 1 1 9 7 3\n     2 9 4 4 8 2 0 8 9 7\n     ```\n   - Reverse the order of the rows:\n     ```\n     2 9 4 4 8 2 0 8 9 7\n     8 5 6 3 5 1 1 9 7 3\n     4 8 4 5 2 5 1 3 9 2\n     7 7 2 7 2 3 4 0 4 8\n     2 6 7 7 6 9 1 3 2 0\n     0 0 1 6 9 7 6 2 2 9\n     6 0 8 3 2 9 0 3 5 0\n     0 2 3 7 2 9 6 3 4 4\n     8 4 7 2 5 4 8 9 0 8\n     1 5 1 4 2 3 5 1 7 7\n     ```\n   - Reverse the order of elements in each row:\n     ```\n     7 9 8 0 2 8 4 4 9 2\n     3 7 9 1 1 5 3 6 5 8\n     2 9 3 1 5 2 5 4 8 4\n     8 4 0 4 3 2 7 2 7 7\n     0 2 3 1 9 6 7 7 6 2\n     9 2 2 6 7 9 6 1 0 0\n     0 5 3 0 9 2 3 8 0 6\n     4 4 3 6 9 2 7 3 2 0\n     8 0 9 8 4 5 2 7 4 8\n     7 7 1 5 3 2 4 1 5 1\n     ```\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - The rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     7 9 8 0 2 8 4 4 9 2\n     3 7 9 1 1 5 3 6 5 8\n     2 9 3 1 5 2 5 4 8 4\n     8 4 0 4 3 2 7 2 7 7\n     0 2 3 1 9 6 7 7 6 2\n     9 2 2 6 7 9 6 1 0 0\n     0 5 3 0 9 2 3 8 0 6\n     4 4 3 6 9 2 7 3 2 0\n     8 0 9 8 4 5 2 7 4 8\n     7 7 1 5 3 2 4 1 5 1\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n7 9 8 0 2 8 4 4 9 2\n3 7 9 1 1 5 3 6 5 8\n2 9 3 1 5 2 5 4 8 4\n8 4 0 4 3 2 7 2 7 7\n0 2 3 1 9 6 7 7 6 2\n9 2 2 6 7 9 6 1 0 0\n0 5 3 0 9 2 3 8 0 6\n4 4 3 6 9 2 7 3 2 0\n8 0 9 8 4 5 2 7 4 8\n7 7 1 5 3 2 4 1 5 1\n>>>"
