    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - A 540-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation because 540 degrees is 1.5 full rotations (540 = 360 + 180). Therefore, we only need to perform a 180-degree rotation.\n\n2. **Perform a 180-degree Rotation:**\n   - A 180-degree rotation of a matrix can be achieved by reversing the order of the elements in the matrix both row-wise and column-wise.\n   - This means the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (n-i-1, n-j-1) in the rotated matrix, where n is the size of the matrix.\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation to the Given Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     7 5 9 2\n     3 3 7 2\n     1 5 0 3\n     1 7 4 2\n     ```\n   - To rotate this matrix 180 degrees, we reverse the order of the rows and then reverse the order of the elements in each row.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Rotation:**\n   - Reverse the order of the rows:\n     ```\n     1 7 4 2\n     1 5 0 3\n     3 3 7 2\n     7 5 9 2\n     ```\n   - Reverse the order of the elements in each row:\n     ```\n     2 4 7 1\n     3 0 5 1\n     2 7 3 3\n     2 9 5 7\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final rotated matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n2 4 7 1\n3 0 5 1\n2 7 3 3\n2 9 5 7\n>>>"
