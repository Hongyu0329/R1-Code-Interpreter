    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 630 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - For a 180-degree rotation, the matrix is rotated twice by 90 degrees.\n   - For a 270-degree rotation, the matrix is rotated three times by 90 degrees.\n   - A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Calculate Effective Rotation:**\n   - Given the rotation is 630 degrees clockwise, we need to determine how many 90-degree rotations this equates to.\n   - 630 degrees divided by 90 degrees per rotation equals 7 rotations.\n   - However, since a full 360-degree rotation results in the matrix returning to its original position, we can reduce the number of rotations by subtracting full 360-degree rotations.\n   - 630 degrees is equivalent to 630 - 360 = 270 degrees (since 630 - 360 = 270).\n   - Therefore, 630 degrees clockwise is effectively the same as a 270-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n3. **Perform the 270-degree Clockwise Rotation:**\n   - A 270-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.\n   - To achieve this, we can rotate the matrix three times by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n4. **Matrix Rotation Steps:**\n   - Start with the original matrix:\n     ```\n     7 8 4 7\n     7 6 3 7\n     5 9 6 3\n     3 0 7 8\n     ```\n   - **First 90-degree Clockwise Rotation:**\n     ```\n     3 5 7 7\n     0 9 6 8\n     7 6 3 4\n     8 3 7 7\n     ```\n   - **Second 90-degree Clockwise Rotation:**\n     ```\n     8 7 0 3\n     3 6 9 5\n     7 3 6 7\n     7 4 8 7\n     ```\n   - **Third 90-degree Clockwise Rotation (Final 270-degree Rotation):**\n     ```\n     7 7 3 8\n     4 3 6 7\n     8 9 6 0\n     7 5 7 3\n     ```\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - The final matrix after a 630-degree clockwise rotation is:\n     ```\n     7 7 3 8\n     4 3 6 7\n     8 9 6 0\n     7 5 7 3\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<\n7 7 3 8\n4 3 6 7\n8 9 6 0\n7 5 7 3\n>>>"
