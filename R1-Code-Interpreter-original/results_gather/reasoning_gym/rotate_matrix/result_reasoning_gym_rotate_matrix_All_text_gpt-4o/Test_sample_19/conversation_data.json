    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 900 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the effect of rotating a matrix by 90 degrees clockwise and then apply this understanding to 900 degrees.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding 90-degree Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - For a 5x5 matrix, this means:\n     - The element at position (0,0) moves to (0,4).\n     - The element at position (0,1) moves to (1,4).\n     - The element at position (0,2) moves to (2,4).\n     - The element at position (0,3) moves to (3,4).\n     - The element at position (0,4) moves to (4,4).\n     - And similarly for other rows.\n\n2. **Understanding 900-degree Rotation:**\n   - Rotating a matrix by 900 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it by 90 degrees clockwise 10 times (since 900 / 90 = 10).\n   - However, since a full rotation (360 degrees) returns the matrix to its original orientation, we can simplify the problem:\n     - 900 degrees is equivalent to 900 % 360 = 180 degrees.\n     - Therefore, we need to perform a 180-degree rotation.\n\n3. **Performing a 180-degree Rotation:**\n   - A 180-degree rotation involves flipping the matrix such that the first row becomes the last row in reverse order, the second row becomes the second last row in reverse order, and so on.\n   - For a 5x5 matrix, this means:\n     - The element at position (0,0) moves to (4,4).\n     - The element at position (0,1) moves to (4,3).\n     - The element at position (0,2) moves to (4,2).\n     - The element at position (0,3) moves to (4,1).\n     - The element at position (0,4) moves to (4,0).\n     - And similarly for other rows.\n\n4. **Applying the 180-degree Rotation:**\n   - Given the matrix:\n     ```\n     8 8 2 3 3\n     8 4 6 8 7\n     8 8 5 9 5\n     6 4 6 0 1\n     0 8 4 0 7\n     ```\n   - After a 180-degree rotation, the matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     7 0 4 8 0\n     1 0 6 4 6\n     5 9 5 8 8\n     7 8 6 4 8\n     3 3 2 8 8\n     ```\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe matrix rotated by 900 degrees clockwise is:\n```\n<<<\n7 0 4 8 0\n1 0 6 4 6\n5 9 5 8 8\n7 8 6 4 8\n3 3 2 8 8\n>>>\n```"
