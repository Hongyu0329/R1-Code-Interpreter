    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 270 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation**: Rotating a matrix by 270 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise. This means that the first column of the original matrix becomes the first row of the new matrix, the second column becomes the second row, and so on.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 5x5 square matrix. This means that after rotation, the resulting matrix will also be 5x5.\n\n3. **Identify the Transformation**: For a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation:\n   - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (n-j-1, i) in the new matrix, where n is the size of the matrix (5 in this case).\n\n4. **Apply the Transformation**: We will apply the above transformation to each element of the matrix.\n\n5. **Construct the New Matrix**: By applying the transformation, we construct the new matrix row by row.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nOriginal Matrix:\n```\n6 5 0 9 0\n8 0 0 4 5\n0 1 7 7 1\n5 3 4 2 4\n6 8 3 2 1\n```\n\n- First column of the original matrix becomes the first row of the new matrix:\n  - (0,0) -> (4,0): 6\n  - (1,0) -> (3,0): 8\n  - (2,0) -> (2,0): 0\n  - (3,0) -> (1,0): 5\n  - (4,0) -> (0,0): 6\n\n- Second column of the original matrix becomes the second row of the new matrix:\n  - (0,1) -> (4,1): 5\n  - (1,1) -> (3,1): 0\n  - (2,1) -> (2,1): 1\n  - (3,1) -> (1,1): 3\n  - (4,1) -> (0,1): 8\n\n- Third column of the original matrix becomes the third row of the new matrix:\n  - (0,2) -> (4,2): 0\n  - (1,2) -> (3,2): 0\n  - (2,2) -> (2,2): 7\n  - (3,2) -> (1,2): 4\n  - (4,2) -> (0,2): 3\n\n- Fourth column of the original matrix becomes the fourth row of the new matrix:\n  - (0,3) -> (4,3): 9\n  - (1,3) -> (3,3): 4\n  - (2,3) -> (2,3): 7\n  - (3,3) -> (1,3): 2\n  - (4,3) -> (0,3): 2\n\n- Fifth column of the original matrix becomes the fifth row of the new matrix:\n  - (0,4) -> (4,4): 0\n  - (1,4) -> (3,4): 5\n  - (2,4) -> (2,4): 1\n  - (3,4) -> (1,4): 4\n  - (4,4) -> (0,4): 1\n\nNew Matrix after 270-degree clockwise rotation:\n```\n6 8 3 2 1\n5 3 4 2 4\n0 1 7 7 1\n8 0 0 4 5\n6 5 0 9 0\n```\n\nFinally, we enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets as required:\n\n<<<\n6 8 3 2 1\n5 3 4 2 4\n0 1 7 7 1\n8 0 0 4 5\n6 5 0 9 0\n>>>"
