    "To rotate a square matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Layout**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     5 6 1\n     5 8 8\n     0 0 4\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n2. **Rotation by 180 Degrees**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 180 degrees clockwise is equivalent to flipping it upside down and then reversing each row.\n   - Alternatively, it can be seen as reversing the order of elements in the matrix as if it were a single list.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - **Flip the Matrix Upside Down**: Swap the first row with the last row, the second row with the second last row, and so on.\n     ```\n     0 0 4\n     5 8 8\n     5 6 1\n     ```\n   - **Reverse Each Row**: Reverse the order of elements in each row.\n     - First row: `0 0 4` becomes `4 0 0`\n     - Second row: `5 8 8` becomes `8 8 5`\n     - Third row: `5 6 1` becomes `1 6 5`\n\n4. **Final Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After performing the above transformations, the matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     4 0 0\n     8 8 5\n     1 6 5\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the matrix rotated by 180 degrees clockwise is:\n\n<<<\n4 0 0\n8 8 5\n1 6 5\n>>>"
