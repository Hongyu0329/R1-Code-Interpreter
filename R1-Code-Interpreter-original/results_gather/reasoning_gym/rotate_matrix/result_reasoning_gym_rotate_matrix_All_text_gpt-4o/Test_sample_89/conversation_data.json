    "To rotate a square matrix by 180 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 3x3 matrix:\n     ```\n     3 9 6\n     2 9 8\n     2 5 4\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotation by 180 Degrees**:\n   - Rotating a matrix by 180 degrees clockwise is equivalent to flipping it upside down and then reversing each row.\n   - This can also be thought of as rotating it twice by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - **Flip the Matrix Upside Down**:\n     - Swap the first row with the last row, and the second row remains in place (since it's a 3x3 matrix):\n     ```\n     2 5 4\n     2 9 8\n     3 9 6\n     ```\n\n   - **Reverse Each Row**:\n     - Reverse the elements in each row:\n     ```\n     4 5 2\n     8 9 2\n     6 9 3\n     ```\n\n4. **Final Output**:\n   - The matrix after a 180-degree clockwise rotation is:\n     ```\n     4 5 2\n     8 9 2\n     6 9 3\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - Enclose the final matrix within triple angle brackets as specified:\n     - <<<4 5 2\n         8 9 2\n         6 9 3>>>\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<4 5 2\n8 9 2\n6 9 3>>>"
