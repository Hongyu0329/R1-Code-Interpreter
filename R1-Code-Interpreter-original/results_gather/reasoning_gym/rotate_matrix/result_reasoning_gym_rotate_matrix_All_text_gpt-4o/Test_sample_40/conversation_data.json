    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we need to break down the task into manageable steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Matrix Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.\n   - For a 450-degree rotation, we need to determine how many 90-degree rotations are equivalent to 450 degrees.\n\n2. **Calculating Effective Rotation:**\n   - Since a full rotation (360 degrees) brings the matrix back to its original orientation, we can simplify the problem by calculating the effective rotation.\n   - 450 degrees is equivalent to 450 - 360 = 90 degrees. Therefore, a 450-degree clockwise rotation is the same as a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n3. **Performing a 90-degree Clockwise Rotation:**\n   - Given the matrix:\n     ```\n     9 2 5\n     8 9 5\n     4 9 2\n     ```\n   - To rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise:\n     - The first row `[9, 2, 5]` becomes the last column `[5, 5, 2]`.\n     - The second row `[8, 9, 5]` becomes the second-to-last column `[9, 9, 2]`.\n     - The third row `[4, 9, 2]` becomes the first column `[4, 8, 9]`.\n\n4. **Constructing the Rotated Matrix:**\n   - After performing the 90-degree clockwise rotation, the new matrix is:\n     ```\n     4 8 9\n     9 9 2\n     2 5 5\n     ```\n\n5. **Formatting the Output:**\n   - The final step is to format the output matrix as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the rotated matrix is:\n\n<<<\n4 8 9\n9 9 2\n2 5 5\n>>>"
