    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 0 degrees clockwise, we need to understand the implications of a 0-degree rotation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Rotation**: \n   - A 0-degree rotation means that the matrix remains unchanged. There is no actual rotation happening, so the output matrix should be identical to the input matrix.\n\n2. **Input Matrix**:\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     1 7 9 9 4\n     5 7 9 4 4\n     7 4 5 1 8\n     2 0 6 5 7\n     1 2 8 8 2\n     ```\n\n3. **Output Matrix**:\n   - Since a 0-degree rotation does not alter the matrix, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\n4. **Formatting the Output**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified: <<<output matrix>>>.\n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - The matrix should be presented in the same format as the input, with each row on a new line.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the final output for the given problem.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```\n<<<\n1 7 9 9 4\n5 7 9 4 4\n7 4 5 1 8\n2 0 6 5 7\n1 2 8 8 2\n>>>\n```"
