    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 540 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation:**\n   - A 90-degree clockwise rotation of a matrix involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   - A 540-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 540/90 = 6 rotations of 90 degrees each.\n   - Since a full 360-degree rotation returns the matrix to its original orientation, we can simplify 540 degrees to 540 - 360 = 180 degrees. Thus, we only need to perform a 180-degree rotation.\n\n2. **Perform a 180-degree Rotation:**\n   - A 180-degree rotation can be achieved by reversing the order of the rows and then reversing the order of the elements in each row.\n   - Alternatively, it can be done by swapping elements symmetrically from the center of the matrix.\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation to the Given Matrix:**\n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     2 2 3 6 2\n     8 6 1 8 9\n     5 5 7 0 2\n     5 6 1 2 6\n     6 6 6 0 2\n     ```\n\n   - Reverse the order of the rows:\n     ```\n     6 6 6 0 2\n     5 6 1 2 6\n     5 5 7 0 2\n     8 6 1 8 9\n     2 2 3 6 2\n     ```\n\n   - Reverse the order of elements in each row:\n     ```\n     2 0 6 6 6\n     6 2 1 6 5\n     2 0 7 5 5\n     9 8 1 6 8\n     2 6 3 2 2\n     ```\n\n4. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final rotated matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the matrix rotated by 540 degrees clockwise is:\n\n<<<\n2 0 6 6 6\n6 2 1 6 5\n2 0 7 5 5\n9 8 1 6 8\n2 6 3 2 2\n>>>"
