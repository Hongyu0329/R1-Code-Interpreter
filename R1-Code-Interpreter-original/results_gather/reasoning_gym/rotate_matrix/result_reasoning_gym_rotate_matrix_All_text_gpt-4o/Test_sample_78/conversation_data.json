    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 450 degrees clockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation:**\n   - A 450-degree clockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation because 450 degrees is 360 + 90 degrees. A full 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation, so we only need to perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions:**\n   - The given matrix is an 8x8 square matrix. This is important because the rotation process will involve swapping elements within this square structure.\n\n3. **Rotation Process:**\n   - To rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can follow these steps:\n     - Transpose the matrix: Swap rows with columns.\n     - Reverse each row: This will complete the 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n4. **Transpose the Matrix:**\n   - Transposing involves swapping the element at position (i, j) with the element at position (j, i) for all i and j.\n\n5. **Reverse Each Row:**\n   - After transposing, reverse the order of elements in each row to achieve the 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n6. **Apply the Steps to the Given Matrix:**\n\n   Original Matrix:\n   ```\n   9 3 6 7 4 8 1 8\n   6 8 5 0 1 8 1 2\n   7 0 8 6 9 3 4 4\n   5 5 8 1 6 8 7 4\n   2 3 4 6 7 3 2 7\n   3 1 7 5 5 3 2 4\n   2 3 4 2 0 9 4 2\n   0 7 6 3 3 7 8 7\n   ```\n\n   Transpose the Matrix:\n   ```\n   9 6 7 5 2 3 2 0\n   3 8 0 5 3 1 3 7\n   6 5 8 8 4 7 4 6\n   7 0 6 1 6 5 2 3\n   4 1 9 6 7 5 0 3\n   8 8 3 8 3 3 9 7\n   1 1 4 7 2 2 4 8\n   8 2 4 4 7 4 2 7\n   ```\n\n   Reverse Each Row:\n   ```\n   0 2 3 2 5 7 6 9\n   7 3 1 3 5 0 8 3\n   6 4 7 4 8 8 5 6\n   3 2 5 6 1 6 0 7\n   3 0 5 7 6 9 1 4\n   7 9 3 3 8 3 8 8\n   8 4 2 2 7 4 1 1\n   7 2 4 7 4 4 2 8\n   ```\n\n7. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final rotated matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```\n<<<\n0 2 3 2 5 7 6 9\n7 3 1 3 5 0 8 3\n6 4 7 4 8 8 5 6\n3 2 5 6 1 6 0 7\n3 0 5 7 6 9 1 4\n7 9 3 3 8 3 8 8\n8 4 2 2 7 4 1 1\n7 2 4 7 4 4 2 8\n>>>\n```"
