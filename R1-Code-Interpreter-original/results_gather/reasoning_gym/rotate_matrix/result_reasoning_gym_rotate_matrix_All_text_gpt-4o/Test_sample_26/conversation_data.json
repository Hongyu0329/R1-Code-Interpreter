    "To solve the problem of rotating a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     3 3 0 3 7\n     6 5 4 4 7\n     9 6 4 9 1\n     0 7 3 7 1\n     7 8 6 5 0\n     ```\n\n2. **Matrix Rotation Concept**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the position of elements such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n3. **Transformation Rule**:\n   - For a given element at position (i, j) in the original matrix, its new position in the rotated matrix will be (j, n-1-i), where n is the size of the matrix (5 in this case).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Transformation**:\n   - Start with an empty 5x5 matrix to store the rotated result.\n   - Iterate over each element of the original matrix and place it in its new position in the rotated matrix using the transformation rule.\n\n5. **Apply the Transformation**:\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     3 3 0 3 7\n     6 5 4 4 7\n     9 6 4 9 1\n     0 7 3 7 1\n     7 8 6 5 0\n     ```\n   - Rotated matrix:\n     - First row of the original becomes the last column of the rotated:\n       - (0,0) -> (0,4), (0,1) -> (1,4), (0,2) -> (2,4), (0,3) -> (3,4), (0,4) -> (4,4)\n     - Second row of the original becomes the second last column of the rotated:\n       - (1,0) -> (0,3), (1,1) -> (1,3), (1,2) -> (2,3), (1,3) -> (3,3), (1,4) -> (4,3)\n     - Continue this pattern for all rows.\n\n6. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - After applying the transformation, the rotated matrix is:\n     ```\n     7 0 9 6 3\n     8 7 6 5 3\n     6 3 4 4 0\n     5 7 9 4 3\n     0 1 1 7 7\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n<<<\n7 0 9 6 3\n8 7 6 5 3\n6 3 4 4 0\n5 7 9 4 3\n0 1 1 7 7\n>>>"
