    "To rotate a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Layout**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     7 8 4 2\n     2 4 2 0\n     6 7 9 1\n     3 4 8 2\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify the Rotation Process**:\n   - Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves moving elements from one position to another in a specific pattern. \n   - The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will move to position (j, n-1-i) in the rotated matrix, where n is the size of the matrix.\n\n3. **Apply the Rotation**:\n   - Let's apply this transformation to each element of the matrix:\n     - The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.\n     - The second row of the original matrix becomes the third column of the rotated matrix.\n     - The third row of the original matrix becomes the second column of the rotated matrix.\n     - The fourth row of the original matrix becomes the first column of the rotated matrix.\n\n4. **Construct the Rotated Matrix**:\n   - Start with an empty 4x4 matrix and fill it according to the rotation rule:\n     ```\n     Original:        Rotated:\n     7 8 4 2    ->    3 6 2 7\n     2 4 2 0    ->    4 7 4 8\n     6 7 9 1    ->    8 9 2 4\n     3 4 8 2    ->    2 1 0 2\n     ```\n\n5. **Verify the Transformation**:\n   - Check each element to ensure it has been moved to the correct position according to the rotation rule.\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final rotated matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final rotated matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n3 6 2 7\n4 7 4 8\n8 9 2 4\n2 1 0 2\n>>>\n```"
