    "To solve the problem, I need to interpret the figlet font and convert it into a readable text format. The figlet font is a form of ASCII art used to create stylized text. The task is to identify the text represented by the figlet font.\n\nThe figlet font provided seems to represent a word or phrase. To decode it, I will analyze the structure and patterns of the characters. Each character in a figlet font is typically represented by a block of text, and the alignment and spacing between these blocks help in identifying the characters.\n\nLet's break down the figlet font:\n\n```\n|\\  /      |\\        |        |        |~~-__  \n| \\/       | \\       |      \\ |        |     | \n|       _  |  \\   _  |   _   \\|     _  |_____| \n|      |_| |     |_| |  |_|   |\\   |_| |  |  | \n| /\\       |         |        | \\      |  |  | \n|/  \\      |         |        |        |  |  | \n```\n\n1. The first character seems to be a \"W\" based on the slashes and vertical bars.\n2. The second character appears to be an \"E\" due to the vertical bars and underscores.\n3. The third character looks like an \"L\" because of the vertical bar and underscores.\n4. The fourth character is another \"C\" based on the vertical bars and underscores.\n5. The fifth character is an \"O\" due to the rounded shape formed by the vertical bars and underscores.\n6. The sixth character is an \"M\" based on the slashes and vertical bars.\n7. The seventh character is an \"E\" again, similar to the second character.\n\nCombining these characters, the figlet font spells out the word \"WELCOME\".\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer.\n\n<<<WELCOME>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please read the following figlet font:\n\n|\\  /      |\\        |        |        |~~-__  \n| \\/       | \\       |      \\ |        |     | \n|       _  |  \\   _  |   _   \\|     _  |_____| \n|      |_| |     |_| |  |_|   |\\   |_| |  |  | \n| /\\       |         |        | \\      |  |  | \n|/  \\      |         |        |        |  |  | \n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
