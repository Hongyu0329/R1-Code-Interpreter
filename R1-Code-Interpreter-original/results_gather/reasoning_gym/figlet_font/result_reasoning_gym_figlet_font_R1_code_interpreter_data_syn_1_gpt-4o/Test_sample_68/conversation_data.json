    "To solve the problem, I need to interpret the figlet font text provided. The figlet font is a form of ASCII art used to create stylized text. The text appears to be a representation of a word or phrase using a specific font style.\n\nThe task is to read the figlet font and determine the text it represents. This involves recognizing the patterns of characters and spaces that form each letter.\n\nLet's break down the figlet font line by line to identify the letters:\n\n1. The first line is mostly empty, indicating the top of the letters.\n2. The second line has a pattern that suggests the top of the letters \"H\" and \"E\".\n3. The third line continues the pattern, showing parts of \"H\", \"E\", and \"L\".\n4. The fourth line completes the letters \"H\", \"E\", \"L\", and \"L\".\n5. The fifth line shows the bottom of the letters \"H\", \"E\", \"L\", \"L\", and \"O\".\n6. The sixth line is mostly empty, indicating the bottom of the letters.\n\nBy analyzing these patterns, the figlet font spells out the word \"HELLO\".\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer.\n\n<<<HELLO>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please read the following figlet font:\n\n                                                              \n                                                              \n                                                              \n                                                              \n ####        #       ####    ###    ##   ##    #####   ###### \n  #  #      # #     #   #     #      ##  #      #  #   # #  # \n  # ##      # #     #         #     # #  #      # #      #    \n ####      #  #      ##       #     # ## #     ####      #    \n #   #     ####        #     #      #  # #     #  #      #    \n #  #     #   #    #   #     #      #  ##      #   #     #    \n####     ##   ##    ###     ###    ##   #     #####     ##    \n                                                              \n                                                              \n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
