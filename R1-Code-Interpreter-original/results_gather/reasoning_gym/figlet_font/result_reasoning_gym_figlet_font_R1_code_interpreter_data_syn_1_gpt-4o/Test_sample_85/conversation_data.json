    "To solve this problem, we need to interpret the ASCII art and determine what word it represents. The ASCII art is composed of characters that form a visual representation of letters. Each block of characters corresponds to a letter in the word.\n\nLet's break down the ASCII art into individual letters:\n\n1. The first block of characters forms a letter that looks like \"H\".\n2. The second block of characters forms a letter that looks like \"E\".\n3. The third block of characters forms a letter that looks like \"L\".\n4. The fourth block of characters forms another letter \"L\".\n5. The fifth block of characters forms a letter that looks like \"O\".\n\nCombining these letters, the word represented by the ASCII art is \"HELLO\".\n\n<<<HELLO>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What word does this say?\n\n                                                               \n   ####            ######            #######           #####   \n  ##  ##           ##   ##           ##                ##  ##  \n ##                ##   ##           ##                ##   ## \n ##                ######            #####             ##   ## \n ##                ## ##             ##                ##   ## \n  ##  ##           ##  ##            ##                ##  ##  \n   ####            ##   ##           #######           #####   \n                                                               \n                                                               \n         \n   ###   \n  ## ##  \n ##   ## \n ##   ## \n ##   ## \n  ## ##  \n   ###   \n         \n         \n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
