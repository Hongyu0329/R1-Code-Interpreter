    "To solve the problem of reading and interpreting the figlet font provided, we need to understand the pattern and structure of the text. The figlet font is a form of ASCII art used to represent text in a stylized manner. The text is broken down into lines and characters, each represented by a combination of symbols.\n\nThe task is to interpret the figlet font and determine the text it represents. The figlet font provided seems to be a stylized representation of a word or phrase. To decode it, we need to analyze the pattern of characters and match them to known figlet font representations.\n\nLet's break down the figlet font line by line:\n\n1. The first line: `. .          . .          . .       .          . .          .      `\n\n2. The second line: `.+|=|`+.    .+'|=|`+.    .+'|=|`+.    |`+.    .+'|=|`+.    .+'|      `\n\n3. The third line: `|  | `+.|    |  | |  |    |  | `+.|    |  |    |  | |  |    |  |      `\n\n4. The fourth line: `|  | .       |  | |  |    |  |         |  |    |  |=|  |    |  |      `\n\n5. The fifth line: `+.|=|`+.    |  | |  |    |  |         |  |    |  | |  |    |  |      `\n\n6. The sixth line: `.    |  |    |  | |  |    |  |    .    |  |    |  | |  |    |  |    . `\n\n7. The seventh line: `|`+. |  |    |  | |  |    |  | .+'|    |  |    |  | |  |    |  | .+'| `\n\n8. The eighth line: `+.|=|.+'    `+.|=|.+'    `+.|=|.+'    |.+'    `+.| |..|    `+.|=|.+' `\n\n9. The ninth line: `                                                                      `\n\nThe figlet font is typically used to create large text banners. Each character in the text is represented by a block of symbols, and the blocks are aligned vertically to form the text.\n\nTo decode the figlet font, we need to match each block of symbols to the corresponding character. This requires familiarity with the specific figlet font style used.\n\nBased on the structure and common patterns in figlet fonts, the text appears to be \"ASK GPT\". This is inferred from the repetition and alignment of the symbols, which are characteristic of figlet representations of these letters.\n\n<<<ASK GPT>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
