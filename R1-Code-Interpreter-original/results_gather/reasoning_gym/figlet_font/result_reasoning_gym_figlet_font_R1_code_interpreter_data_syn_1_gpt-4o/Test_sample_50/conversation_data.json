    "To read the figlet font provided, we need to interpret the ASCII art and convert it into readable text. The figlet font is a form of stylized text that uses characters to create a visual representation of words. \n\nLet's break down the ASCII art line by line to understand what it represents:\n\n1. The first line: \"888 88b,       e Y8b       888 88e    888 88e    888'Y88   88P'888'Y88    dP\"8\"\n2. The second line: \"888 88P'      d8b Y8b      888 888D   888 888D   888 ,'Y   P'  888  'Y   C8b Y\"\n3. The third line: \"888 8K       d888b Y8b     888 88\"    888 88\"    888C8         888        Y8b\"\n4. The fourth line: \"888 88b,    d888888888b    888 b,     888 b,     888 \",d       888       b Y8D\"\n5. The fifth line: \"888 88P'   d8888888b Y8b   888 88b,   888 88b,   888,d88       888       8edP\"\n\nBy analyzing the structure and patterns, we can deduce the text:\n\n- The repeated \"888\" and \"88\" patterns are likely placeholders for letters.\n- The \"Y8b\" and \"Y8D\" patterns suggest the letter \"Y\".\n- The \"d8b\" and \"d888b\" patterns suggest the letter \"d\".\n- The \"e\" and \"D\" patterns suggest the letter \"e\".\n- The \"b\" and \"P\" patterns suggest the letter \"b\".\n- The \"C8b\" and \"8edP\" patterns suggest the letter \"C\" and \"P\".\n\nBy piecing these together, the figlet font spells out the word \"DEBUG\" in a stylized manner.\n\n<<<DEBUG>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
