    "To solve the problem of reading the figlet font and outputting the final answer, we need to interpret the ASCII art and understand what it represents. The figlet font provided seems to be a stylized representation of text. \n\nLet's break down the ASCII art:\n\n1. The first line is just a series of hashes and spaces.\n2. The second line is empty.\n3. The third line has \"####\" followed by spaces and then \"###\" and \"####\".\n4. The fourth line has \"##  ##\" followed by spaces and then \"##\" and \"##  ##\".\n5. The fifth line has \"##\" followed by spaces and then \"##\".\n6. The sixth line has \"##  ##\" followed by spaces and then \"##\" and \"##  ##\".\n7. The seventh line has \"####\" followed by spaces and then \"####\" and \"####\".\n8. The eighth line is empty.\n\nBy analyzing the pattern, it seems to represent the word \"HELLO\" in a stylized figlet font. \n\nNow, let's output the final answer:\n\n<<<HELLO>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please read the following figlet font:\n\n                     ##            \n                                   \n  ####     ####     ###     ####   \n ##  ##       ##     ##    ##  ##  \n ##        #####     ##    ##      \n ##  ##   ##  ##     ##    ##  ##  \n  ####     #####    ####    ####   \n                                   \n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
