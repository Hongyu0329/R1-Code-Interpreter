    "To solve the problem of reading the figlet font, we need to understand how figlet fonts are structured. Figlet fonts are typically used to create stylized text in a large ASCII art format. The text is represented in a way that each character is expanded into a larger, more decorative representation.\n\nThe figlet font provided is:\n\n```\n___     __                   ___     __     ___ \n |     /  \\    |\\ |    |    |__     /__`     |  \n |     \\__/    | \\|    |    |___    .__/     |  \n```\n\nTo interpret this, we need to map each segment of the figlet font to its corresponding character. The figlet font is often used to represent words or phrases in a visually appealing way. In this case, the figlet font represents the word \"ASK\".\n\nLet's break down the figlet font:\n\n1. The first line represents the top part of the letters.\n2. The second line represents the middle part of the letters.\n3. The third line represents the bottom part of the letters.\n\nBy analyzing the structure, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The first character is \"A\", represented by:\n  ```\n  ___  \n |     \n |     \n  ```\n- The second character is \"S\", represented by:\n  ```\n   __  \n  |__  \n  |___ \n  ```\n- The third character is \"K\", represented by:\n  ```\n  __   \n | \\  \n |  \\ \n  ```\n\nTherefore, the figlet font represents the word \"ASK\".\n\n<<<ASK>>>"
