    "To solve this problem, we need to interpret the ASCII art and determine what word it represents. The ASCII art is composed of characters that form a visual representation of letters. Each block of characters corresponds to a letter in the word.\n\nLet's break down the ASCII art:\n\n1. The first block:\n   ```\n   .----.\n   | {}  \\\n   |     /\n   `----'\n   ```\n   This resembles the letter \"H\".\n\n2. The second block:\n   ```\n   .----.\n   | {_  \n   | {__ \n   `----'\n   ```\n   This resembles the letter \"E\".\n\n3. The third block:\n   ```\n   .-. .-.\n   | | | |\n   \\ \\_/ /\n   `---'\n   ```\n   This resembles the letter \"L\".\n\n4. The fourth block:\n   ```\n   .----.\n   | {_  \n   | {__ \n   `----'\n   ```\n   This resembles the letter \"E\".\n\n5. The fifth block:\n   ```\n   .-.     \n   | |     \n   | `--.  \n   `----'  \n   ```\n   This resembles the letter \"O\".\n\nPutting these letters together, the word is \"HELLO\".\n\n<<<HELLO>>>"
