    "To solve the problem of reading the figlet font, we need to interpret the ASCII art and convert it into a readable text format. The figlet font provided seems to represent a word or phrase using a stylized ASCII art format. \n\nThe task is to identify the word or phrase represented by the figlet font. The figlet font is a form of text art where letters are represented using a series of characters, often used to create visually appealing text in command-line interfaces.\n\nLet's analyze the figlet font provided:\n\n```\n #######   #######   #######   ######  \n                ##        ##     ##    \n ##   ##   #######   ######      ##    \n ##    #   ##   ##   ##   ##     ##    \n #######   ##   ##   #######   ######  \n```\n\nThe figlet font appears to represent the word \"PYTHON\". Each block of characters corresponds to a letter in the word. The spaces between the blocks help to distinguish between different letters.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer based on this analysis.\n\n<<<PYTHON>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please read the following figlet font:\n\n                                       \n                                       \n #######   #######   #######   ######  \n                ##        ##     ##    \n ##   ##   #######   ######      ##    \n ##    #   ##   ##   ##   ##     ##    \n #######   ##   ##   #######   ######  \n                                       \n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
