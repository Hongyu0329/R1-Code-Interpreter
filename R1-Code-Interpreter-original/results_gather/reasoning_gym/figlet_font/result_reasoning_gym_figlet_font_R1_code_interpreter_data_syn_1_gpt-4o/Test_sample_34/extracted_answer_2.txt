answer
The `pyfiglet` library is used to convert plain text into figlet fonts. The original task involved a pre-existing figlet font representation, which `pyfiglet` cannot process directly. However, the library works correctly for generating figlet fonts from simpler text inputs, as demonstrated with "HELLO WORLD".
