    "To solve the problem, I need to interpret the figlet font text provided. The figlet font is a way of representing text in a stylized manner using ASCII characters. The text appears to be a stylized representation of the word \"HELLO\".\n\nThe process involves recognizing the pattern of characters and matching them to the corresponding letters. Each letter is represented by a block of characters, and by analyzing these blocks, we can determine the text they represent.\n\nLet's break down the figlet font:\n\n1. The first block of characters represents the letter \"H\".\n2. The second block represents the letter \"E\".\n3. The third block represents the letter \"L\".\n4. The fourth block represents another \"L\".\n5. The fifth block represents the letter \"O\".\n\nTherefore, the figlet font text spells out the word \"HELLO\".\n\n<<<HELLO>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please read the following figlet font:\n\n                                             \n                                             \n                                             \n ####    ###    ##  #    ####   ####   ####  \n##  #   ## ##   ##  #   ##  #   ##     ## ## \n##      ## ##   ### #   ##      ####   ## ## \n##      #####   #####   ##      ##     ####  \n##  #   ## ##   ## ##   ##  #   ##     ## ## \n ####   ## ##   ##  #    ####   ####   ## ## \n                                             \n                                             \n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
