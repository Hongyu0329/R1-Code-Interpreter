    "To solve the problem of reading the figlet font and outputting the final answer, we need to interpret the text represented by the figlet font. The figlet font is a form of ASCII art used to create stylized text. The text in the figlet font appears to be a stylized representation of the word \"HELLO\".\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Text**: The figlet font is a stylized representation of text. By examining the pattern, we can identify the word \"HELLO\".\n\n2. **Output the Final Answer**: Once we have identified the text, we can output it in the required format.\n\nNow, let's proceed to output the final answer.\n\n<<<HELLO>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please read the following figlet font:\n\n                                                            \n                                                            \n                                                            \n### ##   ##  ##   #####      #      ####     #####   ####   \n #  #     ## #     #        ###      #  #     #       #  #  \n # #      ## #     #  #     # #      #   #    #  #    #  #  \n ###      # ##     ####    #  #      #   #    ####    ###   \n # #      # ##     #  #    #####     #   #    #  #    #  #  \n #  #     # ##     #       #   #     #  #     #       #  #  \n###  #   ##  #    #####   ##   ##   ####     #####   ###  # \n                                                            \n                                                            \n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
