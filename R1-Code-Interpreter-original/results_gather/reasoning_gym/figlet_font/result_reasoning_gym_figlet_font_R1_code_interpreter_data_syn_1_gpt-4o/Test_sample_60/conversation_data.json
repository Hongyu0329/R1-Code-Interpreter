    "To solve the problem of reading the figlet font provided, we need to interpret the ASCII art and convert it into a readable text format. The figlet font is a form of stylized text representation using ASCII characters. \n\nThe figlet font provided seems to represent the word \"HELLO\". Each letter is represented in a block of characters, and the blocks are aligned horizontally to form the word. \n\nLet's break down the ASCII art:\n\n1. The first block of characters represents the letter \"H\".\n2. The second block represents the letter \"E\".\n3. The third block represents the letter \"L\".\n4. The fourth block represents another \"L\".\n5. The fifth block represents the letter \"O\".\n\nBy analyzing the structure and alignment of the characters, we can deduce the word being represented.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer based on this analysis.\n\n<<<HELLO>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please read the following figlet font:\n\n##     ##       ###       ##    ##    ##    ##    ######## \n##     ##      ## ##      ###   ##    ##   ##        ##    \n##     ##     ##   ##     ####  ##    ##  ##         ##    \n#########    ##     ##    ## ## ##    #####          ##    \n##     ##    #########    ##  ####    ##  ##         ##    \n##     ##    ##     ##    ##   ###    ##   ##        ##    \n##     ##    ##     ##    ##    ##    ##    ##       ##    \n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
