    "To solve the problem, I need to interpret the figlet font provided. The figlet font is a form of ASCII art that represents text in a stylized manner. The text appears to be a representation of the word \"HELLO\" using a specific figlet font style.\n\nLet's break down the figlet font line by line to understand the characters:\n\n1. The first line: \n   ```\n   .|'''|          /.\\         '||\\   ||`    |''||''|    |''||''| \n   ```\n   This line seems to represent the top part of the letters. The characters are spread out, and the use of symbols like `|`, `'`, and `\\` suggests the top of the letters.\n\n2. The second line:\n   ```\n   ||             // \\\\         ||\\\\  ||        ||          ||    \n   ```\n   This line continues the structure of the letters, with `||` and `\\\\` forming the vertical parts of the letters.\n\n3. The third line:\n   ```\n   `|'''|,       //...\\\\        || \\\\ ||        ||          ||    \n   ```\n   This line includes more complex symbols like `'''` and `...`, which are likely used to form the middle parts of the letters.\n\n4. The fourth line:\n   ```\n    .   ||      //     \\\\       ||  \\\\||        ||          ||    \n   ```\n   This line continues the structure, with `||` and `\\\\` forming the vertical parts of the letters.\n\n5. The fifth line:\n   ```\n    |...|'    .//       \\\\.    .||   \\||.    |..||..|      .||.   \n   ```\n   This line completes the letters, with `|...|` and `..||..` forming the bottom parts of the letters.\n\nBy analyzing the structure and patterns, the figlet font spells out the word \"HELLO\".\n\n<<<HELLO>>>"
