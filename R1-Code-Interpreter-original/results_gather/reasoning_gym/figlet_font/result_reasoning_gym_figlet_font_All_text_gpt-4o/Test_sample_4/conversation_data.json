    "To analyze the question, we need to interpret the ASCII art provided. ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses printable characters from the ASCII standard to create images or text. In this case, the ASCII art is used to represent a word.\n\nLet's break down the ASCII art line by line:\n\n1. The first line:\n   ```\n   ██▀███     ▓█████      ▄████    ▓█████    ▄▄▄█████▓\n   ```\n   This line represents the top part of the letters.\n\n2. The second line:\n   ```\n   ▓██ ▒ ██▒   ▓█   ▀     ██▒ ▀█▒   ▓█   ▀    ▓  ██▒ ▓▒\n   ```\n   This line represents the upper-middle part of the letters.\n\n3. The third line:\n   ```\n   ▓██ ░▄█ ▒   ▒███      ▒██░▄▄▄░   ▒███      ▒ ▓██░ ▒░\n   ```\n   This line represents the middle part of the letters.\n\n4. The fourth line:\n   ```\n   ▒██▀▀█▄     ▒▓█  ▄    ░▓█  ██▓   ▒▓█  ▄    ░ ▓██▓ ░ \n   ```\n   This line represents the lower-middle part of the letters.\n\n5. The fifth line:\n   ```\n   ░██▓ ▒██▒   ░▒████▒   ░▒▓███▀▒   ░▒████▒     ▒██▒ ░ \n   ```\n   This line represents the bottom part of the letters.\n\n6. The sixth line:\n   ```\n   ░ ▒▓ ░▒▓░   ░░ ▒░ ░    ░▒   ▒    ░░ ▒░ ░     ▒ ░░   \n   ```\n   This line represents the bottom part of the letters.\n\n7. The seventh line:\n   ```\n     ░▒ ░ ▒░    ░ ░  ░     ░   ░     ░ ░  ░       ░    \n   ```\n   This line represents the bottom part of the letters.\n\n8. The eighth line:\n   ```\n     ░░   ░       ░      ░ ░   ░       ░        ░      \n   ```\n   This line represents the bottom part of the letters.\n\n9. The ninth line:\n   ```\n      ░           ░  ░         ░       ░  ░            \n   ```\n   This line represents the bottom part of the letters.\n\nBy carefully analyzing each line, we can deduce that the ASCII art spells out the word \"HELLO\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<HELLO>>>"
