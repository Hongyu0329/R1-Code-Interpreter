    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the ASCII art representation of letters. Each block of characters represents a letter, and we need to identify each letter to form a word.\n\n1. **First Block:**\n   ```\n   .----.\n   | {}  \\\n   |     /\n   `----'\n   ```\n   This block represents the letter 'H'. The structure of the block, with the vertical lines on the sides and the horizontal lines on the top and bottom, is characteristic of the letter 'H'.\n\n2. **Second Block:**\n   ```\n   .----.\n   | {_  \n   | {__ \n   `----'\n   ```\n   This block represents the letter 'E'. The top and bottom horizontal lines, along with the vertical line on the left and the two horizontal lines in the middle, are typical of the letter 'E'.\n\n3. **Third Block:**\n   ```\n   .-. .-.\n   | | | |\n   \\ \\_/ /\n   `---'\n   ```\n   This block represents the letter 'L'. The vertical line on the left and the horizontal line at the bottom are indicative of the letter 'L'.\n\n4. **Fourth Block:**\n   ```\n   .----.\n   | {_  \n   | {__ \n   `----'\n   ```\n   This block is identical to the second block and also represents the letter 'E'.\n\n5. **Fifth Block:**\n   ```\n   .-.     \n   | |     \n   | `--.  \n   `----'  \n   ```\n   This block represents the letter 'O'. The rounded shape with the open bottom is characteristic of the letter 'O'.\n\nBy combining the identified letters, we form the word \"HELLO\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<HELLO>>>"
