    "To analyze the question and provide a final answer, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Input**: The input is a figlet font representation of text. Figlet fonts are a way of creating text banners using ASCII characters. The text in the figlet font is:\n   ```\n    _       __        _         _    \n   | |     / /`_     | |       | | | \n   |_|     \\_\\_/     |_|__     \\_\\_/ \n   ```\n\n2. **Interpreting the Figlet Font**: The figlet font is a stylized representation of text. To interpret it, we need to recognize the patterns of characters that form each letter. In this case, the figlet font represents the following text:\n   - The first line: \" _       __        _         _    \"\n   - The second line: \"| |     / /`_     | |       | | |\"\n   - The third line: \"|_|     \\_\\_/     |_|__     \\_\\_/\"\n\n3. **Decoding the Figlet Font**: By analyzing the patterns, we can decode the figlet font into regular text. Each block of characters corresponds to a letter or symbol. The figlet font provided decodes to the following text:\n   - \"HI\"\n   - \"BYE\"\n\n4. **Outputting the Final Answer**: The decoded text from the figlet font is \"HI BYE\". This is the final answer that we need to output.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<HI BYE>>>"
