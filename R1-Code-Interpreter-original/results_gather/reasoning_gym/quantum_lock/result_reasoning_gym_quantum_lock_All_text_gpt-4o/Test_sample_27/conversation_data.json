  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 16\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when any)\nB: Subtract 1 (when green)\nC: Multiply 2 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (16), while considering the state of the light (red or green) and the operations each button performs.\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Adds 2 to the number regardless of the light's color.\n   - **B**: Subtracts 1 from the number only when the light is green.\n   - **C**: Multiplies the number by 2 only when the light is green.\n\n3. **Light Toggle**:\n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n4. **Objective**:\n   - Reach the number 16 with the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n5. **Strategy**:\n   - Since button C (multiply by 2) is only available when the light is green, we should aim to use it effectively to reach higher numbers quickly.\n   - Button A can be used to increment the number by 2, which is useful for reaching even numbers that can be doubled.\n   - Button B is less useful initially since it subtracts, but it might be useful for fine-tuning the number if we overshoot.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Press A: Number becomes 2, light toggles to green.\n   - Press C: Number becomes 4 (2 * 2), light toggles to red.\n   - Press A: Number becomes 6, light toggles to green.\n   - Press C: Number becomes 12 (6 * 2), light toggles to red.\n   - Press A: Number becomes 14, light toggles to green.\n   - Press A: Number becomes 16, light toggles to red.\n\n7. **Sequence of Button Presses**:\n   - The sequence of button presses to reach the target number 16 is: A → C → A → C → A → A.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 16 is:\n\n<<<A → C → A → C → A → A>>>"
