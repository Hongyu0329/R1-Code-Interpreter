    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8), while considering the effect of each button on the light and the number.\n\n### Initial Setup:\n- **Start Number**: 0\n- **Target Number**: 8\n- **Initial Light State**: Red\n\n### Button Functions:\n- **Button A**: Subtract 1 (only when the light is green)\n- **Button B**: Add 1 (only when the light is green)\n- **Button C**: Add 1 (regardless of the light state)\n\n### Light Behavior:\n- The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Understand the Light Toggle**: Each button press toggles the light. Starting with red, the first press will turn it green, the second press will turn it red again, and so on.\n2. **Use Button C to Increment**: Since Button C adds 1 regardless of the light state, it is the most straightforward way to increase the number.\n3. **Calculate the Sequence**: We need to reach the target number 8 starting from 0. Since Button C always adds 1, we can use it repeatedly to reach the target.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n- **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n- **Press C**: Number = 1, Light = Green\n- **Press C**: Number = 2, Light = Red\n- **Press C**: Number = 3, Light = Green\n- **Press C**: Number = 4, Light = Red\n- **Press C**: Number = 5, Light = Green\n- **Press C**: Number = 6, Light = Red\n- **Press C**: Number = 7, Light = Green\n- **Press C**: Number = 8, Light = Red\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy pressing Button C eight times, we can reach the target number 8. This sequence is the shortest because each press of Button C consistently increases the number by 1, regardless of the light state.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C>>>"
