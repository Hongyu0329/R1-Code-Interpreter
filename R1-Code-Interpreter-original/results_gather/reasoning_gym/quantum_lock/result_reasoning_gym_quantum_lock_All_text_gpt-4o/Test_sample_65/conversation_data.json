    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (16). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but the operations themselves do not depend on the light's color. Therefore, we can focus solely on the numerical operations.\n\nLet's analyze the operations available:\n\n1. **Button A**: Subtract 2 from the current number.\n2. **Button B**: Add 1 to the current number.\n3. **Button C**: Multiply the current number by 2.\n\nThe goal is to reach the target number 16 from the starting number 0 using the shortest sequence of these operations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: We begin at 0 (red light).\n2. **Target**: We need to reach 16.\n\nSince multiplying by 2 (Button C) is the most efficient way to increase the number significantly, we should prioritize using Button C to quickly approach the target number. However, we must also consider the starting point and the need to reach exactly 16.\n\n- **Step 1**: Start at 0. Press Button B to add 1. Now the number is 1.\n- **Step 2**: Press Button C to multiply by 2. Now the number is 2.\n- **Step 3**: Press Button C again to multiply by 2. Now the number is 4.\n- **Step 4**: Press Button C again to multiply by 2. Now the number is 8.\n- **Step 5**: Press Button C again to multiply by 2. Now the number is 16.\n\nBy following these steps, we reach the target number 16 in the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 16 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n<<<B → C → C → C → C>>>"
