    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (14), while considering the state of the light (red or green) and the operations each button performs.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Start**: 0 (red)\n- **Target**: 14\n\n### Button Operations:\n- **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number, but only when the light is green.\n- **Button B**: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's color.\n- **Button C**: Adds 1 to the number, but only when the light is green.\n\n### Light Behavior:\n- The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Initial State**: Start at 0 with the light red.\n2. **Goal**: Reach 14 with the fewest button presses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Press Button C**: \n   - Current number: 0\n   - Light: red → green\n   - Operation: None (since C adds 1 only when green)\n\n2. **Press Button C**: \n   - Current number: 0 + 1 = 1\n   - Light: green → red\n   - Operation: Add 1 (since C adds 1 when green)\n\n3. **Press Button B**: \n   - Current number: 1 × 2 = 2\n   - Light: red → green\n   - Operation: Multiply by 2\n\n4. **Press Button A**: \n   - Current number: 2 + 2 = 4\n   - Light: green → red\n   - Operation: Add 2 (since A adds 2 when green)\n\n5. **Press Button B**: \n   - Current number: 4 × 2 = 8\n   - Light: red → green\n   - Operation: Multiply by 2\n\n6. **Press Button A**: \n   - Current number: 8 + 2 = 10\n   - Light: green → red\n   - Operation: Add 2 (since A adds 2 when green)\n\n7. **Press Button B**: \n   - Current number: 10 × 2 = 20\n   - Light: red → green\n   - Operation: Multiply by 2\n\n8. **Press Button C**: \n   - Current number: 20 + 1 = 21\n   - Light: green → red\n   - Operation: Add 1 (since C adds 1 when green)\n\n9. **Press Button A**: \n   - Current number: 21 + 2 = 23\n   - Light: red → green\n   - Operation: Add 2 (since A adds 2 when green)\n\n10. **Press Button B**: \n    - Current number: 23 × 2 = 46\n    - Light: green → red\n    - Operation: Multiply by 2\n\n11. **Press Button C**: \n    - Current number: 46 + 1 = 47\n    - Light: red → green\n    - Operation: Add 1 (since C adds 1 when green)\n\n12. **Press Button A**: \n    - Current number: 47 + 2 = 49\n    - Light: green → red\n    - Operation: Add 2 (since A adds 2 when green)\n\n13. **Press Button B**: \n    - Current number: 49 × 2 = 98\n    - Light: red → green\n    -
