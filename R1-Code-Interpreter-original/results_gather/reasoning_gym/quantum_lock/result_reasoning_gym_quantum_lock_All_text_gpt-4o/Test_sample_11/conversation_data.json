    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but the operations themselves do not depend on the light's color. Therefore, we can focus solely on the mathematical operations.\n\nLet's analyze the operations available:\n\n1. **Button A**: Subtract 2 from the current number.\n2. **Button B**: Multiply the current number by 2.\n3. **Button C**: Add 2 to the current number.\n\nWe start at 0 and need to reach 8. The operations are straightforward, and the light's color does not affect the operations themselves. We need to find the shortest sequence of operations to reach the target.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: 0 (red)\n2. **Target**: 8\n\n#### Possible Sequences:\n\n- **Using Button C (Add 2)**:\n  - 0 → C → 2\n  - 2 → C → 4\n  - 4 → C → 6\n  - 6 → C → 8\n\nThis sequence uses button C four times to reach the target.\n\n- **Using Button B (Multiply 2)**:\n  - 0 → C → 2\n  - 2 → B → 4\n  - 4 → B → 8\n\nThis sequence uses button C once and button B twice to reach the target.\n\n- **Using a Combination of Buttons**:\n  - 0 → C → 2\n  - 2 → C → 4\n  - 4 → C → 6\n  - 6 → C → 8\n\nThis sequence is the same as the first one, using button C four times.\n\n- **Another Combination**:\n  - 0 → B → 0 (no change)\n  - 0 → C → 2\n  - 2 → B → 4\n  - 4 → B → 8\n\nThis sequence is longer than the second sequence.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe shortest sequence to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0 is to use button C once to add 2, and then use button B twice to multiply by 2. This results in the sequence:\n\n0 → C → 2 → B → 4 → B → 8\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<C → B → B>>>"
