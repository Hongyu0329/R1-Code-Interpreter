  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 19\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when any)\nB: Subtract 3 (when any)\nC: Multiply 3 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (19). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but in this case, the operations are independent of the light's state. Therefore, we can focus solely on the mathematical operations.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n- Button A: Add 2\n- Button B: Subtract 3\n- Button C: Multiply by 3\n\nWe start at 0 and need to reach 19. We will explore the possible sequences of operations step by step:\n\n1. **Starting at 0:**\n   - We can press Button A to add 2, resulting in 2.\n   - We can press Button C to multiply by 3, resulting in 0 (since 0 multiplied by any number is 0).\n   - Pressing Button B would result in -3, which is not helpful as we need to increase the number.\n\n2. **From 0, press A:**\n   - Result: 2\n\n3. **From 2, press C:**\n   - Result: 2 * 3 = 6\n\n4. **From 6, press C again:**\n   - Result: 6 * 3 = 18\n\n5. **From 18, press A:**\n   - Result: 18 + 2 = 20\n\n6. **From 20, press B:**\n   - Result: 20 - 3 = 17\n\n7. **From 17, press A:**\n   - Result: 17 + 2 = 19\n\nNow, let's summarize the sequence of button presses:\n- Start at 0\n- Press A to get 2\n- Press C to get 6\n- Press C to get 18\n- Press A to get 20\n- Press B to get 17\n- Press A to get 19\n\nThis sequence is the shortest path to reach the target number 19 from the starting number 0.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<A → C → C → A → B → A>>>"
