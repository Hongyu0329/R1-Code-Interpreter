  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when red)\nB: Multiply 2 (when any)\nC: Multiply 2 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8), while considering the state of the light (red or green) and the operations each button performs.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target**: \n   - Number: 8\n\n3. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Adds 2 to the number if the light is red. Toggling the light.\n   - **B**: Multiplies the number by 2 regardless of the light's color. Toggling the light.\n   - **C**: Multiplies the number by 2 if the light is green. Toggling the light.\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - We start at 0 with the light red. The only operation that can change the number from 0 is button A, which adds 2.\n   - After pressing A, the number becomes 2, and the light turns green.\n   - With the light green, we can use button C to multiply the number by 2.\n   - After pressing C, the number becomes 4, and the light turns red.\n   - With the light red, we can use button B to multiply the number by 2.\n   - After pressing B, the number becomes 8, and the light turns green.\n\n5. **Sequence of Button Presses**:\n   - Start: 0 (red)\n   - Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (green)\n   - Press C: 2 * 2 = 4 (red)\n   - Press B: 4 * 2 = 8 (green)\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 is:\n\n<<<A → C → B>>>"
