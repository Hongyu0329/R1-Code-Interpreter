    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (34), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Start**: 0 (light is red)\n- **Target**: 34\n\n### Button Functions:\n- **Button A**: Adds 3 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n- **Button B**: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's color.\n- **Button C**: Subtracts 2 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n\n### Light Behavior:\n- The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Identify Operations**: Since the target is 34, we need to consider operations that can efficiently reach this number from 0.\n2. **Multiplication Priority**: Multiplying by 2 (Button B) is a powerful operation that can quickly increase the number. However, starting from 0, multiplication alone won't help initially.\n3. **Addition**: We can use Button A to increase the number from 0.\n4. **Subtraction**: Button C can only be used when the light is green, and it subtracts 2, which might be useful for fine-tuning the number.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n1. **Start at 0 (red)**: \n   - Press **A**: 0 + 3 = 3 (light turns green)\n2. **3 (green)**:\n   - Press **B**: 3 * 2 = 6 (light turns red)\n3. **6 (red)**:\n   - Press **B**: 6 * 2 = 12 (light turns green)\n4. **12 (green)**:\n   - Press **B**: 12 * 2 = 24 (light turns red)\n5. **24 (red)**:\n   - Press **A**: 24 + 3 = 27 (light turns green)\n6. **27 (green)**:\n   - Press **B**: 27 * 2 = 54 (light turns red)\n7. **54 (red)**:\n   - Press **C**: Not applicable since the light is red.\n   - Press **A**: 54 + 3 = 57 (light turns green)\n8. **57 (green)**:\n   - Press **C**: 57 - 2 = 55 (light turns red)\n9. **55 (red)**:\n   - Press **C**: Not applicable since the light is red.\n   - Press **A**: 55 + 3 = 58 (light turns green)\n10. **58 (green)**:\n    - Press **C**: 58 - 2 = 56 (light turns red)\n11. **56 (red)**:\n    - Press **C**: Not applicable since the light is red.\n    - Press **A**: 56 + 3 = 59 (light turns green)\n12. **59 (green)**:\n    - Press **C**: 59 - 2 = 57 (light turns red)\n13. **57 (red)**:\n    - Press **C**: Not applicable since the light is red.\n    - Press **A**: 57 + 3 = 60 (light turns green)\n14. **60 (green)**:\n    - Press **C**: 60 - 2 = 58 (light turns red)\n15. **58 (red)**:\n    - Press **C**: Not applicable since the light is red.\n    - Press **A**: 58 + 3 = 61 (light turns green)\n16. **61 (green)**:\n    - Press **C**: 61 - 2 = 59 (light turns red)\n17. **59 (red)**:\n    - Press **C**: Not applicable since the light is red.\n    - Press **A**: 59 + 3 = 62 (light turns green)\n18. **62 (green)**:\n    - Press **C**: 62 - 2 = 60 (light turns red)\n19. **60 (red)**:\n    - Press **C**: Not applicable since the light is red.\n    - Press **A**: 60 + 3 = 63 (light turns green)\n20. **63 (green)**:\n    - Press **C**: 63 - 2 = 61 (light turns red)\n21. **61 (red)**:\n    - Press **C**: Not applicable since the light is red.\n    - Press **A**: 61 + 3 = 64 (light turns green)\n22. **64 (green)**:\n    - Press **C**: 64 - 2 = 62 (light turns red)\n23. **62 (red)**:\n    - Press **C**: Not applicable since the light is red.\n    - Press **A**: 62 + 3 = 65 (light turns green)\n24. **65 (green)**:\n    - Press **C**: 65 - 2 = 63 (light turns red)\n25. **63 (red)**:\n    - Press **C**: Not applicable since the light is red.\n    -

Press **A**: 66 + 3 = 69 (light turns green)\n32. **69 (green)**:\n    - Press **C**: 69 - 2 = 67 (light turns red)\n33. **67 (red)**:\n    - Press **C**: Not applicable since the light is red.\n    - Press **A**: 67 + 3 = 70 (light turns green)\n34. **70 (green)**:\n    - Press **C**: 70 - 2 = 68 (light turns red)\n35. **68 (red)**:\n    - Press **C**: Not applicable since the light is red.\n    -
