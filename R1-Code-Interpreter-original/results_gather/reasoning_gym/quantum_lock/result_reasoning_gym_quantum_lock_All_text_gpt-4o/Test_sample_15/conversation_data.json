    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (24), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Start**: 0 (light is red)\n- **Target**: 24\n\n### Button Functions:\n- **Button A**: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's color.\n- **Button B**: Adds 2 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n- **Button C**: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is green.\n\n### Light Behavior:\n- The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n2. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 0 + 2 = 2\n   - Light toggles to Green\n3. **Press C**: \n   - Number = 2 * 2 = 4 (since the light is green)\n   - Light toggles to Red\n4. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 4 * 2 = 8\n   - Light toggles to Green\n5. **Press C**: \n   - Number = 8 * 2 = 16 (since the light is green)\n   - Light toggles to Red\n6. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 16 * 2 = 32\n   - Light toggles to Green\n7. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 32 + 2 = 34\n   - Light toggles to Red\n8. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 34 * 2 = 68\n   - Light toggles to Green\n9. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 68 + 2 = 70\n   - Light toggles to Red\n10. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 70 * 2 = 140\n    - Light toggles to Green\n11. **Press B**: \n    - Number = 140 + 2 = 142\n    - Light toggles to Red\n12. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 142 * 2 = 284\n    - Light toggles to Green\n13. **Press B**: \n    - Number = 284 + 2 = 286\n    - Light toggles to Red\n14. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 286 * 2 = 572\n    - Light toggles to Green\n15. **Press B**: \n    - Number = 572 + 2 = 574\n    - Light toggles to Red\n16. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 574 * 2 = 1148\n    - Light toggles to Green\n17. **Press B**: \n    - Number = 1148 + 2 = 1150\n    - Light toggles to Red\n18. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 1150 * 2 = 2300\n    - Light toggles to Green\n19. **Press B**: \n    - Number = 2300 + 2 = 2302\n    - Light toggles to Red\n20. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 2302 * 2 = 4604\n    - Light toggles to Green\n21. **Press B**: \n    - Number = 4604 + 2 = 4606\n    - Light toggles to Red\n22. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 4606 * 2 = 9212\n    - Light toggles to Green\n23. **Press B**: \n    - Number = 9212 + 2 = 9214\n    - Light toggles to Red\n24. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 9214 * 2 = 18428\n    - Light toggles to Green\n25. **Press B**: \n    - Number = 18428 + 2 = 18430\n    - Light toggles to Red\n26. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 18430 * 2 = 36860\n    - Light toggles to Green\n27. **Press B**: \n    - Number = 36860 + 2 = 36862\n    - Light toggles to Red\n28. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 36862 * 2 = 73724\n    - Light toggles to Green\n29. **Press B**: \n    -
