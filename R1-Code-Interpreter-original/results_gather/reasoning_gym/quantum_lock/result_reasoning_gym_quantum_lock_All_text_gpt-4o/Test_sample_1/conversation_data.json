    "To solve this problem, we need to reach the target number 46 starting from 0 by pressing a sequence of buttons. The light starts as red, and each button press toggles the light between red and green. We need to carefully consider the operations each button performs based on the light's color.\n\nLet's analyze each button:\n- **Button A**: Multiplies the current number by 3, regardless of the light's color.\n- **Button B**: Subtracts 2 from the current number, but only when the light is green.\n- **Button C**: Adds 3 to the current number, but only when the light is red.\n\nThe initial state is 0 with the light red. Our goal is to reach 46.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Start at 0 (red)**:\n   - We can only use Button C to add 3 because the light is red.\n   - Press C: 0 + 3 = 3 (light toggles to green)\n\n2. **Current state: 3 (green)**:\n   - We cannot use Button C because the light is green.\n   - We can use Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to subtract 2.\n   - Press A: 3 * 3 = 9 (light toggles to red)\n\n3. **Current state: 9 (red)**:\n   - We can use Button C to add 3.\n   - Press C: 9 + 3 = 12 (light toggles to green)\n\n4. **Current state: 12 (green)**:\n   - We can use Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to subtract 2.\n   - Press A: 12 * 3 = 36 (light toggles to red)\n\n5. **Current state: 36 (red)**:\n   - We can use Button C to add 3.\n   - Press C: 36 + 3 = 39 (light toggles to green)\n\n6. **Current state: 39 (green)**:\n   - We can use Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to subtract 2.\n   - Press B: 39 - 2 = 37 (light toggles to red)\n\n7. **Current state: 37 (red)**:\n   - We can use Button C to add 3.\n   - Press C: 37 + 3 = 40 (light toggles to green)\n\n8. **Current state: 40 (green)**:\n   - We can use Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to subtract 2.\n   - Press B: 40 - 2 = 38 (light toggles to red)\n\n9. **Current state: 38 (red)**:\n   - We can use Button C to add 3.\n   - Press C: 38 + 3 = 41 (light toggles to green)\n\n10. **Current state: 41 (green)**:\n    - We can use Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to subtract 2.\n    - Press B: 41 - 2 = 39 (light toggles to red)\n\n11. **Current state: 39 (red)**:\n    - We can use Button C to add 3.\n    - Press C: 39 + 3 = 42 (light toggles to green)\n\n12. **Current state: 42 (green)**:\n    - We can use Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to subtract 2.\n    - Press B: 42 - 2 = 40 (light toggles to red)\n\n13. **Current state: 40 (red)**:\n    - We can use Button C to add 3.\n    - Press C: 40 + 3 = 43 (light toggles to green)\n\n14. **Current state: 43 (green)**:\n    - We can use Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to subtract 2.\n    - Press B: 43 - 2 = 41 (light toggles to red)\n\n15. **Current state: 41 (red)**:\n    - We can use Button C to add 3.\n    - Press C: 41 + 3 = 44 (light toggles to green)\n\n16. **Current state: 44 (green)**:\n    - We can use Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to subtract 2.\n    - Press B: 44 - 2 = 42 (light toggles to red)\n\n17. **Current state: 42 (red)**:\n    - We can use Button C to add 3.\n    - Press C: 42 + 3 = 45 (light toggles to green)\n\n18. **Current state: 45 (green)**:\n    - We can use Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to subtract 2.\n    - Press B: 45 - 2 = 43 (light toggles to red)\n\n19. **Current state: 43 (red)**:\n    - We can use Button C to add 3.\n    - Press C: 43 + 3 = 46 (light toggles to green)\n\nNow we have reached the target value of 46. The sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<C → A → C → A → C → B → C → B → C → B → C → B → C → B → C → B → C>>>"
