    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (9). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but in this case, the color of the light does not affect the operations of the buttons. Each button performs the same operation regardless of the light's color.\n\nLet's analyze the operations of each button:\n- Button A: Adds 1 to the current number.\n- Button B: Adds 2 to the current number.\n- Button C: Subtracts 1 from the current number.\n\nThe goal is to reach the target number 9 from the starting number 0 using the fewest button presses. \n\n1. **Initial State**: Start at 0 (red light).\n2. **Target State**: Reach 9.\n\nTo find the shortest sequence, we should aim to use the button that adds the most to the current number, which is Button B (Add 2), as much as possible. This will help us reach the target faster. \n\nLet's calculate the number of times we need to press each button:\n\n- If we press Button B four times, we add 8 to the starting number 0 (0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8).\n- We are now at 8, and we need to reach 9. We can press Button A once to add 1 (8 + 1 = 9).\n\nThus, the sequence of button presses is:\n- Press Button B four times: 0 → 2 → 4 → 6 → 8\n- Press Button A once: 8 → 9\n\nThis sequence uses a total of 5 button presses, which is the shortest possible sequence to reach the target number 9 from 0.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<B → B → B → B → A>>>"
