    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (13), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze each button:\n- **Button A**: Multiplies the current number by 2. This operation can be performed regardless of the light's color.\n- **Button B**: Adds 1 to the current number, but only when the light is red.\n- **Button C**: Subtracts 1 from the current number. This operation can be performed regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We start with the light being red.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Start**: 0 (red)\n   - We need to reach 13. Since 13 is odd, we cannot reach it directly by multiplying by 2 (as that would only yield even numbers). We need to use Button B to add 1 when the light is red.\n\n2. **Press B**: 0 + 1 = 1 (light toggles to green)\n   - Current number: 1 (green)\n\n3. **Press A**: 1 * 2 = 2 (light toggles to red)\n   - Current number: 2 (red)\n\n4. **Press A**: 2 * 2 = 4 (light toggles to green)\n   - Current number: 4 (green)\n\n5. **Press A**: 4 * 2 = 8 (light toggles to red)\n   - Current number: 8 (red)\n\n6. **Press B**: 8 + 1 = 9 (light toggles to green)\n   - Current number: 9 (green)\n\n7. **Press A**: 9 * 2 = 18 (light toggles to red)\n   - Current number: 18 (red)\n\n8. **Press C**: 18 - 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n   - Current number: 17 (green)\n\n9. **Press C**: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n   - Current number: 16 (red)\n\n10. **Press C**: 16 - 1 = 15 (light toggles to green)\n    - Current number: 15 (green)\n\n11. **Press C**: 15 - 1 = 14 (light toggles to red)\n    - Current number: 14 (red)\n\n12. **Press C**: 14 - 1 = 13 (light toggles to green)\n    - Current number: 13 (green)\n\nWe have reached the target number 13. The sequence of button presses is:\n\n**Answer**: <<<B → A → A → A → B → A → C → C → C → C → C>>>"
