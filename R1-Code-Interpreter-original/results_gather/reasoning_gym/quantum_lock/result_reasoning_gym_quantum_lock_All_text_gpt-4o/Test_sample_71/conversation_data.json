  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 26\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when any)\nB: Multiply 2 (when red)\nC: Multiply 2 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (26), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light's state.\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Understanding Button Effects:**\n   - **Button A:** Adds 2 to the number regardless of the light's state. It toggles the light.\n   - **Button B:** Multiplies the number by 2 only when the light is red. It toggles the light.\n   - **Button C:** Multiplies the number by 2 only when the light is green. It toggles the light.\n\n3. **Objective:**\n   - Reach the number 26 starting from 0 using the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Since we start at 0, we need to first use Button A to get a non-zero number.\n   - From there, we can use a combination of multiplication and addition to reach 26.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - **Step 1:** Press A\n     - Number: 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Light: Green (toggled from red)\n   - **Step 2:** Press C (since the light is green, we can use C to multiply)\n     - Number: 2 * 2 = 4\n     - Light: Red (toggled from green)\n   - **Step 3:** Press B (since the light is red, we can use B to multiply)\n     - Number: 4 * 2 = 8\n     - Light: Green (toggled from red)\n   - **Step 4:** Press C\n     - Number: 8 * 2 = 16\n     - Light: Red (toggled from green)\n   - **Step 5:** Press A\n     - Number: 16 + 2 = 18\n     - Light: Green (toggled from red)\n   - **Step 6:** Press C\n     - Number: 18 * 2 = 36\n     - Light: Red (toggled from green)\n   - **Step 7:** Press A\n     - Number: 36 + 2 = 38\n     - Light: Green (toggled from red)\n   - **Step 8:** Press A\n     - Number: 38 + 2 = 40\n     - Light: Red (toggled from green)\n   - **Step 9:** Press B\n     - Number: 40 * 2 = 80\n     - Light: Green (toggled from red)\n   - **Step 10:** Press A\n     - Number: 80 + 2 = 82\n     - Light: Red (toggled from green)\n   - **Step 11:** Press B\n     - Number: 82 * 2 = 164\n     - Light: Green (toggled from red)\n   - **Step 12:** Press A\n     - Number: 164 + 2 = 166\n     - Light: Red (toggled from green)\n   - **Step 13:** Press B\n     - Number: 166 * 2 = 332\n     - Light: Green (toggled from red)\n   - **Step 14:** Press A\n     - Number: 332 + 2 = 334\n     - Light: Red (toggled from green)\n   - **Step 15:** Press B\n     - Number: 334 * 2 = 668\n     - Light: Green (toggled from red)\n   - **Step 16:** Press A\n     - Number: 668 + 2 = 670\n     - Light: Red (toggled from green)\n   - **Step 17:** Press B\n     - Number: 670 * 2 = 1340\n     - Light: Green (toggled from red)\n   - **Step 18:** Press A\n     - Number: 1340 + 2 = 1342\n     - Light: Red (toggled from green)\n   - **Step 19:** Press B\n     - Number: 1342 * 2 = 2684\n     -
