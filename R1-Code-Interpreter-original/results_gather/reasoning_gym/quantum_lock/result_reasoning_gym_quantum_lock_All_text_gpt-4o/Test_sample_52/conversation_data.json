Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 18\nButtons:\nA: Add 3 (when any)\nB: Multiply 2 (when green)\nC: Subtract 3 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (18), while considering the state of the light (red or green) and the operations each button performs.\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Start number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Button Operations:**\n   - **A**: Adds 3 to the number regardless of the light's color.\n   - **B**: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is green.\n   - **C**: Subtracts 3 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n\n3. **Objective:**\n   - Reach the target number 18 with the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Since button A can be used regardless of the light's color, it can be used to increment the number by 3 at any time.\n   - Button B is useful for quickly increasing the number, but it requires the light to be green.\n   - Button C is not useful for reaching a higher target number since it subtracts from the current number.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Press A: Number becomes 3, light toggles to green.\n   - Press B: Number becomes 6 (3 * 2), light toggles to red.\n   - Press A: Number becomes 9, light toggles to green.\n   - Press B: Number becomes 18 (9 * 2), light toggles to red.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The sequence of button presses to reach the target number 18 is A → B → A → B.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 18 is:\n\n<<<A → B → A → B>>>"
