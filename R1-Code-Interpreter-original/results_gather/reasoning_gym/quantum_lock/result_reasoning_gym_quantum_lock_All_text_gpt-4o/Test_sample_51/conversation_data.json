Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 24\nButtons:\nA: Add 3 (when any)\nB: Subtract 2 (when any)\nC: Multiply 2 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (24), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Button Effects:**\n   - **A:** Adds 3 to the number, toggles the light.\n   - **B:** Subtracts 2 from the number, toggles the light.\n   - **C:** Multiplies the number by 2, only when the light is green, and toggles the light.\n\n3. **Objective:**\n   - Reach the number 24 with the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Since button C can only be used when the light is green, we need to toggle the light to green before using it.\n   - Multiplying by 2 (button C) is a powerful operation that can quickly increase the number, so we should aim to use it effectively.\n   - We need to balance the use of buttons A and B to toggle the light and adjust the number to a state where using C will help us reach 24.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Press A: Number becomes 3, light toggles to green.\n   - Press C: Number becomes 6 (3 * 2), light toggles to red.\n   - Press A: Number becomes 9, light toggles to green.\n   - Press C: Number becomes 18 (9 * 2), light toggles to red.\n   - Press A: Number becomes 21, light toggles to green.\n   - Press A: Number becomes 24, light toggles to red.\n\n6. **Sequence of Button Presses:**\n   - A → C → A → C → A → A\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 24 is:\n\n<<<A → C → A → C → A → A>>>"
