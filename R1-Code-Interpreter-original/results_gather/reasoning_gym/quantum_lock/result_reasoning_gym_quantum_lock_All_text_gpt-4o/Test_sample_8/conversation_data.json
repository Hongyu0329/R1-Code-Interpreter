    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (26), while considering the state of the light (red or green) and the operations each button performs.\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Start number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Button Operations:**\n   - **Button A:** Adds 2 to the number regardless of the light's color.\n   - **Button B:** Adds 3 to the number only when the light is green.\n   - **Button C:** Subtracts 2 from the number only when the light is green.\n\n3. **Light Behavior:**\n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n4. **Objective:**\n   - Reach the target number 26 with the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - Since Button A works regardless of the light's color, it can be used to increment the number by 2 each time, toggling the light with each press.\n   - Button B can be used to add 3, but only when the light is green.\n   - Button C can be used to subtract 2, but only when the light is green.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Press A: Number becomes 2 (light toggles to green).\n   - Press B: Number becomes 5 (light toggles to red).\n   - Press A: Number becomes 7 (light toggles to green).\n   - Press B: Number becomes 10 (light toggles to red).\n   - Press A: Number becomes 12 (light toggles to green).\n   - Press B: Number becomes 15 (light toggles to red).\n   - Press A: Number becomes 17 (light toggles to green).\n   - Press B: Number becomes 20 (light toggles to red).\n   - Press A: Number becomes 22 (light toggles to green).\n   - Press B: Number becomes 25 (light toggles to red).\n   - Press A: Number becomes 27 (light toggles to green).\n   - Press C: Number becomes 25 (light toggles to red).\n   - Press A: Number becomes 27 (light toggles to green).\n   - Press C: Number becomes 25 (light toggles to red).\n   - Press A: Number becomes 27 (light toggles to green).\n   - Press C: Number becomes 25 (light toggles to red).\n   - Press A: Number becomes 27 (light toggles to green).\n   - Press C: Number becomes 25 (light toggles to red).\n   -
