  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Multiply 2 (when any)\nB: Add 1 (when green)\nC: Subtract 1 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Multiplies the number by 2. This operation can be performed regardless of the light's color. Pressing this button will toggle the light.\n\n2. **Button B**: Adds 1 to the number, but only when the light is green. Pressing this button will toggle the light.\n\n3. **Button C**: Subtracts 1 from the number. This operation can be performed regardless of the light's color. Pressing this button will toggle the light.\n\nThe initial state is 0 with the light being red. The target is to reach the number 8.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Start at 0 (red)**:\n   - We need to increase the number, so we should aim to use Button A to multiply and Button B to add when possible.\n\n2. **Press Button A**:\n   - Number: 0 * 2 = 0\n   - Light: red → green\n\n3. **Press Button B** (since the light is green):\n   - Number: 0 + 1 = 1\n   - Light: green → red\n\n4. **Press Button A**:\n   - Number: 1 * 2 = 2\n   - Light: red → green\n\n5. **Press Button A**:\n   - Number: 2 * 2 = 4\n   - Light: green → red\n\n6. **Press Button A**:\n   - Number: 4 * 2 = 8\n   - Light: red → green\n\nNow, the number is 8, which is the target value. The sequence of button presses is complete.\n\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value of 8 is:\n\n<<<A → B → A → A → A>>>"
