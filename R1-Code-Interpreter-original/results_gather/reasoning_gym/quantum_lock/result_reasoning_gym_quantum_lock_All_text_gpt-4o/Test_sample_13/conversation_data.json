  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 18\nButtons:\nA: Multiply 2 (when any)\nB: Subtract 2 (when green)\nC: Add 2 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (18), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Multiplies the number by 2. This operation is independent of the light's color.\n2. **Button B**: Subtracts 2 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n3. **Button C**: Adds 2 to the number. This operation is independent of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Start**: 0 (red)\n2. **Press C**: 0 + 2 = 2 (light toggles to green)\n3. **Press A**: 2 * 2 = 4 (light toggles to red)\n4. **Press A**: 4 * 2 = 8 (light toggles to green)\n5. **Press A**: 8 * 2 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n6. **Press C**: 16 + 2 = 18 (light toggles to green)\n\nWe have reached the target number 18. The sequence of button presses is:\n\n- C (0 to 2)\n- A (2 to 4)\n- A (4 to 8)\n- A (8 to 16)\n- C (16 to 18)\n\nThis sequence uses 5 button presses, which is the shortest path to reach the target number 18 from the starting number 0.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<C → A → A → A → C>>>"
