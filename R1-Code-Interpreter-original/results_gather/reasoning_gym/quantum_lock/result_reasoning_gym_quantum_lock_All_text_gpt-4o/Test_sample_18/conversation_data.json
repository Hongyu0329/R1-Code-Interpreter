  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 27\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 3 (when green)\nB: Add 3 (when green)\nC: Multiply 3 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (27), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Start**: 0 (light is red)\n- **Target**: 27\n\n### Button Operations:\n1. **Button A**: Subtract 3 (only when the light is green)\n2. **Button B**: Add 3 (only when the light is green)\n3. **Button C**: Multiply by 3 (works regardless of the light's color)\n\n### Light Behavior:\n- The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Objective**: \n   - Reach 27 using the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Since Button C can be used regardless of the light's color and multiplies the number by 3, it is a powerful tool for quickly increasing the number.\n   - We need to consider how to reach 27, which is a multiple of 3, using multiplication and addition.\n\n4. **Steps**:\n   - **Press C**: \n     - Number: 0 * 3 = 0\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 0 + 3 = 3\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press C**: \n     - Number: 3 * 3 = 9\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 9 + 3 = 12\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press C**: \n     - Number: 12 * 3 = 36\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 36 - 3 = 33\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 33 - 3 = 30\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 30 - 3 = 27\n     - Light: Red\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 27 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n<<<C → B → C → B → C → A → A → A>>>"
