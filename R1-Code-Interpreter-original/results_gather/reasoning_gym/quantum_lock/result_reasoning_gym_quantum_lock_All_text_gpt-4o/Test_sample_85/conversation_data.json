  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 16\nButtons:\nA: Add 1 (when any)\nB: Add 2 (when green)\nC: Multiply 2 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (16), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target**: \n   - Number: 16\n\n3. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Add 1 (works regardless of light color)\n   - **B**: Add 2 (only works when the light is green)\n   - **C**: Multiply by 2 (works regardless of light color)\n\n4. **Light Toggle**:\n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n5. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach 16 from 0.\n   - Multiplying by 2 (button C) is a powerful operation that can quickly increase the number, so it should be used strategically.\n   - Adding 1 (button A) can be used to adjust the number when needed.\n   - Adding 2 (button B) can be used when the light is green to make larger jumps.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Press C: 0 * 2 = 0 (light turns green).\n   - Press A: 0 + 1 = 1 (light turns red).\n   - Press C: 1 * 2 = 2 (light turns green).\n   - Press C: 2 * 2 = 4 (light turns red).\n   - Press C: 4 * 2 = 8 (light turns green).\n   - Press C: 8 * 2 = 16 (light turns red).\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The sequence of button presses to reach the target number 16 from 0 is: C → A → C → C → C → C.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<C → A → C → C → C → C>>>"
