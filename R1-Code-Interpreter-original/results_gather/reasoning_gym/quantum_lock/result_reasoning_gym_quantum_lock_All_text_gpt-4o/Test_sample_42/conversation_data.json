    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (43), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Start**: 0 (red light)\n- **Target**: 43\n\n### Button Functions:\n- **Button A**: Multiplies the number by 2. This operation is independent of the light's color.\n- **Button B**: Subtracts 2 from the number, but only when the light is red.\n- **Button C**: Adds 3 to the number. This operation is independent of the light's color.\n\n### Light Behavior:\n- The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Understand the Operations**:\n   - Multiplying by 2 (Button A) is a powerful operation for quickly increasing the number.\n   - Adding 3 (Button C) is useful for making small adjustments.\n   - Subtracting 2 (Button B) is only available when the light is red and can be used to correct overshoots.\n\n2. **Plan the Sequence**:\n   - Start with 0 (red light).\n   - Use Button C to increase the number to a manageable size.\n   - Use Button A to quickly increase the number by powers of 2.\n   - Use Button C to fine-tune the number to reach the target.\n   - Use Button B if necessary to adjust the number when the light is red.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. **Press C**: 0 + 3 = 3 (light turns green)\n2. **Press C**: 3 + 3 = 6 (light turns red)\n3. **Press A**: 6 * 2 = 12 (light turns green)\n4. **Press A**: 12 * 2 = 24 (light turns red)\n5. **Press A**: 24 * 2 = 48 (light turns green)\n6. **Press B**: 48 - 2 = 46 (light turns red)\n7. **Press B**: 46 - 2 = 44 (light turns green)\n8. **Press B**: 44 - 2 = 42 (light turns red)\n9. **Press C**: 42 + 3 = 45 (light turns green)\n10. **Press B**: 45 - 2 = 43 (light turns red)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 43 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n<<<C → C → A → A → A → B → B → B → C → B>>>"
