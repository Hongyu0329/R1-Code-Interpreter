    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (11), while considering the toggling of the light between red and green with each button press. The operations for each button are independent of the light's state, so we can focus solely on the numerical transformations.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target**: \n   - Number: 11\n\n3. **Available Operations**:\n   - Button A: Subtract 2\n   - Button B: Add 1\n   - Button C: Multiply by 2\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - Since the target number is 11, which is odd, and we start from 0, we need to use operations that can help us reach an odd number.\n   - Multiplying by 2 (Button C) is useful for quickly increasing the number, but it will always result in an even number if we start from 0.\n   - Adding 1 (Button B) is necessary to reach an odd number.\n   - Subtracting 2 (Button A) can be used to adjust the number if we overshoot.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start at 0 (Red).\n   - Press B: 0 + 1 = 1 (Light toggles to Green).\n   - Press C: 1 * 2 = 2 (Light toggles to Red).\n   - Press C: 2 * 2 = 4 (Light toggles to Green).\n   - Press C: 4 * 2 = 8 (Light toggles to Red).\n   - Press B: 8 + 1 = 9 (Light toggles to Green).\n   - Press B: 9 + 1 = 10 (Light toggles to Red).\n   - Press B: 10 + 1 = 11 (Light toggles to Green).\n\n6. **Sequence of Button Presses**:\n   - The sequence of button presses to reach the target number 11 is: B → C → C → C → B → B → B.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 11 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n<<<B → C → C → C → B → B → B>>>"
