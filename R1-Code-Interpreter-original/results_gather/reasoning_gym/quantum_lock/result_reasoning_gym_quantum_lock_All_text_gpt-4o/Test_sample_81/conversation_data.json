    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but the operations themselves are not dependent on the light's color. Therefore, we can focus solely on the mathematical operations.\n\nLet's analyze the operations available:\n\n1. **Button A**: Multiply the current number by 2.\n2. **Button B**: Add 1 to the current number.\n3. **Button C**: Subtract 2 from the current number.\n\nThe goal is to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0 using the shortest sequence of these operations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: 0 (red)\n2. **Target**: 8\n\n#### Strategy:\n- Since multiplying by 2 (Button A) can quickly increase the number, it is efficient to use it to reach numbers close to 8.\n- Adding 1 (Button B) can be used to fine-tune the number to exactly reach 8.\n- Subtracting 2 (Button C) is less useful in this context as it moves us away from the target.\n\n#### Sequence of Operations:\n\n1. **Press B**: 0 + 1 = 1 (light toggles to green)\n2. **Press A**: 1 * 2 = 2 (light toggles to red)\n3. **Press A**: 2 * 2 = 4 (light toggles to green)\n4. **Press A**: 4 * 2 = 8 (light toggles to red)\n\nWe have reached the target number 8 in four button presses. This sequence is efficient because it uses multiplication to quickly approach the target and only uses addition initially to get to a number that can be doubled effectively.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n<<<B → A → A → A>>>"
