    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (27), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\n### Initial Setup:\n- **Start Number**: 0\n- **Target Number**: 27\n- **Initial Light State**: Red\n\n### Button Operations:\n- **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number, but only when the light is green.\n- **Button B**: Subtracts 3 from the number, regardless of the light's state.\n- **Button C**: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's state.\n\n### Light Behavior:\n- The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Understand the Goal**: We need to reach 27 from 0 using the fewest button presses.\n2. **Consider the Light**: Since the light starts red, the first press will toggle it to green, allowing the use of Button A.\n3. **Use Multiplication**: Multiplying by 2 (Button C) is a powerful operation that can quickly increase the number.\n4. **Adjust with Addition**: Use Button A to fine-tune the number when the light is green.\n5. **Avoid Negative Numbers**: Be cautious with Button B, as it subtracts and can lead to negative numbers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Press C**: \n   - Start: 0 (red) → Press C → 0 (green)\n   - The number remains 0, but the light is now green.\n\n2. **Press A**: \n   - 0 (green) → Press A → 2 (red)\n   - Add 2 to the number, resulting in 2.\n\n3. **Press C**: \n   - 2 (red) → Press C → 4 (green)\n   - Multiply by 2, resulting in 4.\n\n4. **Press C**: \n   - 4 (green) → Press C → 8 (red)\n   - Multiply by 2, resulting in 8.\n\n5. **Press C**: \n   - 8 (red) → Press C → 16 (green)\n   - Multiply by 2, resulting in 16.\n\n6. **Press A**: \n   - 16 (green) → Press A → 18 (red)\n   - Add 2 to the number, resulting in 18.\n\n7. **Press C**: \n   - 18 (red) → Press C → 36 (green)\n   - Multiply by 2, resulting in 36.\n\n8. **Press B**: \n   - 36 (green) → Press B → 33 (red)\n   - Subtract 3, resulting in 33.\n\n9. **Press B**: \n   - 33 (red) → Press B → 30 (green)\n   - Subtract 3, resulting in 30.\n\n10. **Press B**: \n    - 30 (green) → Press B → 27 (red)\n    - Subtract 3, resulting in 27, which is the target number.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 27 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n<<<C → A → C → C → C → A → C → B → B → B>>>"
