Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when any)\nB: Add 1 (when any)\nC: Add 2 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8), while considering the effect of each button on the light and the number.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Start**: 0 (red)\n- **Target**: 8\n\n### Button Functions:\n- **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number regardless of the light's color. The light toggles between red and green.\n- **Button B**: Adds 1 to the number regardless of the light's color. The light toggles between red and green.\n- **Button C**: Adds 2 to the number only when the light is green. The light toggles between red and green.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n2. **Objective**: Reach the number 8 with the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Since Button A always adds 2, it is efficient for making larger jumps towards the target.\n- Button B adds 1, useful for odd numbers or when a single increment is needed.\n- Button C can be used when the light is green to add 2, but it requires the light to be in the correct state.\n\n### Sequence Exploration:\n1. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 2, Light = Green\n2. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 4, Light = Red\n3. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 6, Light = Green\n4. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 8, Light = Red\n\n### Verification:\n- Each press of Button A adds 2 to the number and toggles the light.\n- After four presses of Button A, the number reaches 8, which is the target.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0 is four presses of Button A.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<A → A → A → A>>>"
