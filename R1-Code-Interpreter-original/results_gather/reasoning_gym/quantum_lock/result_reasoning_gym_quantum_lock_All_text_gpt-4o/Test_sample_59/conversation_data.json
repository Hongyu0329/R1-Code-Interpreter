Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when any)\nB: Multiply 2 (when green)\nC: Multiply 2 (when red)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8), while considering the state of the light (red or green) and the operations each button performs.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target**: \n   - Number: 8\n\n3. **Button Operations**:\n   - **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n   - **Button B**: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is green.\n   - **Button C**: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is red.\n\n4. **Light Behavior**:\n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n5. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 from 0.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - **Step 1**: Start at 0 (red). Press Button A.\n     - Number becomes 0 + 2 = 2.\n     - Light toggles to green.\n   - **Step 2**: Number is 2 (green). Press Button B.\n     - Number becomes 2 * 2 = 4.\n     - Light toggles to red.\n   - **Step 3**: Number is 4 (red). Press Button C.\n     - Number becomes 4 * 2 = 8.\n     - Light toggles to green.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - We have reached the target number 8 in three steps.\n   - The sequence of button presses is A → B → C.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 is:\n\n<<<A → B → C>>>"
