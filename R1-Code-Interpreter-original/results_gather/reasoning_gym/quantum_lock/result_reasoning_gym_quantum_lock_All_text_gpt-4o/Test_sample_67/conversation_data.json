Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 27\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 2 (when green)\nB: Add 2 (when any)\nC: Add 3 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (27), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Button Effects**:\n   - **Button A**: Subtracts 2, but only when the light is green.\n   - **Button B**: Adds 2, regardless of the light's color.\n   - **Button C**: Adds 3, but only when the light is green.\n\n3. **Light Toggle**:\n   - Pressing any button toggles the light between red and green.\n\n4. **Objective**:\n   - Reach the number 27 with the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n5. **Strategy**:\n   - Since Button B can be used regardless of the light's color, it is the most versatile for increasing the number.\n   - Button C is more efficient than Button B when the light is green, as it adds 3 instead of 2.\n   - Button A is not useful for reaching a positive target number, as it subtracts from the total.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Press Button B: Number becomes 2, light toggles to green.\n   - Press Button C: Number becomes 5, light toggles to red.\n   - Press Button B: Number becomes 7, light toggles to green.\n   - Press Button C: Number becomes 10, light toggles to red.\n   - Press Button B: Number becomes 12, light toggles to green.\n   - Press Button C: Number becomes 15, light toggles to red.\n   - Press Button B: Number becomes 17, light toggles to green.\n   - Press Button C: Number becomes 20, light toggles to red.\n   - Press Button B: Number becomes 22, light toggles to green.\n   - Press Button C: Number becomes 25, light toggles to red.\n   - Press Button B: Number becomes 27, light toggles to green.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The sequence of button presses that achieves the target number 27 is: B → C → B → C → B → C → B → C → B → C → B.\n\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 27 is: <<<B → C → B → C → B → C → B → C → B → C → B>>>"
