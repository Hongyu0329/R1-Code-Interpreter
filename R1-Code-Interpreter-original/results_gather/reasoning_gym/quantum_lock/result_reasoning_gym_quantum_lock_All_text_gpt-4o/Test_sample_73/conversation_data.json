    "To solve this problem, we need to reach the target number 36 starting from 0 by pressing a sequence of buttons. The light starts as red, and each button press toggles the light between red and green. We need to carefully consider the operations each button performs based on the light's color.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons:\n\n1. **Button A**: Adds 3 to the number regardless of the light's color. This is a consistent operation.\n2. **Button B**: Adds 3 to the number only when the light is green. This means it can only be used effectively when the light is green.\n3. **Button C**: Subtracts 3 from the number only when the light is red. This means it can only be used effectively when the light is red.\n\nThe light starts as red, and we need to reach 36. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n\n2. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 0 + 3 = 3\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n3. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 3 + 3 = 6\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n4. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 6 + 3 = 9\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n5. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 9 + 3 = 12\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n6. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 12 + 3 = 15\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n7. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 15 + 3 = 18\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n8. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 18 + 3 = 21\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n9. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 21 + 3 = 24\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n10. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 24 + 3 = 27\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n11. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 27 + 3 = 30\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n12. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 30 + 3 = 33\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n13. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 33 + 3 = 36\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\nWe have reached the target number 36. The sequence of button presses is all A, as it consistently adds 3 regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target is:\n\n<<<A → A → A → A → A → A → A → A → A → A → A → A>>>"
