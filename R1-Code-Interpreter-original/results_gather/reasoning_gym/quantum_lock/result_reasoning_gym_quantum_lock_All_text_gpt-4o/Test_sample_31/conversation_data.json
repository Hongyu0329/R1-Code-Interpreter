    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (31), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\n### Initial Setup:\n- **Start Number**: 0\n- **Target Number**: 31\n- **Initial Light State**: Red\n\n### Button Operations:\n- **Button A**: Subtract 2, but only when the light is green.\n- **Button B**: Subtract 2, regardless of the light's state.\n- **Button C**: Add 3, regardless of the light's state.\n\n### Light Behavior:\n- The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Understand the Light Toggle**: Each button press changes the light's state. Starting from red, the first press will turn it green, the second press will turn it red again, and so on.\n\n2. **Determine Effective Operations**:\n   - **Button A**: Only effective when the light is green. Since it subtracts 2, it can only be used every second press.\n   - **Button B**: Always subtracts 2, regardless of the light's state.\n   - **Button C**: Always adds 3, regardless of the light's state.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Since the target is 31, which is an odd number, and we start at 0, we need to use Button C (which adds 3) to reach an odd number.\n   - Button B can be used to decrease the number by 2, which is useful for fine-tuning the number to reach exactly 31.\n   - Button A is less useful initially because it requires the light to be green and only subtracts 2, which is not directly helpful in reaching an odd number from 0.\n\n4. **Construct the Sequence**:\n   - Start by using Button C to increase the number towards 31.\n   - Use Button B to adjust the number as needed to reach exactly 31.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Press C**: 0 + 3 = 3 (Light: Green)\n2. **Press C**: 3 + 3 = 6 (Light: Red)\n3. **Press C**: 6 + 3 = 9 (Light: Green)\n4. **Press C**: 9 + 3 = 12 (Light: Red)\n5. **Press C**: 12 + 3 = 15 (Light: Green)\n6. **Press C**: 15 + 3 = 18 (Light: Red)\n7. **Press C**: 18 + 3 = 21 (Light: Green)\n8. **Press C**: 21 + 3 = 24 (Light: Red)\n9. **Press C**: 24 + 3 = 27 (Light: Green)\n10. **Press C**: 27 + 3 = 30 (Light: Red)\n11. **Press C**: 30 + 3 = 33 (Light: Green)\n12. **Press B**: 33 - 2 = 31 (Light: Red)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 31 from 0 is:\n\n<<<C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → B>>>"
