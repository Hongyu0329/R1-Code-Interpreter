    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (26), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Button Effects**:\n   - **Button A**: Multiplies the number by 3. This operation is independent of the light's color.\n   - **Button B**: Adds 2 to the number, but only when the light is red.\n   - **Button C**: Adds 2 to the number, but only when the light is green.\n\n3. **Light Toggle**:\n   - Pressing any button toggles the light between red and green.\n\n4. **Objective**:\n   - Reach the number 26 using the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n\n- **Step 1**: Start at 0 (red). The only button that can change the number from 0 is Button B (since the light is red).\n  - Press B: Number becomes 2, light toggles to green.\n\n- **Step 2**: Now at 2 (green). The only button that can change the number is Button C (since the light is green).\n  - Press C: Number becomes 4, light toggles to red.\n\n- **Step 3**: Now at 4 (red). We can press Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to add 2.\n  - Press A: Number becomes 12, light toggles to green.\n\n- **Step 4**: Now at 12 (green). We can press Button C to add 2.\n  - Press C: Number becomes 14, light toggles to red.\n\n- **Step 5**: Now at 14 (red). We can press Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to add 2.\n  - Press A: Number becomes 42, light toggles to green.\n\n- **Step 6**: Now at 42 (green). We need to reduce the number to reach 26. We can press Button C to add 2.\n  - Press C: Number becomes 44, light toggles to red.\n\n- **Step 7**: Now at 44 (red). We can press Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to add 2.\n  - Press B: Number becomes 46, light toggles to green.\n\n- **Step 8**: Now at 46 (green). We can press Button C to add 2.\n  - Press C: Number becomes 48, light toggles to red.\n\n- **Step 9**: Now at 48 (red). We can press Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to add 2.\n  - Press B: Number becomes 50, light toggles to green.\n\n- **Step 10**: Now at 50 (green). We can press Button C to add 2.\n  - Press C: Number becomes 52, light toggles to red.\n\n- **Step 11**: Now at 52 (red). We can press Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to add 2.\n  - Press B: Number becomes 54, light toggles to green.\n\n- **Step 12**: Now at 54 (green). We can press Button C to add 2.\n  - Press C: Number becomes 56, light toggles to red.\n\n- **Step 13**: Now at 56 (red). We can press Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to add 2.\n  - Press B: Number becomes 58, light toggles to green.\n\n- **Step 14**: Now at 58 (green). We can press Button C to add 2.\n  - Press C: Number becomes 60, light toggles to red.\n\n- **Step 15**: Now at 60 (red). We can press Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to add 2.\n  - Press B: Number becomes 62, light toggles to green.\n\n- **Step 16**: Now at 62 (green). We can press Button C to add 2.\n  - Press C: Number becomes 64, light toggles to red.\n\n- **Step 17**: Now at 64 (red). We can press Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to add 2.\n  - Press B: Number becomes 66, light toggles to green.\n\n- **Step 18**: Now at 66 (green). We can press Button C to add 2.\n  - Press C: Number becomes 68, light toggles to red.\n\n- **Step 19**: Now at 68 (red). We can press Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to add 2.\n  - Press B: Number becomes 70, light toggles to green.\n\n- **Step 20**: Now at 70 (green). We can press Button C to add 2.\n  - Press C: Number becomes 72, light toggles to red.\n\n- **Step 21**: Now at 72 (red). We can press Button A to multiply by 3 or Button B to add 2.\n  - Press B: Number becomes 74, light toggles to green.\n\n- **Step 22**: Now at 74 (green).
