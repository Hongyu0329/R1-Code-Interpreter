Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 14\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 1 (when any)\nB: Add 2 (when any)\nC: Subtract 2 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (14), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Subtracts 1 from the number, regardless of the light's color. It toggles the light between red and green.\n\n2. **Button B**: Adds 2 to the number, regardless of the light's color. It also toggles the light between red and green.\n\n3. **Button C**: Subtracts 2 from the number, but only when the light is green. It toggles the light between red and green.\n\nThe initial state is 0 with the light being red. The target is to reach 14.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Start at 0 (red)**:\n   - We need to increase the number to reach 14. Button B is the only button that increases the number, so we should start with it.\n\n2. **Press B**:\n   - Number: 0 + 2 = 2\n   - Light: Red → Green\n\n3. **Press B again**:\n   - Number: 2 + 2 = 4\n   - Light: Green → Red\n\n4. **Press B again**:\n   - Number: 4 + 2 = 6\n   - Light: Red → Green\n\n5. **Press B again**:\n   - Number: 6 + 2 = 8\n   - Light: Green → Red\n\n6. **Press B again**:\n   - Number: 8 + 2 = 10\n   - Light: Red → Green\n\n7. **Press B again**:\n   - Number: 10 + 2 = 12\n   - Light: Green → Red\n\n8. **Press B again**:\n   - Number: 12 + 2 = 14\n   - Light: Red → Green\n\nAt this point, we have reached the target number 14. The sequence of button presses is all B, and the light toggles between red and green with each press.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n<<<B → B → B → B → B → B>>>"
