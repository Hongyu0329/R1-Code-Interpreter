  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 9\nButtons:\nA: Add 1 (when any)\nB: Multiply 2 (when green)\nC: Subtract 1 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (9), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Button Operations**:\n   - **Button A**: Adds 1 to the number regardless of the light's color.\n   - **Button B**: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is green.\n   - **Button C**: Subtracts 1 from the number regardless of the light's color.\n\n3. **Light Toggle**:\n   - Pressing any button toggles the light between red and green.\n\n4. **Objective**:\n   - Reach the target number 9 from the starting number 0 using the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n5. **Strategy**:\n   - Since Button B is only effective when the light is green, we need to ensure the light is green before using it.\n   - We can use Button A to increment the number and toggle the light.\n   - We can use Button C to decrement the number and toggle the light, but this is less useful for reaching a higher target number.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Press A: Number becomes 1, light becomes green.\n   - Press B: Number becomes 2 (1 * 2), light becomes red.\n   - Press A: Number becomes 3, light becomes green.\n   - Press B: Number becomes 6 (3 * 2), light becomes red.\n   - Press A: Number becomes 7, light becomes green.\n   - Press A: Number becomes 8, light becomes red.\n   - Press A: Number becomes 9, light becomes green.\n\n7. **Sequence of Button Presses**:\n   - A → B → A → B → A → A → A\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 9 is:\n\n<<<A → B → A → B → A → A → A>>>"
