    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (30). The light starts as red, and each button press will toggle the light between red and green. We need to consider the operations each button performs based on the light's color.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: \n   - Adds 2 to the number when the light is red.\n   - Toggles the light to green.\n\n2. **Button B**: \n   - Multiplies the number by 2 regardless of the light's color.\n   - Toggles the light's color.\n\n3. **Button C**: \n   - Adds 2 to the number when the light is green.\n   - Toggles the light to red.\n\nNow, let's find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 30 from the starting number 0:\n\n1. **Start**: 0 (red)\n   - Press **A**: 0 + 2 = 2 (light turns green)\n\n2. **Current**: 2 (green)\n   - Press **B**: 2 * 2 = 4 (light turns red)\n\n3. **Current**: 4 (red)\n   - Press **A**: 4 + 2 = 6 (light turns green)\n\n4. **Current**: 6 (green)\n   - Press **B**: 6 * 2 = 12 (light turns red)\n\n5. **Current**: 12 (red)\n   - Press **A**: 12 + 2 = 14 (light turns green)\n\n6. **Current**: 14 (green)\n   - Press **B**: 14 * 2 = 28 (light turns red)\n\n7. **Current**: 28 (red)\n   - Press **A**: 28 + 2 = 30 (light turns green)\n\nWe have reached the target number 30. The sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<A → B → A → B → A → B → A>>>"
