Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value.

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (9). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but in this case, the color of the light does not affect the operations of the buttons. Each button performs the same operation regardless of the light's color.\n\nLet's analyze the operations of each button:\n- Button A: Adds 1 to the current number.\n- Button B: Adds 2 to the current number.\n- Button C: Subtracts 1 from the current number.\n\nThe goal is to reach the target number 9 from the starting number 0 using the fewest button presses. We can achieve this by maximizing the increase in the number with each press.\n\n1. **Initial State**: Start at 0 (red light).\n2. **Objective**: Reach 9.\n\nTo reach 9 efficiently:\n- Using Button B (Add 2) is more efficient than using Button A (Add 1) because it increases the number by a larger amount with each press.\n- We can use Button B as many times as possible to get close to 9, then use Button A to reach exactly 9.\n\nLet's calculate the steps:\n1. Press Button B: 0 + 2 = 2\n2. Press Button B: 2 + 2 = 4\n3. Press Button B: 4 + 2 = 6\n4. Press Button B: 6 + 2 = 8\n5. Press Button A: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nThis sequence uses 5 button presses, which is the shortest possible sequence to reach the target number 9 from 0.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses is: <<<B → B → B → B → A>>>"
