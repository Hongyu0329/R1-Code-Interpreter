    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (15), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\n### Initial Setup:\n- **Start Number**: 0\n- **Target Number**: 15\n- **Initial Light State**: Red\n\n### Button Operations:\n1. **Button A**: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's color.\n2. **Button B**: Adds 1 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n3. **Button C**: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is green.\n\n### Light Behavior:\n- The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Understand the Goal**: We need to reach 15 from 0 using the fewest button presses.\n2. **Consider Light State**: Since the light toggles with each press, we must account for the light's state to use Button C effectively.\n3. **Efficient Operations**: Multiplying by 2 is more efficient than adding 1, so we should prioritize using Button A and Button C when possible.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Start at 0 (Red)**:\n   - Press **B**: 0 + 1 = 1 (Light turns Green)\n   \n2. **Number is 1 (Green)**:\n   - Press **C**: 1 * 2 = 2 (Light turns Red)\n   \n3. **Number is 2 (Red)**:\n   - Press **A**: 2 * 2 = 4 (Light turns Green)\n   \n4. **Number is 4 (Green)**:\n   - Press **C**: 4 * 2 = 8 (Light turns Red)\n   \n5. **Number is 8 (Red)**:\n   - Press **A**: 8 * 2 = 16 (Light turns Green)\n   \n6. **Number is 16 (Green)**:\n   - Press **B**: 16 - 1 = 15 (Light turns Red)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 15 from 0 is:\n- **B → C → A → C → A → B**\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<<<B → C → A → C → A → B>>>"
