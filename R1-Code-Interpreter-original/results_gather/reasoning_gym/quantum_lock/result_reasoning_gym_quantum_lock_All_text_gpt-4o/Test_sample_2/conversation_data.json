    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (36), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze each button and its effect:\n\n1. **Button A**: \n   - Subtracts 2 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n   - Toggles the light between red and green.\n\n2. **Button B**: \n   - Adds 3 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n   - Toggles the light between red and green.\n\n3. **Button C**: \n   - Adds 3 to the number, but only when the light is red.\n   - Toggles the light between red and green.\n\n**Initial State**: \n- Number: 0\n- Light: Red\n\n**Target State**: \n- Number: 36\n\n**Strategy**:\n- Since Button B works regardless of the light's color and adds 3, it is the most versatile button.\n- Button C can be used when the light is red to add 3, similar to Button B.\n- Button A is less useful initially because it subtracts 2 and requires the light to be green.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n1. Start at 0 with the light red.\n2. Use Button C to add 3 (light toggles to green): Number = 3, Light = Green.\n3. Use Button B to add 3 (light toggles to red): Number = 6, Light = Red.\n4. Repeat the sequence of Button C followed by Button B to continue adding 6 each cycle:\n   - After 1st cycle: Number = 12, Light = Red.\n   - After 2nd cycle: Number = 18, Light = Red.\n   - After 3rd cycle: Number = 24, Light = Red.\n   - After 4th cycle: Number = 30, Light = Red.\n   - After 5th cycle: Number = 36, Light = Red.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The sequence of button presses is: C → B → C → B → C → B → C → B → C → B → C.\n- This sequence efficiently reaches the target number 36.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n<<<C → B → C → B → C → B → C → B → C → B → C>>>"
