Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 12\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 1 (when green)\nB: Subtract 1 (when any)\nC: Add 2 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (12), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Button Operations**:\n   - **Button A**: Subtracts 1, but only when the light is green.\n   - **Button B**: Subtracts 1 regardless of the light's color.\n   - **Button C**: Adds 2 regardless of the light's color.\n\n3. **Light Behavior**:\n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n4. **Objective**:\n   - Reach the number 12 starting from 0 using the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n5. **Strategy**:\n   - Since Button C adds 2 and works regardless of the light's color, it is the most efficient way to increase the number.\n   - We need to reach 12, which is an even number, and starting from 0 (also even), we can use Button C to reach 12 directly by adding 2 six times.\n\n6. **Sequence of Actions**:\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Press Button C: Number becomes 2, light toggles to green.\n   - Press Button C: Number becomes 4, light toggles to red.\n   - Press Button C: Number becomes 6, light toggles to green.\n   - Press Button C: Number becomes 8, light toggles to red.\n   - Press Button C: Number becomes 10, light toggles to green.\n   - Press Button C: Number becomes 12, light toggles to red.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The shortest sequence to reach the target number 12 is to press Button C six times.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C → C → C → C → C → C>>>"
