Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 9\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when green)\nB: Add 1 (when red)\nC: Subtract 1 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (9), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target**: \n   - Number: 9\n\n3. **Button Effects**:\n   - **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number, but only when the light is green. Pressing this button will toggle the light.\n   - **Button B**: Adds 1 to the number, but only when the light is red. Pressing this button will toggle the light.\n   - **Button C**: Subtracts 1 from the number, but only when the light is green. Pressing this button will toggle the light.\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - We start with the light red, so we can only press Button B initially.\n   - Pressing Button B will add 1 to the number and toggle the light to green.\n   - Once the light is green, we can press Button A to add 2 to the number and toggle the light back to red.\n   - We need to repeat this process to reach the target number 9.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Execution**:\n   - Start: Number = 0, Light = Red\n   - Press B: Number = 1, Light = Green\n   - Press A: Number = 3, Light = Red\n   - Press B: Number = 4, Light = Green\n   - Press A: Number = 6, Light = Red\n   - Press B: Number = 7, Light = Green\n   - Press A: Number = 9, Light = Red\n\n6. **Sequence of Button Presses**:\n   - The sequence of button presses to reach the target number 9 is: B → A → B → A → B → A\n\nTherefore, the shortest correct sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<B → A → B → A → B → A>>>"
