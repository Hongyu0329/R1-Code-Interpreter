  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 21\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 3 (when red)\nB: Add 3 (when green)\nC: Multiply 2 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (21), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Subtracts 3 from the number when the light is red. It also toggles the light.\n2. **Button B**: Adds 3 to the number when the light is green. It also toggles the light.\n3. **Button C**: Multiplies the number by 2 regardless of the light's color. It also toggles the light.\n\nThe initial state is 0 with the light being red. The target is to reach 21.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n\n2. **Press C**: \n   - Number = 0 * 2 = 0\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n3. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 0 + 3 = 3\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n4. **Press C**: \n   - Number = 3 * 2 = 6\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n5. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 6 + 3 = 9\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n6. **Press C**: \n   - Number = 9 * 2 = 18\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n7. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 18 + 3 = 21\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\nNow, the number is 21, which is the target value. The sequence of button presses is C, B, C, B, C, B.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<C → B → C → B → C → B>>>"
