    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (31), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light's state.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Start**: 0 (red light)\n- **Target**: 31\n\n### Button Operations:\n1. **Button A**: \n   - Adds 2 to the number when the light is red.\n   - Toggles the light between red and green.\n\n2. **Button B**: \n   - Subtracts 3 from the number when the light is red.\n   - Toggles the light between red and green.\n\n3. **Button C**: \n   - Adds 3 to the number regardless of the light's color.\n   - Toggles the light between red and green.\n\n### Strategy:\n- We need to reach 31 starting from 0, using the shortest sequence of button presses.\n- Each button press toggles the light, so we must consider the light's state after each press.\n- Since Button C adds 3 regardless of the light's state, it can be used to make consistent progress towards the target.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Start at 0 (red light)**:\n   - Press **C**: 0 + 3 = 3 (light toggles to green)\n\n2. **3 (green light)**:\n   - Press **C**: 3 + 3 = 6 (light toggles to red)\n\n3. **6 (red light)**:\n   - Press **C**: 6 + 3 = 9 (light toggles to green)\n\n4. **9 (green light)**:\n   - Press **C**: 9 + 3 = 12 (light toggles to red)\n\n5. **12 (red light)**:\n   - Press **C**: 12 + 3 = 15 (light toggles to green)\n\n6. **15 (green light)**:\n   - Press **C**: 15 + 3 = 18 (light toggles to red)\n\n7. **18 (red light)**:\n   - Press **C**: 18 + 3 = 21 (light toggles to green)\n\n8. **21 (green light)**:\n   - Press **C**: 21 + 3 = 24 (light toggles to red)\n\n9. **24 (red light)**:\n   - Press **C**: 24 + 3 = 27 (light toggles to green)\n\n10. **27 (green light)**:\n    - Press **C**: 27 + 3 = 30 (light toggles to red)\n\n11. **30 (red light)**:\n    - Press **A**: 30 + 2 = 32 (light toggles to green)\n\n12. **32 (green light)**:\n    - Press **B**: 32 - 3 = 29 (light toggles to red)\n\n13. **29 (red light)**:\n    - Press **A**: 29 + 2 = 31 (light toggles to green)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 31 from 0 is:\n\n<<<C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → A → B → A>>>"
