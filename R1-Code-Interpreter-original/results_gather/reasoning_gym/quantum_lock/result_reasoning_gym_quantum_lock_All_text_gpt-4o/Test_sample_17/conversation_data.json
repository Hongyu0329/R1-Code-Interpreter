  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 9\nButtons:\nA: Multiply 2 (when green)\nB: Subtract 1 (when any)\nC: Add 1 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (9), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Understanding the Buttons**:\n   - **Button A**: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is green.\n   - **Button B**: Subtracts 1 from the number, regardless of the light's color.\n   - **Button C**: Adds 1 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n\n3. **Light Behavior**:\n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n4. **Objective**:\n   - Reach the number 9 with the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n5. **Strategy**:\n   - Since Button A is only effective when the light is green, we need to plan our sequence to make the most of this operation.\n   - We can use Button C to increment the number and toggle the light.\n   - We can use Button B to decrement the number and toggle the light if needed.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Press C: Number becomes 1, light becomes green.\n   - Press A: Number becomes 2 (1 * 2), light becomes red.\n   - Press C: Number becomes 3, light becomes green.\n   - Press A: Number becomes 6 (3 * 2), light becomes red.\n   - Press C: Number becomes 7, light becomes green.\n   - Press A: Number becomes 14 (7 * 2), light becomes red.\n   - Press B: Number becomes 13, light becomes green.\n   - Press B: Number becomes 12, light becomes red.\n   - Press B: Number becomes 11, light becomes green.\n   - Press B: Number becomes 10, light becomes red.\n   - Press B: Number becomes 9, light becomes green.\n\n7. **Sequence of Button Presses**:\n   - C → A → C → A → C → A → B → B → B → B → B\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 9 is:\n\n<<<C → A → C → A → C → A → B → B → B → B → B>>>"
