  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 9\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 1 (when any)\nB: Add 2 (when any)\nC: Multiply 2 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (9), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\n### Initial Setup:\n- **Start Number**: 0\n- **Target Number**: 9\n- **Initial Light State**: Red\n\n### Button Operations:\n- **Button A**: Subtract 1 (works regardless of light state)\n- **Button B**: Add 2 (works regardless of light state)\n- **Button C**: Multiply by 2 (only works when the light is green)\n\n### Light Behavior:\n- The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Understand the Operations**:\n   - Button A and B can be used at any time, but Button C requires the light to be green.\n   - The light starts as red and toggles with each button press.\n\n2. **Plan the Sequence**:\n   - Since Button C is only effective when the light is green, we need to plan our sequence to make the light green when we want to use Button C.\n   - We need to reach 9 from 0 using the fewest button presses.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - **Step 1**: Start at 0 (red). Press B to add 2. New number: 2 (light is now green).\n   - **Step 2**: Press C to multiply by 2. New number: 4 (light is now red).\n   - **Step 3**: Press B to add 2. New number: 6 (light is now green).\n   - **Step 4**: Press C to multiply by 2. New number: 12 (light is now red).\n   - **Step 5**: Press A to subtract 1. New number: 11 (light is now green).\n   - **Step 6**: Press A to subtract 1. New number: 10 (light is now red).\n   - **Step 7**: Press A to subtract 1. New number: 9 (light is now green).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 9 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n<<<B → C → B → C → A → A → A>>>"
