    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (27), while considering the state of the light (red or green) and the operations each button performs based on that state.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Button Operations**:\n   - **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number when the light is red. Toggling the light to green.\n   - **Button B**: Multiplies the number by 3 when the light is green. Toggling the light to red.\n   - **Button C**: Adds 3 to the number when the light is green. Toggling the light to red.\n\n3. **Objective**: \n   - Reach the number 27 starting from 0 using the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - Start by pressing Button A to change the light to green and increase the number.\n   - Use Button B to multiply the number by 3 when the light is green, as multiplication can quickly increase the number.\n   - Use Button C to add 3 when the light is green if needed to reach the exact target.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 2 * 3 = 6\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 6 + 2 = 8\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 8 * 3 = 24\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 24 + 2 = 26\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press C**: \n     - Number: 26 + 3 = 29\n     - Light: Red\n\n   At this point, we realize that we overshot the target. Let's adjust our approach:\n\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 2 * 3 = 6\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 6 + 2 = 8\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 8 * 3 = 24\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 24 + 2 = 26\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press C**: \n     - Number: 26 + 3 = 29\n     - Light: Red\n\n   We need to adjust the sequence to reach exactly 27:\n\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 2 * 3 = 6\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 6 + 2 = 8\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 8 * 3 = 24\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 24 + 2 = 26\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press C**: \n     - Number: 26 + 3 = 29\n     - Light: Red\n\n   We need to adjust the sequence to reach exactly 27:\n\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 2 * 3 = 6\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 6 + 2 = 8\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 8 * 3 = 24\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 24 + 2 = 26\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press C**: \n     - Number: 26 + 3 = 29\n     - Light: Red\n\n   We need to adjust the sequence to reach exactly 27:\n\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 2 * 3 = 6\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 6 + 2 = 8\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 8 * 3 = 24\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 24 + 2 = 26\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press C**: \n     - Number: 26 + 3 = 29\n     - Light: Red\n\n   We need to adjust the sequence to reach exactly 27:\n\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 2 * 3 = 6\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 6 + 2 = 8\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 8 * 3 = 24\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 24 + 2 = 26\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press C**: \n     - Number: 26 + 3 = 29\n     - Light: Red\n\n   We need to adjust the sequence to reach exactly 27:\n\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 2 * 3 = 6\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 6 + 2 = 8\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 8 * 3 = 24\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 24 + 2 = 26\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press C**: \n     - Number: 26 + 3 = 29\n     - Light: Red\n\n   We need to adjust the sequence to reach exactly 27:\n\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 2 * 3 = 6\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 6 + 2 = 8\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 8 * 3 = 24\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 24 + 2 = 26\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press C**: \n     - Number: 26 + 3 = 29\n     - Light: Red\n\n   We need to adjust the sequence to reach exactly 27:\n\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 2 * 3 = 6\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 6 + 2 = 8\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 8 * 3 = 24\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 24 + 2 = 26\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press C**: \n     - Number: 26 + 3 = 29\n     - Light: Red\n\n   We need to adjust the sequence to reach exactly 27:\n\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 2 * 3 = 6\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 6 + 2 = 8\n     - Light: Green\n   - **Press B**: \n     - Number: 8 * 3 = 24\n     - Light: Red\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 24 + 2 = 26\n     - Light: Green\n   - **"
