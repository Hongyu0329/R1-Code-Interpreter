    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (14), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light's state.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Start**: 0 (red light)\n- **Target**: 14\n\n### Button Functions:\n- **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number when the light is red. It also toggles the light.\n- **Button B**: Multiplies the number by 2 when the light is green. It also toggles the light.\n- **Button C**: Adds 1 to the number when the light is red. It also toggles the light.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n2. **Objective**: Reach 14 with the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n#### Strategy:\n- Since the light starts red, we can only use buttons A and C initially.\n- Button A is more efficient than C for increasing the number because it adds 2 instead of 1.\n- We need to toggle the light to green to use button B, which can quickly increase the number by multiplication.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 0 + 2 = 2\n   - Light toggles to green\n\n2. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 2 * 2 = 4\n   - Light toggles to red\n\n3. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 4 + 2 = 6\n   - Light toggles to green\n\n4. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 6 * 2 = 12\n   - Light toggles to red\n\n5. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 12 + 2 = 14\n   - Light toggles to green\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14 is: A → B → A → B → A.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<A → B → A → B → A>>>"
