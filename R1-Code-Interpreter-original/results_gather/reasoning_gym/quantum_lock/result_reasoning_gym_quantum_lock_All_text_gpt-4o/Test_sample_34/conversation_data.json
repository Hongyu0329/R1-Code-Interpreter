  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Multiply 2 (when any)\nB: Subtract 1 (when any)\nC: Add 1 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Start**: 0 (light is red)\n- **Target**: 8\n\n### Button Functions:\n- **Button A**: Multiplies the number by 2. This operation is independent of the light's color.\n- **Button B**: Subtracts 1 from the number. This operation is independent of the light's color.\n- **Button C**: Adds 1 to the number, but only when the light is green.\n\n### Light Behavior:\n- The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Understand the Operations**:\n   - Button A is useful for quickly increasing the number since it doubles the current value.\n   - Button B can decrease the number, which might be useful for fine-tuning the value.\n   - Button C can only be used when the light is green, and it increases the number by 1.\n\n2. **Plan the Sequence**:\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Use Button A to quickly increase the number.\n   - Use Button C to make small adjustments when the light is green.\n   - Use Button B if necessary to decrease the number.\n\n3. **Determine the Sequence**:\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Press A: 0 → 0 (red to green), number becomes 0.\n   - Press A: 0 → 0 (green to red), number becomes 0.\n   - Press C: 0 → 1 (red to green), number becomes 1.\n   - Press A: 1 → 2 (green to red), number becomes 2.\n   - Press A: 2 → 4 (red to green), number becomes 4.\n   - Press A: 4 → 8 (green to red), number becomes 8.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0 is:\n- Press A four times, and then press C once.\n\nThus, the sequence is: <<<A → A → C → A → A>>>"
