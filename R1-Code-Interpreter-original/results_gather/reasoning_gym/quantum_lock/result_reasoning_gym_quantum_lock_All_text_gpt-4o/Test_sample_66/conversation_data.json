    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (21), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Understanding Button Effects:**\n   - **Button A:** Subtracts 2, but only when the light is green.\n   - **Button B:** Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's color.\n   - **Button C:** Adds 3, but only when the light is green.\n\n3. **Light Toggle:**\n   - Pressing any button toggles the light between red and green.\n\n4. **Objective:**\n   - Reach the number 21 starting from 0 using the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - Since Button B can be used regardless of the light's color and can quickly increase the number, it is a powerful tool for reaching higher numbers.\n   - Button C can be used to add 3 when the light is green, which is useful for reaching odd numbers.\n   - Button A is less useful initially since it subtracts, but it can be used to adjust the number if needed.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Press Button C to add 3 (light turns green): Number = 3\n   - Press Button B to multiply by 2 (light turns red): Number = 6\n   - Press Button C to add 3 (light turns green): Number = 9\n   - Press Button B to multiply by 2 (light turns red): Number = 18\n   - Press Button C to add 3 (light turns green): Number = 21\n\n7. **Sequence of Button Presses:**\n   - C → B → C → B → C\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 21 is:\n\n<<<C → B → C → B → C>>>"
