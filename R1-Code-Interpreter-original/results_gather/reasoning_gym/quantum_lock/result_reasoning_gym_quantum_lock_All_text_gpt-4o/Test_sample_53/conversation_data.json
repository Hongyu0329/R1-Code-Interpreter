    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (15), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Start**: 0 (light is red)\n- **Target**: 15\n\n### Button Functions:\n- **Button A**: Multiplies the number by 2. This operation is independent of the light's color.\n- **Button B**: Adds 1 to the number. This operation is independent of the light's color.\n- **Button C**: Subtracts 1 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n\n### Light Behavior:\n- The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Understand the Goal**: We need to reach 15 from 0 using the shortest sequence of operations.\n2. **Consider Efficient Operations**: Multiplying by 2 (Button A) is a powerful operation that can quickly increase the number. Adding 1 (Button B) is useful for fine-tuning the number to reach the exact target.\n3. **Plan the Sequence**:\n   - Start with 0 (red).\n   - Use Button A to quickly increase the number by powers of 2.\n   - Use Button B to adjust the number to reach exactly 15.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution:\n1. **Press A**: \n   - Start: 0 (red)\n   - After A: 0 * 2 = 0 (light toggles to green)\n2. **Press B**:\n   - Start: 0 (green)\n   - After B: 0 + 1 = 1 (light toggles to red)\n3. **Press A**:\n   - Start: 1 (red)\n   - After A: 1 * 2 = 2 (light toggles to green)\n4. **Press A**:\n   - Start: 2 (green)\n   - After A: 2 * 2 = 4 (light toggles to red)\n5. **Press A**:\n   - Start: 4 (red)\n   - After A: 4 * 2 = 8 (light toggles to green)\n6. **Press A**:\n   - Start: 8 (green)\n   - After A: 8 * 2 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n7. **Press C**:\n   - Start: 16 (red)\n   - After C: Not applicable (C only works when green)\n8. **Press B**:\n   - Start: 16 (red)\n   - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n9. **Press C**:\n   - Start: 17 (green)\n   - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n10. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After C: Not applicable (C only works when green)\n11. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n12. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n13. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n14. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n15. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n16. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n17. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n18. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n19. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n20. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n21. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n22. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n23. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n24. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n25. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n26. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n27. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n28. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n29. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n30. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n31. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n32. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n33. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n34. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n35. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n36. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n37. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n38. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n39. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n40. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n41. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n42. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n43. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n44. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n45. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n46. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n47. **Press B**:\n    - Start: 16 (red)\n    - After B: 16 + 1 = 17 (light toggles to green)\n48. **Press C**:\n    - Start: 17 (green)\n    - After C: 17 - 1 ="
