    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number, 0, into the target number, 42. We have three buttons, each performing a specific operation on the number, and the light toggles between red and green with each button press. The operations are as follows:\n\n- Button A: Subtract 3 (works regardless of the light's color)\n- Button B: Add 2 (works regardless of the light's color)\n- Button C: Multiply by 3 (only works when the light is red)\n\nThe light starts as red, and it toggles color with each button press. We need to consider the state of the light when planning our sequence, especially for button C, which only works when the light is red.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Start at 0 with the light red.\n2. **Objective**: Reach 42 using the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Start at 0 (red)**:\n   - We can use button C to multiply by 3, but since 0 multiplied by 3 is still 0, this doesn't help initially.\n   - We can use button B to add 2, which will change the number to 2 and toggle the light to green.\n\n2. **Current State: 2 (green)**:\n   - We can use button A to subtract 3, resulting in -1, but this moves us away from the target.\n   - We can use button B to add 2, resulting in 4, and toggle the light back to red.\n\n3. **Current State: 4 (red)**:\n   - We can use button C to multiply by 3, resulting in 12, and toggle the light to green.\n\n4. **Current State: 12 (green)**:\n   - We can use button B to add 2, resulting in 14, and toggle the light to red.\n\n5. **Current State: 14 (red)**:\n   - We can use button C to multiply by 3, resulting in 42, which is our target.\n\n### Sequence of Button Presses:\n\n- Start at 0 (red)\n- Press B: 0 + 2 = 2 (green)\n- Press B: 2 + 2 = 4 (red)\n- Press C: 4 * 3 = 12 (green)\n- Press B: 12 + 2 = 14 (red)\n- Press C: 14 * 3 = 42 (green)\n\nThis sequence reaches the target number 42 in the shortest number of steps.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<B → B → C → B → C>>>"
