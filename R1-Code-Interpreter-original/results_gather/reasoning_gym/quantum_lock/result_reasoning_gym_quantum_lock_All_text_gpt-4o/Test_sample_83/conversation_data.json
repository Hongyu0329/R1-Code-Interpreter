    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (20), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze each button and its effect:\n\n1. **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number regardless of the light's color. It toggles the light between red and green.\n\n2. **Button B**: Subtracts 3 from the number, but only when the light is green. It toggles the light back to red.\n\n3. **Button C**: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is green. It toggles the light back to red.\n\nThe initial state is 0 with the light being red. Our goal is to reach 20.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Start at 0 (red)**:\n   - Press **A**: Number becomes 2, light turns green.\n\n2. **Number is 2 (green)**:\n   - Press **C**: Number becomes 4 (2 * 2), light turns red.\n\n3. **Number is 4 (red)**:\n   - Press **A**: Number becomes 6, light turns green.\n\n4. **Number is 6 (green)**:\n   - Press **C**: Number becomes 12 (6 * 2), light turns red.\n\n5. **Number is 12 (red)**:\n   - Press **A**: Number becomes 14, light turns green.\n\n6. **Number is 14 (green)**:\n   - Press **C**: Number becomes 28 (14 * 2), light turns red.\n\n7. **Number is 28 (red)**:\n   - Press **B**: This is not possible because B only works when the light is green.\n\n8. **Number is 28 (red)**:\n   - Press **A**: Number becomes 30, light turns green.\n\n9. **Number is 30 (green)**:\n   - Press **B**: Number becomes 27 (30 - 3), light turns red.\n\n10. **Number is 27 (red)**:\n    - Press **A**: Number becomes 29, light turns green.\n\n11. **Number is 29 (green)**:\n    - Press **B**: Number becomes 26 (29 - 3), light turns red.\n\n12. **Number is 26 (red)**:\n    - Press **A**: Number becomes 28, light turns green.\n\n13. **Number is 28 (green)**:\n    - Press **B**: Number becomes 25 (28 - 3), light turns red.\n\n14. **Number is 25 (red)**:\n    - Press **A**: Number becomes 27, light turns green.\n\n15. **Number is 27 (green)**:\n    - Press **B**: Number becomes 24 (27 - 3), light turns red.\n\n16. **Number is 24 (red)**:\n    - Press **A**: Number becomes 26, light turns green.\n\n17. **Number is 26 (green)**:\n    - Press **B**: Number becomes 23 (26 - 3), light turns red.\n\n18. **Number is 23 (red)**:\n    - Press **A**: Number becomes 25, light turns green.\n\n19. **Number is 25 (green)**:\n    - Press **B**: Number becomes 22 (25 - 3), light turns red.\n\n20. **Number is 22 (red)**:\n    - Press **A**: Number becomes 24, light turns green.\n\n21. **Number is 24 (green)**:\n    - Press **B**: Number becomes 21 (24 - 3), light turns red.\n\n22. **Number is 21 (red)**:\n    - Press **A**: Number becomes 23, light turns green.\n\n23. **Number is 23 (green)**:\n    - Press **B**: Number becomes 20 (23 - 3), light turns red.\n\nNow, we have reached the target number 20.\n\nThe sequence of button presses is: A → C → A → C → A → C → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A →"
