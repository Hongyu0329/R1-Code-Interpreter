  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 14\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 2 (when any)\nB: Subtract 3 (when green)\nC: Add 2 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (14), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target State:**\n   - Number: 14\n\n3. **Button Operations:**\n   - **A:** Subtract 2 (works regardless of light color)\n   - **B:** Subtract 3 (only works when the light is green)\n   - **C:** Add 2 (works regardless of light color)\n\n4. **Light Behavior:**\n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - Since the target is 14 and we start at 0, we need to increase the number.\n   - Button C is the only button that increases the number, adding 2 each time it is pressed.\n   - We need to determine how many times to press C to reach 14.\n\n6. **Calculation:**\n   - Starting at 0, pressing C once will result in 2, then 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and finally 14.\n   - This requires pressing C a total of 7 times.\n\n7. **Light State:**\n   - The light starts red and toggles with each press.\n   - After 7 presses, the light will end in the opposite state from which it started. Since it starts red, it will end green.\n\n8. **Sequence of Button Presses:**\n   - Press C seven times to reach the target number 14.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14 is:\n\n<<<C → C → C → C → C → C → C>>>"
