    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (14). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but in this case, the color of the light does not affect the operations of the buttons. Each button performs the same operation regardless of the light's color.\n\nLet's analyze the operations of each button:\n- Button A: Adds 3 to the current number.\n- Button B: Adds 2 to the current number.\n- Button C: Subtracts 3 from the current number.\n\nThe goal is to reach the target number 14 from the starting number 0 using the fewest button presses. We will explore the possible sequences of button presses:\n\n1. **Using Button A:**\n   - Pressing A once: 0 + 3 = 3\n   - Pressing A twice: 3 + 3 = 6\n   - Pressing A three times: 6 + 3 = 9\n   - Pressing A four times: 9 + 3 = 12\n   - Pressing A five times: 12 + 3 = 15 (overshoots the target)\n\n2. **Using Button B:**\n   - Pressing B once: 0 + 2 = 2\n   - Pressing B twice: 2 + 2 = 4\n   - Pressing B three times: 4 + 2 = 6\n   - Pressing B four times: 6 + 2 = 8\n   - Pressing B five times: 8 + 2 = 10\n   - Pressing B six times: 10 + 2 = 12\n   - Pressing B seven times: 12 + 2 = 14 (reaches the target)\n\n3. **Combining Buttons A and B:**\n   - We can reach 14 by combining A and B presses. For example:\n     - Press A four times to reach 12, then press B once to reach 14.\n\n4. **Using Button C:**\n   - Button C subtracts 3, which is not useful for reaching a positive target from 0.\n\nFrom the analysis, the shortest sequence to reach 14 is by pressing Button B seven times. This sequence is shorter than any combination involving Button A, as pressing A four times and B once results in five presses, which is longer than pressing B seven times.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14 is:\n\n<<<B → B → B → B → B → B → B>>>"
