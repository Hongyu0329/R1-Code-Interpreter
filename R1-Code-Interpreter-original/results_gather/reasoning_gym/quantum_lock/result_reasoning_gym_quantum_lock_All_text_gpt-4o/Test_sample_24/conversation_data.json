    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (28). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but in this case, the color of the light does not affect the operations of the buttons. Each button performs the same operation regardless of the light's color.\n\nLet's analyze the operations of each button:\n- Button A: Adds 2 to the current number.\n- Button B: Multiplies the current number by 2.\n- Button C: Multiplies the current number by 3.\n\nStarting from 0, we need to reach 28 using these operations. Since starting from 0, multiplication will not help initially (as multiplying 0 by any number still results in 0), we need to use addition first to get a non-zero number.\n\n1. **Press A**: 0 + 2 = 2 (light toggles to green)\n2. **Press B**: 2 * 2 = 4 (light toggles to red)\n3. **Press B**: 4 * 2 = 8 (light toggles to green)\n4. **Press B**: 8 * 2 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n5. **Press A**: 16 + 2 = 18 (light toggles to green)\n6. **Press B**: 18 * 2 = 36 (light toggles to red)\n7. **Press A**: 36 - 2 = 34 (light toggles to green)\n8. **Press A**: 34 - 2 = 32 (light toggles to red)\n9. **Press A**: 32 - 2 = 30 (light toggles to green)\n10. **Press A**: 30 - 2 = 28 (light toggles to red)\n\nThe sequence of button presses to reach the target number 28 from 0 is: A → B → B → B → A → A → A → A → A.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<A → B → B → B → A → A → A → A → A>>>"
