    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but in this case, the color of the light does not affect the operations of the buttons. Each button performs the same operation regardless of the light's color.\n\nLet's analyze the operations of each button:\n- Button A: Subtract 2 from the current number.\n- Button B: Add 2 to the current number.\n- Button C: Multiply the current number by 2.\n\nWe start at 0 with the light red, and we need to reach 8. The goal is to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: 0 (red)\n2. **Target**: 8\n\nLet's explore the possible sequences:\n\n- **Using Button C (Multiply by 2)**:\n  - Press C: 0 * 2 = 0 (light toggles to green)\n  - Press C: 0 * 2 = 0 (light toggles to red)\n  - Press C: 0 * 2 = 0 (light toggles to green)\n  - This approach does not help us reach 8 from 0.\n\n- **Using Button B (Add 2)**:\n  - Press B: 0 + 2 = 2 (light toggles to green)\n  - Press B: 2 + 2 = 4 (light toggles to red)\n  - Press B: 4 + 2 = 6 (light toggles to green)\n  - Press B: 6 + 2 = 8 (light toggles to red)\n  - We have reached the target number 8.\n\n- **Using Button A (Subtract 2)**:\n  - Starting from 0, subtracting 2 will result in negative numbers, which will not help us reach 8.\n\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0 is to press Button B four times.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is: <<<B → B → B → B>>>"
