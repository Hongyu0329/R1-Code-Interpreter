  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when any)\nB: Multiply 2 (when any)\nC: Add 1 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8). The light's color does not affect the operations, so we can focus solely on the mathematical operations provided by each button:\n\n- Button A: Add 2 to the current number.\n- Button B: Multiply the current number by 2.\n- Button C: Add 1 to the current number.\n\nLet's analyze the steps to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0:\n\n1. **Start at 0**: The initial number is 0, and the light is red. We need to reach 8.\n\n2. **Consider the operations**:\n   - Since multiplying 0 by 2 (Button B) will still result in 0, we cannot start with Button B.\n   - Adding 2 (Button A) or adding 1 (Button C) will change the number from 0.\n\n3. **First step**: \n   - Press Button C to add 1. Now the number is 1.\n\n4. **Second step**:\n   - Press Button B to multiply by 2. Now the number is 2.\n\n5. **Third step**:\n   - Press Button B again to multiply by 2. Now the number is 4.\n\n6. **Fourth step**:\n   - Press Button B again to multiply by 2. Now the number is 8.\n\nWe have reached the target number 8 in four steps. The sequence of button presses is C → B → B → B.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 is:\n\n<<<C → B → B → B>>>"
