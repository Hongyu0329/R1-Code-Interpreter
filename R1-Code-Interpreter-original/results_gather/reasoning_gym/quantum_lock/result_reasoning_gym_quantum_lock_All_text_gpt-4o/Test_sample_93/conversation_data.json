  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 16\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when any)\nB: Subtract 1 (when any)\nC: Multiply 2 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (16). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but in this case, the operations are independent of the light's state. Therefore, we can focus solely on the mathematical operations.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n- Button A: Add 2\n- Button B: Subtract 1\n- Button C: Multiply by 2\n\nWe start at 0 and want to reach 16. The most efficient way to reach a higher number is by using multiplication, so we should prioritize using Button C (Multiply by 2) whenever possible.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n1. Start at 0.\n2. Press Button A (Add 2): 0 + 2 = 2\n3. Press Button C (Multiply by 2): 2 * 2 = 4\n4. Press Button C (Multiply by 2): 4 * 2 = 8\n5. Press Button C (Multiply by 2): 8 * 2 = 16\n\nWe have reached the target number 16 in 5 steps. This sequence is efficient because it uses multiplication to quickly increase the number.\n\nThe sequence of button presses is:\n- A → C → C → C\n\nTherefore, the shortest correct sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<A → C → C → C>>>"
