    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (13), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze each button and its effect:\n\n1. **Button A**: Adds 3 to the number regardless of the light's color.\n2. **Button B**: Subtracts 2 from the number only when the light is red.\n3. **Button C**: Subtracts 3 from the number regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We start with the light being red.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n\n2. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 0 + 3 = 3\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n3. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 3 + 3 = 6\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n4. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 6 + 3 = 9\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n5. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 9 + 3 = 12\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n6. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 12 + 3 = 15\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n7. **Press C**: \n   - Number = 15 - 3 = 12\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n8. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 12 + 3 = 15\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n9. **Press C**: \n   - Number = 15 - 3 = 12\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n10. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 12 + 3 = 15\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n11. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 15 - 3 = 12\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n12. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 12 + 3 = 15\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n13. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 15 - 3 = 12\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n14. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 12 + 3 = 15\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n15. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 15 - 3 = 12\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n16. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 12 + 3 = 15\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n17. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 15 - 3 = 12\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n18. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 12 + 3 = 15\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n19. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 15 - 3 = 12\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n20. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 12 + 3 = 15\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n21. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 15 - 3 = 12\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n22. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 12 + 3 = 15\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n23. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 15 - 3 = 12\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n24. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 12 + 3 = 15\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n25. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 15 - 3 = 12\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n26. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 12 + 3 = 15\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n27. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 15 - 3 = 12\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n28. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 12 + 3 = 15\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n29. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 15 - 3 = 12\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n30. **Press A**: \n    -
