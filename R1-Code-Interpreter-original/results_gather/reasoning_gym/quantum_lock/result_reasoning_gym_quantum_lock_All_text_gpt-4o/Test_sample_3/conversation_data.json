    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (29), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Start Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Button Effects:**\n   - **Button A:** Subtracts 2 when the light is green.\n   - **Button B:** Adds 3 regardless of the light's color.\n   - **Button C:** Subtracts 3 when the light is green.\n\n3. **Light Toggling:**\n   - Each button press toggles the light between red and green.\n\n4. **Objective:**\n   - Reach the target number 29 from the starting number 0 using the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - Since Button B adds 3 regardless of the light's color, it is the most straightforward way to increase the number.\n   - We need to determine how many times we can press Button B to get close to 29, and then adjust using Buttons A or C if necessary.\n\n6. **Calculation:**\n   - Pressing Button B repeatedly will increase the number by 3 each time.\n   - Calculate how many times we need to press Button B to get close to 29:\n     - \\( 29 \\div 3 = 9 \\) remainder 2.\n   - After 9 presses of Button B, the number will be \\( 9 \\times 3 = 27 \\).\n\n7. **Adjusting to Reach 29:**\n   - After reaching 27, we need to add 2 more to reach 29.\n   - Since the light toggles with each press, after 9 presses of Button B, the light will be green (since it starts red and toggles each time).\n   - We cannot use Button A or C to add 2 directly, but we can use Button B one more time to add 3, reaching 30, and then adjust back to 29.\n\n8. **Final Adjustment:**\n   - After reaching 30, the light will be red.\n   - Press Button B one more time to reach 30.\n   - Now, press Button A to subtract 2 (since the light is green after pressing B), reaching 28.\n   - Finally, press Button B again to add 3, reaching 31, and then press Button A to subtract 2, reaching 29.\n\n9. **Sequence:**\n   - Press Button B 10 times to reach 30.\n   - Press Button A to subtract 2, reaching 28.\n   - Press Button B to add 3, reaching 31.\n   - Press Button A to subtract 2, reaching 29.\n\n10. **Conclusion:**\n    - The shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 29 is:\n\n**Answer:**\n<<<B → B → B → B → B → B → B → B → B → B → A → B → A>>>"
