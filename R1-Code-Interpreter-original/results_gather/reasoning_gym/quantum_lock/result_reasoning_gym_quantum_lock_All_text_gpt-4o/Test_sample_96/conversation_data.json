    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (15), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Start**: 0 (light is red)\n- **Target**: 15\n\n### Button Functions:\n- **Button A**: Subtract 2 (works regardless of light color)\n- **Button B**: Add 1 (works regardless of light color)\n- **Button C**: Multiply by 2 (only works when the light is green)\n\n### Light Behavior:\n- The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Understand the Operations**:\n   - Button A and B can be used at any time, but Button C is only effective when the light is green.\n   - The light starts as red, so the first press will turn it green.\n\n2. **Plan the Sequence**:\n   - Since Button C is the only button that can significantly increase the number (by doubling it), we should aim to use it effectively.\n   - We need to reach a point where using Button C will help us get closer to 15 efficiently.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Approach**:\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Press B to add 1 (0 + 1 = 1), light turns green.\n   - Press C to multiply by 2 (1 * 2 = 2), light turns red.\n   - Press B to add 1 (2 + 1 = 3), light turns green.\n   - Press C to multiply by 2 (3 * 2 = 6), light turns red.\n   - Press B to add 1 (6 + 1 = 7), light turns green.\n   - Press C to multiply by 2 (7 * 2 = 14), light turns red.\n   - Press B to add 1 (14 + 1 = 15), light turns green.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 15 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n<<<B → C → B → C → B → C → B>>>"
