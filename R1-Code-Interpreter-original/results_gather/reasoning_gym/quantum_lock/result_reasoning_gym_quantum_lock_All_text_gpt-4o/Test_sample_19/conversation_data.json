    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (14), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n- Button A: Subtracts 1 from the number, regardless of the light's color. It toggles the light.\n- Button B: Adds 1 to the number, but only when the light is green. It toggles the light.\n- Button C: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's color. It toggles the light.\n\nThe initial state is 0 with the light being red. The target is to reach 14.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n\n2. **Objective**: Reach 14 using the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n3. **Strategy**: Since multiplying by 2 (Button C) is a powerful operation, we should aim to use it effectively to reach higher numbers quickly. However, we need to ensure that we can reach exactly 14.\n\n4. **Exploration**:\n   - Start with Button C to quickly increase the number:\n     - Press C: Number = 0 * 2 = 0, Light = Green\n   - Now, we can use Button B to increment the number:\n     - Press B: Number = 0 + 1 = 1, Light = Red\n   - Use Button C to double the number:\n     - Press C: Number = 1 * 2 = 2, Light = Green\n   - Use Button C again to double the number:\n     - Press C: Number = 2 * 2 = 4, Light = Red\n   - Use Button C again to double the number:\n     - Press C: Number = 4 * 2 = 8, Light = Green\n   - Use Button C again to double the number:\n     - Press C: Number = 8 * 2 = 16, Light = Red\n   - Now, we are over the target (16 > 14), so we need to adjust:\n     - Press A: Number = 16 - 1 = 15, Light = Green\n     - Press A: Number = 15 - 1 = 14, Light = Red\n\n5. **Sequence**: The sequence of button presses is C → B → C → C → C → C → A → A.\n\n6. **Verification**: \n   - Start: 0 (Red)\n   - C: 0 (Green)\n   - B: 1 (Red)\n   - C: 2 (Green)\n   - C: 4 (Red)\n   - C: 8 (Green)\n   - C: 16 (Red)\n   - A: 15 (Green)\n   - A: 14 (Red)\n\nThe sequence successfully transforms the starting number into the target number using the shortest path.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<C → B → C → C → C → C → A → A>>>"
