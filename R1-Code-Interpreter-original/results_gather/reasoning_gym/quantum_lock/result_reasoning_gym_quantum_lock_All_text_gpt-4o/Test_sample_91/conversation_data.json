  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 1 (when green)\nB: Add 2 (when any)\nC: Subtract 2 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8). The light starts as red, and each button press toggles the light between red and green. We need to consider the effect of each button press on both the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Subtracts 1 from the number, but only when the light is green. Pressing this button will toggle the light.\n2. **Button B**: Adds 2 to the number regardless of the light's color. Pressing this button will toggle the light.\n3. **Button C**: Subtracts 2 from the number, but only when the light is green. Pressing this button will toggle the light.\n\nThe light starts as red, and we need to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n\n2. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 0 + 2 = 2\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n3. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 2 + 2 = 4\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n4. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 4 + 2 = 6\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n5. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 6 + 2 = 8\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\nAt this point, the number is 8, which is the target value. The sequence of button presses is B → B → B → B.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<B → B → B → B>>>"
