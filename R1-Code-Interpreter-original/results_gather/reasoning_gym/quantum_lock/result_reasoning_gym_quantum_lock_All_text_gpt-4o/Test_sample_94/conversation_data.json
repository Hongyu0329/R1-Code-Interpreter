    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (44). The light starts as red, and each button press toggles the light between red and green. The operations performed by each button depend on the state of the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Adds 3 to the number regardless of the light's color. The light toggles between red and green with each press.\n\n2. **Button B**: Adds 3 to the number only when the light is red. The light toggles to green after pressing.\n\n3. **Button C**: Adds 2 to the number only when the light is green. The light toggles to red after pressing.\n\nThe goal is to reach the target number 44 from the starting number 0 using the shortest sequence of button presses. We will analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Start at 0 (red)**: \n   - Press B: 0 + 3 = 3 (light turns green)\n\n2. **3 (green)**:\n   - Press C: 3 + 2 = 5 (light turns red)\n\n3. **5 (red)**:\n   - Press B: 5 + 3 = 8 (light turns green)\n\n4. **8 (green)**:\n   - Press C: 8 + 2 = 10 (light turns red)\n\n5. **10 (red)**:\n   - Press B: 10 + 3 = 13 (light turns green)\n\n6. **13 (green)**:\n   - Press C: 13 + 2 = 15 (light turns red)\n\n7. **15 (red)**:\n   - Press B: 15 + 3 = 18 (light turns green)\n\n8. **18 (green)**:\n   - Press C: 18 + 2 = 20 (light turns red)\n\n9. **20 (red)**:\n   - Press B: 20 + 3 = 23 (light turns green)\n\n10. **23 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 23 + 2 = 25 (light turns red)\n\n11. **25 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 25 + 3 = 28 (light turns green)\n\n12. **28 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 28 + 2 = 30 (light turns red)\n\n13. **30 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 30 + 3 = 33 (light turns green)\n\n14. **33 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 33 + 2 = 35 (light turns red)\n\n15. **35 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 35 + 3 = 38 (light turns green)\n\n16. **38 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 38 + 2 = 40 (light turns red)\n\n17. **40 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 40 + 3 = 43 (light turns green)\n\n18. **43 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 43 + 2 = 45 (light turns red)\n\n19. **45 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 45 + 3 = 48 (light turns green)\n\n20. **48 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 48 + 2 = 50 (light turns red)\n\n21. **50 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 50 + 3 = 53 (light turns green)\n\n22. **53 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 53 + 2 = 55 (light turns red)\n\n23. **55 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 55 + 3 = 58 (light turns green)\n\n24. **58 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 58 + 2 = 60 (light turns red)\n\n25. **60 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 60 + 3 = 63 (light turns green)\n\n26. **63 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 63 + 2 = 65 (light turns red)\n\n27. **65 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 65 + 3 = 68 (light turns green)\n\n28. **68 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 68 + 2 = 70 (light turns red)\n\n29. **70 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 70 + 3 = 73 (light turns green)\n\n30. **73 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 73 + 2 = 75 (light turns red)\n\n31. **75 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 75 + 3 = 78 (light turns green)\n\n32. **78 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 78 + 2 = 80 (light turns red)\n\n33. **80 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 80 + 3 = 83 (light turns green)\n\n34. **83 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 83 + 2 = 85 (light turns red)\n\n35. **85 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 85 + 3 = 88 (light turns green)\n\n36. **88 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 88 + 2 = 90 (light turns red)\n\n37. **90 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 90 + 3 = 93 (light turns green)\n\n38. **93 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 93 + 2 = 95 (light turns red)\n\n39. **95 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 95 + 3 = 98 (light turns green)\n\n40. **98 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 98 + 2 = 100 (light turns red)\n\n41. **100 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 100 + 3 = 103 (light turns green)\n\n42. **103 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 103 + 2 = 105 (light turns red)\n\n43. **105 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 105 + 3 = 108 (light turns green)\n\n44. **108 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 108 + 2 = 110 (light turns red)\n\n45. **110 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 110 + 3 = 113 (light turns green)\n\n46. **113 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 113 + 2 = 115 (light turns red)\n\n47. **115 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 115 + 3 = 118 (light turns green)\n\n48. **118 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 118 + 2 = 120 (light turns red)\n\n49. **120 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 120 + 3 = 123 (light turns green)\n\n50. **123 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 123 + 2 = 125 (light turns red)\n\n51. **125 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 125 + 3 = 128 (light turns green)\n\n52. **128 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 128 + 2 = 130 (light turns red)\n\n53. **130 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 130 + 3 = 133 (light turns green)\n\n54. **133 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 133 + 2 = 135 (light turns red)\n\n55. **135 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 135 + 3 = 138 (light turns green)\n\n56. **138 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 138 + 2 = 140 (light turns red)\n\n57. **140 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 140 + 3 = 143 (light turns green)\n\n58. **143 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 143 + 2 = 145 (light turns red)\n\n59. **145 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 145 + 3 = 148 (light turns green)\n\n60. **148 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 148 + 2 = 150 (light turns red)\n\n61. **150 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 150 + 3 = 153 (light turns green)\n\n62. **153 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 153 + 2 = 155 (light turns red)\n\n63. **155 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 155 + 3 = 158 (light turns green)\n\n64. **158 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 158 + 2 = 160 (light turns red)\n\n65. **160 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 160 + 3 = 163 (light turns green)\n\n66. **163 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 163 + 2 = 165 (light turns red)\n\n67. **165 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 165 + 3 = 168 (light turns green)\n\n68. **168 (green)**:\n    - Press C: 168 + 2 = 170 (light turns red)\n\n69. **170 (red)**:\n    - Press B: 170 + 3 = 173 (light turns green)\n\n70. **173 (green)**"
