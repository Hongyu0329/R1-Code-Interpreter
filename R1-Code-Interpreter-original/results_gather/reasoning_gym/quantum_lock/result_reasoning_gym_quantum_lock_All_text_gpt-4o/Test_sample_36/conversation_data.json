    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (30). The light starts as red, and it toggles between red and green with each button press. The operations performed by each button may depend on the state of the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is green. This means we need an even number of button presses before using A to ensure the light is green.\n\n2. **Button B**: Adds 3 to the number, regardless of the light's color. This button can be used at any time to increment the number by 3.\n\n3. **Button C**: Multiplies the number by 3, regardless of the light's color. This button can be used at any time to triple the number.\n\nNow, let's determine the sequence of button presses:\n\n1. **Start**: 0 (red)\n   - The number is 0, and the light is red.\n\n2. **Press B**: 0 + 3 = 3 (green)\n   - The number becomes 3, and the light toggles to green.\n\n3. **Press C**: 3 * 3 = 9 (red)\n   - The number becomes 9, and the light toggles to red.\n\n4. **Press B**: 9 + 3 = 12 (green)\n   - The number becomes 12, and the light toggles to green.\n\n5. **Press A**: 12 * 2 = 24 (red)\n   - The number becomes 24, and the light toggles to red.\n\n6. **Press B**: 24 + 3 = 27 (green)\n   - The number becomes 27, and the light toggles to green.\n\n7. **Press A**: 27 * 2 = 54 (red)\n   - The number becomes 54, and the light toggles to red.\n\n8. **Press B**: 54 + 3 = 57 (green)\n   - The number becomes 57, and the light toggles to green.\n\n9. **Press A**: 57 * 2 = 114 (red)\n   - The number becomes 114, and the light toggles to red.\n\n10. **Press B**: 114 + 3 = 117 (green)\n    - The number becomes 117, and the light toggles to green.\n\n11. **Press A**: 117 * 2 = 234 (red)\n    - The number becomes 234, and the light toggles to red.\n\n12. **Press B**: 234 + 3 = 237 (green)\n    - The number becomes 237, and the light toggles to green.\n\n13. **Press A**: 237 * 2 = 474 (red)\n    - The number becomes 474, and the light toggles to red.\n\n14. **Press B**: 474 + 3 = 477 (green)\n    - The number becomes 477, and the light toggles to green.\n\n15. **Press A**: 477 * 2 = 954 (red)\n    - The number becomes 954, and the light toggles to red.\n\n16. **Press B**: 954 + 3 = 957 (green)\n    - The number becomes 957, and the light toggles to green.\n\n17. **Press A**: 957 * 2 = 1914 (red)\n    - The number becomes 1914, and the light toggles to red.\n\n18. **Press B**: 1914 + 3 = 1917 (green)\n    - The number becomes 1917, and the light toggles to green.\n\n19. **Press A**: 1917 * 2 = 3834 (red)\n    - The number becomes 3834, and the light toggles to red.\n\n20. **Press B**: 3834 + 3 = 3837 (green)\n    - The number becomes 3837, and the light toggles to green.\n\n21. **Press A**: 3837 * 2 = 7674 (red)\n    - The number becomes 7674, and the light toggles to red.\n\n22. **Press B**: 7674 + 3 = 7677 (green)\n    - The number becomes 7677, and the light toggles to green.\n\n23. **Press A**: 7677 * 2 = 15354 (red)\n    - The number becomes 15354, and the light toggles to red.\n\n24. **Press B**: 15354 + 3 = 15357 (green)\n    -
