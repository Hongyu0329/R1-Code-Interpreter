    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (20). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but since the operations are independent of the light's state, we can focus solely on the numerical transformations.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n- Button A: Adds 3 to the current number.\n- Button B: Multiplies the current number by 2.\n- Button C: Subtracts 2 from the current number.\n\nWe start at 0 and aim to reach 20. The operations can be applied in any order, but we need to find the shortest sequence.\n\n1. **Starting at 0:**\n   - We cannot use Button B initially because multiplying 0 by 2 will still result in 0.\n   - Button C will take us to -2, which is not helpful for reaching 20.\n   - Button A is the only viable option to make progress towards 20.\n\n2. **Press A:**\n   - Current number: 0 + 3 = 3\n\n3. **Press B:**\n   - Current number: 3 * 2 = 6\n\n4. **Press B again:**\n   - Current number: 6 * 2 = 12\n\n5. **Press A:**\n   - Current number: 12 + 3 = 15\n\n6. **Press A again:**\n   - Current number: 15 + 3 = 18\n\n7. **Press A again:**\n   - Current number: 18 + 3 = 21\n\n8. **Press C:**\n   - Current number: 21 - 2 = 19\n\n9. **Press A:**\n   - Current number: 19 + 3 = 22\n\n10. **Press C:**\n    - Current number: 22 - 2 = 20\n\nThe sequence of button presses that achieves the target number 20 from the starting number 0 is: A → B → B → A → A → A → C → A → C.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<A → B → B → A → A → A → C → A → C>>>"
