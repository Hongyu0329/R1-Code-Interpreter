    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (16), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\n### Initial Setup:\n- **Start Number**: 0\n- **Target Number**: 16\n- **Initial Light State**: Red\n\n### Button Operations:\n- **Button A**: Multiplies the number by 2. This operation is independent of the light's color.\n- **Button B**: Subtracts 2 from the number. This operation is also independent of the light's color.\n- **Button C**: Adds 2 to the number, but only when the light is green.\n\n### Light Behavior:\n- The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Understand the Operations**:\n   - Button A is useful for quickly increasing the number since it doubles the current value.\n   - Button B decreases the number, which might not be useful since we need to increase the number to reach 16.\n   - Button C can only be used when the light is green, and it increases the number by 2.\n\n2. **Plan the Sequence**:\n   - Start with 0 (red).\n   - Use Button A to quickly increase the number by doubling it.\n   - Since Button A is independent of the light's color, we can use it repeatedly to reach a number close to 16.\n   - If needed, use Button C to make small adjustments when the light is green.\n\n3. **Calculate the Steps**:\n   - Press Button A: 0 → 0 (red to green)\n   - Press Button A: 0 → 0 (green to red)\n   - Press Button A: 0 → 0 (red to green)\n   - Press Button A: 0 → 0 (green to red)\n   - Press Button A: 0 → 0 (red to green)\n   -
