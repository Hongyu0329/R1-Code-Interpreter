    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (34), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\n### Initial Setup:\n- **Start Number**: 0\n- **Target Number**: 34\n- **Initial Light State**: Red\n\n### Button Operations:\n- **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number, only when the light is red. Toggling the light.\n- **Button B**: Adds 3 to the number, regardless of the light state. Toggling the light.\n- **Button C**: Multiplies the number by 3, regardless of the light state. Toggling the light.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Understand the Operations**: \n   - Button A is only useful when the light is red, and it adds a small increment (2).\n   - Button B can be used anytime and adds a moderate increment (3).\n   - Button C can be used anytime and significantly increases the number by multiplying it by 3.\n\n2. **Approach**:\n   - Start with the initial number (0) and the light state (red).\n   - Use Button C to quickly increase the number, as multiplication will help reach larger numbers faster.\n   - Use Button B to adjust the number when close to the target.\n   - Use Button A to make small adjustments when the light is red.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Press C: 0 * 3 = 0 (green).\n   - Press B: 0 + 3 = 3 (red).\n   - Press C: 3 * 3 = 9 (green).\n   - Press C: 9 * 3 = 27 (red).\n   - Press B: 27 + 3 = 30 (green).\n   - Press B: 30 + 3 = 33 (red).\n   - Press A: 33 + 2 = 35 (green).\n   - Press B: 35 - 1 = 34 (red).\n\n### Final Sequence:\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 34 from 0 is:\n<<<B → C → C → B → B → A>>>"
