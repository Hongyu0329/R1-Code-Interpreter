  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 30\nButtons:\nA: Add 3 (when any)\nB: Subtract 3 (when green)\nC: Multiply 2 (when red)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (30), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze each button and its effect:\n\n1. **Button A**: Adds 3 to the number regardless of the light's color.\n2. **Button B**: Subtracts 3 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n3. **Button C**: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is red.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We start with the light being red.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Start**: 0 (red)\n   - We need to reach 30. Multiplying by 2 (Button C) is not useful at 0 because it remains 0. So, we start by adding 3.\n\n2. **Press A**: 0 + 3 = 3 (light toggles to green)\n\n3. **Press A**: 3 + 3 = 6 (light toggles to red)\n\n4. **Press C**: 6 * 2 = 12 (light toggles to green)\n\n5. **Press A**: 12 + 3 = 15 (light toggles to red)\n\n6. **Press C**: 15 * 2 = 30 (light toggles to green)\n\nNow, we have reached the target number 30. The sequence of button presses is A → A → C → A → C.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<A → A → C → A → C>>>"
