    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (17). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but since the operations are independent of the light's state, we can focus solely on the numerical transformations.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n- Button A: Multiply the current number by 2.\n- Button B: Add 3 to the current number.\n- Button C: Subtract 2 from the current number.\n\nWe start at 0 and aim to reach 17. We need to find a sequence of operations that will achieve this efficiently.\n\n1. **Starting Point: 0**\n   - Current number: 0\n\n2. **First Step: Use Button B (Add 3)**\n   - Current number: 0 + 3 = 3\n\n3. **Second Step: Use Button A (Multiply by 2)**\n   - Current number: 3 * 2 = 6\n\n4. **Third Step: Use Button A (Multiply by 2)**\n   - Current number: 6 * 2 = 12\n\n5. **Fourth Step: Use Button B (Add 3)**\n   - Current number: 12 + 3 = 15\n\n6. **Fifth Step: Use Button B (Add 3)**\n   - Current number: 15 + 3 = 18\n\n7. **Sixth Step: Use Button C (Subtract 2)**\n   - Current number: 18 - 2 = 16\n\n8. **Seventh Step: Use Button B (Add 3)**\n   - Current number: 16 + 3 = 19\n\n9. **Eighth Step: Use Button C (Subtract 2)**\n   - Current number: 19 - 2 = 17\n\nNow, we have reached the target number 17. The sequence of button presses is:\n\n- B (Add 3)\n- A (Multiply by 2)\n- A (Multiply by 2)\n- B (Add 3)\n- B (Add 3)\n- C (Subtract 2)\n- B (Add 3)\n- C (Subtract 2)\n\nThis sequence can be represented as:\n\n<<<B → A → A → B → B → C → B → C>>>"
