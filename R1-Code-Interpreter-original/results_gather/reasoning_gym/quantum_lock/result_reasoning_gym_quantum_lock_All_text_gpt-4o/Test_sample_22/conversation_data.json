  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 9\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 1 (when any)\nB: Multiply 2 (when red)\nC: Add 2 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (9), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Subtracts 1 from the number, regardless of the light's color. It also toggles the light.\n2. **Button B**: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is red. It also toggles the light.\n3. **Button C**: Adds 2 to the number, regardless of the light's color. It also toggles the light.\n\nThe initial state is 0 with the light being red. The goal is to reach the number 9.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n\n2. **Press C**: \n   - Number = 0 + 2 = 2\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n3. **Press C**: \n   - Number = 2 + 2 = 4\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n4. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 4 * 2 = 8\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n5. **Press C**: \n   - Number = 8 + 2 = 10\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n6. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 10 - 1 = 9\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\nNow, the number is 9, which is the target value. The sequence of button presses is C → C → B → C → A.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<C → C → B → C → A>>>"
