    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (13). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but the operations themselves do not depend on the light's color. Therefore, we can focus solely on the numerical transformations.\n\nLet's analyze the operations provided by each button:\n- Button A: Subtract 2\n- Button B: Add 3\n- Button C: Multiply by 2\n\nWe start at 0 and need to reach 13. We will explore the possible sequences of operations step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point: 0 (red)**\n   - We need to increase the number to reach 13. Subtracting 2 (Button A) will not help initially, as it will take us negative. Therefore, we should consider adding or multiplying.\n\n2. **First Step:**\n   - Press Button B (Add 3): 0 + 3 = 3\n\n3. **Second Step:**\n   - Press Button C (Multiply by 2): 3 * 2 = 6\n\n4. **Third Step:**\n   - Press Button C (Multiply by 2): 6 * 2 = 12\n\n5. **Fourth Step:**\n   - We are at 12 and need to reach 13. Adding 3 (Button B) will overshoot, and multiplying by 2 (Button C) will overshoot even more. Therefore, we should consider subtracting 2 (Button A) to adjust.\n   - Press Button A (Subtract 2): 12 - 2 = 10\n\n6. **Fifth Step:**\n   - Now, we can add 3 to reach the target.\n   - Press Button B (Add 3): 10 + 3 = 13\n\nWe have reached the target number 13. The sequence of button presses is as follows:\n\n- B (Add 3)\n- C (Multiply by 2)\n- C (Multiply by 2)\n- A (Subtract 2)\n- B (Add 3)\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<B → C → C → A → B>>>"
