    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (24). We have three buttons, each performing a specific operation on the number, and the light toggles between red and green with each button press. The operations are as follows:\n\n- Button A: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button B: Adds 2 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button C: Adds 2 to the number, but only when the light is green.\n\nThe light starts as red, and we need to reach the target number 24.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Objective**: \n   - Reach the number 24 with the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Since button A doubles the number, it is a powerful operation for quickly increasing the number. \n   - Button B can be used to increment the number by 2, regardless of the light's color.\n   - Button C can only be used when the light is green, so it is less flexible.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - Start by using button B to increment the number to a point where doubling will be effective.\n   - Use button A to double the number strategically.\n   - Use button C when the light is green to make small adjustments if needed.\n\n5. **Execution**:\n   - Press B: Number = 2, Light = Green\n   - Press A: Number = 4, Light = Red\n   - Press A: Number = 8, Light = Green\n   - Press A: Number = 16, Light = Red\n   - Press B: Number = 18, Light = Green\n   - Press C: Number = 20, Light = Red\n   - Press B: Number = 22, Light = Green\n   - Press C: Number = 24, Light = Red\n\nThis sequence uses a combination of doubling and adding to efficiently reach the target number.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<B → A → A → A → B → C → B → C>>>"
