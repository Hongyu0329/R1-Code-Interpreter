    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (26). The light starts as red, and it toggles between red and green with each button press. Each button performs a specific operation on the number, and some operations depend on the light's color.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Subtracts 3 from the number, regardless of the light's color.\n2. **Button B**: Subtracts 3 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n3. **Button C**: Adds 2 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We start with the light red.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n\n2. **Objective**: Reach the number 26 with the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n3. **Strategy**: Since Button C adds 2 regardless of the light's color, and we need to increase the number from 0 to 26, Button C will be our primary tool. We need to determine how many times to press Button C to reach 26.\n\n4. **Calculate Button C Presses**: \n   - Each press of Button C adds 2 to the number.\n   - To reach 26 from 0, we need to add 2 a total of 13 times (since 26 / 2 = 13).\n\n5. **Sequence of Button Presses**:\n   - Press Button C 13 times.\n   - Each press toggles the light, but since Button C's operation is independent of the light's color, we don't need to track the light's state for this sequence.\n\n6. **Final State**: After 13 presses of Button C, the number will be 26, and the light will have toggled 13 times, ending in green.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 26 is to press Button C 13 times.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C>>>"
