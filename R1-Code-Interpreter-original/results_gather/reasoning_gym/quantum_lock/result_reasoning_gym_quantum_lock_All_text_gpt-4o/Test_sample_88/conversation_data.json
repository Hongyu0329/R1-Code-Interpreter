    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (36), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Start**: 0 (light is red)\n- **Target**: 36\n\n### Button Functions:\n- **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number if the light is red. Toggling the light to green.\n- **Button B**: Multiplies the number by 3 regardless of the light's color. Toggling the light.\n- **Button C**: Adds 2 to the number if the light is green. Toggling the light to red.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n2. **Objective**: Reach 36 using the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Since Button B multiplies the number by 3, it is efficient to use it when the number is greater than 0 to quickly increase the number.\n- We need to reach a number that can be multiplied to reach 36 or close to it, then adjust using addition.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 0 + 2 = 2\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n2. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 2 * 3 = 6\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n3. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 6 * 3 = 18\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n4. **Press B**: \n   - Number = 18 * 3 = 54\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n5. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 54 + 2 = 56\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n6. **Press C**: \n   - Number = 56 + 2 = 58\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n7. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 58 + 2 = 60\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n8. **Press C**: \n   - Number = 60 + 2 = 62\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n9. **Press A**: \n   - Number = 62 + 2 = 64\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n10. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 64 + 2 = 66\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n11. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 66 + 2 = 68\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n12. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 68 + 2 = 70\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n13. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 70 + 2 = 72\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n14. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 72 + 2 = 74\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n15. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 74 + 2 = 76\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n16. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 76 + 2 = 78\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n17. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 78 + 2 = 80\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n18. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 80 + 2 = 82\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n19. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 82 + 2 = 84\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n20. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 84 + 2 = 86\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n21. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 86 + 2 = 88\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n22. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 88 + 2 = 90\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n23. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 90 + 2 = 92\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n24. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 92 + 2 = 94\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n25. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 94 + 2 = 96\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n26. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 96 + 2 = 98\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n27. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 98 + 2 = 100\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n28. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 100 + 2 = 102\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n29. **Press A**: \n    - Number = 102 + 2 = 104\n    - Light toggles to Green\n\n30. **Press C**: \n    - Number = 104 + 2 = 106\n    - Light toggles to Red\n\n31. **Press A**: \n    -
