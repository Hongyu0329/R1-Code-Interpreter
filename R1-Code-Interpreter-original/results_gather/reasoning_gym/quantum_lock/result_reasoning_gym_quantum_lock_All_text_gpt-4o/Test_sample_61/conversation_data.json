    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (31), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target**: \n   - Number: 31\n\n3. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Multiply by 3 (only when the light is red)\n   - **B**: Add 3 (works regardless of the light's color)\n   - **C**: Subtract 2 (only when the light is green)\n\n4. **Light Toggle**:\n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n5. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to find a sequence of button presses that will reach the target number 31 from 0, while considering the light's state and the operations' constraints.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Press B: 0 + 3 = 3 (light turns green).\n   - Press B: 3 + 3 = 6 (light turns red).\n   - Press A: 6 * 3 = 18 (light turns green).\n   - Press B: 18 + 3 = 21 (light turns red).\n   - Press A: 21 * 3 = 63 (light turns green).\n   - Press C: 63 - 2 = 61 (light turns red).\n   - Press C: 61 - 2 = 59 (light turns green).\n   - Press C: 59 - 2 = 57 (light turns red).\n   - Press C: 57 - 2 = 55 (light turns green).\n   - Press C: 55 - 2 = 53 (light turns red).\n   - Press C: 53 - 2 = 51 (light turns green).\n   - Press C: 51 - 2 = 49 (light turns red).\n   - Press C: 49 - 2 = 47 (light turns green).\n   - Press C: 47 - 2 = 45 (light turns red).\n   - Press C: 45 - 2 = 43 (light turns green).\n   - Press C: 43 - 2 = 41 (light turns red).\n   - Press C: 41 - 2 = 39 (light turns green).\n   - Press C: 39 - 2 = 37 (light turns red).\n   - Press C: 37 - 2 = 35 (light turns green).\n   - Press C: 35 - 2 = 33 (light turns red).\n   - Press C: 33 - 2 = 31 (light turns green).\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The sequence of button presses that achieves the target number 31 is: B → B → A → B → A → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C →"
