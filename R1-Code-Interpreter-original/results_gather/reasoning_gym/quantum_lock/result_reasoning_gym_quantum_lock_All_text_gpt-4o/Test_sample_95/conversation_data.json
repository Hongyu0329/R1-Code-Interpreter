Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Multiply 2 (when red)\nB: Add 2 (when red)\nC: Multiply 2 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8). The light starts as red, and each button press toggles the light between red and green. The operations performed by each button depend on the current color of the light.\n\nLet's analyze the operations of each button:\n\n1. **Button A**: When the light is red, it multiplies the number by 2.\n2. **Button B**: When the light is red, it adds 2 to the number.\n3. **Button C**: When the light is green, it multiplies the number by 2.\n\nThe initial state is 0 with the light being red. The target is to reach the number 8.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n\n2. **Press Button B**: \n   - Operation: Add 2 (since the light is red)\n   - New Number = 0 + 2 = 2\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n3. **Press Button C**: \n   - Operation: Multiply by 2 (since the light is green)\n   - New Number = 2 * 2 = 4\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n4. **Press Button A**: \n   - Operation: Multiply by 2 (since the light is red)\n   - New Number = 4 * 2 = 8\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\nAt this point, we have reached the target number 8. The sequence of button presses is B, C, A.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<B → C → A>>>"
