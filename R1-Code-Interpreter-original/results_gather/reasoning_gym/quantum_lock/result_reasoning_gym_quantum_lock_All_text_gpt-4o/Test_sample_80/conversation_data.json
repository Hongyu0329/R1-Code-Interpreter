    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (30). We have three buttons, each performing a specific operation on the number, and the effect of button C depends on the state of the light.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target**: \n   - Number: 30\n\n3. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Add 3 (works regardless of light color)\n   - **B**: Subtract 2 (works regardless of light color)\n   - **C**: Multiply by 2 (only when the light is green)\n\n4. **Light Toggle**:\n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n5. **Strategy**:\n   - Since button C is the only one that can significantly increase the number (by multiplying), we should aim to use it effectively when the light is green.\n   - We need to reach a number that can be doubled to get closer to 30, ideally reaching 30 directly or getting as close as possible.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start at 0 (red).\n   - Press A: 0 + 3 = 3 (light turns green).\n   - Press C: 3 * 2 = 6 (light turns red).\n   - Press A: 6 + 3 = 9 (light turns green).\n   - Press C: 9 * 2 = 18 (light turns red).\n   - Press A: 18 + 3 = 21 (light turns green).\n   - Press C: 21 * 2 = 42 (light turns red).\n   - Press B: 42 - 2 = 40 (light turns green).\n   - Press B: 40 - 2 = 38 (light turns red).\n   - Press B: 38 - 2 = 36 (light turns green).\n   - Press B: 36 - 2 = 34 (light turns red).\n   - Press B: 34 - 2 = 32 (light turns green).\n   - Press B: 32 - 2 = 30 (light turns red).\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The sequence of button presses to reach the target number 30 is: A → C → A → C → A → C → B → B → B → B → B → B.\n\nTherefore, the shortest correct sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<A → C → A → C → A → C → B → B → B → B → B → B>>>"
