    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8), while considering the state of the light (red or green) and the operations each button performs.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target**: \n   - Number: 8\n\n3. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Adds 2 to the number regardless of the light's color.\n   - **B**: Adds 1 to the number only if the light is green.\n   - **C**: Multiplies the number by 2 only if the light is green.\n\n4. **Light Toggle**: \n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n5. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to find a sequence of button presses that efficiently reaches the target number 8, while considering the light's state and the operations' conditions.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - **Press A**: \n     - Number: 0 + 2 = 2\n     - Light: Green (toggled from red)\n   - **Press C**: \n     - Number: 2 * 2 = 4 (since the light is green)\n     - Light: Red (toggled from green)\n   - **Press A**: \n     -
