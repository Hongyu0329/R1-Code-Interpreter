  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Add 1 (when any)\nB: Subtract 2 (when red)\nC: Multiply 2 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Adds 1 to the number regardless of the light's color.\n2. **Button B**: Subtracts 2 from the number, but only when the light is red.\n3. **Button C**: Multiplies the number by 2 regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We start with the light being red.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Start**: 0 (red)\n   - We need to reach 8. Multiplying by 2 is a powerful operation, so let's consider using Button C.\n\n2. **Press C**: 0 * 2 = 0 (light toggles to green)\n   - The number remains 0, but the light is now green.\n\n3. **Press A**: 0 + 1 = 1 (light toggles to red)\n   - The number is now 1, and the light is red.\n\n4. **Press C**: 1 * 2 = 2 (light toggles to green)\n   - The number is now 2, and the light is green.\n\n5. **Press C**: 2 * 2 = 4 (light toggles to red)\n   - The number is now 4, and the light is red.\n\n6. **Press C**: 4 * 2 = 8 (light toggles to green)\n   - The number is now 8, which is our target, and the light is green.\n\nThe sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 is: C → A → C → C → C.\n\nTherefore, the shortest correct sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<C → A → C → C → C>>>"
