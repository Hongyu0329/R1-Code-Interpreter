    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (8). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but the operations are independent of the light's state in this case.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Multiply the current number by 2.\n- Button B: Add 1 to the current number.\n- Button C: Subtract 2 from the current number.\n\nThe goal is to reach the number 8 starting from 0 using the shortest sequence of these operations. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the shortest path to the target number.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Start from the initial state (0, red).\n2. Use a queue to explore each possible state by applying each button operation.\n3. Keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.\n4. Stop when we reach the target number (8).\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart = 0\ntarget = 8\n\n# Define the operations for each button\noperations = {\n    'A': lambda x: x * 2,\n    'B': lambda x: x + 1,\n    'C': lambda x: x - 2\n}\n\n# Use a queue to perform BFS\nqueue = deque([(start, [])])  # (current number, sequence of buttons)\nvisited = set()\n\nwhile queue:\n    current, sequence = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # If we reach the target, return the sequence\n    if current == target:\n        print(\" → \".join(sequence))\n        break\n    \n    # Explore each button operation\n    for button, operation in operations.items():\n        next_number = operation(current)\n        \n        # Check if the next number is valid and not visited\n        if next_number not in visited and next_number >= 0:\n            visited.add(next_number)\n            queue.append((next_number, sequence + [button]))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n<<<B → A → A → A>>>"
