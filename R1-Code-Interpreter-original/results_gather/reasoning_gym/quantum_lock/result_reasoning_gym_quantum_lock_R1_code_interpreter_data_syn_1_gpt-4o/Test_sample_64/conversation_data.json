    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number 0 into the target number 21, while considering the toggling of the light between red and green states. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target**: \n   - Number: 21\n\n3. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Subtract 3 (only when the light is red)\n   - **B**: Add 3 (only when the light is green)\n   - **C**: Multiply by 2 (works regardless of the light's color)\n\n4. **Light Toggle**: \n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n5. **Objective**: \n   - Find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 21.\n\nTo solve this, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible sequences of button presses. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possibilities level by level, ensuring that the first time we reach the target, it is through the shortest path.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = (0, 'red')  # (number, light color)\ntarget = 21\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    if light == 'red':\n        return number - 3, 'green'\n    return number, light\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number + 3, 'red'\n    return number, light\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    return number * 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(initial_state, target):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])  # (state, path)\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        (current_number, current_light), path = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if we reached the target\n        if current_number == target:\n            return path\n\n        # If already visited this state, skip it\n        if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n\n        # Explore the next states\n        next_states = [\n            (press_A(current_number, current_light), path + ['A']),\n            (press_B(current_number, current_light), path + ['B']),\n            (press_C(current_number, current_light), path + ['C'])\n        ]\n\n        for state, new_path in next_states:\n            queue.append((state, new_path))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nshortest_sequence = find_shortest_sequence(initial_state, target)\nprint(\" → \".join(shortest_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will execute and return the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 21.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the sequence of button presses needed to reach the target number 21 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n- **C**: Multiply by 2 (0 becomes 0, light toggles to green)\n- **B**: Add 3 (0 becomes 3, light toggles to red)\n- **C**: Multiply by 2 (3 becomes 6, light toggles to green)\n- **B**: Add 3 (6 becomes 9, light toggles to red)\n- **C**: Multiply by 2 (9 becomes 18, light toggles to green)\n- **B**: Add 3 (18 becomes 21, light toggles to red)\n\nThis sequence achieves the target number 21 in the shortest number of button presses. \n\n<<<C → B → C → B → C → B>>>"
