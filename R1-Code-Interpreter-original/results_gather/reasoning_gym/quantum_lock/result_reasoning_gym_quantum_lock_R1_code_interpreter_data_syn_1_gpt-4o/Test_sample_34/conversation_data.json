    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light's state.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n- **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n- **Target**: Number = 8\n- **Buttons**:\n  - **A**: Multiply by 2 (works regardless of light state)\n  - **B**: Subtract 1 (works regardless of light state)\n  - **C**: Add 1 (only works when the light is green)\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Toggle the Light**: Since the light toggles between red and green with each button press, we need to consider the light's state when planning to use button C.\n2. **Efficient Operations**: Multiplying by 2 (button A) is a powerful operation that can quickly increase the number. We should use it strategically to approach the target.\n3. **Reaching the Target**: We need to reach the target number 8, which is a power of 2. This suggests that using button A (multiply by 2) will be effective.\n\n### Plan\n- Start with 0 (red).\n- Use button A to multiply by 2, which will toggle the light and increase the number.\n- Use button C when the light is green to add 1, if needed.\n- Use button B to adjust the number if it overshoots the target.\n\nLet's simulate this process using a Python script to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = (0, 'red')  # (number, light)\n\n# Define the target number\ntarget = 8\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    return (number * 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red')\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    return (number - 1, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red')\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return (number + 1, 'red')\n    return None\n\n# Breadth-first search to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(initial_state, target):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])  # (state, sequence of buttons)\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        (current_number, current_light), sequence = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_number == target:\n            return sequence\n        \n        if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n        \n        # Try pressing each button\n        next_state_A = press_A(current_number, current_light)\n        next_state_B = press_B(current_number, current_light)\n        next_state_C = press_C(current_number, current_light)\n        \n        if next_state_A and next_state_A not in visited:\n            queue.append((next_state_A, sequence + ['A']))\n        \n        if next_state_B and next_state_B not in visited:\n            queue.append((next_state_B, sequence + ['B']))\n        \n        if next_state_C and next_state_C not in visited:\n            queue.append((next_state_C, sequence + ['C']))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(initial_state, target)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will execute and return the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8.",
    "The code has successfully found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n- **A**: Multiply by 2 (0 → 0, light toggles to green)\n- **C**: Add 1 (0 → 1, light toggles to red)\n- **A**: Multiply by 2 (1 → 2, light toggles to green)\n- **A**: Multiply by 2 (2 → 4, light toggles to red)\n- **A**: Multiply by 2 (4 → 8, light toggles to green)\n\nThis sequence efficiently uses the operations to reach the target number. \n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<A → C → A → A → A>>>"
