    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (36), while considering the toggling of the light between red and green. The light starts as red, and each button press toggles the light.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the button operations:\n- Button A: Subtract 3, but only when the light is green.\n- Button B: Multiply by 3, but only when the light is green.\n- Button C: Add 3, regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. Therefore, the sequence of operations must be carefully planned to ensure the light is in the correct state for each operation.\n\nLet's explore the possible sequences using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path to the target number. We'll keep track of the current number, the light's state, and the sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Initial state\nstart = 0\ntarget = 36\ninitial_light = 'red'\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number - 3, 'red'\n    return number, light\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number * 3, 'red'\n    return number, light\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    return number + 3, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    queue = deque([(start, initial_light, [])])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_number, current_light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n\n        if current_number == target:\n            return sequence\n\n        if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n            continue\n\n        visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n\n        # Try each button\n        new_number, new_light = press_A(current_number, current_light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['A']))\n\n        new_number, new_light = press_B(current_number, current_light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['B']))\n\n        new_number, new_light = press_C(current_number, current_light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['C']))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(start, target)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the shortest sequence of button presses.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 36 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n- Press C: 0 + 3 = 3 (light toggles to green)\n- Press B: 3 * 3 = 9 (light toggles to red)\n- Press C: 9 + 3 = 12 (light toggles to green)\n- Press B: 12 * 3 = 36 (light toggles to red)\n\nThis sequence successfully transforms the starting number into the target number while adhering to the rules of the button operations and light toggling.\n\n<<<C → B → C → B>>>"
