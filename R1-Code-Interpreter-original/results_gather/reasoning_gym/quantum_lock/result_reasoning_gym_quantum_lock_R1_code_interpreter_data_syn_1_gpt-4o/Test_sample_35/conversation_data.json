    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (8), while considering the toggling of the light between red and green. The light starts as red.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the button operations:\n- Button A: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button B: Adds 1 to the number, but only when the light is green.\n- Button C: Subtracts 1 from the number, regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\nThe goal is to reach the target number 8 with the fewest button presses. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the possible sequences of button presses. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possibilities level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to the target.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart_number = 0\nstart_light = 'red'\ntarget_number = 8\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    return number * 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number + 1, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n    return None\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    return number - 1, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start_number, start_light, target_number):\n    queue = deque([(start_number, start_light, [])])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_number, current_light, path = queue.popleft()\n\n        if current_number == target_number:\n            return path\n\n        if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n            continue\n\n        visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n\n        # Try pressing each button\n        new_number, new_light = press_A(current_number, current_light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, path + ['A']))\n\n        if current_light == 'green':\n            result = press_B(current_number, current_light)\n            if result:\n                new_number, new_light = result\n                queue.append((new_number, new_light, path + ['B']))\n\n        new_number, new_light = press_C(current_number, current_light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, path + ['C']))\n\n# Find and print the shortest sequence\nshortest_sequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_number, start_light, target_number)\nprint(' → '.join(shortest_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0, considering the toggling of the light. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
