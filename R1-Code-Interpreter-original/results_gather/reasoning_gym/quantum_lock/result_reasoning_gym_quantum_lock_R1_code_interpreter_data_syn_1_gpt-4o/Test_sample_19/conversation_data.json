    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (14), while considering the toggling of the light between red and green. The light starts as red.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the operations:\n\n- Button A: Subtract 1 (works regardless of the light's color).\n- Button B: Add 1 (only works when the light is green).\n- Button C: Multiply by 2 (works regardless of the light's color).\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Initial State**: Start at 0 with the light red.\n2. **Goal**: Reach 14 with the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n### Approach\n\n- We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the shortest path to the target number. \n- Each state can be represented as a tuple `(current_number, light_color)`.\n- We will maintain a queue to explore each state and a set to keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement the BFS approach to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    # Initial state\n    initial_state = (start, 'red')\n    # Queue for BFS\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    # Visited set to avoid revisiting states\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (current_number, light_color), path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the target\n        if current_number == target:\n            return path\n        \n        # Generate possible next states\n        # Button A: Subtract 1\n        next_number = current_number - 1\n        next_light = 'green' if light_color == 'red' else 'red'\n        next_state = (next_number, next_light)\n        if next_state not in visited:\n            visited.add(next_state)\n            queue.append((next_state, path + ['A']))\n        \n        # Button B: Add 1 (only if light is green)\n        if light_color == 'green':\n            next_number = current_number + 1\n            next_light = 'red'\n            next_state = (next_number, next_light)\n            if next_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(next_state)\n                queue.append((next_state, path + ['B']))\n        \n        # Button C: Multiply by 2\n        next_number = current_number * 2\n        next_light = 'green' if light_color == 'red' else 'red'\n        next_state = (next_number, next_light)\n        if next_state not in visited:\n            visited.add(next_state)\n            queue.append((next_state, path + ['C']))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(0, 14)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14 from the starting number 0, considering the toggling of the light. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
