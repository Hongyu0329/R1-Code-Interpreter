    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number 0 into the target number 34, while considering the toggling of the light between red and green. The light starts as red.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the operations:\n- Button A: Subtract 2, toggles the light.\n- Button B: Add 2, only works when the light is red, toggles the light.\n- Button C: Multiply by 3, toggles the light.\n\nThe light starts as red, so initially, we can use button B to add 2. We need to find a sequence that efficiently reaches 34.\n\nLet's explore the possible sequences using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph-like problem.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart_value = 0\ntarget_value = 34\ninitial_light = 'red'\n\n# Define the operations\ndef press_A(value, light):\n    return value - 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_B(value, light):\n    if light == 'red':\n        return value + 2, 'green'\n    return value, light\n\ndef press_C(value, light):\n    return value * 3, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target, initial_light):\n    queue = deque([(start, initial_light, [])])  # (current_value, current_light, sequence)\n    visited = set((start, initial_light))\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_value, current_light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_value == target:\n            return sequence\n        \n        # Try each button\n        # Button A\n        new_value, new_light = press_A(current_value, current_light)\n        if (new_value, new_light) not in visited:\n            visited.add((new_value, new_light))\n            queue.append((new_value, new_light, sequence + ['A']))\n        \n        # Button B\n        new_value, new_light = press_B(current_value, current_light)\n        if (new_value, new_light) not in visited:\n            visited.add((new_value, new_light))\n            queue.append((new_value, new_light, sequence + ['B']))\n        \n        # Button C\n        new_value, new_light = press_C(current_value, current_light)\n        if (new_value, new_light) not in visited:\n            visited.add((new_value, new_light))\n            queue.append((new_value, new_light, sequence + ['C']))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_value, target_value, initial_light)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will execute a breadth-first search to find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value of 34 from the starting value of 0, considering the toggling of the light. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
