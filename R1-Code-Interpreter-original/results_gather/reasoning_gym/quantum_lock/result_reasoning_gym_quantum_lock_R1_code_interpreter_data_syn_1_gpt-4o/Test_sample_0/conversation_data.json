  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 9\nButtons:\nA: Add 1 (when any)\nB: Add 2 (when any)\nC: Subtract 1 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (9). Each button press toggles the light between red and green, but in this case, the operations are independent of the light's state.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Adds 1 to the current number.\n- Button B: Adds 2 to the current number.\n- Button C: Subtracts 1 from the current number.\n\nThe goal is to reach the number 9 starting from 0 using the fewest button presses. Since the operations are simple additions and subtractions, we can use a straightforward approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. Start at 0.\n2. Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible sequences of button presses.\n3. Keep track of the current number and the sequence of button presses that led to it.\n4. Stop when we reach the target number 9.\n\nLet's implement this logic using Python code to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart = 0\ntarget = 9\n\n# Define the operations for each button\noperations = {\n    'A': lambda x: x + 1,\n    'B': lambda x: x + 2,\n    'C': lambda x: x - 1\n}\n\n# Use a queue to perform BFS\nqueue = deque([(start, [])])\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    current, path = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we've reached the target\n    if current == target:\n        print(\" → \".join(path))\n        break\n    \n    # Explore each button press\n    for button, operation in operations.items():\n        new_value = operation(current)\n        new_path = path + [button]\n        queue.append((new_value, new_path))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 9 from the starting number 0. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 9 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n- Press A once to go from 0 to 1.\n- Press B four times to go from 1 to 9.\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<A → B → B → B → B>>>"
