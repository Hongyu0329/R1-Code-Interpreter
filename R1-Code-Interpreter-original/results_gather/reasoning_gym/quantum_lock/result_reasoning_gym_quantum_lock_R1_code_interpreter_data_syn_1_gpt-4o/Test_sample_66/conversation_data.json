    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number 0 into the target number 21, while considering the toggling of the light between red and green states. \n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Subtract 2 (only when the light is green)\n   - **B**: Multiply by 2 (works regardless of the light's color)\n   - **C**: Add 3 (only when the light is green)\n\n3. **Light Toggle**: \n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n4. **Goal**: \n   - Reach the number 21 with the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n### Strategy\n\n- Start with the number 0 and the light being red.\n- Use button B to increase the number efficiently since it works regardless of the light's color.\n- Use button C to add 3 when the light is green to approach the target number.\n- Use button A to adjust the number when necessary, but only when the light is green.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. Use button B to quickly increase the number.\n2. Use button C to add 3 when the light is green to fine-tune the number towards 21.\n3. Use button A if needed to adjust the number downwards when the light is green.\n\nLet's simulate this process using a Python script to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = (0, 'red')  # (number, light color)\ntarget = 21\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number - 2, 'red'\n    return number, light\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    return number * 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number + 3, 'red'\n    return number, light\n\n# Define the BFS function to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(initial_state, target):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])  # (state, sequence of buttons)\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        (current_number, current_light), sequence = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_number == target:\n            return sequence\n        \n        if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n        \n        # Try each button\n        new_state_A = press_A(current_number, current_light)\n        new_state_B = press_B(current_number, current_light)\n        new_state_C = press_C(current_number, current_light)\n        \n        queue.append((new_state_A, sequence + ['A']))\n        queue.append((new_state_B, sequence + ['B']))\n        queue.append((new_state_C, sequence + ['C']))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(initial_state, target)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will execute and return the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 21.",
    "The code has successfully found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 21 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n- **B**: Multiply by 2 (0 becomes 0, light turns green)\n- **C**: Add 3 (0 becomes 3, light turns red)\n- **B**: Multiply by 2 (3 becomes 6, light turns green)\n- **C**: Add 3 (6 becomes 9, light turns red)\n- **B**: Multiply by 2 (9 becomes 18, light turns green)\n- **C**: Add 3 (18 becomes 21, light turns red)\n\nThis sequence efficiently uses the operations to reach the target number 21. \n\n<<<B → C → B → C → B → C>>>"
