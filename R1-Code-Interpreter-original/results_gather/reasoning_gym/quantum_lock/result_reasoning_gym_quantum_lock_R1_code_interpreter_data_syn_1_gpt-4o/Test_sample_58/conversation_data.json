    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (11). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but the operations themselves do not depend on the light's state.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Subtract 2\n- Button B: Add 1\n- Button C: Multiply by 2\n\nThe goal is to reach the target number 11 from the starting number 0 using the fewest button presses. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the shortest path to the target number. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible sequences of button presses level by level, ensuring that the first time we reach the target number, it is through the shortest sequence.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef press_A(n):\n    return n - 2\n\ndef press_B(n):\n    return n + 1\n\ndef press_C(n):\n    return n * 2\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence of button presses\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    queue = deque([(start, \"\", 0)])  # (current_value, sequence_of_buttons, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_value, sequence, steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_value == target:\n            return sequence\n        \n        if current_value in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add(current_value)\n        \n        # Try each button press\n        for button, operation in [('A', press_A), ('B', press_B), ('C', press_C)]:\n            new_value = operation(current_value)\n            new_sequence = sequence + (f\" → {button}\" if sequence else button)\n            queue.append((new_value, new_sequence, steps + 1))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Start the search\nresult = find_shortest_sequence(0, 11)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 11 from the starting number 0. Let's see the result.",
