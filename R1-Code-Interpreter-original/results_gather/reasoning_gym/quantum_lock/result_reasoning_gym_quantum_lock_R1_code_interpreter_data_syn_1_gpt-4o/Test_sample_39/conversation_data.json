    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (24), while considering the effect of each button on the light and the number.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n- **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n- **Target State**: Number = 24\n- **Buttons**:\n  - **A**: Multiplies the number by 2, toggles the light.\n  - **B**: Adds 2 to the number, toggles the light.\n  - **C**: Adds 2 to the number only if the light is green, toggles the light.\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Understand the Operations**:\n   - Button A and B can be used regardless of the light's color.\n   - Button C can only be used when the light is green.\n\n2. **Goal**: Reach 24 using the fewest button presses.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible sequences of button presses.\n   - Keep track of the current number and the light's state.\n   - Use a queue to explore each state and its possible transitions.\n   - Stop when the target number is reached.\n\n### Implementation\nWe'll implement a BFS to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Initial state\nstart_number = 0\nstart_light = 'red'\ntarget_number = 24\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    return number * 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    return number + 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number + 2, 'red'\n    return number, light\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start_number, start_light, target_number):\n    queue = deque([(start_number, start_light, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        number, light, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if number == target_number:\n            return path\n        \n        if (number, light) in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add((number, light))\n        \n        # Try each button\n        new_number, new_light = press_A(number, light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, path + ['A']))\n        \n        new_number, new_light = press_B(number, light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, path + ['B']))\n        \n        new_number, new_light = press_C(number, light)\n        if new_number != number:  # Only add if C was effective\n            queue.append((new_number, new_light, path + ['C']))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_number, start_light, target_number)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 24 from the starting number 0, considering the light's state.",
