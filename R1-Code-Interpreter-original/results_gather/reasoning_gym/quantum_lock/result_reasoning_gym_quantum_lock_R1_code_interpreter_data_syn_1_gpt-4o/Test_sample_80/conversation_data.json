    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (30). The light starts as red, and it toggles between red and green with each button press. The operations are as follows:\n\n- Button A: Adds 3 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button B: Subtracts 2 from the number, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button C: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is green.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press, so we need to keep track of the light's state as well as the current number.\n\nLet's explore the possible sequences of button presses to reach the target number efficiently. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest sequence of operations.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart_number = 0\ntarget_number = 30\ninitial_light = 'red'\n\n# Define the operations\ndef press_A(number):\n    return number + 3\n\ndef press_B(number):\n    return number - 2\n\ndef press_C(number):\n    return number * 2\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    queue = deque([(start, initial_light, [])])  # (current number, light state, sequence of presses)\n    visited = set()  # To keep track of visited states\n\n    while queue:\n        current_number, light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if we have reached the target\n        if current_number == target:\n            return sequence\n\n        # If this state has been visited, skip it\n        if (current_number, light) in visited:\n            continue\n\n        # Mark this state as visited\n        visited.add((current_number, light))\n\n        # Try pressing each button and add the new state to the queue\n        # Press A\n        new_number = press_A(current_number)\n        new_light = 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['A']))\n\n        # Press B\n        new_number = press_B(current_number)\n        new_light = 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['B']))\n\n        # Press C (only if the light is green)\n        if light == 'green':\n            new_number = press_C(current_number)\n            new_light = 'red'  # Light will toggle to red\n            queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['C']))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_number, target_number)\nprint(' → '.join(sequence))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the shortest sequence of button presses.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the sequence of button presses needed to reach the target number 30 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n- Press A five times to add 15 (3 * 5) to the starting number 0, resulting in 15.\n- The light will toggle between red and green with each press, so after five presses, the light will be green.\n- Press C once to multiply the current number 15 by 2, resulting in 30.\n\nThis sequence efficiently reaches the target number with the fewest button presses.\n\n<<<A → A → A → A → A → C>>>"
