    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (13). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but since the operations are independent of the light's state, we can focus solely on the numerical transformations.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Subtract 2\n- Button B: Add 3\n- Button C: Multiply by 2\n\nWe start at 0 and want to reach 13. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the shortest path to the target number. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possibilities at the current depth before moving deeper, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Start from 0 and apply each button operation.\n2. Keep track of the sequence of operations.\n3. Use a queue to explore each state and its resulting states.\n4. Stop when we reach the target number 13.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the operations\ndef apply_operation(value, button):\n    if button == 'A':\n        return value - 2\n    elif button == 'B':\n        return value + 3\n    elif button == 'C':\n        return value * 2\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])  # (current_value, sequence_of_buttons)\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_value, sequence = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_value == target:\n            return sequence\n        \n        if current_value in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add(current_value)\n        \n        for button in ['A', 'B', 'C']:\n            new_value = apply_operation(current_value, button)\n            if new_value not in visited:\n                queue.append((new_value, sequence + [button]))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the shortest sequence from 0 to 13\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(0, 13)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 13 from the starting number 0. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 13 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n<<<B → B → C → A → B>>>"
