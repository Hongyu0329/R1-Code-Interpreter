  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (33). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but since the operations are independent of the light's state, we can focus solely on the numerical transformations.\n\nThe available operations are:\n- Button A: Add 3\n- Button B: Subtract 2\n- Button C: Subtract 3\n\nThe goal is to reach the number 33 starting from 0 using the fewest button presses. We can approach this problem using a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. In this context, each state (current number) is a node, and each button press is an edge to a new state.\n\nLet's implement a BFS to find the shortest sequence of button presses:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the operations for each button\noperations = {\n    'A': lambda x: x + 3,\n    'B': lambda x: x - 2,\n    'C': lambda x: x - 3\n}\n\n# Initialize the BFS queue\nqueue = deque([(0, [])])  # (current number, sequence of buttons)\n\n# Set to keep track of visited numbers to avoid cycles\nvisited = set()\n\n# Target number\ntarget = 33\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    current, sequence = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we've reached the target\n    if current == target:\n        print(\" → \".join(sequence))\n        break\n    \n    # Explore each button press\n    for button, operation in operations.items():\n        next_number = operation(current)\n        \n        # If the next number is not visited, add it to the queue\n        if next_number not in visited:\n            visited.add(next_number)\n            queue.append((next_number, sequence + [button]))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 33 from the starting number 0. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 33 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n<<<A → A → A → A → A → A → A → A → A → A → A>>>"
