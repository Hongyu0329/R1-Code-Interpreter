    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (42), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light's state.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n- **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n- **Target**: Number = 42\n- **Buttons**:\n  - **A**: Subtract 3 (works regardless of light state)\n  - **B**: Add 2 (works regardless of light state)\n  - **C**: Multiply by 3 (only when light is red)\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Initial Step**: Start with the number 0 and light red.\n2. **Button C**: Since the light is red, we can use button C to multiply the number by 3. However, starting from 0, multiplying by 3 will still result in 0. Thus, we need to first increase the number using button B.\n3. **Button B**: Add 2 to the number. This will change the number to 2 and toggle the light to green.\n4. **Button A**: Subtract 3 is not useful initially as it will take us to negative numbers.\n5. **Button C**: We need the light to be red to use button C effectively. So, we need to toggle the light back to red by pressing button B again.\n6. **Repeat**: Use a combination of button presses to reach the target number.\n\n### Plan\n- Use button B to increase the number and toggle the light.\n- Use button C when the light is red to multiply the number.\n- Avoid using button A initially as it decreases the number.\n\n### Implementation\nWe will write a Python script to simulate the button presses and find the shortest sequence to reach the target number.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = (0, 'red')  # (number, light color)\ntarget = 42\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    return number - 3, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    return number + 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    if light == 'red':\n        return number * 3, 'green'\n    return number, light\n\n# Breadth-first search to find the shortest sequence\nqueue = deque([(initial_state, [])])  # (state, sequence of buttons)\nvisited = set()\n\nwhile queue:\n    (current_number, current_light), sequence = queue.popleft()\n    \n    if current_number == target:\n        print(' → '.join(sequence))\n        break\n    \n    if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n        continue\n    \n    visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n    \n    # Try each button\n    next_state_A = press_A(current_number, current_light)\n    next_state_B = press_B(current_number, current_light)\n    next_state_C = press_C(current_number, current_light)\n    \n    queue.append((next_state_A, sequence + ['A']))\n    queue.append((next_state_B, sequence + ['B']))\n    queue.append((next_state_C, sequence + ['C']))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 42. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
