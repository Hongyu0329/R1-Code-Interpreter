    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number 0 into the target number 26, while considering the toggling of the light between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n- **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n- **Target State**: Number = 26\n- **Button Operations**:\n  - **A**: Multiply the number by 3 (light toggles)\n  - **B**: Add 2 to the number if the light is red (light toggles)\n  - **C**: Add 2 to the number if the light is green (light toggles)\n\n### Approach\n1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This is a classic shortest path problem in an implicit graph where each state is defined by a pair (number, light color). We will use BFS to explore all possible states starting from (0, Red) and find the shortest path to (26, any color).\n\n2. **State Representation**: Each state can be represented as a tuple (number, light color).\n\n3. **Queue for BFS**: We will use a queue to explore each state. Each entry in the queue will be a tuple containing the current number, the current light color, and the sequence of button presses that led to this state.\n\n4. **Visited States**: To avoid revisiting states, we will maintain a set of visited states.\n\n5. **Transition Function**: For each state, we will apply each button operation that is valid for the current light color, compute the new state, and add it to the queue if it hasn't been visited.\n\n### Implementation\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Initial state\nstart_number = 0\nstart_light = 'red'\ntarget_number = 26\n\n# Queue for BFS: (current_number, current_light, sequence_of_buttons)\nqueue = deque([(start_number, start_light, [])])\n\n# Visited states to avoid revisiting\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add((start_number, start_light))\n\n# BFS loop\nwhile queue:\n    current_number, current_light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we reached the target\n    if current_number == target_number:\n        print(\" → \".join(sequence))\n        break\n    \n    # Apply button A (Multiply by 3)\n    new_number = current_number * 3\n    new_light = 'green' if current_light == 'red' else 'red'\n    if (new_number, new_light) not in visited:\n        visited.add((new_number, new_light))\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['A']))\n    \n    # Apply button B (Add 2 if red)\n    if current_light == 'red':\n        new_number = current_number + 2\n        new_light = 'green'\n        if (new_number, new_light) not in visited:\n            visited.add((new_number, new_light))\n            queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['B']))\n    \n    # Apply button C (Add 2 if green)\n    if current_light == 'green':\n        new_number = current_number + 2\n        new_light = 'red'\n        if (new_number, new_light) not in visited:\n            visited.add((new_number, new_light))\n            queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['C']))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 26. Let's execute it to get the result.",
