  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 2 (when any)\nB: Add 2 (when any)\nC: Multiply 2 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (8). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but in this case, the operations are independent of the light's state.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n- Button A: Subtract 2\n- Button B: Add 2\n- Button C: Multiply by 2\n\nStarting from 0, we need to reach 8. The most efficient way to reach 8 is to use the multiplication operation, as it increases the number more significantly than addition or subtraction. However, since we start at 0, multiplying by 2 will not change the number. Therefore, we need to first increase the number using addition.\n\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Start at 0.\n2. Press B (Add 2): 0 + 2 = 2\n3. Press C (Multiply by 2): 2 * 2 = 4\n4. Press C (Multiply by 2): 4 * 2 = 8\n\nThis sequence reaches the target number 8 in three steps. Let's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure correctness.\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nnumber = 0\nsequence = []\n\n# Step 1: Add 2\nnumber += 2\nsequence.append('B')\n\n# Step 2: Multiply by 2\nnumber *= 2\nsequence.append('C')\n\n# Step 3: Multiply by 2\nnumber *= 2\nsequence.append('C')\n\n# Output the sequence and final number\nprint(\"Sequence:\", \" → \".join(sequence))\nprint(\"Final Number:\", number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the sequence and the final number.",
    "The code executed successfully, confirming that the sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0 is correct. The sequence is:\n\n<<<B → C → C>>>"
