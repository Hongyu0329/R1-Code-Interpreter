    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (27), while considering the toggling of the light between red and green with each button press.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Adds 2 to the number when the light is red.\n   - **B**: Multiplies the number by 3 when the light is green.\n   - **C**: Adds 3 to the number when the light is green.\n\n3. **Goal**: \n   - Reach the number 27.\n\n4. **Constraints**:\n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n   - We need the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\nTo solve this, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible sequences of button presses, keeping track of the number and the light state. We will stop as soon as we reach the target number.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = (0, 'red')  # (number, light)\n\n# Define the target number\ntarget = 27\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number):\n    return number + 2\n\ndef press_B(number):\n    return number * 3\n\ndef press_C(number):\n    return number + 3\n\n# Define the BFS queue\nqueue = deque([(initial_state, [])])  # (state, sequence of buttons)\n\n# Define a set to keep track of visited states\nvisited = set()\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (current_number, current_light), sequence = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the target\n    if current_number == target:\n        print('<<<' + ' → '.join(sequence) + '>>>')\n        break\n    \n    # If the current state has been visited, skip it\n    if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n        continue\n    \n    # Mark the current state as visited\n    visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n    \n    # Generate new states based on the current light\n    if current_light == 'red':\n        # Press button A\n        new_number = press_A(current_number)\n        new_light = 'green'\n        queue.append(((new_number, new_light), sequence + ['A']))\n    else:\n        # Press button B\n        new_number = press_B(current_number)\n        new_light = 'red'\n        queue.append(((new_number, new_light), sequence + ['B']))\n        \n        # Press button C\n        new_number = press_C(current_number)\n        new_light = 'red'\n        queue.append(((new_number, new_light), sequence + ['C']))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 27, considering the toggling of the light. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
