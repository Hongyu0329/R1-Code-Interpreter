    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (12). The light starts as red, and it toggles between red and green with each button press. The operations of the buttons are as follows:\n\n- Button A: Subtract 1, but only when the light is green.\n- Button B: Subtract 1, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button C: Add 2, regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press, so we need to keep track of the light's state as well as the current number.\n\nLet's simulate the process to find the shortest sequence of button presses:\n\n1. Start at 0 with the light red.\n2. Use button C to add 2, which is always possible. This will toggle the light to green.\n3. Repeat using button C until we get close to 12.\n4. If we overshoot 12, use button A or B to adjust the number.\n\nWe will write a Python script to simulate this process and find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart = 0\ntarget = 12\ninitial_light = 'red'\n\n# Define the operations for each button\noperations = {\n    'A': lambda x, light: (x - 1, 'red' if light == 'green' else 'green') if light == 'green' else (x, light),\n    'B': lambda x, light: (x - 1, 'red' if light == 'green' else 'green'),\n    'C': lambda x, light: (x + 2, 'red' if light == 'green' else 'green')\n}\n\n# Use a queue to perform a breadth-first search\nqueue = deque([(start, initial_light, [])])\nvisited = set()\n\nwhile queue:\n    current_value, current_light, path = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the target\n    if current_value == target:\n        print(' → '.join(path))\n        break\n    \n    # Try each button\n    for button, operation in operations.items():\n        new_value, new_light = operation(current_value, current_light)\n        \n        # Avoid revisiting the same state\n        if (new_value, new_light) not in visited:\n            visited.add((new_value, new_light))\n            queue.append((new_value, new_light, path + [button]))\n```\n\nThis script uses a breadth-first search to explore all possible sequences of button presses, ensuring that we find the shortest sequence to reach the target value. The output will be the sequence of button presses.",
    "The code has successfully found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value of 12 starting from 0. The sequence is:\n\n- Press button C six times.\n\nEach press of button C adds 2 to the current number, and since the light's color does not affect button C, we can repeatedly press it to reach the target.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<C → C → C → C → C → C>>>"
