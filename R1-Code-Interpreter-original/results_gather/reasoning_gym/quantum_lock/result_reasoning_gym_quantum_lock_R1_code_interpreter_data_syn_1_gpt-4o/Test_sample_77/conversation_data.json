  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (14). Each button press toggles the light between red and green, but since the operations are independent of the light's state, we can focus solely on the numerical transformations.\n\nThe available operations are:\n- Button A: Add 3\n- Button B: Add 2\n- Button C: Subtract 3\n\nThe goal is to reach the number 14 starting from 0 using the fewest button presses. We can approach this problem by considering it as a shortest path problem in a graph where each node represents a number and each edge represents a button press.\n\nLet's use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the possible sequences of button presses. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possibilities at the current depth (number of button presses) before moving on to deeper levels, ensuring that we find the shortest sequence.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Start from the initial number (0).\n2. Apply each button operation to generate new numbers.\n3. Keep track of the sequence of button presses that led to each number.\n4. Stop when we reach the target number (14).\n5. Return the sequence of button presses.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the button operations\noperations = {\n    'A': lambda x: x + 3,\n    'B': lambda x: x + 2,\n    'C': lambda x: x - 3\n}\n\n# Initialize the BFS queue\nqueue = deque([(0, [])])  # (current number, sequence of button presses)\nvisited = set()  # To keep track of visited numbers\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    current, sequence = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we've reached the target\n    if current == 14:\n        print(\" → \".join(sequence))\n        break\n    \n    # Explore the next states\n    for button, operation in operations.items():\n        next_number = operation(current)\n        if next_number not in visited:\n            visited.add(next_number)\n            queue.append((next_number, sequence + [button]))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14 from the starting number 0. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n<<<A → A → A → A → B>>>"
