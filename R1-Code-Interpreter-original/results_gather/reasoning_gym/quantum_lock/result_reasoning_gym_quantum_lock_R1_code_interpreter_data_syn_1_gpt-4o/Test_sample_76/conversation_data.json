    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number 0 into the target number 13, while considering the toggling of the light between red and green. The light starts as red.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the button operations:\n- Button A: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button B: Adds 1 to the number, but only when the light is red.\n- Button C: Subtracts 1 from the number, regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy\n1. Start at 0 with the light red.\n2. Use button B to increment the number when the light is red.\n3. Use button A to double the number when needed.\n4. Use button C to decrement the number if necessary.\n\n### Plan\n- Since the target is 13, which is an odd number, we need to end with a red light to use button B for the final increment.\n- We can use button A to quickly increase the number by doubling it.\n- We need to carefully plan the sequence to ensure the light is red when we need to add 1.\n\nLet's simulate this process using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart = (0, 'red')  # (number, light color)\ntarget = 13\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    return (number * 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red')\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    if light == 'red':\n        return (number + 1, 'green')\n    return None\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    return (number - 1, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red')\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\nqueue = deque([(start, [])])  # (state, path)\nvisited = set()\n\nwhile queue:\n    (current_number, current_light), path = queue.popleft()\n    \n    if current_number == target:\n        print(' → '.join(path))\n        break\n    \n    # Try pressing each button\n    # Press A\n    new_state = press_A(current_number, current_light)\n    if new_state not in visited:\n        visited.add(new_state)\n        queue.append((new_state, path + ['A']))\n    \n    # Press B\n    if current_light == 'red':\n        new_state = press_B(current_number, current_light)\n        if new_state not in visited:\n            visited.add(new_state)\n            queue.append((new_state, path + ['B']))\n    \n    # Press C\n    new_state = press_C(current_number, current_light)\n    if new_state not in visited:\n        visited.add(new_state)\n        queue.append((new_state, path + ['C']))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 13 from the starting number 0, considering the toggling of the light. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 13 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n- Start at 0 (red)\n- Press B: 0 + 1 = 1 (green)\n- Press A: 1 * 2 = 2 (red)\n- Press A: 2 * 2 = 4 (green)\n- Press A: 4 * 2 = 8 (red)\n- Press C: 8 - 1 = 7 (green)\n- Press A: 7 * 2 = 14 (red)\n- Press C: 14 - 1 = 13 (green)\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press, and the sequence ends with the number 13.\n\n<<<B → A → A → A → C → A → C>>>"
