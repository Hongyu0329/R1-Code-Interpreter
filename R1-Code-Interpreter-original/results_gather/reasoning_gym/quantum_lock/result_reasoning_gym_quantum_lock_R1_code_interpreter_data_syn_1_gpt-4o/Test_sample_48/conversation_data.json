    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (14), while considering the toggling of the light between red and green.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Start**: 0 (red)\n- **Target**: 14\n- **Buttons**:\n  - **A**: Subtract 2 (works regardless of light color)\n  - **B**: Subtract 3 (only works when the light is green)\n  - **C**: Add 2 (works regardless of light color)\n\n### Light Toggling:\n- Each button press toggles the light between red and green.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. We start at 0 with the light red.\n2. We need to reach 14 with the fewest button presses.\n3. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the shortest path to the target number.\n\n### BFS Approach:\n- Use a queue to explore each state (current number and light color).\n- Track visited states to avoid cycles.\n- For each state, consider all possible button presses and enqueue the resulting states.\n- Stop when we reach the target number with the correct light color.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart_number = 0\ntarget_number = 14\ninitial_light = 'red'  # Light starts as red\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    return number - 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number - 3, 'red'\n    return None\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    return number + 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    queue = deque([(start, initial_light, [])])  # (current number, light color, sequence of buttons)\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_number, current_light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if we reached the target\n        if current_number == target:\n            return sequence\n\n        # Mark the current state as visited\n        visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n\n        # Try pressing each button\n        for button, operation in [('A', press_A), ('B', press_B), ('C', press_C)]:\n            result = operation(current_number, current_light)\n            if result:\n                new_number, new_light = result\n                if (new_number, new_light) not in visited:\n                    queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + [button]))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_number, target_number)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will execute and return the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14 from the starting number 0.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the sequence of button presses needed to reach the target number 14 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n<<<C → C → C → C → C → C → C>>>"
