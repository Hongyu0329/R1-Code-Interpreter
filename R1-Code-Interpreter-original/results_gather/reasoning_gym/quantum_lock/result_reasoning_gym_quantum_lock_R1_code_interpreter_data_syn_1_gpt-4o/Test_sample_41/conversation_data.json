    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (17). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but the operations themselves do not depend on the light's state.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Multiply the current number by 2.\n- Button B: Add 3 to the current number.\n- Button C: Subtract 2 from the current number.\n\nThe goal is to reach the target number 17 from the starting number 0 using the shortest sequence of these operations.\n\nTo find the shortest sequence, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. This approach will explore all possible sequences of button presses, starting from the initial state, and will stop as soon as it reaches the target number.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef button_A(n):\n    return n * 2\n\ndef button_B(n):\n    return n + 3\n\ndef button_C(n):\n    return n - 2\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence of button presses\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    # Queue for BFS: stores tuples of (current number, sequence of buttons)\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])\n    visited = set()  # To keep track of visited numbers\n\n    while queue:\n        current, sequence = queue.popleft()\n\n        # If we reach the target, return the sequence\n        if current == target:\n            return sequence\n\n        # If the current number has been visited, skip it\n        if current in visited:\n            continue\n\n        # Mark the current number as visited\n        visited.add(current)\n\n        # Explore the next states by pressing each button\n        next_states = [\n            (button_A(current), sequence + ['A']),\n            (button_B(current), sequence + ['B']),\n            (button_C(current), sequence + ['C'])\n        ]\n\n        # Add valid next states to the queue\n        for next_state, next_sequence in next_states:\n            if next_state not in visited:\n                queue.append((next_state, next_sequence))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence from 0 to 17\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(0, 17)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 17 from the starting number 0. Let's run the code to see the result.",
