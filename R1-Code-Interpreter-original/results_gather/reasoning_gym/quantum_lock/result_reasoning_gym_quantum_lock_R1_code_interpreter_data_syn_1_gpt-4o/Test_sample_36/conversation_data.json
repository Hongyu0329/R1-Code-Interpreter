    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (30). The light starts as red, and it toggles between red and green with each button press. The operations available are:\n\n- Button A: Multiply by 2, but only when the light is green.\n- Button B: Add 3, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button C: Multiply by 3, regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press, so we need to keep track of the light's state as we apply operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Start at 0 with the light red.\n2. We can only use Button B initially since Button A requires the light to be green.\n3. We need to find a sequence of operations that will reach exactly 30.\n\nTo find the shortest sequence, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. In this case, each state (number, light color) can be considered a node, and each button press is an edge.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart = (0, 'red')  # (number, light color)\ntarget = 30\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number * 2, 'red'\n    return None\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    return number + 3, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    return number * 3, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])  # (state, path)\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        (current_number, current_light), path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_number == target:\n            return path\n        \n        if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n        \n        # Try each button\n        if current_light == 'green':\n            new_state = press_A(current_number, current_light)\n            if new_state:\n                queue.append((new_state, path + ['A']))\n        \n        new_state = press_B(current_number, current_light)\n        queue.append((new_state, path + ['B']))\n        \n        new_state = press_C(current_number, current_light)\n        queue.append((new_state, path + ['C']))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(start, target)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will execute and return the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 30.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 30. The sequence is:\n\n- Start at 0 (red light).\n- Press B: 0 + 3 = 3 (light turns green).\n- Press C: 3 * 3 = 9 (light turns red).\n- Press C: 9 * 3 = 27 (light turns green).\n- Press B: 27 + 3 = 30 (light turns red).\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<B → C → C → B>>>"
