    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (24). The light starts as red, and it toggles between red and green with each button press. The operations for each button are as follows:\n\n- Button A: Adds 3 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button B: Subtracts 2 from the number, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button C: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is green.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press, so we need to keep track of the light's state as well as the current number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Start at 0 with the light red.\n2. Pressing A will add 3, and the light will turn green.\n3. Pressing B will subtract 2, and the light will turn green.\n4. Pressing C will multiply by 2, but only if the light is green.\n\nThe goal is to reach 24 using the shortest sequence of button presses. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the possible sequences of button presses. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possibilities level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to the target.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart_number = 0\ntarget_number = 24\ninitial_light = 'red'\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    return number + 3, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    return number - 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number * 2, 'red'\n    return number, light\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    queue = deque([(start, initial_light, [])])  # (current number, light state, sequence of presses)\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_number, current_light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if we reached the target\n        if current_number == target:\n            return sequence\n\n        # Avoid revisiting the same state\n        if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n\n        # Try each button\n        for button, operation in [('A', press_A), ('B', press_B), ('C', press_C)]:\n            new_number, new_light = operation(current_number, current_light)\n            new_sequence = sequence + [button]\n            queue.append((new_number, new_light, new_sequence))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nshortest_sequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_number, target_number)\nprint(\" → \".join(shortest_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will execute and return the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 24.",
