    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (8). The light starts as red, and it toggles between red and green with each button press. The operations associated with each button are as follows:\n\n- Button A: Adds 1 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button B: Subtracts 2 from the number, but only when the light is red.\n- Button C: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We need to consider the light's state when deciding which button to press, especially for button B, which only works when the light is red.\n\nLet's explore the possible sequences of button presses to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest sequence.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart = 0\ntarget = 8\ninitial_light = 'red'\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef press_A(number):\n    return number + 1\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    if light == 'red':\n        return number - 2\n    return None\n\ndef press_C(number):\n    return number * 2\n\n# Define the BFS function to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target, initial_light):\n    # Queue for BFS: stores tuples of (current_number, current_light, sequence_of_buttons)\n    queue = deque([(start, initial_light, [])])\n    visited = set()  # To keep track of visited states\n\n    while queue:\n        current_number, current_light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if we have reached the target\n        if current_number == target:\n            return sequence\n\n        # Toggle the light\n        next_light = 'green' if current_light == 'red' else 'red'\n\n        # Try pressing each button and add the new state to the queue\n        # Press A\n        new_number = press_A(current_number)\n        if (new_number, next_light) not in visited:\n            visited.add((new_number, next_light))\n            queue.append((new_number, next_light, sequence + ['A']))\n\n        # Press B\n        new_number = press_B(current_number, current_light)\n        if new_number is not None and (new_number, next_light) not in visited:\n            visited.add((new_number, next_light))\n            queue.append((new_number, next_light, sequence + ['B']))\n\n        # Press C\n        new_number = press_C(current_number)\n        if (new_number, next_light) not in visited:\n            visited.add((new_number, next_light))\n            queue.append((new_number, next_light, sequence + ['C']))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(start, target, initial_light)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the shortest sequence of button presses.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n- Press A: 0 + 1 = 1 (light toggles to green)\n- Press A: 1 + 1 = 2 (light toggles to red)\n- Press C: 2 * 2 = 4 (light toggles to green)\n- Press C: 4 * 2 = 8 (light toggles to red)\n\nThis sequence successfully transforms the starting number to the target number using the shortest path. \n\n<<<A → A → C → C>>>"
