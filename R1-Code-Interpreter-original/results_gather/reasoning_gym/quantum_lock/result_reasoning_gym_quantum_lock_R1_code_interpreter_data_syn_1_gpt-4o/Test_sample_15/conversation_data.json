    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number 0 into the target number 24, while considering the toggling of the light between red and green states.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target State**: \n   - Number: 24\n\n3. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Multiply by 2 (works regardless of light state)\n   - **B**: Add 2 (works regardless of light state)\n   - **C**: Multiply by 2 (only when the light is green)\n\n4. **Light Toggling**: \n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy\n- We need to find a sequence of button presses that will reach the target number 24.\n- The sequence should be the shortest possible, meaning the fewest number of button presses.\n- We need to keep track of the light state because it affects the operation of button C.\n\n### Approach\n- We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible sequences of button presses.\n- Each state in the search will be defined by the current number and the light state.\n- We will explore all possible button presses from each state and keep track of the sequence of presses.\n- We will stop when we reach the target number 24.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_number = 0\ninitial_light = 'red'  # 'red' or 'green'\ntarget_number = 24\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    return number * 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    return number + 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number * 2, 'red'\n    return number, light\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence():\n    queue = deque([(initial_number, initial_light, [])])  # (number, light, sequence)\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        number, light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the target\n        if number == target_number:\n            return sequence\n        \n        # Check if this state has been visited\n        if (number, light) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add((number, light))\n        \n        # Try pressing each button\n        new_number, new_light = press_A(number, light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['A']))\n        \n        new_number, new_light = press_B(number, light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['B']))\n        \n        new_number, new_light = press_C(number, light)\n        if new_number != number:  # Only add if C was effective\n            queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['C']))\n\n# Find and print the shortest sequence\nshortest_sequence = find_shortest_sequence()\nprint(' → '.join(shortest_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will execute and return the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 24.",
