    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (13), while considering the effect of each button on the light and the number.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Adds 3 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button B: Subtracts 2 from the number, but only when the light is red.\n- Button C: Subtracts 3 from the number, regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We start with the light being red.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of button presses that will reach the target number 13. The sequence should be as short as possible.\n\nTo approach this, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible sequences of button presses. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possibilities level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest sequence first.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart_number = 0\ntarget_number = 13\ninitial_light = 'red'\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    return number + 3, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    if light == 'red':\n        return number - 2, 'green'\n    return number, light\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    return number - 3, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    queue = deque([(start, initial_light, [])])  # (current number, current light, sequence of presses)\n    visited = set()  # To keep track of visited states\n\n    while queue:\n        current_number, current_light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if we reached the target\n        if current_number == target:\n            return sequence\n\n        # Check if this state has been visited\n        if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n\n        # Try each button\n        new_number, new_light = press_A(current_number, current_light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['A']))\n\n        new_number, new_light = press_B(current_number, current_light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['B']))\n\n        new_number, new_light = press_C(current_number, current_light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['C']))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nshortest_sequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_number, target_number)\nprint(' → '.join(shortest_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 13 from the starting number 0, considering the light's state. Let's execute it to get the result.",
