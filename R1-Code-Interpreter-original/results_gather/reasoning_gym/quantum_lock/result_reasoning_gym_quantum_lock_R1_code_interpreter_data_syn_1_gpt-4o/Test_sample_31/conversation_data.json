    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (31), while considering the toggling of the light between red and green. The light starts as red and toggles with each button press.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the button operations:\n- Button A: Subtracts 2 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n- Button B: Subtracts 2 from the number, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button C: Adds 3 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We need to keep track of the light's state and the current number to determine the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\nLet's use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible sequences of button presses. We'll maintain a queue of states, where each state consists of the current number, the light's color, and the sequence of button presses taken to reach that state. We'll explore each state by pressing each button and adding the resulting state to the queue if it hasn't been visited yet.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart_number = 0\ntarget_number = 31\ninitial_light = 'red'  # Light starts as red\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_button_A(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number - 2, 'red'\n    return number, 'green'\n\ndef press_button_B(number, light):\n    return number - 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_button_C(number, light):\n    return number + 3, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\n# Initialize the queue with the starting state\nqueue = deque([(start_number, initial_light, [])])\nvisited = set((start_number, initial_light))\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    current_number, current_light, path = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we've reached the target\n    if current_number == target_number:\n        print(' → '.join(path))\n        break\n    \n    # Explore the next states\n    for button, operation in [('A', press_button_A), ('B', press_button_B), ('C', press_button_C)]:\n        next_number, next_light = operation(current_number, current_light)\n        if (next_number, next_light) not in visited:\n            visited.add((next_number, next_light))\n            queue.append((next_number, next_light, path + [button]))\n```\n\nThis code will output the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
