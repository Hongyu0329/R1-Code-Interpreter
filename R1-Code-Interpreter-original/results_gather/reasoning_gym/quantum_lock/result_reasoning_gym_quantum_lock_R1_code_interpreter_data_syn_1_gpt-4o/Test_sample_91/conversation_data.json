  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 1 (when green)\nB: Add 2 (when any)\nC: Subtract 2 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (8), while considering the effect of each button on the light and the number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target State**:\n   - Number: 8\n\n3. **Button Effects**:\n   - **A**: Subtract 1 (only when the light is green)\n   - **B**: Add 2 (works regardless of the light's color)\n   - **C**: Subtract 2 (only when the light is green)\n\n4. **Light Toggle**:\n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\nGiven these rules, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Since button B is the only button that can be used regardless of the light's color and it adds 2 to the number, it seems to be the most straightforward way to increase the number.\n- We can press button B repeatedly to increase the number by 2 each time.\n- We need to determine how many times we need to press button B to reach the target number 8.\n\nLet's calculate the number of times we need to press button B to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0.\n\n```python\n# Initial number\nnumber = 0\n\n# Target number\ntarget = 8\n\n# Button B effect\nbutton_B_effect = 2\n\n# Calculate the number of times to press button B\nbutton_B_presses = (target - number) // button_B_effect\n\n# Print the sequence of button presses\nsequence = \"B \" * button_B_presses\nprint(sequence.strip().replace(\" \", \" → \"))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of times we need to press button B to reach the target number 8 and print the sequence of button presses.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of button presses needed to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0. \n\nThe sequence is:\n- Press button B four times, as each press of button B adds 2 to the number, and the light's color does not affect this operation.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number is:\n\n<<<B → B → B → B>>>"
