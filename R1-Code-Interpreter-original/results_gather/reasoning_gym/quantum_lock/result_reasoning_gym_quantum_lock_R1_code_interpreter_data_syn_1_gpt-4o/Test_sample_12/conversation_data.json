    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number 0 into the target number 27. The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but since the operations are independent of the light's state, we can focus solely on the numerical transformations.\n\nThe available operations are:\n- Button A: Multiply the current number by 2.\n- Button B: Add 3 to the current number.\n- Button C: Add 2 to the current number.\n\nWe can approach this problem using a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here, each state (current number) can be considered a node, and each button press represents an edge to a new node.\n\nLet's implement a BFS to find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 27 from the starting number 0.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef button_A(n):\n    return n * 2\n\ndef button_B(n):\n    return n + 3\n\ndef button_C(n):\n    return n + 2\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence of button presses\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    queue = deque([(start, \"\", 0)])  # (current number, sequence of buttons, depth)\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current, sequence, depth = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current == target:\n            return sequence\n        \n        if current in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add(current)\n        \n        # Try each button and add the result to the queue\n        queue.append((button_A(current), sequence + \"A → \", depth + 1))\n        queue.append((button_B(current), sequence + \"B → \", depth + 1))\n        queue.append((button_C(current), sequence + \"C → \", depth + 1))\n    \n    return \"No solution\"\n\n# Start the search\nresult = find_shortest_sequence(0, 27)\nprint(result.strip(\" → \"))  # Remove the trailing arrow\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the shortest sequence of button presses.",
