    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (10). The light starts as red, and each button press toggles the light between red and green. The operations for each button are as follows:\n\n- Button A: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button B: Subtracts 1 from the number, but only when the light is red.\n- Button C: Adds 1 to the number, but only when the light is red.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We need to consider the light's state when deciding which button to press.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Start at 0 with the light red.\n2. We need to reach 10 with the fewest button presses.\n3. We can use button A to quickly increase the number by multiplying it by 2.\n4. We can use button C to increment the number by 1 when the light is red.\n5. Button B can be used to decrement the number by 1 when the light is red, but it seems less useful for reaching a higher target.\n\nGiven these operations, a strategy is to use button A to quickly increase the number and button C to adjust the number when needed. We should avoid using button B unless necessary, as it decreases the number.\n\nLet's simulate the process using Python to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart = 0\ntarget = 10\ninitial_light = 'red'\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    return number * 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    if light == 'red':\n        return number - 1, 'green'\n    return number, light\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    if light == 'red':\n        return number + 1, 'green'\n    return number, light\n\n# Use a queue to perform a breadth-first search\nqueue = deque([(start, initial_light, [])])\nvisited = set()\n\nwhile queue:\n    number, light, path = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we reached the target\n    if number == target:\n        print(' → '.join(path))\n        break\n    \n    # If this state has been visited, skip it\n    if (number, light) in visited:\n        continue\n    visited.add((number, light))\n    \n    # Try each button\n    new_number, new_light = press_A(number, light)\n    queue.append((new_number, new_light, path + ['A']))\n    \n    new_number, new_light = press_B(number, light)\n    queue.append((new_number, new_light, path + ['B']))\n    \n    new_number, new_light = press_C(number, light)\n    queue.append((new_number, new_light, path + ['C']))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 10 from the starting number 0. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 10 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n- C: Add 1 (0 + 1 = 1, light turns green)\n- A: Multiply by 2 (1 * 2 = 2, light turns red)\n- C: Add 1 (2 + 1 = 3, light turns green)\n- A: Multiply by 2 (3 * 2 = 6, light turns red)\n- B: Subtract 1 (6 - 1 = 5, light turns green)\n- A: Multiply by 2 (5 * 2 = 10, light turns red)\n\nThis sequence efficiently reaches the target number 10 with the fewest button presses.\n\n<<<C → A → C → A → B → A>>>"
