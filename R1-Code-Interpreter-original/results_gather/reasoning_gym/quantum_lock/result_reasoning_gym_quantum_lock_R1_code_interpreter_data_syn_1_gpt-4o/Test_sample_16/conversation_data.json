    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (30). The light starts as red, and each button press toggles the light between red and green.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n\n1. **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number when the light is red.\n2. **Button B**: Multiplies the number by 2 regardless of the light's color.\n3. **Button C**: Adds 2 to the number when the light is green.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We need to consider the light's state after each operation to determine the next valid operation.\n\n### Strategy\n- Start with 0 (red).\n- Use Button A to add 2 (light turns green).\n- Use Button B to multiply by 2 (light turns red).\n- Repeat the process, considering the light's state and the current number, until reaching 30.\n\n### Plan\n1. Start with 0 (red).\n2. Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (green).\n3. Press B: 2 * 2 = 4 (red).\n4. Press A: 4 + 2 = 6 (green).\n5. Press B: 6 * 2 = 12 (red).\n6. Press A: 12 + 2 = 14 (green).\n7. Press B: 14 * 2 = 28 (red).\n8. Press A: 28 + 2 = 30 (green).\n\nThis sequence reaches the target number 30. Let's verify this sequence using a Python script to ensure it's the shortest path.\n\n```python\ndef find_sequence(start, target):\n    from collections import deque\n\n    # Each state is represented as (current_value, light_state, sequence_of_buttons)\n    queue = deque([(start, 'red', [])])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_value, light_state, sequence = queue.popleft()\n\n        # If we reach the target, return the sequence\n        if current_value == target:\n            return sequence\n\n        # If this state has been visited, skip it\n        if (current_value, light_state) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add((current_value, light_state))\n\n        # Generate possible next states\n        if light_state == 'red':\n            # Button A: Add 2, toggle to green\n            queue.append((current_value + 2, 'green', sequence + ['A']))\n        else:\n            # Button C: Add 2, toggle to red\n            queue.append((current_value + 2, 'red', sequence + ['C']))\n\n        # Button B: Multiply by 2, toggle light\n        new_light_state = 'green' if light_state == 'red' else 'red'\n        queue.append((current_value * 2, new_light_state, sequence + ['B']))\n\n# Find the sequence\nsequence = find_sequence(0, 30)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the shortest sequence of button presses.",
    "The code output indicates the sequence of button presses needed to reach the target number 30 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n- **A**: Add 2 (0 + 2 = 2, light turns green)\n- **C**: Add 2 (2 + 2 = 4, light turns red)\n- **A**: Add 2 (4 + 2 = 6, light turns green)\n- **B**: Multiply by 2 (6 * 2 = 12, light turns red)\n- **A**: Add 2 (12 + 2 = 14, light turns green)\n- **B**: Multiply by 2 (14 * 2 = 28, light turns red)\n- **A**: Add 2 (28 + 2 = 30, light turns green)\n\nThis sequence successfully reaches the target number 30. The sequence is verified to be the shortest path using the breadth-first search approach implemented in the code.\n\n<<<A → C → A → B → A → B → A>>>"
