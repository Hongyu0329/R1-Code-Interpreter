    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (31). The light starts as red, and each button press toggles the light between red and green. The operations for each button are as follows:\n\n- Button A: Adds 2 to the number when the light is red.\n- Button B: Subtracts 3 from the number when the light is red.\n- Button C: Adds 3 to the number regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press, so we need to keep track of the light's state as well as the current number. The goal is to reach the target number (31) with the fewest button presses.\n\nTo find the solution, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. In this case, each state (number, light color) can be considered a node, and each button press represents an edge to a new state.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart_number = 0\ntarget_number = 31\ninitial_light = 'red'\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_button(state, button):\n    number, light = state\n    if button == 'A' and light == 'red':\n        number += 2\n    elif button == 'B' and light == 'red':\n        number -= 3\n    elif button == 'C':\n        number += 3\n    # Toggle the light\n    light = 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n    return number, light\n\n# Perform BFS to find the shortest sequence of button presses\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])  # (state, path)\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        current_number, current_light = current_state\n        \n        # Check if we've reached the target\n        if current_number == target:\n            return path\n        \n        # Check if we've already visited this state\n        if current_state in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add(current_state)\n        \n        # Try each button\n        for button in ['A', 'B', 'C']:\n            new_state = press_button(current_state, button)\n            new_path = path + [button]\n            queue.append((new_state, new_path))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nstart_state = (start_number, initial_light)\nshortest_sequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_state, target_number)\nprint(\" → \".join(shortest_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will output the shortest sequence of button presses needed to reach the target number. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a sequence of button presses. Let's analyze the sequence to ensure it correctly transforms the starting number (0) to the target number (31) while considering the light's state:\n\n1. Start: 0 (red)\n2. Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (light toggles to green)\n3. Press C: 2 + 3 = 5 (light toggles to red)\n4. Press A: 5 + 2 = 7 (light toggles to green)\n5. Press C: 7 + 3 = 10 (light toggles to red)\n6. Press C: 10 + 3 = 13 (light toggles to green)\n7. Press C: 13 + 3 = 16 (light toggles to red)\n8. Press C: 16 + 3 = 19 (light toggles to green)\n9. Press C: 19 + 3 = 22 (light toggles to red)\n10. Press C: 22 + 3 = 25 (light toggles to green)\n11. Press C: 25 + 3 = 28 (light toggles to red)\n12. Press C: 28 + 3 = 31 (light toggles to green)\n\nThe sequence correctly reaches the target number 31. Therefore, the shortest sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<A → C → A → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C>>>"
