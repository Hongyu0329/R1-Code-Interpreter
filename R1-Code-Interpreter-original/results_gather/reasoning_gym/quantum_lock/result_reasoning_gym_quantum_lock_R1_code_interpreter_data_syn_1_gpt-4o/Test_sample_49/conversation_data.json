    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (26). The light starts as red, and it toggles between red and green with each button press. The operations for each button are as follows:\n\n- Button A: Subtract 3 (works regardless of the light's color)\n- Button B: Subtract 3 (only works when the light is green)\n- Button C: Add 2 (works regardless of the light's color)\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We need to consider the light's state when planning the sequence of button presses.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Start at 0 with the light red.\n2. We need to reach 26 with the fewest button presses.\n3. Button C is the only button that increases the number, so it will be essential in reaching 26.\n4. Button A and B can be used to decrease the number, but B can only be used when the light is green.\n\nTo find the shortest sequence, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, where we explore all possible sequences of button presses and keep track of the number and light state. We will stop when we reach the target number.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart_number = 0\ntarget_number = 26\ninitial_light = 'red'  # 'red' or 'green'\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_button(state, button):\n    number, light = state\n    if button == 'A':\n        return (number - 3, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red')\n    elif button == 'B' and light == 'green':\n        return (number - 3, 'red')\n    elif button == 'C':\n        return (number + 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red')\n    return None\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])  # (state, sequence of buttons)\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, sequence = queue.popleft()\n        number, light = current_state\n        \n        if number == target:\n            return sequence\n        \n        if current_state in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add(current_state)\n        \n        for button in ['A', 'B', 'C']:\n            new_state = press_button(current_state, button)\n            if new_state and new_state not in visited:\n                queue.append((new_state, sequence + [button]))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Initial state\ninitial_state = (start_number, initial_light)\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nshortest_sequence = find_shortest_sequence(initial_state, target_number)\n\n# Format the output\nif shortest_sequence:\n    result = ' → '.join(shortest_sequence)\nelse:\n    result = \"No solution found\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 26 from the starting number 0, considering the light's state.",
    "The code successfully found a sequence of button presses to reach the target number 26. The sequence consists of pressing button C thirteen times, which makes sense because each press of button C adds 2 to the number, and 13 presses of C will add up to 26 (since 13 * 2 = 26).\n\nThe light's state toggles with each press, but since button C works regardless of the light's color, the sequence is valid.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 26 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n<<<C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C>>>"
