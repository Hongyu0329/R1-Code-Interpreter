  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Multiply 2 (when red)\nB: Add 2 (when red)\nC: Multiply 2 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8), while considering the toggling of the light between red and green with each button press.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Multiply by 2 (when red)\n   - **B**: Add 2 (when red)\n   - **C**: Multiply by 2 (when green)\n\n3. **Target**: 8\n\n4. **Light Toggle**: The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\nThe goal is to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will result in the number 8.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Start with 0 (red)**:\n   - Pressing **B** (Add 2 when red) will result in 2, and the light will turn green.\n\n2. **Now 2 (green)**:\n   - Pressing **C** (Multiply by 2 when green) will result in 4, and the light will turn red.\n\n3. **Now 4 (red)**:\n   - Pressing **A** (Multiply by 2 when red) will result in 8, and the light will turn green.\n\nThis sequence results in the target number 8 in three button presses. Let's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure correctness.\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nnumber = 0\nlight = 'red'  # red or green\n\n# Sequence of button presses\nsequence = ['B', 'C', 'A']\n\n# Process each button press\nfor button in sequence:\n    if button == 'A' and light == 'red':\n        number *= 2\n    elif button == 'B' and light == 'red':\n        number += 2\n    elif button == 'C' and light == 'green':\n        number *= 2\n    \n    # Toggle the light\n    light = 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\n# Output the final number\nprint(number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 8, which matches the target number. This confirms that the sequence of button presses is correct.\n\nThe shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n<<<B → C → A>>>"
