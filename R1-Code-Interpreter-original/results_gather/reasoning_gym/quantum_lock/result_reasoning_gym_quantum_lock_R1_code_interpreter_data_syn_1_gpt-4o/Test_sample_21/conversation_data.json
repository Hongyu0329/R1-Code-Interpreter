  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 30\nButtons:\nA: Add 3 (when any)\nB: Subtract 3 (when green)\nC: Multiply 2 (when red)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number 0 to the target number 30, while considering the state of the light (red or green) which affects the operations of the buttons.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Adds 3 to the number regardless of the light's state.\n- Button B: Subtracts 3 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n- Button C: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is red.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\nWe start at 0 with the light red. Our goal is to reach 30. We need to consider the sequence of operations and the state of the light after each operation.\n\nLet's explore the possible sequences using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to ensure we find the shortest sequence:\n\n1. Start at 0 (red).\n2. Press button A: 0 + 3 = 3 (light turns green).\n3. Press button A: 3 + 3 = 6 (light turns red).\n4. Press button C: 6 * 2 = 12 (light turns green).\n5. Press button A: 12 + 3 = 15 (light turns red).\n6. Press button C: 15 * 2 = 30 (light turns green).\n\nThis sequence reaches the target number 30. Let's verify this sequence using a Python script to ensure it's the shortest path.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart = (0, 'red')  # (number, light state)\ntarget = 30\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    return number + 3, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number - 3, 'red'\n    return None\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    if light == 'red':\n        return number * 2, 'green'\n    return None\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\nqueue = deque([(start, [])])  # (state, path)\nvisited = set()\n\nwhile queue:\n    (current_number, current_light), path = queue.popleft()\n    \n    if current_number == target:\n        print(' → '.join(path))\n        break\n    \n    # Try pressing each button\n    for button, operation in [('A', press_A), ('B', press_B), ('C', press_C)]:\n        result = operation(current_number, current_light)\n        if result and result not in visited:\n            visited.add(result)\n            queue.append((result, path + [button]))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 30 from the starting number 0, considering the light's state. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution confirms that the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 30 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n<<<A → A → C → A → C>>>"
