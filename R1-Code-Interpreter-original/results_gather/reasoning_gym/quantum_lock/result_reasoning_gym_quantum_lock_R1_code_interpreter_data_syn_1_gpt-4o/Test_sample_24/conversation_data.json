    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (28). Each button press toggles the light between red and green, but since the operations are independent of the light's state, we can focus solely on the numerical transformations.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Adds 2 to the current number.\n- Button B: Multiplies the current number by 2.\n- Button C: Multiplies the current number by 3.\n\nThe goal is to reach 28 from 0 using the shortest sequence of these operations. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the shortest path in this state space.\n\n1. Start with the initial state (0, red).\n2. Apply each button operation to generate new states.\n3. Keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.\n4. Continue until the target state (28) is reached.\n\nLet's implement this logic using Python to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef apply_operation(state, button):\n    number, _ = state\n    if button == 'A':\n        return number + 2\n    elif button == 'B':\n        return number * 2\n    elif button == 'C':\n        return number * 3\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence of button presses\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])  # (current state, path)\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        current_number, _ = current_state\n        \n        if current_number == target:\n            return path\n        \n        for button in ['A', 'B', 'C']:\n            new_number = apply_operation(current_state, button)\n            new_state = (new_number, not current_state[1])  # Toggle light state\n            \n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [button]))\n\n# Initial state: (0, red)\nstart_state = (0, False)  # False for red, True for green\ntarget_number = 28\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_state, target_number)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will output the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 28 from the starting number 0.",
    "The code has successfully found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 28 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n- A → A → C → A → B\n\nThis means:\n1. Start at 0, press A: 0 + 2 = 2\n2. Press A again: 2 + 2 = 4\n3. Press C: 4 * 3 = 12\n4. Press A: 12 + 2 = 14\n5. Press B: 14 * 2 = 28\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<A → A → C → A → B>>>"
