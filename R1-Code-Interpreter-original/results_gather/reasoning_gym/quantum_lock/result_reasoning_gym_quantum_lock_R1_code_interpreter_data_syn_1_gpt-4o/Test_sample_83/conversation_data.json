  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 20\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when any)\nB: Subtract 3 (when green)\nC: Multiply 2 (when green)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (20), while considering the toggling of the light between red and green states. \n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Adds 2 to the number, regardless of the light's state.\n- Button B: Subtracts 3 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n- Button C: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is green.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We start with the light being red.\n\nThe goal is to reach the target number 20 with the fewest button presses. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the possible sequences of button presses. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possibilities level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to the target.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart_number = 0\ntarget_number = 20\ninitial_light = 'red'\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    return number + 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number - 3, 'red'\n    return None\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number * 2, 'red'\n    return None\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    queue = deque([(start, initial_light, [])])  # (current number, current light, sequence of buttons)\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_number, current_light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n\n        if current_number == target:\n            return sequence\n\n        if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n            continue\n\n        visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n\n        # Try pressing each button\n        new_number, new_light = press_A(current_number, current_light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['A']))\n\n        if current_light == 'green':\n            result = press_B(current_number, current_light)\n            if result:\n                new_number, new_light = result\n                queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['B']))\n\n            result = press_C(current_number, current_light)\n            if result:\n                new_number, new_light = result\n                queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['C']))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_number, target_number)\nprint(' → '.join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will execute and return the shortest sequence of button presses needed to reach the target number 20 from the starting number 0.",
    "The output indicates that the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 20 from the starting number 0 is \"A → A → A → A → A → C\". \n\nLet's verify the sequence step-by-step:\n1. Start at 0 (red), press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (green)\n2. Press A: 2 + 2 = 4 (red)\n3. Press A: 4 + 2 = 6 (green)\n4. Press A: 6 + 2 = 8 (red)\n5. Press A: 8 + 2 = 10 (green)\n6. Press C: 10 * 2 = 20 (red)\n\nThe sequence is correct and reaches the target number 20. \n\n<<<A → A → A → A → A → C>>>"
