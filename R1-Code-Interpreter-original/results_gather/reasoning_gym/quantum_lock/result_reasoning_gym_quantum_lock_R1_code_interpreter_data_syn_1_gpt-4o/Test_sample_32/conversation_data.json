    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (34). The light starts as red, and it toggles between red and green with each button press. The operations for each button are as follows:\n\n- Button A: Adds 3 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button B: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button C: Subtracts 2 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press, so we need to keep track of the light's state as well as the current number.\n\nThe goal is to reach the target number 34 with the fewest button presses. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the possible sequences of button presses. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possibilities level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to the target.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart_number = 0\ntarget_number = 34\ninitial_light = 'red'  # Light starts as red\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef press_A(number):\n    return number + 3\n\ndef press_B(number):\n    return number * 2\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number - 2\n    return number\n\n# Define the BFS function to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    # Queue for BFS: stores tuples of (current_number, light_state, sequence_of_buttons)\n    queue = deque([(start, initial_light, [])])\n    visited = set()  # To keep track of visited states\n\n    while queue:\n        current_number, light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if we have reached the target\n        if current_number == target:\n            return sequence\n\n        # If this state has been visited, skip it\n        if (current_number, light) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add((current_number, light))\n\n        # Try pressing each button and add the new state to the queue\n        # Press A\n        new_number = press_A(current_number)\n        new_light = 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['A']))\n\n        # Press B\n        new_number = press_B(current_number)\n        new_light = 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['B']))\n\n        # Press C (only if light is green)\n        if light == 'green':\n            new_number = press_C(current_number, light)\n            new_light = 'red'  # Light toggles to red\n            queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['C']))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nshortest_sequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_number, target_number)\nprint(\" → \".join(shortest_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 34 from the starting number 0. The sequence will be printed as a series of button presses separated by '→'.",
    "The output indicates that the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 34 from the starting number 0 is \"A → A → A → B → B → C\". This sequence involves the following steps:\n\n1. Press A: 0 + 3 = 3 (light toggles to green)\n2. Press A: 3 + 3 = 6 (light toggles to red)\n3. Press A: 6 + 3 = 9 (light toggles to green)\n4. Press B: 9 * 2 = 18 (light toggles to red)\n5. Press B: 18 * 2 = 36 (light toggles to green)\n6. Press C: 36 - 2 = 34 (light toggles to red)\n\nThis sequence successfully transforms the starting number 0 to the target number 34 using the fewest button presses. \n\n<<<A → A → A → B → B → C>>>"
