    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number 0 to the target number 14, while considering the toggling of the light between red and green. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target State**: \n   - Number: 14\n\n3. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Subtract 1 (works regardless of light color)\n   - **B**: Add 2 (works regardless of light color)\n   - **C**: Subtract 2 (only works when the light is green)\n\n4. **Light Toggling**: \n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n5. **Objective**: \n   - Find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14.\n\nTo solve this, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Each state can be represented as a tuple of the current number and the light color. We will explore all possible button presses from each state and keep track of the sequence of button presses that lead to each state.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Initial state\nstart_number = 0\nstart_light = 'red'\ntarget_number = 14\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    return number - 1, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    return number + 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number - 2, 'red'\n    return None\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start_number, start_light, target_number):\n    queue = deque([(start_number, start_light, [])])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        number, light, path = queue.popleft()\n\n        if (number, light) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add((number, light))\n\n        if number == target_number:\n            return path\n\n        # Try each button\n        next_state = press_A(number, light)\n        queue.append((next_state[0], next_state[1], path + ['A']))\n\n        next_state = press_B(number, light)\n        queue.append((next_state[0], next_state[1], path + ['B']))\n\n        if light == 'green':\n            next_state = press_C(number, light)\n            if next_state:\n                queue.append((next_state[0], next_state[1], path + ['C']))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_number, start_light, target_number)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14 from the starting number 0, considering the toggling of the light. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n- Press button B seven times.\n\nThis sequence works because each press of button B adds 2 to the current number, and since the light toggles with each press, it doesn't affect the operation of button B. Starting from 0 and pressing B seven times results in:\n\n0 → 2 → 4 → 6 → 8 → 10 → 12 → 14\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<B → B → B → B → B → B → B>>>"
