    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (35). The light starts as red, and each button press toggles the light between red and green. The operations of buttons A and B depend on the light's color, while button C can be used regardless of the light's color.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the operations:\n- Button A: Adds 2 to the number, but only when the light is green.\n- Button B: Subtracts 3 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n- Button C: Multiplies the number by 3, regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press, so we need to keep track of the light's state as we press buttons.\n\nTo find the shortest sequence, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. In this case, each state (number, light color) can be considered a node, and each button press represents an edge to a new state.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    # Queue for BFS: stores tuples of (current number, light state, sequence of buttons)\n    queue = deque([(start, 'red', [])])\n    visited = set()  # To keep track of visited states\n\n    while queue:\n        current, light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n\n        # If we reach the target, return the sequence\n        if current == target:\n            return sequence\n\n        # If this state has been visited, skip it\n        if (current, light) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add((current, light))\n\n        # Calculate the next states for each button\n        if light == 'green':\n            # Button A: Add 2\n            queue.append((current + 2, 'red', sequence + ['A']))\n            # Button B: Subtract 3\n            queue.append((current - 3, 'red', sequence + ['B']))\n        \n        # Button C: Multiply by 3 (works for both red and green)\n        queue.append((current * 3, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red', sequence + ['C']))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(0, 35)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will execute a breadth-first search to find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 35 from the starting number 0, considering the light's state. Let's run the code to find the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 35 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n- C: Multiply by 3 (0 becomes 0, light turns green)\n- A: Add 2 (0 becomes 2, light turns red)\n- C: Multiply by 3 (2 becomes 6, light turns green)\n- B: Subtract 3 (6 becomes 3, light turns red)\n- C: Multiply by 3 (3 becomes 9, light turns green)\n- A: Add 2 (9 becomes 11, light turns red)\n- C: Multiply by 3 (11 becomes 33, light turns green)\n- A: Add 2 (33 becomes 35, light turns red)\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<C → A → C → B → C → A → C → A>>>"
