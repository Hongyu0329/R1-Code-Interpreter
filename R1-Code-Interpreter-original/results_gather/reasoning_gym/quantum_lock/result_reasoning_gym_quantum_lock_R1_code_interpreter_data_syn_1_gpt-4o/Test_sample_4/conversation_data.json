    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (22), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light's state.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target**: \n   - Number: 22\n\n3. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Add 2 (only when the light is red)\n   - **B**: Subtract 2 (any light state)\n   - **C**: Multiply by 2 (any light state)\n\n4. **Light Toggle**: \n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy\n- We need to explore sequences of button presses that will lead us from 0 to 22.\n- The light starts as red, so the first press of button A will add 2.\n- We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the shortest path to the target number.\n\n### Plan\n1. Use a queue to explore each state (number, light state) and the sequence of button presses that led to it.\n2. For each state, apply each button and calculate the new state.\n3. If the new state reaches the target number, return the sequence of button presses.\n4. Ensure we do not revisit states to avoid infinite loops.\n\nLet's implement this plan using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Initial state\nstart_number = 0\nstart_light = 'red'\ntarget_number = 22\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef apply_button(number, light, button):\n    if button == 'A' and light == 'red':\n        return number + 2, 'green'\n    elif button == 'B':\n        return number - 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n    elif button == 'C':\n        return number * 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n    return None\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start_number, start_light, target_number):\n    queue = deque([(start_number, start_light, [])])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        number, light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if we reached the target\n        if number == target_number:\n            return sequence\n\n        # Explore each button\n        for button in ['A', 'B', 'C']:\n            new_state = apply_button(number, light, button)\n            if new_state:\n                new_number, new_light = new_state\n                if (new_number, new_light) not in visited:\n                    visited.add((new_number, new_light))\n                    queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + [button]))\n\n# Find the sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_number, start_light, target_number)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 22 from the starting number 0, considering the light's state. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of button presses needed to reach the target number 22 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n- **A**: Add 2 (0 + 2 = 2, light toggles to green)\n- **C**: Multiply by 2 (2 * 2 = 4, light toggles to red)\n- **A**: Add 2 (4 + 2 = 6, light toggles to green)\n- **C**: Multiply by 2 (6 * 2 = 12, light toggles to red)\n- **C**: Multiply by 2 (12 * 2 = 24, light toggles to green)\n- **B**: Subtract 2 (24 - 2 = 22, light toggles to red)\n\nThis sequence successfully transforms the starting number into the target number using the shortest path. \n\n<<<A → C → A → C → C → B>>>"
