    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number 0 into the target number 26, while considering the toggling of the light between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target State**: \n   - Number: 26\n\n3. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Add 2 (works regardless of light color)\n   - **B**: Multiply by 2 (only when light is red)\n   - **C**: Multiply by 2 (only when light is green)\n\n4. **Light Toggle**: \n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy\n- We need to find a sequence of operations that will reach the target number 26.\n- We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the shortest path to the target number.\n- Each state can be represented as a tuple of (current number, light color).\n- We will keep track of visited states to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n### Implementation\nWe will implement a BFS to explore all possible sequences of button presses, starting from the initial state, and find the shortest sequence that results in the target number.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = (0, 'red')  # (number, light color)\ntarget_number = 26\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    return number + 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    if light == 'red':\n        return number * 2, 'green'\n    return None\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number * 2, 'red'\n    return None\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence():\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])  # (state, sequence of buttons)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n\n    while queue:\n        (current_number, current_light), sequence = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if we reached the target\n        if current_number == target_number:\n            return sequence\n\n        # Try pressing each button\n        for button, operation in [('A', press_A), ('B', press_B), ('C', press_C)]:\n            new_state = operation(current_number, current_light)\n            if new_state and new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, sequence + [button]))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nshortest_sequence = find_shortest_sequence()\nprint(\" → \".join(shortest_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 26 from the initial state. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 26 from the initial state. The sequence is:\n\n<<<A → A → A → C → B → A>>>"
