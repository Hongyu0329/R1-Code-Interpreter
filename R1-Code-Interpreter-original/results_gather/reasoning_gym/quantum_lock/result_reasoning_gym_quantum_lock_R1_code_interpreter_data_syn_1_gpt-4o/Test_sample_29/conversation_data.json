  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 27\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when green)\nB: Subtract 3 (when any)\nC: Multiply 2 (when any)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number 0 into the target number 27, while considering the effect of each button on the light and the number.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Adds 2 to the number, but only when the light is green.\n- Button B: Subtracts 3 from the number, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button C: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy\n1. Start at 0 with the light red.\n2. Consider the effect of each button press on both the number and the light.\n3. Aim to reach 27 with the fewest button presses.\n\n### Approach\n- Since button C doubles the number, it can quickly increase the number towards the target.\n- Button A can only be used when the light is green, so we need to toggle the light to green before using it.\n- Button B can be used to adjust the number downwards if needed.\n\n### Plan\n1. Use button C to increase the number quickly.\n2. Use button A when the light is green to make small adjustments.\n3. Use button B if necessary to correct overshoots.\n\nLet's simulate this process using Python to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart = (0, 'red')  # (number, light color)\ntarget = 27\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number + 2, 'red'\n    return number, light\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    return number - 3, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    return number * 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\n# Breadth-first search to find the shortest sequence\nqueue = deque([(start, [])])\nvisited = set()\n\nwhile queue:\n    (current_number, current_light), path = queue.popleft()\n    \n    if current_number == target:\n        print(\" → \".join(path))\n        break\n    \n    if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n        continue\n    visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n    \n    # Try each button\n    next_number, next_light = press_A(current_number, current_light)\n    queue.append(((next_number, next_light), path + ['A']))\n    \n    next_number, next_light = press_B(current_number, current_light)\n    queue.append(((next_number, next_light), path + ['B']))\n    \n    next_number, next_light = press_C(current_number, current_light)\n    queue.append(((next_number, next_light), path + ['C']))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 27. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code has successfully found a sequence of button presses to reach the target number 27. The sequence is:\n\n- C: Multiply by 2 (0 → 0, light toggles to green)\n- A: Add 2 (0 → 2, light toggles to red)\n- C: Multiply by 2 (2 → 4, light toggles to green)\n- A: Add 2 (4 → 6, light toggles to red)\n- C: Multiply by 2 (6 → 12, light toggles to green)\n- A: Add 2 (12 → 14, light toggles to red)\n- C: Multiply by 2 (14 → 28, light toggles to green)\n- A: Add 2 (28 → 30, light toggles to red)\n- B: Subtract 3 (30 → 27, light toggles to green)\n\nThis sequence reaches the target number 27. The sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<C → A → C → A → C → A → C → A → B>>>"
