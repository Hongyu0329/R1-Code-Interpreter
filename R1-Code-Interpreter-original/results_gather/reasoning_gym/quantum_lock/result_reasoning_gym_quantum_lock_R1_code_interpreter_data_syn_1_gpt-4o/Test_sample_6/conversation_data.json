    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (20). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but since the operations are independent of the light's state, we can focus solely on the numerical transformations.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Initial State**: Start at 0 with the light red.\n2. **Operations**:\n   - **A**: Add 3\n   - **B**: Multiply by 2\n   - **C**: Subtract 2\n\n3. **Objective**: Reach the target number 20 using the shortest sequence of operations.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible sequences of operations.\n   - Keep track of the current number and the sequence of operations that led to it.\n   - Stop when the target number is reached.\n\n5. **Implementation**:\n   - Use a queue to explore each state (current number and sequence of operations).\n   - For each state, apply each button operation and enqueue the resulting state if it hasn't been visited yet.\n   - Continue until the target number is reached.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the operations\ndef apply_operation(number, operation):\n    if operation == 'A':\n        return number + 3\n    elif operation == 'B':\n        return number * 2\n    elif operation == 'C':\n        return number - 2\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])  # (current number, sequence of operations)\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current, sequence = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current == target:\n            return sequence\n        \n        for operation in ['A', 'B', 'C']:\n            next_number = apply_operation(current, operation)\n            if next_number not in visited:\n                visited.add(next_number)\n                queue.append((next_number, sequence + [operation]))\n\n# Start the search\nstart_number = 0\ntarget_number = 20\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_number, target_number)\n\n# Format the sequence for output\nformatted_sequence = ' → '.join(sequence)\nprint(f\"<<<{formatted_sequence}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will execute and return the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 20 from the starting number 0.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 20 from the starting number 0. The sequence is:\n\n<<<A → A → B → C → B>>>"
