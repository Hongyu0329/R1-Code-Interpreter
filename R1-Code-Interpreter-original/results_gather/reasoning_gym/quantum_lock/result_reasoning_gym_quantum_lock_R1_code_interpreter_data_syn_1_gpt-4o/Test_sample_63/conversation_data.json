    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (32), while considering the toggling of the light between red and green states.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Start**: 0 (red)\n- **Target**: 32\n\n### Button Operations:\n- **A**: Multiply by 2 (when red)\n- **B**: Add 2 (when green)\n- **C**: Multiply by 2 (when green)\n\n### Light State:\n- The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. Start with the number 0 and the light in the red state.\n2. Use button A to multiply by 2 when the light is red.\n3. Use button B to add 2 when the light is green.\n4. Use button C to multiply by 2 when the light is green.\n5. Find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach 32.\n\n### Approach:\n- We will simulate the process using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible sequences of button presses.\n- We will keep track of the current number, the state of the light, and the sequence of button presses.\n- We will stop when we reach the target number 32.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Initial state\nstart_number = 0\nstart_light = 'red'\ntarget_number = 32\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef press_A(number):\n    return number * 2\n\ndef press_B(number):\n    return number + 2\n\ndef press_C(number):\n    return number * 2\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start_number, start_light, target_number):\n    # Queue for BFS: (current_number, current_light, sequence_of_buttons)\n    queue = deque([(start_number, start_light, [])])\n    visited = set()  # To avoid revisiting the same state\n\n    while queue:\n        current_number, current_light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if we reached the target\n        if current_number == target_number:\n            return sequence\n\n        # If the current state is already visited, skip it\n        if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n\n        # Explore the next states\n        if current_light == 'red':\n            # Press A\n            next_number = press_A(current_number)\n            next_light = 'green'\n            queue.append((next_number, next_light, sequence + ['A']))\n        else:\n            # Press B\n            next_number = press_B(current_number)\n            next_light = 'red'\n            queue.append((next_number, next_light, sequence + ['B']))\n\n            # Press C\n            next_number = press_C(current_number)\n            next_light = 'red'\n            queue.append((next_number, next_light, sequence + ['C']))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nshortest_sequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_number, start_light, target_number)\nprint(\" → \".join(shortest_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 32 from the starting number 0, considering the toggling of the light. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
