    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (43), while considering the toggling of the light between red and green with each button press. The light starts as red.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the button operations:\n- Button A: Multiplies the current number by 2, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button B: Subtracts 2 from the current number, but only when the light is red.\n- Button C: Adds 3 to the current number, regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. Therefore, the sequence of operations must account for the light's state to ensure that Button B is only used when the light is red.\n\nTo find the shortest sequence, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. In this context, each state (current number and light color) can be considered a node, and each button press represents an edge to a new state.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart_number = 0\ntarget_number = 43\nstart_light = 'red'\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef apply_button_A(number):\n    return number * 2\n\ndef apply_button_B(number, light):\n    if light == 'red':\n        return number - 2\n    return None\n\ndef apply_button_C(number):\n    return number + 3\n\n# Define the BFS function\ndef bfs(start_number, target_number, start_light):\n    # Queue for BFS: stores tuples of (current_number, current_light, path)\n    queue = deque([(start_number, start_light, [])])\n    # Set to keep track of visited states\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_number, current_light, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the target number\n        if current_number == target_number:\n            return path\n        \n        # If the current state has been visited, skip it\n        if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        # Mark the current state as visited\n        visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n        \n        # Calculate the next states for each button\n        # Button A\n        next_number_A = apply_button_A(current_number)\n        next_light_A = 'green' if current_light == 'red' else 'red'\n        queue.append((next_number_A, next_light_A, path + ['A']))\n        \n        # Button B\n        next_number_B = apply_button_B(current_number, current_light)\n        if next_number_B is not None:\n            next_light_B = 'green' if current_light == 'red' else 'red'\n            queue.append((next_number_B, next_light_B, path + ['B']))\n        \n        # Button C\n        next_number_C = apply_button_C(current_number)\n        next_light_C = 'green' if current_light == 'red' else 'red'\n        queue.append((next_number_C, next_light_C, path + ['C']))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the shortest sequence of button presses\nshortest_path = bfs(start_number, target_number, start_light)\nprint(' → '.join(shortest_path))\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 43 from the starting number 0, considering the light's state. Let's run the code to find the solution.",
