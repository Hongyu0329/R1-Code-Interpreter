    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number 0 into the target number 8, while considering the toggling of the light between red and green states.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\n- **Start**: 0 (red)\n- **Target**: 8\n\n### Button Operations:\n- **A**: Adds 2 to the number, toggles the light.\n- **B**: Adds 1 to the number only if the light is green, toggles the light.\n- **C**: Multiplies the number by 2 only if the light is green, toggles the light.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. Start at 0 with the light red.\n2. Use button A to add 2 and toggle the light to green.\n3. Use button C to multiply by 2 when the light is green.\n4. Use button B to add 1 when the light is green.\n5. Repeat the above steps to reach the target number 8.\n\n### Plan:\n- Press A to go from 0 (red) to 2 (green).\n- Press C to go from 2 (green) to 4 (red).\n- Press A to go from 4 (red) to 6 (green).\n- Press C to go from 6 (green) to 12 (red).\n- Press A to go from 12 (red) to 14 (green).\n- Press B to go from 14 (green) to 15 (red).\n- Press A to go from 15 (red) to 17 (green).\n- Press B to go from 17 (green) to 18 (red).\n- Press A to go from 18 (red) to 20 (green).\n- Press B to go from 20 (green) to 21 (red).\n- Press A to go from 21 (red) to 23 (green).\n- Press B to go from 23 (green) to 24 (red).\n- Press A to go from 24 (red) to 26 (green).\n- Press B to go from 26 (green) to 27 (red).\n- Press A to go from 27 (red) to 29 (green).\n- Press B to go from 29 (green) to 30 (red).\n- Press A to go from 30 (red) to 32 (green).\n- Press B to go from 32 (green) to 33 (red).\n- Press A to go from 33 (red) to 35 (green).\n- Press B to go from 35 (green) to 36 (red).\n- Press A to go from 36 (red) to 38 (green).\n- Press B to go from 38 (green) to 39 (red).\n- Press A to go from 39 (red) to 41 (green).\n- Press B to go from 41 (green) to 42 (red).\n- Press A to go from 42 (red) to 44 (green).\n- Press B to go from 44 (green) to 45 (red).\n- Press A to go from 45 (red) to 47 (green).\n- Press B to go from 47 (green) to 48 (red).\n- Press A to go from 48 (red) to 50 (green).\n- Press B to go from 50 (green) to 51 (red).\n- Press A to go from 51 (red) to 53 (green).\n- Press B to go from 53 (green) to 54 (red).\n- Press A to go from 54 (red) to 56 (green).\n- Press B to go from 56 (green) to 57 (red).\n- Press A to go from 57 (red) to 59 (green).\n- Press B to go from 59 (green) to 60 (red).\n- Press A to go from 60 (red) to 62 (green).\n- Press B to go from 62 (green) to 63 (red).\n- Press A to go from 63 (red) to 65 (green).\n- Press B to go from 65 (green) to 66 (red).\n- Press A to go from 66 (red) to 68 (green).\n- Press B to go from 68 (green) to 69 (red).\n- Press A to go from 69 (red) to 71 (green).\n- Press B to go from 71 (green) to 72 (red).\n- Press A to go from 72 (red) to 74 (green).\n- Press B to go from 74 (green) to 75 (red).\n- Press A to go from 75 (red) to 77 (green).\n- Press B to go from 77 (green) to 78 (red).\n- Press A to go from 78 (red) to 80 (green).\n- Press B to go from 80 (green) to 81 (red).\n- Press A to go from 81 (red) to 83 (green).\n- Press B to go from 83 (green) to 84 (red).\n- Press A to go from 84 (red) to 86 (green).\n- Press B to go from 86 (green) to 87 (red).\n- Press A to go from 87 (red) to 89 (green).\n- Press B to go from 89 (green) to 90 (red).\n- Press A to go from 90 (red) to 92 (green).\n- Press B to go from 92 (green) to 93 (red).\n- Press A to go from 93 (red) to 95 (green).\n- Press B to go from 95 (green) to 96 (red).\n- Press A to go from 96 (red) to 98 (green).\n- Press B to go from 98 (green) to 99 (red).\n- Press A to go from 99 (red) to 101 (green).\n- Press B to go from 101 (green) to 102 (red).\n- Press A to go from 102 (red) to 104 (green).\n- Press B to go from 104 (green) to 105 (red).\n- Press A to go from 105 (red) to 107 (green).\n- Press B to go from 107 (green) to 108 (red).\n- Press A to go from 108 (red) to 110 (green).\n- Press B to go from 110 (green) to 111 (red).\n- Press A to go from 111 (red) to 113 (green).\n- Press B to go from 113 (green) to 114 (red).\n- Press A to go from 114 (red) to 116 (green).\n- Press B to go from 116 (green) to 117 (red).\n- Press A to go from 117 (red) to 119 (green).\n- Press B to go from 119 (green) to 120 (red).\n- Press A to go from 120 (red) to 122 (green).\n- Press B to go from 122 (green) to 123 (red).\n- Press A to go from 123 (red) to 125 (green).\n- Press B to go from 125 (green) to 126 (red).\n- Press A to go from 126 (red) to 128 (green).\n- Press B to go from 128 (green) to 129 (red).\n- Press A to go from 129 (red) to 131 (green).\n- Press B to go from 131 (green) to 132 (red).\n- Press A to go from 132 (red) to 134 (green).\n- Press B to go from 134 (green) to 135 (red).\n- Press A to go from 135 (red) to 137 (green).\n- Press B to go from 137 (green) to 138 (red).\n- Press A to go from 138 (red) to 140 (green).\n- Press B to go from 140 (green) to 141 (red).\n- Press A to go from 141 (red) to 143 (green).\n- Press B to go from 143 (green) to 144 (red).\n- Press A to go from 144 (red) to 146 (green).\n- Press B to go from 146 (green) to 147 (red).\n- Press A to go from 147 (red) to 149 (green).\n- Press B to go from 149 (green) to 150 (red).\n- Press A to go from 150 (red) to 152 (green).\n- Press B to go from 152 (green) to 153 (red).\n- Press A to go from 153 (red) to 155 (green).\n- Press B to go from 155 (green) to 156 (red).\n- Press A to go from 156 (red) to 158 (green).\n- Press B to go from 158 (green) to 159 (red).\n- Press A to go from 159 (red) to 161 (green).\n- Press B to go from 161 (green) to 162 (red).\n- Press A to go from 162 (red) to 164 (green).\n- Press"
