    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (16), while considering the toggling of the light between red and green.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n- **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n- **Target State**: Number = 16\n- **Buttons**:\n  - **A**: Adds 1 to the number, toggles the light.\n  - **B**: Adds 2 to the number, toggles the light (only when the light is green).\n  - **C**: Multiplies the number by 2, toggles the light.\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This approach is suitable because it explores all possible sequences of button presses level by level, ensuring that the shortest sequence is found first.\n2. **State Representation**: Each state can be represented as a tuple `(number, light_color)`.\n3. **Queue**: Use a queue to explore each state, starting from `(0, 'red')`.\n4. **Visited States**: Keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.\n5. **Transitions**: For each state, apply each button and enqueue the resulting state if it hasn't been visited.\n\n### Implementation\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start, target):\n    # Initial state\n    initial_state = (start, 'red')\n    # Queue for BFS: stores tuples of (current_number, light_color, sequence_of_buttons)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    # Set to keep track of visited states\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (current_number, light_color), sequence = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we've reached the target\n        if current_number == target:\n            return sequence\n        \n        # Generate possible next states\n        # Button A: Add 1, toggle light\n        next_number = current_number + 1\n        next_light = 'green' if light_color == 'red' else 'red'\n        next_state = (next_number, next_light)\n        if next_state not in visited:\n            visited.add(next_state)\n            queue.append((next_state, sequence + ['A']))\n        \n        # Button B: Add 2, toggle light (only if light is green)\n        if light_color == 'green':\n            next_number = current_number + 2\n            next_light = 'red'\n            next_state = (next_number, next_light)\n            if next_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(next_state)\n                queue.append((next_state, sequence + ['B']))\n        \n        # Button C: Multiply by 2, toggle light\n        next_number = current_number * 2\n        next_light = 'green' if light_color == 'red' else 'red'\n        next_state = (next_number, next_light)\n        if next_state not in visited:\n            visited.add(next_state)\n            queue.append((next_state, sequence + ['C']))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence to reach the target\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(0, 16)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 16 from the starting number 0, considering the toggling of the light. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
