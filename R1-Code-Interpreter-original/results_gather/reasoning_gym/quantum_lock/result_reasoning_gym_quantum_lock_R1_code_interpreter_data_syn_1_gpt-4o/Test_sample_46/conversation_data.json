    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number 0 into the target number 14, while considering the toggling of the light between red and green with each button press.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n- **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n- **Target State**: Number = 14\n- **Button Operations**:\n  - **A**: Add 2 (only when the light is red)\n  - **B**: Multiply by 2 (only when the light is green)\n  - **C**: Add 1 (only when the light is red)\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Start with Red Light**: The first button press will toggle the light to green.\n2. **Use Button A**: Since we start with red, we can use button A to add 2.\n3. **Toggle to Green**: After pressing A, the light turns green.\n4. **Use Button B**: Multiply by 2 when the light is green.\n5. **Use Button C**: Add 1 when the light is red.\n\n### Approach\n- We need to find a sequence of operations that will reach 14.\n- We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the shortest path to the target number.\n\n### Implementation\nLet's implement a BFS to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = (0, 'red')  # (number, light color)\ntarget = 14\n\n# Define the operations\noperations = {\n    'A': lambda x: (x + 2, 'green') if x[1] == 'red' else None,\n    'B': lambda x: (x[0] * 2, 'red') if x[1] == 'green' else None,\n    'C': lambda x: (x[0] + 1, 'green') if x[1] == 'red' else None\n}\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(initial_state, target):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])  # (state, path)\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the target\n        if current_state[0] == target:\n            return path\n        \n        # Explore the next states\n        for button, operation in operations.items():\n            next_state = operation(current_state)\n            if next_state and next_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(next_state)\n                queue.append((next_state, path + [button]))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence of button presses\nshortest_path = bfs(initial_state, target)\nprint(\" → \".join(shortest_path))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14 from the starting number 0, considering the toggling of the light. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The error occurs because the lambda function for button A is trying to add an integer to a tuple, which is incorrect. The lambda functions should correctly access the number from the tuple and perform the operation. Let's fix the lambda functions to correctly handle the tuple structure.\n\n### Corrected Approach\n- Access the number from the tuple using `x[0]`.\n- Ensure the operations are applied to the number, and the light state is toggled correctly.\n\nLet's correct the code and try again:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = (0, 'red')  # (number, light color)\ntarget = 14\n\n# Define the operations\noperations = {\n    'A': lambda x: (x[0] + 2, 'green') if x[1] == 'red' else None,\n    'B': lambda x: (x[0] * 2, 'red') if x[1] == 'green' else None,\n    'C': lambda x: (x[0] + 1, 'green') if x[1] == 'red' else None\n}\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(initial_state, target):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])  # (state, path)\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the target\n        if current_state[0] == target:\n            return path\n        \n        # Explore the next states\n        for button, operation in operations.items():\n            next_state = operation(current_state)\n            if next_state and next_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(next_state)\n                queue.append((next_state, path + [button]))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence of button presses\nshortest_path = bfs(initial_state, target)\nprint(\" → \".join(shortest_path))\n```\n\nThis corrected code should now properly handle the tuple structure and find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and found a sequence of button presses: `A → B → A → B → A`. Let's verify this sequence:\n\n1. **Start**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n2. **Press A**: \n   - Add 2 (since light is red)\n   - Number = 2, Light toggles to Green\n3. **Press B**: \n   - Multiply by 2 (since light is green)\n   - Number = 4, Light toggles to Red\n4. **Press A**: \n   - Add 2 (since light is red)\n   - Number = 6, Light toggles to Green\n5. **Press B**: \n   - Multiply by 2 (since light is green)\n   - Number = 12, Light toggles to Red\n6. **Press A**: \n   - Add 2 (since light is red)\n   - Number = 14, Light toggles to Green\n\nThe sequence `A → B → A → B → A` successfully transforms the starting number 0 into the target number 14. \n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<A → B → A → B → A>>>"
