    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (8), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light's state.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n- **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n- **Target State**: Number = 8\n- **Buttons and Effects**:\n  - **A**: Subtract 1 (only when the light is Green)\n  - **B**: Add 1 (only when the light is Green)\n  - **C**: Add 1 (regardless of the light's state)\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Toggle the Light**: Each button press toggles the light between Red and Green.\n2. **Button C**: Since Button C adds 1 regardless of the light's state, it can be used to increment the number without worrying about the light's color.\n3. **Button B**: Can be used to add 1 when the light is Green, but requires the light to be toggled to Green first.\n4. **Button A**: Not useful initially since it subtracts 1 when the light is Green, which is not helpful for reaching a positive target.\n\n### Plan\n- Use Button C to increment the number until we reach the target.\n- Since Button C works regardless of the light's state, it simplifies the process.\n\n### Implementation\nWe will simulate the button presses using a simple loop to determine the sequence of button presses needed to reach the target number.\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nnumber = 0\nlight = 'red'  # Initial light state\ntarget = 8\nsequence = []\n\n# Use Button C to reach the target\nwhile number < target:\n    sequence.append('C')\n    number += 1\n    # Toggle the light\n    light = 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\n# Print the sequence of button presses\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the sequence of button presses.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of button presses needed to reach the target number. The sequence consists of pressing Button C eight times, which increments the number by 1 each time, regardless of the light's state.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value of 8 is:\n\n<<<C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C>>>"
