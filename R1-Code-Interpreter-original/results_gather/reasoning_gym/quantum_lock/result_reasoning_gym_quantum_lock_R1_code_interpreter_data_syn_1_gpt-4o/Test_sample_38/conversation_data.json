    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number 0 to the target number 8, while considering the toggling of the light between red and green.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n- **Initial State**: Number = 0, Light = Red\n- **Target State**: Number = 8\n- **Button Operations**:\n  - **A**: Add 2 (Light state doesn't matter)\n  - **B**: Add 1 (Light state doesn't matter)\n  - **C**: Add 2 (Only when Light is Green)\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Track the State**: We need to keep track of both the number and the light state after each button press.\n2. **Toggle the Light**: Each button press toggles the light between red and green.\n3. **Find the Shortest Path**: Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number.\n\n### Implementation\nWe'll implement a BFS to explore all possible sequences of button presses, keeping track of the number and light state. We'll stop as soon as we reach the target number with the shortest sequence.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Initial state\nstart_number = 0\nstart_light = 'red'\ntarget_number = 8\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    return number + 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    return number + 1, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number + 2, 'red'\n    return number, light\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(start_number, start_light, target_number):\n    queue = deque([(start_number, start_light, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        number, light, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if number == target_number:\n            return path\n        \n        if (number, light) in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add((number, light))\n        \n        # Try each button\n        new_number, new_light = press_A(number, light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, path + ['A']))\n        \n        new_number, new_light = press_B(number, light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, path + ['B']))\n        \n        new_number, new_light = press_C(number, light)\n        queue.append((new_number, new_light, path + ['C']))\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nsequence = find_shortest_sequence(start_number, start_light, target_number)\nprint(\" → \".join(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 8 from the starting number 0, considering the toggling of the light. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
