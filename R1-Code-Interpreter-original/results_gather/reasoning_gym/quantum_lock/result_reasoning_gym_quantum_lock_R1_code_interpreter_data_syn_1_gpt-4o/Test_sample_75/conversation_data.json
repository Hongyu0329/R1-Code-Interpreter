    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (14), while considering the toggling of the light between red and green.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Target**: \n   - Number: 14\n\n3. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Add 2 (only when the light is green)\n   - **B**: Multiply by 2 (works regardless of the light's color)\n   - **C**: Add 1 (only when the light is green)\n\n4. **Light Toggle**: \n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n5. **Objective**: \n   - Find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14.\n\nTo solve this, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible sequences of button presses. We'll keep track of the current number, the light's state, and the sequence of button presses. The BFS will ensure that we find the shortest sequence.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Initial state\nstart_number = 0\ntarget_number = 14\ninitial_light = 'red'  # Light starts as red\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number + 2, 'red'\n    return number, light\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    return number * 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number + 1, 'red'\n    return number, light\n\n# BFS to find the shortest sequence\nqueue = deque([(start_number, initial_light, [])])\nvisited = set()\n\nwhile queue:\n    current_number, current_light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we reached the target\n    if current_number == target_number:\n        print(' → '.join(sequence))\n        break\n    \n    # Check if this state has been visited\n    if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n        continue\n    visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n    \n    # Try each button\n    new_number, new_light = press_A(current_number, current_light)\n    queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['A']))\n    \n    new_number, new_light = press_B(current_number, current_light)\n    queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['B']))\n    \n    new_number, new_light = press_C(current_number, current_light)\n    queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['C']))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code has successfully found the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 14. The sequence is:\n\n- **B**: Multiply by 2 (0 → 0, light toggles to green)\n- **A**: Add 2 (0 → 2, light toggles to red)\n- **B**: Multiply by 2 (2 → 4, light toggles to green)\n- **A**: Add 2 (4 → 6, light toggles to red)\n- **B**: Multiply by 2 (6 → 12, light toggles to green)\n- **A**: Add 2 (12 → 14, light toggles to red)\n\nThis sequence achieves the target number 14 in the shortest possible way. \n\n<<<B → A → B → A → B → A>>>"
