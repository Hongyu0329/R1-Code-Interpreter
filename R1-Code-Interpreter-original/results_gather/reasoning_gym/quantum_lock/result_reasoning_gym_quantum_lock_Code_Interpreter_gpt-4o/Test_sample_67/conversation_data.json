  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 27\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 2 (when green)\nB: Add 2 (when any)\nC: Add 3 (when green)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (27), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Subtracts 2, but only when the light is green.\n2. **Button B**: Adds 2, regardless of the light's color.\n3. **Button C**: Adds 3, but only when the light is green.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We start with the light being red.\n\nTo reach the target number 27, we can use the following strategy:\n\n1. Use Button B to increase the number by 2 each time, regardless of the light's color.\n2. Use Button C to increase the number by 3, but only when the light is green.\n\nLet's calculate the sequence of button presses needed to reach 27.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial state\ncurrent_value = 0\nlight_state = \"red\"  # Initial light state\ntarget_value = 27\n\n# Sequence of button presses\nbutton_sequence = []\n\n# Function to toggle light state\ndef toggle_light(state):\n    return \"green\" if state == \"red\" else \"red\"\n\n# Function to apply button press\ndef press_button(button, value, light):\n    if button == \"A\" and light == \"green\":\n        return value - 2\n    elif button == \"B\":\n        return value + 2\n    elif button == \"C\" and light == \"green\":\n        return value + 3\n    return value\n\n# Strategy: Use B to get close to the target, then use C when green\nwhile current_value < target_value:\n    if light_state == \"green\" and current_value + 3 <= target_value:\n        button_sequence.append(\"C\")\n        current_value = press_button(\"C\", current_value, light_state)\n    else:\n        button_sequence.append(\"B\")\n        current_value = press_button(\"B\", current_value, light_state)\n    light_state = toggle_light(light_state)\n\nbutton_sequence\nassistant > The shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value of 27 from the starting value of 0 is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<B → C → B → C → B → C → B → C → B → C → B>>>} \\]\n\nThis sequence uses Button B to add 2 and Button C to add 3 when the light is green, efficiently reaching the target value."
