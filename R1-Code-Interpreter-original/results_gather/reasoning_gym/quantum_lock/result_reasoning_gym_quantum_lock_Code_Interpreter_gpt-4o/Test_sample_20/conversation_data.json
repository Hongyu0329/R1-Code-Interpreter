  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 19\nButtons:\nA: Add 3 (when green)\nB: Subtract 3 (when any)\nC: Add 2 (when red)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (19), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Adds 3 to the number, but only when the light is green. Pressing this button will toggle the light.\n2. **Button B**: Subtracts 3 from the number, regardless of the light's color. Pressing this button will toggle the light.\n3. **Button C**: Adds 2 to the number, but only when the light is red. Pressing this button will toggle the light.\n\nThe initial state is 0 with a red light. The goal is to reach 19.\n\nLet's find the shortest sequence of button presses to achieve this.
