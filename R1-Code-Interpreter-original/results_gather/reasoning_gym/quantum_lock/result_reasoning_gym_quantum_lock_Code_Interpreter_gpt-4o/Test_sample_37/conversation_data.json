  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Add 1 (when any)\nB: Subtract 2 (when red)\nC: Multiply 2 (when any)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n- Button A: Adds 1 to the number, toggles the light.\n- Button B: Subtracts 2 from the number only when the light is red, toggles the light.\n- Button C: Multiplies the number by 2, toggles the light.\n\nWe start with the number 0 and the light red. Our goal is to reach the number 8.\n\n1. Start: 0 (red)\n2. Press C: 0 * 2 = 0 (light toggles to green)\n3. Press A: 0 + 1 = 1 (light toggles to red)\n4. Press C: 1 * 2 = 2 (light toggles to green)\n5. Press C: 2 * 2 = 4 (light toggles to red)\n6. Press C: 4 * 2 = 8 (light toggles to green)\n\nThe sequence of button presses is C → A → C → C → C.\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<C → A → C → C → C>>>"
