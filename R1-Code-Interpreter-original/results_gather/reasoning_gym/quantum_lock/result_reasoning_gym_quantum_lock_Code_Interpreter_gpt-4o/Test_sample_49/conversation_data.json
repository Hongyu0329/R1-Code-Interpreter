  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 26\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 3 (when any)\nB: Subtract 3 (when green)\nC: Add 2 (when any)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (26), while considering the effect of each button on the light and the number.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Subtracts 3 from the number, regardless of the light's color. It toggles the light between red and green.\n2. **Button B**: Subtracts 3 from the number only when the light is green. It toggles the light between red and green.\n3. **Button C**: Adds 2 to the number, regardless of the light's color. It toggles the light between red and green.\n\nThe initial state is 0 with a red light. The goal is to reach 26.\n\nLet's find the shortest sequence of button presses to achieve this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = (0, 'red')  # (number, light_color)\n\n# Define the target number\ntarget_number = 26\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light_color):\n    return (number - 3, 'green' if light_color == 'red' else 'red')\n\ndef press_B(number, light_color):\n    if light_color == 'green':\n        return (number - 3, 'red')\n    return (number, light_color)\n\ndef press_C(number, light_color):\n    return (number + 2, 'green' if light_color == 'red' else 'red')\n\n# Define the BFS function to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(initial_state, target_number):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])  # (state, sequence_of_buttons)\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        (current_number, current_light), sequence = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the target number\n        if current_number == target_number:\n            return sequence\n        \n        # Check if the current state is already visited\n        if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        # Mark the current state as visited\n        visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n        \n        # Explore the next states by pressing each button\n        next_states = [\n            (press_A(current_number, current_light), sequence + ['A']),\n            (press_B(current_number, current_light), sequence + ['B']),\n            (press_C(current_number, current_light), sequence + ['C'])\n        ]\n        \n        for next_state, next_sequence in next_states:\n            queue.append((next_state, next_sequence))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nshortest_sequence = find_shortest_sequence(initial_state, target_number)\nshortest_sequence\nassistant > The shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 26 from the starting number 0 is to press button C thirteen times.
