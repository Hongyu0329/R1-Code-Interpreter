  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 27\nButtons:\nA: Multiply 2 (when any)\nB: Add 3 (when any)\nC: Add 2 (when any)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (27). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but in this case, the operations are independent of the light's state.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Multiply the current number by 2.\n- Button B: Add 3 to the current number.\n- Button C: Add 2 to the current number.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of these operations that results in the number 27. Let's explore the possibilities step by step. \n\n1. Start with 0.\n2. Use button B to add 3: 0 + 3 = 3.\n3. Use button A to multiply by 2: 3 * 2 = 6.\n4. Use button A to multiply by 2: 6 * 2 = 12.\n5. Use button A to multiply by 2: 12 * 2 = 24.\n6. Use button B to add 3: 24 + 3 = 27.\n\nThe sequence of button presses is B → A → A → A → B.\n\nTherefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<B → A → A → A → B>>>"
