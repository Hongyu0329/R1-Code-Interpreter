  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (43), while considering the effect of each button and the state of the light.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button B: Subtracts 2, but only when the light is red.\n- Button C: Adds 3, regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\nWe start at 0 with the light red.
