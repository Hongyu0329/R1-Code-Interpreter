  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 9\nButtons:\nA: Add 1 (when any)\nB: Add 2 (when any)\nC: Subtract 1 (when any)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (9). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but in this case, the operations are independent of the light's state.\n\nGiven the operations:\n- Button A: Add 1\n- Button B: Add 2\n- Button C: Subtract 1\n\nWe can approach this problem by trying to reach the target number using the fewest button presses. Since the operations are independent of the light's state, we can focus solely on the arithmetic operations.\n\nTo reach 9 from 0, we can use the following strategy:\n1. Use Button B (Add 2) as much as possible to quickly increase the number.\n2. Use Button A (Add 1) to make up any remaining difference to reach exactly 9.\n\nLet's calculate the sequence of button presses.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Starting number\nstart = 0\n\n# Target number\ntarget = 9\n\n# Calculate the number of times to press each button\n# Use Button B (Add 2) as much as possible\nb_presses = target // 2\n\n# Calculate the remaining difference to reach the target\nremaining = target - (b_presses * 2)\n\n# Use Button A (Add 1) to make up the remaining difference\na_presses = remaining\n\n# Create the sequence of button presses\nbutton_sequence = ['B'] * b_presses + ['A'] * a_presses\nbutton_sequence\nassistant > The shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 9 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<B → B → B → B → A>>>} \\]\n\nThis sequence involves pressing Button B four times to add 8, and then pressing Button A once to add the remaining 1, reaching the target of 9."
