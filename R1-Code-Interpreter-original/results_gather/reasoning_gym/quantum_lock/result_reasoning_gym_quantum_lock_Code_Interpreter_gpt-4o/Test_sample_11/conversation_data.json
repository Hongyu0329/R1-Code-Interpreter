  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 2 (when any)\nB: Multiply 2 (when any)\nC: Add 2 (when any)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8), while considering the effect of each button press on the light's state.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Start with the number 0 and the light in the red state.\n2. **Target**: Reach the number 8.\n\nLet's explore the operations:\n\n- **Button A**: Subtracts 2 from the number.\n- **Button B**: Multiplies the number by 2.\n- **Button C**: Adds 2 to the number.\n\nSince the light toggles between red and green with each button press, the state of the light does not affect the operations in this case.\n\nTo reach the target number 8 from 0, we can use the following sequence of operations:\n\n1. Start with 0.\n2. Press C: 0 + 2 = 2\n3. Press B: 2 * 2 = 4\n4. Press B: 4 * 2 = 8\n\nThis sequence reaches the target number 8 in three steps. Therefore, the shortest sequence of button presses is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<C → B → B>>>} \\]"
