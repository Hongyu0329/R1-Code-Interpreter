  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when any)\nB: Multiply 2 (when green)\nC: Multiply 2 (when red)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n\n1. **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n2. **Button B**: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is green.\n3. **Button C**: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is red.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\nStarting from 0 (red), we need to reach 8. Let's explore the sequence of operations:\n\n1. **Press A**: \n   - Number: 0 + 2 = 2\n   - Light: Green\n\n2. **Press B**: \n   - Number: 2 * 2 = 4\n   - Light: Red\n\n3. **Press C**: \n   - Number: 4 * 2 = 8\n   - Light: Green\n\nThe sequence of button presses is A → B → C, which transforms the starting number 0 into the target number 8.\n\nThus, the shortest correct sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<A → B → C>>>"
