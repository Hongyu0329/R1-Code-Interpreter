  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 44\nButtons:\nA: Add 3 (when any)\nB: Add 3 (when red)\nC: Add 2 (when green)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (44), while considering the effect of each button on the light's state and the number.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n\n- **Button A**: Adds 3 to the number regardless of the light's state. It toggles the light.\n- **Button B**: Adds 3 to the number only when the light is red. It toggles the light.\n- **Button C**: Adds 2 to the number only when the light is green. It toggles the light.\n\nThe initial state is 0 with the light being red. We need to reach 44.\n\nLet's simulate the process to find the shortest sequence of button presses.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = (0, 'red')  # (number, light_state)\n\n# Define the target number\ntarget_number = 44\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef press_A(number, light_state):\n    return (number + 3, 'green' if light_state == 'red' else 'red')\n\ndef press_B(number, light_state):\n    if light_state == 'red':\n        return (number + 3, 'green')\n    return None\n\ndef press_C(number, light_state):\n    if light_state == 'green':\n        return (number + 2, 'red')\n    return None\n\n# Use a queue to perform a breadth-first search (BFS)\nqueue = deque([(initial_state, [])])  # (current_state, sequence_of_buttons)\n\n# Use a set to keep track of visited states\nvisited = set()\n\n# Perform BFS to find the shortest sequence\nwhile queue:\n    (current_number, current_light), sequence = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the target number\n    if current_number == target_number:\n        shortest_sequence = sequence\n        break\n    \n    # Mark the current state as visited\n    visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n    \n    # Try pressing each button and enqueue the resulting state if not visited\n    for button, operation in [('A', press_A), ('B', press_B), ('C', press_C)]:\n        new_state = operation(current_number, current_light)\n        if new_state and new_state not in visited:\n            queue.append((new_state, sequence + [button]))\n\n# Format the shortest sequence\nshortest_sequence_formatted = ' → '.join(shortest_sequence)\nshortest_sequence_formatted\nassistant > The shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 44 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n\\[ \\texttt{<<<A → A → A → A → A → A → A → A → A → A → A → A → A → C → A>>>} \\]\n\nThis sequence ensures that the operations are performed correctly while toggling the light as needed."
