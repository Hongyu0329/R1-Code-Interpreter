  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 16\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 2 (when any)\nB: Add 1 (when any)\nC: Multiply 2 (when any)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (16). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but in this case, the operations are independent of the light's state.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n- Button A: Subtract 2\n- Button B: Add 1\n- Button C: Multiply by 2\n\nSince the target is 16, and multiplication by 2 is the most efficient way to increase the number, we should prioritize using button C. However, we need to start from 0, and multiplying 0 by 2 will always result in 0. Therefore, we need to first increase the number using button B.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n1. Use button B to increase the number from 0 to 1.\n2. Use button C to double the number repeatedly until we reach 16.\n\nLet's calculate the sequence of operations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial number\nnumber = 0\n\n# Sequence of operations\nsequence = []\n\n# Step 1: Use button B to increase the number from 0 to 1\nnumber += 1\nsequence.append('B')\n\n# Step 2: Use button C to double the number until we reach 16\nwhile number < 16:\n    number *= 2\n    sequence.append('C')\n\nsequence\nassistant > The shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value of 16 from the starting value of 0 is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<B → C → C → C → C>>>} \\]\n\nThis sequence involves pressing button B once to increase the number to 1, followed by pressing button C four times to double the number each time, reaching 16."
