  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Multiply 2 (when any)\nB: Add 1 (when any)\nC: Subtract 2 (when any)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but in this case, the operations are independent of the light's state.\n\nLet's explore the sequence of operations:\n\n1. Start at 0 (red).\n2. Press B: 0 + 1 = 1 (light toggles to green).\n3. Press A: 1 * 2 = 2 (light toggles to red).\n4. Press A: 2 * 2 = 4 (light toggles to green).\n5. Press A: 4 * 2 = 8 (light toggles to red).\n\nThe sequence of button presses is B → A → A → A.\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<B → A → A → A>>>"
