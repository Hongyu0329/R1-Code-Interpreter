  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 34\nButtons:\nA: Add 3 (when any)\nB: Multiply 2 (when any)\nC: Subtract 2 (when green)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (34), while considering the effect of the light's state (red or green) on the operations.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Adds 3 to the number, regardless of the light's state.\n- Button B: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's state.\n- Button C: Subtracts 2 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\nWe start at 0 with the light red. Our goal is to reach 34. Let's explore the sequence of operations:\n\n1. Start at 0 (red).\n2. Press A: 0 + 3 = 3 (light turns green).\n3. Press B: 3 * 2 = 6 (light turns red).\n4. Press B: 6 * 2 = 12 (light turns green).\n5. Press B: 12 * 2 = 24 (light turns red).\n6. Press A: 24 + 3 = 27 (light turns green).\n7. Press B: 27 * 2 = 54 (light turns red).\n8. Press C: 54 - 2 = 52 (light turns green).\n9. Press C: 52 - 2 = 50 (light turns red).\n10. Press C: 50 - 2 = 48 (light turns green).\n11. Press C: 48 - 2 = 46 (light turns red).\n12. Press C: 46 - 2 = 44 (light turns green).\n13. Press C: 44 - 2 = 42 (light turns red).\n14. Press C: 42 - 2 = 40 (light turns green).\n15. Press C: 40 - 2 = 38 (light turns red).\n16. Press C: 38 - 2 = 36 (light turns green).\n17. Press C: 36 - 2 = 34 (light turns red).\n\nThe sequence of button presses is: A → B → B → B → A → B → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C\n\nLet's express this sequence in the required format:\n\n<<<A → B → B → B → A → B → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C>>>"
