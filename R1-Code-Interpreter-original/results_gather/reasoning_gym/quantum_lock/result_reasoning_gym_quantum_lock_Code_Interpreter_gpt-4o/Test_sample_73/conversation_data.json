  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 36\nButtons:\nA: Add 3 (when any)\nB: Add 3 (when green)\nC: Subtract 3 (when red)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (36), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons:\n\n1. **Button A**: Adds 3 to the number regardless of the light's color. It also toggles the light.\n2. **Button B**: Adds 3 to the number only when the light is green. It also toggles the light.\n3. **Button C**: Subtracts 3 from the number only when the light is red. It also toggles the light.\n\nStarting from 0 with the light red, we need to reach 36. Let's explore the sequence of operations:\n\n1. Press **A**: Number becomes 3, light turns green.\n2. Press **B**: Number becomes 6, light turns red.\n3. Press **A**: Number becomes 9, light turns green.\n4. Press **B**: Number becomes 12, light turns red.\n5. Press **A**: Number becomes 15, light turns green.\n6. Press **B**: Number becomes 18, light turns red.\n7. Press **A**: Number becomes 21, light turns green.\n8. Press **B**: Number becomes 24, light turns red.\n9. Press **A**: Number becomes 27, light turns green.\n10. Press **B**: Number becomes 30, light turns red.\n11. Press **A**: Number becomes 33, light turns green.\n12. Press **B**: Number becomes 36, light turns red.\n\nThe sequence of button presses is: A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B → A → B>>>"
