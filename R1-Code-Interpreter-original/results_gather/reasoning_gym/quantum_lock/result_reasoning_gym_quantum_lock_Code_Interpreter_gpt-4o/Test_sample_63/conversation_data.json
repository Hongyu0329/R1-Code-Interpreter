  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 32\nButtons:\nA: Multiply 2 (when red)\nB: Add 2 (when green)\nC: Multiply 2 (when green)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (32), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n\n1. **Button A**: Multiplies the number by 2 when the light is red.\n2. **Button B**: Adds 2 to the number when the light is green.\n3. **Button C**: Multiplies the number by 2 when the light is green.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We start with the light being red.\n\nLet's find the sequence of button presses:\n\n1. Start: 0 (red)\n2. Press A: 0 * 2 = 0 (light turns green)\n3. Press B: 0 + 2 = 2 (light turns red)\n4. Press A: 2 * 2 = 4 (light turns green)\n5. Press C: 4 * 2 = 8 (light turns red)\n6. Press A: 8 * 2 = 16 (light turns green)\n7. Press C: 16 * 2 = 32 (light turns red)\n\nThe sequence of button presses is A → B → A → C → A → C.\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<A → B → A → C → A → C>>>"
