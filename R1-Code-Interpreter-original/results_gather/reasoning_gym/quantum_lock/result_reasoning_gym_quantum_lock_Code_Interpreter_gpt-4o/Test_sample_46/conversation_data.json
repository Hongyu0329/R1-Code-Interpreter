  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 14\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when red)\nB: Multiply 2 (when green)\nC: Add 1 (when red)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (14), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons:\n- Button A: Adds 2 to the number when the light is red and toggles the light.\n- Button B: Multiplies the number by 2 when the light is green and toggles the light.\n- Button C: Adds 1 to the number when the light is red and toggles the light.\n\nWe start with the number 0 and the light red. Our goal is to reach the number 14.\n\n1. Start: 0 (red)\n2. Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (light turns green)\n3. Press B: 2 * 2 = 4 (light turns red)\n4. Press A: 4 + 2 = 6 (light turns green)\n5. Press B: 6 * 2 = 12 (light turns red)\n6. Press C: 12 + 1 = 13 (light turns green)\n7. Press C: 13 + 1 = 14 (light turns red)\n\nThe sequence of button presses is: A → B → A → B → C → C\n\nTherefore, the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<A → B → A → B → C → C>>>"
