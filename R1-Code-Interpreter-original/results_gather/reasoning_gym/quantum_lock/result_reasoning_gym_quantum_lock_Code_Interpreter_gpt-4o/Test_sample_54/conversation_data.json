  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when any)\nB: Multiply 2 (when any)\nC: Add 1 (when any)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8), while considering the effect of each button press on the light's state.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n\n- Button A: Adds 2 to the number.\n- Button B: Multiplies the number by 2.\n- Button C: Adds 1 to the number.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press, but the operations themselves are not dependent on the light's state.\n\nTo reach the target number 8 from 0, we can use the following strategy:\n\n1. Start with 0.\n2. Press button C to add 1 (0 + 1 = 1).\n3. Press button B to multiply by 2 (1 * 2 = 2).\n4. Press button B again to multiply by 2 (2 * 2 = 4).\n5. Press button B again to multiply by 2 (4 * 2 = 8).\n\nThis sequence of operations will reach the target number 8. Let's write the sequence of button presses:\n\n<<<C → B → B → B>>>"
