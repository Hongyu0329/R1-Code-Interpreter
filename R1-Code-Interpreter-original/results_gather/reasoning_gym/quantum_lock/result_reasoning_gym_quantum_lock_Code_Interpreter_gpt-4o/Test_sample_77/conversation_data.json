  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 14\nButtons:\nA: Add 3 (when any)\nB: Add 2 (when any)\nC: Subtract 3 (when any)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (14), while considering the toggling of the light between red and green with each button press. \n\nGiven the operations:\n- Button A: Add 3\n- Button B: Add 2\n- Button C: Subtract 3\n\nWe can approach this problem by simulating the button presses and keeping track of the current number and the light's state.
