  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 2 (when any)\nB: Add 2 (when any)\nC: Multiply 2 (when any)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (8), while considering the effect of each button press on the light's state.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Start at 0 (red):**\n   - Current number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Press B (Add 2):**\n   - New number: 0 + 2 = 2\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\n3. **Press C (Multiply 2):**\n   - New number: 2 * 2 = 4\n   - Light toggles to Red\n\n4. **Press C (Multiply 2):**\n   - New number: 4 * 2 = 8\n   - Light toggles to Green\n\nNow, the number is 8, which is the target value. The sequence of button presses is B → C → C.\n\nTherefore, the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<B → C → C>>>"
