  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 10\nButtons:\nA: Multiply 2 (when red)\nB: Subtract 1 (when green)\nC: Add 1 (when any)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (10), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is red. Pressing this button will toggle the light to green.\n2. **Button B**: Subtracts 1 from the number, but only when the light is green. Pressing this button will toggle the light to red.\n3. **Button C**: Adds 1 to the number, regardless of the light's color. Pressing this button will toggle the light's color.\n\nStarting from 0 with the light red, we need to reach 10. Let's find the sequence of button presses:\n\n1. Start at 0 (red).\n2. Press C: 0 + 1 = 1 (light turns green).\n3. Press C: 1 + 1 = 2 (light turns red).\n4. Press A: 2 * 2 = 4 (light turns green).\n5. Press C: 4 + 1 = 5 (light turns red).\n6. Press A: 5 * 2 = 10 (light turns green).\n\nThe sequence of button presses is: C → C → A → C → A\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<C → C → A → C → A>>>"
