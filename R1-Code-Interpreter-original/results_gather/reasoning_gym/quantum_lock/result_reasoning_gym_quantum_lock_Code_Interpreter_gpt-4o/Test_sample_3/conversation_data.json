    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (29), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n\n1. **Button A**: Subtracts 2, but only when the light is green.\n2. **Button B**: Adds 3, regardless of the light's color.\n3. **Button C**: Subtracts 3, but only when the light is green.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We start with the light being red.\n\nTo reach the target number 29, we can only increase the number when the light is red (since only Button B works in both states), and we can decrease the number when the light is green (using either Button A or C).\n\nLet's find the sequence of button presses:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the initial state\nstart = 0\ntarget = 29\nlight = 'red'  # Initial light state\n\n# Define the operations for each button\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number - 2, 'red'\n    return number, 'green'\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    return number + 3, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number - 3, 'red'\n    return number, 'green'\n\n# Use a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest sequence of button presses\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Queue for BFS: (current number, light state, sequence of presses)\nqueue = deque([(start, light, [])])\nvisited = set((start, light))\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    current_number, current_light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we reached the target\n    if current_number == target:\n        shortest_sequence = sequence\n        break\n    \n    # Try pressing each button and add the new state to the queue if not visited\n    for button, press in [('A', press_A), ('B', press_B), ('C', press_C)]:\n        new_number, new_light = press(current_number, current_light)\n        if (new_number, new_light) not in visited:\n            visited.add((new_number, new_light))\n            queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + [button]))\n\n# Format the sequence\nshortest_sequence_formatted = ' → '.join(shortest_sequence)\nshortest_sequence_formatted\nassistant > The shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value of 29 from the starting value of 0 is:\n\n<<<B → A → B → A → B → B → B → B → B → B → B → B → B>>>\n\nThis sequence ensures that the operations are performed correctly according to the state of the light, and it achieves the target value in the fewest steps."
