  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 15\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 2 (when any)\nB: Add 1 (when any)\nC: Multiply 2 (when green)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (15), while considering the effect of the light's color on the operations.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the operations:\n\n1. **Start at 0 (red):**\n   - Press B: 0 + 1 = 1 (light toggles to green)\n\n2. **1 (green):**\n   - Press C: 1 * 2 = 2 (light toggles to red)\n\n3. **2 (red):**\n   - Press B: 2 + 1 = 3 (light toggles to green)\n\n4. **3 (green):**\n   - Press C: 3 * 2 = 6 (light toggles to red)\n\n5. **6 (red):**\n   - Press B: 6 + 1 = 7 (light toggles to green)\n\n6. **7 (green):**\n   - Press C: 7 * 2 = 14 (light toggles to red)\n\n7. **14 (red):**\n   - Press B: 14 + 1 = 15 (light toggles to green)\n\nNow, we have reached the target number 15. The sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<B → C → B → C → B → C → B>>>"
