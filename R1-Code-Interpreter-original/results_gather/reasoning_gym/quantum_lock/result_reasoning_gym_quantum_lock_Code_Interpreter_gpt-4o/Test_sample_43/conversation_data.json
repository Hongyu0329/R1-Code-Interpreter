  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 31\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when red)\nB: Subtract 3 (when red)\nC: Add 3 (when any)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (31), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n\n- **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number when the light is red and toggles the light.\n- **Button B**: Subtracts 3 from the number when the light is red and toggles the light.\n- **Button C**: Adds 3 to the number regardless of the light's color and toggles the light.\n\nThe light starts as red, and we need to reach the target number 31.
