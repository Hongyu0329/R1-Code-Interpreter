  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 8\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when any)\nB: Add 1 (when any)\nC: Add 2 (when green)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) to the target number (8), while considering the effect of the light's color on the operations.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Number: 0\n   - Light: Red\n\n2. **Button Operations**:\n   - **A**: Adds 2 regardless of the light's color.\n   - **B**: Adds 1 regardless of the light's color.\n   - **C**: Adds 2 only when the light is green.\n\n3. **Light Toggle**:\n   - The light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\n4. **Objective**:\n   - Reach the number 8 with the shortest sequence of button presses.\n\nLet's explore the sequence of button presses:\n\n- Start with 0 (red).\n- Press A: Number becomes 2, light becomes green.\n- Press A: Number becomes 4, light becomes red.\n- Press A: Number becomes 6, light becomes green.\n- Press A: Number becomes 8, light becomes red.\n\nThe sequence of button presses is: A → A → A → A\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<A → A → A → A>>>"
