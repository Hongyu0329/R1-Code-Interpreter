  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (31), while considering the effect of the light's color on the operations.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n\n- Button A: Subtracts 2 only when the light is green.\n- Button B: Subtracts 2 regardless of the light's color.\n- Button C: Adds 3 regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press. We start with the light being red.\n\nTo reach the target number 31 from 0, we can use the following strategy:\n\n1. Use Button C to increase the number by 3, which is the only way to increase the number.\n2. Use Button B to decrease the number by 2 when needed, as it works regardless of the light's color.\n3. Use Button A only when the light is green, if necessary.\n\nLet's find the sequence of button presses:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial state\nstart = 0\ntarget = 31\nlight = 'red'  # Initial light color\n\n# Define the operations\ndef press_A(number, light):\n    if light == 'green':\n        return number - 2, 'red'\n    return number, 'green'\n\ndef press_B(number, light):\n    return number - 2, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_C(number, light):\n    return number + 3, 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n\n# Find the shortest sequence of button presses\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Queue for BFS: (current_number, current_light, sequence_of_buttons)\nqueue = deque([(start, light, [])])\nvisited = set()\n\nwhile queue:\n    current_number, current_light, sequence = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we reached the target\n    if current_number == target:\n        shortest_sequence = sequence\n        break\n    \n    # Check if this state has been visited\n    if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n        continue\n    visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n    \n    # Try each button\n    # Press A\n    new_number, new_light = press_A(current_number, current_light)\n    queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['A']))\n    \n    # Press B\n    new_number, new_light = press_B(current_number, current_light)\n    queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['B']))\n    \n    # Press C\n    new_number, new_light = press_C(current_number, current_light)\n    queue.append((new_number, new_light, sequence + ['C']))\n\nshortest_sequence\nassistant > The shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value of 31 from the starting value of 0 is:\n\n<<<B → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C → C>>>\n\nThis sequence involves pressing Button B once and Button C eleven times."
