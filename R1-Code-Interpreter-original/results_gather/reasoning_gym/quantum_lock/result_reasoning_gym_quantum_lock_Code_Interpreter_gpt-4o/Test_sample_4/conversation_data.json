    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (22), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n\n1. **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number, but only when the light is red. Pressing this button will toggle the light.\n2. **Button B**: Subtracts 2 from the number, regardless of the light's color. Pressing this button will toggle the light.\n3. **Button C**: Multiplies the number by 2, regardless of the light's color. Pressing this button will toggle the light.\n\nThe light starts as red, and we need to reach the target number 22. Let's find the shortest sequence of button presses to achieve this. \n\nWe can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the possible sequences of button presses.
