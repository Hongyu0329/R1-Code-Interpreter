  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 14\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 2 (when any)\nB: Subtract 3 (when green)\nC: Add 2 (when any)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (14), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Subtracts 2 from the number, regardless of the light's color.\n2. **Button B**: Subtracts 3 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n3. **Button C**: Adds 2 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\nStarting from 0 with the light red, we need to reach 14. Let's explore the sequence of operations:\n\n1. Start: 0 (red)\n2. Press C: 0 + 2 = 2 (light turns green)\n3. Press C: 2 + 2 = 4 (light turns red)\n4. Press C: 4 + 2 = 6 (light turns green)\n5. Press C: 6 + 2 = 8 (light turns red)\n6. Press C: 8 + 2 = 10 (light turns green)\n7. Press C: 10 + 2 = 12 (light turns red)\n8. Press C: 12 + 2 = 14 (light turns green)\n\nThe sequence of button presses is C repeated 7 times. Therefore, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<C → C → C → C → C → C → C>>>"
