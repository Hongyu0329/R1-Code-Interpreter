  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 16\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when any)\nB: Subtract 1 (when any)\nC: Multiply 2 (when any)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (16). The light toggles between red and green with each button press, but in this case, the operations are independent of the light's state.\n\nLet's analyze the operations:\n- Button A: Add 2\n- Button B: Subtract 1\n- Button C: Multiply by 2\n\nStarting from 0, we need to reach 16. The most efficient way to reach a higher number is by using multiplication, so we should prioritize using button C (Multiply by 2) whenever possible.\n\nLet's calculate the sequence of operations: \n\n1. Start at 0.\n2. Press A: 0 + 2 = 2\n3. Press C: 2 * 2 = 4\n4. Press C: 4 * 2 = 8\n5. Press C: 8 * 2 = 16\n\nThis sequence reaches the target number 16 in four steps. Therefore, the shortest sequence of button presses is:\n\n<<<A → C → C → C>>>"
