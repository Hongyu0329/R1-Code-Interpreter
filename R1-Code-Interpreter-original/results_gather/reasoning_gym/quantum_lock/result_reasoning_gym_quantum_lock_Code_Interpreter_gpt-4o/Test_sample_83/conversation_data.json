  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 20\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when any)\nB: Subtract 3 (when green)\nC: Multiply 2 (when green)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (20), while considering the state of the light (red or green) and the operations each button performs.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Adds 2 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button B: Subtracts 3 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n- Button C: Multiplies the number by 2, but only when the light is green.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\nWe start at 0 with the light red. Our goal is to reach 20.
