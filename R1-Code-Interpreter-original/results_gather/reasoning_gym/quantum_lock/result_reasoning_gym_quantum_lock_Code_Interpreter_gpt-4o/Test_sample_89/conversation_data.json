  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 9\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when green)\nB: Add 1 (when red)\nC: Subtract 1 (when green)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (9), while considering the state of the light (red or green) and the operations each button performs.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n\n- **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number, but only when the light is green.\n- **Button B**: Adds 1 to the number, but only when the light is red.\n- **Button C**: Subtracts 1 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\nStarting from 0 with the light red, we can press Button B to add 1, and the light will turn green. We can then press Button A to add 2, and the light will turn red again. We can repeat this sequence to reach the target number 9.\n\nLet's calculate the sequence step by step.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial state\nnumber = 0\nlight = 'red'\nsequence = []\n\n# Target number\ntarget = 9\n\n# Function to press a button\ndef press_button(button, number, light):\n    if button == 'A' and light == 'green':\n        number += 2\n    elif button == 'B' and light == 'red':\n        number += 1\n    elif button == 'C' and light == 'green':\n        number -= 1\n    # Toggle light\n    light = 'green' if light == 'red' else 'red'\n    return number, light\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nwhile number != target:\n    if light == 'red':\n        # Press B to add 1\n        number, light = press_button('B', number, light)\n        sequence.append('B')\n    elif light == 'green':\n        # Press A to add 2\n        number, light = press_button('A', number, light)\n        sequence.append('A')\n\nsequence\nassistant > The shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 9 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<B → A → B → A → B → A>>>} \\]\n\nThis sequence alternates between pressing Button B (when the light is red) and Button A (when the light is green), effectively adding 3 to the number with each cycle."
