  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 23\nButtons:\nA: Add 3 (when any)\nB: Add 2 (when green)\nC: Subtract 3 (when red)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (23), while considering the state of the light (red or green) and the operations each button performs.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Adds 3 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n- Button B: Adds 2 to the number, but only when the light is green.\n- Button C: Subtracts 3 from the number, but only when the light is red.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\nStarting from 0 with the light red, we need to reach 23. Let's find the sequence of button presses:\n\n1. Start at 0 (red).\n2. Press A: 0 + 3 = 3 (light turns green).\n3. Press A: 3 + 3 = 6 (light turns red).\n4. Press A: 6 + 3 = 9 (light turns green).\n5. Press A: 9 + 3 = 12 (light turns red).\n6. Press A: 12 + 3 = 15 (light turns green).\n7. Press A: 15 + 3 = 18 (light turns red).\n8. Press A: 18 + 3 = 21 (light turns green).\n9. Press B: 21 + 2 = 23 (light turns red).\n\nThe sequence of button presses is: A → A → A → A → A → A → A → B\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<A → A → A → A → A → A → A → B>>>"
