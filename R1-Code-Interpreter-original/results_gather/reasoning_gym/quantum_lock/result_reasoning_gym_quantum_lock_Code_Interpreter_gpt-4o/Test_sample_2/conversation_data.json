  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 36\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 2 (when green)\nB: Add 3 (when any)\nC: Add 3 (when red)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (36), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Subtracts 2 from the number, but only when the light is green.\n2. **Button B**: Adds 3 to the number, regardless of the light's color.\n3. **Button C**: Adds 3 to the number, but only when the light is red.\n\nThe light toggles between red and green with each button press.\n\nStarting from 0 with the light red, we need to reach 36. Let's find the sequence of button presses:\n\n1. Start at 0 (red).\n2. Press B: 0 + 3 = 3 (light turns green).\n3. Press B: 3 + 3 = 6 (light turns red).\n4. Press B: 6 + 3 = 9 (light turns green).\n5. Press B: 9 + 3 = 12 (light turns red).\n6. Press B: 12 + 3 = 15 (light turns green).\n7. Press B: 15 + 3 = 18 (light turns red).\n8. Press B: 18 + 3 = 21 (light turns green).\n9. Press B: 21 + 3 = 24 (light turns red).\n10. Press B: 24 + 3 = 27 (light turns green).\n11. Press B: 27 + 3 = 30 (light turns red).\n12. Press B: 30 + 3 = 33 (light turns green).\n13. Press B: 33 + 3 = 36 (light turns red).\n\nThe sequence of button presses is all B, and the light toggles between red and green with each press. The shortest sequence is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<B → B → B → B → B → B → B → B → B → B → B → B → B>>>} \\]"
