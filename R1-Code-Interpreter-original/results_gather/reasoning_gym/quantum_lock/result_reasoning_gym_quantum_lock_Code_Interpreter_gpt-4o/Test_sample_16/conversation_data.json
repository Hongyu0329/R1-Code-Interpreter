  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 30\nButtons:\nA: Add 2 (when red)\nB: Multiply 2 (when any)\nC: Add 2 (when green)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (30), while considering the effect of each button on the number and the state of the light.\n\nLet's analyze the buttons and their effects:\n\n1. **Button A**: Adds 2 to the number when the light is red. It also toggles the light.\n2. **Button B**: Multiplies the number by 2 regardless of the light's color. It also toggles the light.\n3. **Button C**: Adds 2 to the number when the light is green. It also toggles the light.\n\nThe initial state is 0 with the light being red. The goal is to reach 30.\n\nLet's find the shortest sequence of button presses to achieve this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial state\ninitial_state = (0, 'red')  # (number, light_color)\n\n# Define the target number\ntarget_number = 30\n\n# Define the button operations\ndef press_A(number, light_color):\n    if light_color == 'red':\n        return number + 2, 'green'\n    return number, light_color\n\ndef press_B(number, light_color):\n    return number * 2, 'green' if light_color == 'red' else 'red'\n\ndef press_C(number, light_color):\n    if light_color == 'green':\n        return number + 2, 'red'\n    return number, light_color\n\n# Define the BFS function to find the shortest sequence\ndef find_shortest_sequence(initial_state, target_number):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])  # (state, path)\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        (current_number, current_light), path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_number == target_number:\n            return path\n        \n        if (current_number, current_light) in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add((current_number, current_light))\n        \n        # Try each button\n        next_state_A = press_A(current_number, current_light)\n        next_state_B = press_B(current_number, current_light)\n        next_state_C = press_C(current_number, current_light)\n        \n        queue.append((next_state_A, path + ['A']))\n        queue.append((next_state_B, path + ['B']))\n        queue.append((next_state_C, path + ['C']))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Find the shortest sequence\nshortest_sequence = find_shortest_sequence(initial_state, target_number)\nshortest_sequence\nassistant > The shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target number 30 from the starting number 0 is:\n\n\\[ \\texttt{<<<A → B → A → B → A → B → A>>>} \\]\n\nThis sequence ensures that the operations are performed in the correct order, taking into account the state of the light after each button press."
