  "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '→' enclosed within triple angle brackets, for example: <<<A → B → C>>>\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 19\nButtons:\nA: Subtract 3 (when any)\nB: Add 3 (when any)\nC: Add 2 (when any)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that will transform the starting number (0) into the target number (19), while considering the toggling of the light between red and green with each button press. The light's color does not affect the operations in this case, as each button performs the same operation regardless of the light's state.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n- Button A: Subtract 3\n- Button B: Add 3\n- Button C: Add 2\n\nWe start at 0 and need to reach 19. The goal is to find the shortest sequence of operations to achieve this.\n\n1. Start at 0 (red)\n2. Press B: 0 + 3 = 3 (green)\n3. Press B: 3 + 3 = 6 (red)\n4. Press B: 6 + 3 = 9 (green)\n5. Press B: 9 + 3 = 12 (red)\n6. Press B: 12 + 3 = 15 (green)\n7. Press C: 15 + 2 = 17 (red)\n8. Press C: 17 + 2 = 19 (green)\n\nThe sequence of button presses is B → B → B → B → B → C → C.\n\nThus, the shortest sequence of button presses to reach the target value is:\n\n<<<B → B → B → B → B → C → C>>>"
