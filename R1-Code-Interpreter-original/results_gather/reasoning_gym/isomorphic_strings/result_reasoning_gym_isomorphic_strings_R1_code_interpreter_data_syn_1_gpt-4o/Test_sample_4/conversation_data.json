    "To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between every character of the first string to the second string. This means that each character in the first string can be replaced to get the second string, and no two characters in the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: First, we need to check if the two strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**: We will create two dictionaries to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**: We will iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously. For each character pair:\n   - Check if the character from the first string is already mapped to a character in the second string. If it is, ensure it maps to the current character from the second string.\n   - Similarly, check if the character from the second string is already mapped to a character in the first string. If it is, ensure it maps to the current character from the first string.\n   - If any of these conditions fail, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n4. **Return Result**: If we successfully iterate through the strings without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code to determine if the given strings \"dcxeju\" and \"symfpn\" are isomorphic.\n\n```python\ndef are_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    mapping_s1_to_s2 = {}\n    mapping_s2_to_s1 = {}\n    \n    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if char1 in mapping_s1_to_s2:\n            if mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] != char2:\n                return False\n        if char2 in mapping_s2_to_s1:\n            if mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] != char1:\n                return False\n        \n        mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2\n        mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1\n    \n    return True\n\n# Test the function with the given strings\nresult = are_isomorphic(\"dcxeju\", \"symfpn\")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to see if the strings are isomorphic.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is `True`. This means that the two strings \"dcxeju\" and \"symfpn\" are isomorphic. Each character in the first string can be uniquely mapped to a character in the second string, and vice versa, without any conflicts.\n\n<<<True>>>"
