    "To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between every character of the first string to the second string. This means that each character in the first string can be replaced to get the second string, and no two characters in the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. We need to iterate through both strings simultaneously.\n2. We will use two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings:\n   - One dictionary to map characters from the first string to the second string.\n   - Another dictionary to map characters from the second string to the first string.\n3. For each character pair from both strings:\n   - If the character from the first string is already in the first dictionary, it should map to the current character of the second string.\n   - If the character from the second string is already in the second dictionary, it should map to the current character of the first string.\n   - If any of these conditions fail, the strings are not isomorphic.\n4. If we successfully iterate through both strings without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\ndef are_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    mapping_s1_to_s2 = {}\n    mapping_s2_to_s1 = {}\n    \n    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if char1 in mapping_s1_to_s2:\n            if mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] != char2:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2\n        \n        if char2 in mapping_s2_to_s1:\n            if mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] != char1:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1\n    \n    return True\n\n# Test the function with the given strings\ns1 = \"kjj\"\ns2 = \"lnr\"\nresult = are_isomorphic(s1, s2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if the strings \"kjj\" and \"lnr\" are isomorphic.",
    "The code execution indicates that the strings \"kjj\" and \"lnr\" are not isomorphic, which means there is no consistent one-to-one character mapping between the two strings.\n\nLet's summarize the reasoning:\n\n- The first string \"kjj\" has the characters 'k', 'j', and 'j'.\n- The second string \"lnr\" has the characters 'l', 'n', and 'r'.\n- For the strings to be isomorphic:\n  - 'k' should map to 'l'.\n  - 'j' should map to 'n'.\n  - However, the second occurrence of 'j' in \"kjj\" would need to map to 'r' in \"lnr\", which violates the one-to-one mapping rule since 'j' cannot map to both 'n' and 'r'.\n\nTherefore, the strings \"kjj\" and \"lnr\" are not isomorphic.\n\n<<<False>>>"
