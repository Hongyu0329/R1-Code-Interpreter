    "To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between every character of the first string to the second string. This means that each character in the first string can be replaced to get the second string, and no two characters in the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: If the two strings are not of the same length, they cannot be isomorphic.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**: Create two dictionaries to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**: For each character pair in the two strings:\n   - If the character from the first string is already mapped to a different character in the second string, return False.\n   - If the character from the second string is already mapped to a different character in the first string, return False.\n   - Otherwise, record the mapping in both dictionaries.\n\n4. **Return True**: If all character pairs are consistent with the one-to-one mapping, return True.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code to check if the given strings \"dqld\" and \"xqgx\" are isomorphic.\n\n```python\ndef are_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    mapping_s1_to_s2 = {}\n    mapping_s2_to_s1 = {}\n    \n    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if char1 in mapping_s1_to_s2:\n            if mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] != char2:\n                return False\n        if char2 in mapping_s2_to_s1:\n            if mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] != char1:\n                return False\n        \n        mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2\n        mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1\n    \n    return True\n\nresult = are_isomorphic(\"dqld\", \"xqgx\")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will determine if the two strings are isomorphic and print the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and determined that the strings \"dqld\" and \"xqgx\" are isomorphic. This means there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the two strings, satisfying the conditions for isomorphism.\n\n<<<True>>>"
