    "To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between every character of the first string to the second string. This means that each character in the first string can be replaced to get the second string, and no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: If the two strings have different lengths, they cannot be isomorphic.\n\n2. **Create Mappings**: We need to create two dictionaries (or hash maps):\n   - One to map characters from the first string to the second string.\n   - Another to map characters from the second string to the first string.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**: For each character pair in the two strings:\n   - Check if the current character from the first string is already mapped to a character in the second string. If it is, ensure it maps to the current character from the second string.\n   - Similarly, check if the current character from the second string is already mapped to a character in the first string. If it is, ensure it maps to the current character from the first string.\n   - If any of these checks fail, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n4. **Return Result**: If all character pairs satisfy the mapping condition, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine if the given strings \"mvqat\" and \"kewog\" are isomorphic.\n\n```python\ndef are_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    map_s1_to_s2 = {}\n    map_s2_to_s1 = {}\n    \n    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if char1 in map_s1_to_s2:\n            if map_s1_to_s2[char1] != char2:\n                return False\n        else:\n            map_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2\n        \n        if char2 in map_s2_to_s1:\n            if map_s2_to_s1[char2] != char1:\n                return False\n        else:\n            map_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1\n    \n    return True\n\n# Test the function with the given strings\nresult = are_isomorphic(\"mvqat\", \"kewog\")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to see if the strings \"mvqat\" and \"kewog\" are isomorphic.",
    "The code execution indicates that the strings \"mvqat\" and \"kewog\" are isomorphic. This means that there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the two strings, and each character in \"mvqat\" can be replaced to get \"kewog\" while preserving the order of characters.\n\n<<<True>>>"
