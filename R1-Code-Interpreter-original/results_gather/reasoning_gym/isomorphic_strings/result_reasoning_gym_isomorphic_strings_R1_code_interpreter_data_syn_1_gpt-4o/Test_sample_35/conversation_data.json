    "To determine if two strings `ss` and `cc` are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between every character of `ss` to every character of `cc`. This means:\n\n1. Each character in `ss` can be replaced by a character in `cc` such that the entire string `ss` transforms into `cc`.\n2. No two different characters in `ss` map to the same character in `cc`.\n3. The order of characters must be preserved.\n\nTo implement this, we can use two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings from `ss` to `cc` and vice versa. We will iterate through the characters of both strings simultaneously and check the mappings:\n\n- If a character from `ss` is already mapped to a different character in `cc`, return False.\n- If a character from `cc` is already mapped to a different character in `ss`, return False.\n- Otherwise, establish the mapping in both dictionaries.\n\nLet's write the code to check if the strings are isomorphic:\n\n```python\ndef are_isomorphic(s, t):\n    if len(s) != len(t):\n        return False\n    \n    mapping_s_to_t = {}\n    mapping_t_to_s = {}\n    \n    for char_s, char_t in zip(s, t):\n        if char_s in mapping_s_to_t:\n            if mapping_s_to_t[char_s] != char_t:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s_to_t[char_s] = char_t\n        \n        if char_t in mapping_t_to_s:\n            if mapping_t_to_s[char_t] != char_s:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_t_to_s[char_t] = char_s\n    \n    return True\n\n# Example strings\nss = \"egg\"\ncc = \"add\"\n\n# Check if they are isomorphic\nresult = are_isomorphic(ss, cc)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will determine if the strings `ss` and `cc` are isomorphic and print the result. Let's execute the code to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned `True`, indicating that the strings \"egg\" and \"add\" are isomorphic. This means that each character in \"egg\" can be replaced to get \"add\" while preserving the order and ensuring a one-to-one mapping.\n\nNow, let's apply the same logic to the strings `ss` and `cc` provided in your question. Since the code has already been tested with an example, we can directly use it to check the isomorphism of `ss` and `cc`.\n\n```python\n# Given strings\nss = \"ss\"\ncc = \"cc\"\n\n# Check if they are isomorphic\nresult = are_isomorphic(ss, cc)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine if the strings `ss` and `cc` are isomorphic.",
    "The error indicates that the function `are_isomorphic` is not defined in the current code block. This happened because the function definition was not included in the second code block.
