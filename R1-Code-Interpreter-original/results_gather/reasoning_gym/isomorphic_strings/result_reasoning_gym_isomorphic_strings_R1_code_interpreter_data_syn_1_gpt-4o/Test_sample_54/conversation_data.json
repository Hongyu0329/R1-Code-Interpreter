    "To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between every character of the first string to the second string. This means that each character in the first string can be replaced to get the second string, and no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We need to iterate through both strings simultaneously.\n2. We will use two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings:\n   - One dictionary to map characters from the first string to the second string.\n   - Another dictionary to map characters from the second string to the first string.\n3. As we iterate, we will check:\n   - If a character from the first string is already mapped to a different character in the second string.\n   - If a character from the second string is already mapped to a different character in the first string.\n4. If any of these conditions are violated, the strings are not isomorphic.\n5. If we complete the iteration without any violations, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\ndef are_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    mapping_s1_to_s2 = {}\n    mapping_s2_to_s1 = {}\n    \n    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if char1 in mapping_s1_to_s2:\n            if mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] != char2:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2\n        \n        if char2 in mapping_s2_to_s1:\n            if mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] != char1:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1\n    \n    return True\n\n# Test the function with the given strings\ns1 = \"gg\"\ns2 = \"sz\"\nresult = are_isomorphic(s1, s2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if the strings \"gg\" and \"sz\" are isomorphic.",
    "The code execution indicates that the strings \"gg\" and \"sz\" are not isomorphic, which aligns with the logic we implemented. Here's the reasoning:\n\n- The first string \"gg\" has two identical characters 'g'.\n- The second string \"sz\" has two different characters 's' and 'z'.\n- For the strings to be isomorphic, each 'g' in the first string should map to the same character in the second string. However, in this case, 'g' would need to map to both 's' and 'z', which violates the one-to-one mapping rule.\n\nTherefore, the strings \"gg\" and \"sz\" are not isomorphic.\n\n<<<False>>>"
