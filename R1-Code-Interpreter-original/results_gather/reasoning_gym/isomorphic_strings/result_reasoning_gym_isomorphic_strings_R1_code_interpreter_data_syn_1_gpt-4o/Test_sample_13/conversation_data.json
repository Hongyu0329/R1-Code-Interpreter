    "To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between every character of the first string to the second string. This means:\n\n1. Each character in the first string can be replaced to get the second string.\n2. No two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n3. The order of characters must be preserved.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n- We will iterate through both strings simultaneously.\n- We will use two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings:\n  - One for mapping characters from the first string to the second string.\n  - Another for mapping characters from the second string to the first string.\n- As we iterate, we will check:\n  - If a character from the first string is already mapped to a different character in the second string.\n  - If a character from the second string is already mapped to a different character in the first string.\n- If any of these conditions are violated, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef are_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n\n    mapping_s1_to_s2 = {}\n    mapping_s2_to_s1 = {}\n\n    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if char1 in mapping_s1_to_s2:\n            if mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] != char2:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2\n\n        if char2 in mapping_s2_to_s1:\n            if mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] != char1:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1\n\n    return True\n\ns1 = \"uwdap\"\ns2 = \"ajemq\"\nprint(are_isomorphic(s1, s2))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if the strings \"uwdap\" and \"ajemq\" are isomorphic.",
    "The code execution indicates that the strings \"uwdap\" and \"ajemq\" are isomorphic. This means there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the two strings, and the order of characters is preserved.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
