    "To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between every character of the first string to the second string. This means that each character in the first string can be replaced to get the second string, and no two characters in the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We need to iterate through both strings simultaneously.\n2. We will use two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings:\n   - One dictionary to map characters from the first string to the second string.\n   - Another dictionary to map characters from the second string to the first string.\n3. For each character pair from both strings:\n   - If the character from the first string is already mapped to a different character in the second string, return False.\n   - If the character from the second string is already mapped to a different character in the first string, return False.\n   - Otherwise, add the mapping to both dictionaries.\n4. If we successfully iterate through both strings without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code to check if the strings \"ybb\" and \"ytm\" are isomorphic.\n\n```python\ndef are_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    mapping_s1_to_s2 = {}\n    mapping_s2_to_s1 = {}\n    \n    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if char1 in mapping_s1_to_s2:\n            if mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] != char2:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2\n        \n        if char2 in mapping_s2_to_s1:\n            if mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] != char1:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1\n    \n    return True\n\nresult = are_isomorphic(\"ybb\", \"ytm\")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if the strings \"ybb\" and \"ytm\" are isomorphic.",
    "The code execution indicates that the strings \"ybb\" and \"ytm\" are not isomorphic. This result is based on the logic that checks for a one-to-one character mapping between the two strings. \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- The first character 'y' in \"ybb\" maps to 'y' in \"ytm\".\n- The second character 'b' in \"ybb\" maps to 't' in \"ytm\".\n- The third character 'b' in \"ybb\" should also map to 't' in \"ytm\" for the strings to be isomorphic.\n\nHowever, if there was any inconsistency in the mapping, such as 'b' mapping to a different character than 't', the strings would not be isomorphic. In this case, the mapping is consistent, but the code output is False, indicating that the logic correctly identifies that the strings are not isomorphic due to the constraints of the problem.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
