    "To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between every character of the first string to the second string. This means that each character in the first string can be replaced to get the second string, and no two characters in the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Check if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If not, they cannot be isomorphic.\n2. Create two dictionaries to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n3. Iterate through the characters of both strings simultaneously.\n4. For each character pair, check if:\n   - The character from the first string is already mapped to a different character in the second string.\n   - The character from the second string is already mapped to a different character in the first string.\n5. If any of the above conditions are true, the strings are not isomorphic.\n6. If the loop completes without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\ndef are_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    mapping_s1_to_s2 = {}\n    mapping_s2_to_s1 = {}\n    \n    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if char1 in mapping_s1_to_s2:\n            if mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] != char2:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2\n        \n        if char2 in mapping_s2_to_s1:\n            if mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] != char1:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1\n    \n    return True\n\n# Test the function with the given strings\ns1 = \"waq\"\ns2 = \"hru\"\nresult = are_isomorphic(s1, s2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if the strings \"waq\" and \"hru\" are isomorphic.",
    "The code execution indicates that the strings \"waq\" and \"hru\" are isomorphic, as the function returned `True`. This means that there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the two strings, satisfying the conditions for isomorphism.\n\n<<<True>>>"
