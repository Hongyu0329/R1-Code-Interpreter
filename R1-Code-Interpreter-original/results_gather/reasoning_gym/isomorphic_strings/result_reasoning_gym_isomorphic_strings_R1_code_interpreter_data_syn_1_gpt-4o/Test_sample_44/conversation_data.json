    "To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. This means that each character in the first string can be replaced by a character in the second string, and vice versa, without any conflicts.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: First, we need to ensure that both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**: We will create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**: We will iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously. For each pair of characters, we will:\n   - Check if the character from the first string is already mapped to a character in the second string. If it is, ensure it maps to the current character from the second string.\n   - Check if the character from the second string is already mapped to a character in the first string. If it is, ensure it maps to the current character from the first string.\n   - If neither character is mapped, create a new mapping in both dictionaries.\n\n4. **Check for Conflicts**: If at any point there is a conflict in the mapping (i.e., a character is mapped to two different characters), the strings are not isomorphic.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine if the given strings \"nwswwz\" and \"xdyddk\" are isomorphic.\n\n```python\ndef are_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    mapping_s1_to_s2 = {}\n    mapping_s2_to_s1 = {}\n    \n    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if char1 in mapping_s1_to_s2:\n            if mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] != char2:\n                return False\n        if char2 in mapping_s2_to_s1:\n            if mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] != char1:\n                return False\n        \n        mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2\n        mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1\n    \n    return True\n\n# Test the function with the given strings\nresult = are_isomorphic(\"nwswwz\", \"xdyddk\")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine if the strings are isomorphic.",
    "The code execution indicates that the strings \"nwswwz\" and \"xdyddk\" are isomorphic. This means that there is a consistent one-to-one mapping between the characters of the two strings without any conflicts.\n\n<<<True>>>"
