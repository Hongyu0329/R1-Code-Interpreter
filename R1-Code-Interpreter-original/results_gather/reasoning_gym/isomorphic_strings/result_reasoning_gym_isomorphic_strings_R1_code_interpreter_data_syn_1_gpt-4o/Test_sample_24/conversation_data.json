    "To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between every character of the first string to the second string. This means:\n\n1. Each character in the first string can be replaced to get the second string.\n2. No two characters in the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n3. The order of characters must be preserved.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n- We will iterate through both strings simultaneously.\n- We will use two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings:\n  - One dictionary to map characters from the first string to the second string.\n  - Another dictionary to map characters from the second string to the first string.\n- For each character pair, we will check:\n  - If the character from the first string is already mapped to a different character in the second string.\n  - If the character from the second string is already mapped to a different character in the first string.\n- If any of these conditions are violated, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\ndef are_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    mapping_s1_to_s2 = {}\n    mapping_s2_to_s1 = {}\n    \n    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if char1 in mapping_s1_to_s2:\n            if mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] != char2:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2\n        \n        if char2 in mapping_s2_to_s1:\n            if mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] != char1:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1\n    \n    return True\n\ns1 = \"hwibpogtd\"\ns2 = \"usqtrafwh\"\nprint(are_isomorphic(s1, s2))\n```\n\nThis code will determine if the two strings \"hwibpogtd\" and \"usqtrafwh\" are isomorphic. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is `True`. This means that the two strings \"hwibpogtd\" and \"usqtrafwh\" are isomorphic. Each character in the first string can be uniquely mapped to a character in the second string, preserving the order and ensuring no two characters map to the same character.\n\n<<<True>>>"
