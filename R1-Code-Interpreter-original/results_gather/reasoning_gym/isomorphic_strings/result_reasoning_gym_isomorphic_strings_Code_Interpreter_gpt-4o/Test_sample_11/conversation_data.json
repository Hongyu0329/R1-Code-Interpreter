    "\nassistant > To determine if the two strings \"z\" and \"i\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the two strings. Since both strings have only one character, they can be mapped to each other directly.\n\nLet's evaluate this: \n\n- The character 'z' in the first string can be replaced with 'i' in the second string.\n- There are no other characters to consider, so the mapping is valid.\n\nTherefore, the strings \"z\" and \"i\" are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
