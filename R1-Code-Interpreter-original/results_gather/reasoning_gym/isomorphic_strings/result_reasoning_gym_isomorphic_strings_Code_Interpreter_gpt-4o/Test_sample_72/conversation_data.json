    "\nassistant > To determine if the two strings \"ll\" and \"nr\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. \n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create two dictionaries to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n2. Iterate through the characters of both strings simultaneously.\n3. For each pair of characters, check if:\n   - The character from the first string is already mapped to a different character in the second string.\n   - The character from the second string is already mapped to a different character in the first string.\n4. If any of the above conditions are true, the strings are not isomorphic.\n5. If the loop completes without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's implement this logic in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef are_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    mapping_s1_to_s2 = {}\n    mapping_s2_to_s1 = {}\n    \n    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if (char1 in mapping_s1_to_s2 and mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] != char2) or \\\n           (char2 in mapping_s2_to_s1 and mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] != char1):\n            return False\n        mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2\n        mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1\n    \n    return True\n\n# Check if the strings \"ll\" and \"nr\" are isomorphic\nresult = are_isomorphic(\"ll\", \"nr\")\nresult\nassistant > The two strings \"ll\" and \"nr\" are not isomorphic.
