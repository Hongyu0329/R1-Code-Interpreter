    "\nassistant > To determine if the two strings \"hvmf\" and \"xtcj\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. This means that each character in the first string should map to a unique character in the second string, and vice versa.\n\nLet's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. Create two dictionaries to store the mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string and vice versa.\n2. Iterate through the characters of both strings simultaneously.\n3. For each pair of characters, check if there is a consistent mapping in both dictionaries.\n4. If any inconsistency is found, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\nLet's implement this logic in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef are_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    mapping_s1_to_s2 = {}\n    mapping_s2_to_s1 = {}\n    \n    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if char1 in mapping_s1_to_s2:\n            if mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] != char2:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2\n        \n        if char2 in mapping_s2_to_s1:\n            if mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] != char1:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1\n    \n    return True\n\n# Check if the strings \"hvmf\" and \"xtcj\" are isomorphic\nresult = are_isomorphic(\"hvmf\", \"xtcj\")\nresult\nassistant > The two strings \"hvmf\" and \"xtcj\" are isomorphic.\n\n<<<True>>>"
