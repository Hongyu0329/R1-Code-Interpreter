    "\nassistant > To determine if the two strings \"bwd\" and \"jsy\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. This means that each character in the first string can be replaced with a unique character in the second string, and vice versa.\n\nLet's check this condition: \n\n1. Create two dictionaries to map characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n2. Iterate through the characters of both strings simultaneously.\n3. For each pair of characters, check if they are already mapped in the dictionaries.\n4. If a character is already mapped to a different character, return False.\n5. If not, add the mapping to the dictionaries.\n6. If we complete the iteration without conflicts, return True.\n\nLet's implement this logic in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef are_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    # Dictionaries to store character mappings\n    map_s1_to_s2 = {}\n    map_s2_to_s1 = {}\n    \n    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        # Check if there is a conflicting mapping\n        if (char1 in map_s1_to_s2 and map_s1_to_s2[char1] != char2) or \\\n           (char2 in map_s2_to_s1 and map_s2_to_s1[char2] != char1):\n            return False\n        \n        # Add the mapping\n        map_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2\n        map_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1\n    \n    return True\n\n# Check if the strings \"bwd\" and \"jsy\" are isomorphic\nresult = are_isomorphic(\"bwd\", \"jsy\")\nresult\nassistant > The two strings \"bwd\" and \"jsy\" are isomorphic.
