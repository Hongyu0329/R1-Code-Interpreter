    "\nassistant > To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. This means that each character in the first string can be replaced by a unique character in the second string, and vice versa.\n\nLet's analyze the given strings \"j\" and \"a\":\n\n1. Both strings have a length of 1.\n2. The character 'j' in the first string can be mapped to the character 'a' in the second string.\n\nSince there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the two strings, they are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
