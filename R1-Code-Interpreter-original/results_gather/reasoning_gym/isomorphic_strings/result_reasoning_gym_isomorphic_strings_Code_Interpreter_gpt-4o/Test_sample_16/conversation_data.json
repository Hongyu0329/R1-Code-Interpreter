Let me explain the logic and provide the answer based on the algorithm.\n\nTo determine if the strings \"iiwrzjcar\" and \"ffunqiewn\" are isomorphic, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If not, they cannot be isomorphic.\n2. Create two dictionaries to map characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n3. Iterate through the characters of both strings simultaneously.\n4. For each pair of characters, check if there is a consistent mapping in both dictionaries.\n5. If any inconsistency is found, return False.\n6. If the loop completes without inconsistencies, return True.\n\nApplying this logic to the given strings, we find that they are isomorphic because each character in \"iiwrzjcar\" can be consistently mapped to a unique character in \"ffunqiewn\" and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
