    "\nassistant > To determine if the two strings \"lff\" and \"vzy\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. This means that each character in the first string can be replaced with a unique character in the second string, and vice versa.\n\nLet's analyze the strings:\n\n1. The first string is \"lff\".\n2. The second string is \"vzy\".\n\nWe will map each character from the first string to the second string and ensure that no two characters map to the same character unless they are the same character in the first string.\n\nLet's perform this check.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef are_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    # Create two dictionaries to store the mapping of characters\n    mapping_s1_to_s2 = {}\n    mapping_s2_to_s1 = {}\n    \n    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        # Check if there is a conflicting mapping\n        if (char1 in mapping_s1_to_s2 and mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] != char2) or \\\n           (char2 in mapping_s2_to_s1 and mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] != char1):\n            return False\n        \n        # Create the mapping\n        mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2\n        mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1\n    \n    return True\n\n# Check if the strings \"lff\" and \"vzy\" are isomorphic\nare_isomorphic(\"lff\", \"vzy\")\nassistant > The strings \"lff\" and \"vzy\" are not isomorphic.
