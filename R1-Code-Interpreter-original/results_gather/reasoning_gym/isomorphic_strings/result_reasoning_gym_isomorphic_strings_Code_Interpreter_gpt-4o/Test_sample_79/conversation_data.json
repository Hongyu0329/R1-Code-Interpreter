    "\nassistant > To determine if the two strings \"grsrc\" and \"hrlzv\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. This means that each character in the first string can be replaced with a unique character in the second string, and vice versa.\n\nLet's go through the process step-by-step:\n\n1. Create two dictionaries to store the mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string and vice versa.\n2. Iterate through the characters of both strings simultaneously.\n3. For each pair of characters, check if there is a consistent mapping in both dictionaries.\n4. If a mapping is inconsistent, return False.\n5. If we successfully iterate through both strings without inconsistencies, return True.\n\nLet's implement this logic in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef are_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    # Dictionaries to store character mappings\n    mapping_s1_to_s2 = {}\n    mapping_s2_to_s1 = {}\n    \n    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        # Check mapping from s1 to s2\n        if char1 in mapping_s1_to_s2:\n            if mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] != char2:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2\n        \n        # Check mapping from s2 to s1\n        if char2 in mapping_s2_to_s1:\n            if mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] != char1:\n                return False\n        else:\n            mapping_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1\n    \n    return True\n\n# Test the function with the given strings\ns1 = \"grsrc\"\ns2 = \"hrlzv\"\nresult = are_isomorphic(s1, s2)\nresult\nassistant > The two strings \"grsrc\" and \"hrlzv\" are not isomorphic.
