    "\nassistant > To determine if the two strings \"o\" and \"m\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the two strings. Since both strings have only one character, they can be considered isomorphic because the single character in each string can map to the other.\n\nTherefore, the strings \"o\" and \"m\" are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
