    "To determine if the two strings \"twmzjqmjd\" and \"bzqnjwqte\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - Both strings must be of the same length to be isomorphic. \n   - \"twmzjqmjd\" has 9 characters, and \"bzqnjwqte\" also has 9 characters. \n   - Since the lengths are equal, we can proceed.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to create a mapping from each character in the first string to a character in the second string.\n   - We also need to ensure that no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Initialize two dictionaries: one for mapping characters from the first string to the second string (`map_s_to_t`), and another for mapping characters from the second string to the first string (`map_t_to_s`).\n   - Iterate through each character pair (c1, c2) from the two strings simultaneously.\n\n4. **Check and Update Mappings**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2):\n     - If c1 is already in `map_s_to_t`, check if `map_s_to_t[c1]` is equal to c2. If not, return False.\n     - If c2 is already in `map_t_to_s`, check if `map_t_to_s[c2]` is equal to c1. If not, return False.\n     - If c1 is not in `map_s_to_t` and c2 is not in `map_t_to_s`, add the mapping `c1 -> c2` in `map_s_to_t` and `c2 -> c1` in `map_t_to_s`.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - If we complete the iteration without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's apply this to the given strings:\n\n- t -> b\n- w -> z\n- m -> q\n- z -> n\n- j -> j\n- q -> w\n- m -> q (already mapped correctly)\n- j -> j (already mapped correctly)\n- d -> e\n\nAll mappings are consistent and no two characters map to the same character in the other string. Therefore, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
