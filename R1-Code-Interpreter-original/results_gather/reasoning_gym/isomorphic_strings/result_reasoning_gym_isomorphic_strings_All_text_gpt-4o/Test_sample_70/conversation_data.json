    "To determine if the two strings \"fifk\" and \"vzqg\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"fifk\" and \"vzqg\" have a length of 4, so we proceed.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one mapping between characters of the first string to the second string.\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps): one for mapping characters from the first string to the second, and another for mapping characters from the second string to the first. This ensures that no two characters map to the same character in either direction.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"fifk\" and c2 from \"vzqg\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string. If it is, ensure it maps to c2.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the first string. If it is, ensure it maps to c1.\n     - If either of these checks fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If neither character is mapped, create a new mapping from c1 to c2 and from c2 to c1.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For \"fifk\" and \"vzqg\":\n     - 'f' maps to 'v', and 'v' maps to 'f'.\n     - 'i' maps to 'z', and 'z' maps to 'i'.\n     - 'f' is already mapped to 'v', which is consistent.\n     - 'k' maps to 'g', and 'g' maps to 'k'.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - If we can iterate through all characters without conflicts in the mapping, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nSince all characters map consistently without conflicts, the strings \"fifk\" and \"vzqg\" are isomorphic.\n\n<<<True>>>"
