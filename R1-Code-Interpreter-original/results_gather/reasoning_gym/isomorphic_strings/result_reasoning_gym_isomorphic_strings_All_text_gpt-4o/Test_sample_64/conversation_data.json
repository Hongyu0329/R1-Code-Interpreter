    "To determine if the two strings \"krgbjh\" and \"redmkc\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between every character of the first string to the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"krgbjh\" and \"redmkc\" have a length of 6, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - Let's denote these dictionaries as `map_s1_to_s2` and `map_s2_to_s1`.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"krgbjh\" and c2 from \"redmkc\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already in `map_s1_to_s2`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_s1_to_s2[c1]` is equal to c2. If not, return False.\n     - If c1 is not in `map_s1_to_s2`, add the mapping `c1 -> c2`.\n     - Similarly, check if c2 is already in `map_s2_to_s1`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_s2_to_s1[c2]` is equal to c1. If not, return False.\n     - If c2 is not in `map_s2_to_s1`, add the mapping `c2 -> c1`.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For \"krgbjh\" and \"redmkc\":\n     - k -> r, r -> e, g -> d, b -> m, j -> k, h -> c\n     - Check reverse mapping:\n       - r -> k, e -> r, d -> g, m -> b, k -> j, c -> h\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - If all characters can be mapped consistently without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nSince all characters map correctly without any conflicts, the strings \"krgbjh\" and \"redmkc\" are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>."
