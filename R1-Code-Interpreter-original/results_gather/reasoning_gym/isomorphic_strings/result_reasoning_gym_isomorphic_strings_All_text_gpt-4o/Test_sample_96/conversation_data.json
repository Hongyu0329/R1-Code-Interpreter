    "To determine if the two strings \"fayh\" and \"imrg\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"fayh\" has a length of 4, and \"imrg\" also has a length of 4. So, they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one character mapping from the first string to the second string.\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps): one for mapping characters from \"fayh\" to \"imrg\" and another for mapping characters from \"imrg\" to \"fayh\". This ensures that no two characters map to the same character in either direction.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from \"fayh\" and \"imrg\":\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in \"imrg\". If it is, ensure it maps to c2.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in \"fayh\". If it is, ensure it maps to c1.\n     - If either of these checks fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If neither character is mapped, create a new mapping from c1 to c2 and from c2 to c1.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For \"fayh\" and \"imrg\":\n     - 'f' maps to 'i' and 'i' maps to 'f'.\n     - 'a' maps to 'm' and 'm' maps to 'a'.\n     - 'y' maps to 'r' and 'r' maps to 'y'.\n     - 'h' maps to 'g' and 'g' maps to 'h'.\n   - All mappings are consistent and unique, satisfying the isomorphic condition.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - If we complete the iteration without conflicts in the mappings, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied, the strings \"fayh\" and \"imrg\" are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>."
