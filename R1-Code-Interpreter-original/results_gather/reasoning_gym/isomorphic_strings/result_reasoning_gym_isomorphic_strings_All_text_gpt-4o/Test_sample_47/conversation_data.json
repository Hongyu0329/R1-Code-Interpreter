    "To determine if the two strings \"oql\" and \"vpn\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, check if the two strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"oql\" and \"vpn\" have a length of 3, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one character mapping from the first string to the second string.\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to keep track of the mappings:\n     - `map_s1_to_s2`: Maps characters from the first string (\"oql\") to the second string (\"vpn\").\n     - `map_s2_to_s1`: Maps characters from the second string (\"vpn\") to the first string (\"oql\").\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"oql\" and c2 from \"vpn\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already in `map_s1_to_s2`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_s1_to_s2[c1]` is equal to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c1 is not in `map_s1_to_s2`, add the mapping `c1 -> c2`.\n     - Similarly, check if c2 is already in `map_s2_to_s1`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_s2_to_s1[c2]` is equal to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c2 is not in `map_s2_to_s1`, add the mapping `c2 -> c1`.\n\n4. **Check for Conflicts**:\n   - If at any point there is a conflict in the mapping (i.e., a character maps to two different characters), the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n5. **Final Decision**:\n   - If we complete the iteration without finding any conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the strings \"oql\" and \"vpn\":\n\n- For the first pair ('o', 'v'):\n  - 'o' is not in `map_s1_to_s2`, and 'v' is not in `map_s2_to_s1`.\n  - Add 'o' -> 'v' to `map_s1_to_s2` and 'v' -> 'o' to `map_s2_to_s1`.\n\n- For the second pair ('q', 'p'):\n  - 'q' is not in `map_s1_to_s2`, and 'p' is not in `map_s2_to_s1`.\n  - Add 'q' -> 'p' to `map_s1_to_s2` and 'p' -> 'q' to `map_s2_to_s1`.\n\n- For the third pair ('l', 'n'):\n  - 'l' is not in `map_s1_to_s2`, and 'n' is not in `map_s2_to_s1`.\n  - Add 'l' -> 'n' to `map_s1_to_s2` and 'n' -> 'l' to `map_s2_to_s1`.\n\nSince there are no conflicts in the mappings, the strings \"oql\" and \"vpn\" are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
