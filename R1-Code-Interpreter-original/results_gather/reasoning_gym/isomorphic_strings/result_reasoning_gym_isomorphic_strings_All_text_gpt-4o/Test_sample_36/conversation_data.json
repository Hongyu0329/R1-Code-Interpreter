    "To determine if the two strings \"lptsugijp\" and \"ugtkshmzd\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both strings \"lptsugijp\" and \"ugtkshmzd\" have a length of 9, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - Let's denote these dictionaries as `map1` for mapping from \"lptsugijp\" to \"ugtkshmzd\" and `map2` for mapping from \"ugtkshmzd\" to \"lptsugijp\".\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"lptsugijp\" and c2 from \"ugtkshmzd\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already in `map1`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map1[c1]` is equal to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c1 is not in `map1`, add the mapping `map1[c1] = c2`.\n     - Similarly, check if c2 is already in `map2`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map2[c2]` is equal to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c2 is not in `map2`, add the mapping `map2[c2] = c1`.\n\n4. **Check Each Character Pair**:\n   - For the given strings:\n     - 'l' maps to 'u'\n     - 'p' maps to 'g'\n     - 't' maps to 't'\n     - 's' maps to 'k'\n     - 'u' maps to 's'\n     - 'g' maps to 'h'\n     - 'i' maps to 'm'\n     - 'j' maps to 'z'\n     - 'p' maps to 'd'\n   - Ensure that each mapping is consistent and no two characters map to the same character in the other string.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - If all character mappings are consistent and no conflicts are found, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nAfter performing these steps, we find that the strings \"lptsugijp\" and \"ugtkshmzd\" are isomorphic because each character in the first string consistently maps to a unique character in the second string, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
