    "To determine if the two strings \"dqld\" and \"xqgx\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"dqld\" and \"xqgx\" have a length of 4, so we proceed.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - Also, create a reverse mapping from characters in the second string to characters in the first string to ensure no two characters map to the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from the two strings:\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string.\n     - If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c1 is not mapped, check if c2 is already mapped to another character. If it is, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c2 is not mapped, create a new mapping from c1 to c2 and vice versa.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Mapping**:\n   - Pair 1: ('d', 'x')\n     - 'd' is not mapped yet, and 'x' is not mapped yet. Map 'd' to 'x' and 'x' to 'd'.\n   - Pair 2: ('q', 'q')\n     - 'q' is not mapped yet, and 'q' is not mapped yet. Map 'q' to 'q'.\n   - Pair 3: ('l', 'g')\n     - 'l' is not mapped yet, and 'g' is not mapped yet. Map 'l' to 'g' and 'g' to 'l'.\n   - Pair 4: ('d', 'x')\n     - 'd' is already mapped to 'x', and 'x' is already mapped to 'd'. This is consistent.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - All character mappings are consistent, and no two characters map to the same character inappropriately.\n   - Therefore, the strings \"dqld\" and \"xqgx\" are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
