    "To determine if the two strings \"iiwrzjcar\" and \"ffunqiewn\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between every character in the first string to a character in the second string, and vice versa. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - Both strings must be of the same length to be isomorphic. \n   - \"iiwrzjcar\" has 9 characters, and \"ffunqiewn\" also has 9 characters. \n   - Since the lengths are equal, we can proceed.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to create a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - We also need to ensure that no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Initialize two dictionaries: `map_s1_to_s2` for mapping characters from the first string to the second, and `map_s2_to_s1` for the reverse mapping.\n   - Iterate through each character pair (c1, c2) from the two strings simultaneously.\n\n4. **Mapping Validation**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2):\n     - Check if c1 is already in `map_s1_to_s2`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_s1_to_s2[c1]` is equal to c2. If not, return False.\n     - If c1 is not in `map_s1_to_s2`, add the mapping `c1 -> c2`.\n     - Similarly, check if c2 is already in `map_s2_to_s1`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_s2_to_s1[c2]` is equal to c1. If not, return False.\n     - If c2 is not in `map_s2_to_s1`, add the mapping `c2 -> c1`.\n\n5. **Character Pair Analysis**:\n   - Pair (i, f): Map i -> f and f -> i.\n   - Pair (i, f): i is already mapped to f, and f is mapped to i, so continue.\n   - Pair (w, u): Map w -> u and u -> w.\n   - Pair (r, n): Map r -> n and n -> r.\n   - Pair (z, q): Map z -> q and q -> z.\n   - Pair (j, i): Map j -> i and i -> j.\n   - Pair (c, e): Map c -> e and e -> c.\n   - Pair (a, w): Map a -> w and w -> a.\n   - Pair (r, n): r is already mapped to n, and n is mapped to r, so continue.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - All character pairs have been successfully mapped without conflicts.\n   - Therefore, the strings \"iiwrzjcar\" and \"ffunqiewn\" are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>."
