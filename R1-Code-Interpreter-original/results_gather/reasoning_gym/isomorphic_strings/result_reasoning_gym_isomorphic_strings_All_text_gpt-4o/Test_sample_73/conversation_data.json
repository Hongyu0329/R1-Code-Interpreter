    "To determine if the two strings \"pwzgjwj\" and \"mkgoqeq\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"pwzgjwj\" and \"mkgoqeq\" have a length of 7, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from the strings \"pwzgjwj\" and \"mkgoqeq\":\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string. If it is, ensure it maps to c2.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the first string. If it is, ensure it maps to c1.\n     - If either of these checks fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If both checks pass, add the mapping c1 -> c2 and c2 -> c1 to the respective dictionaries.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - Let's map each character:\n     - 'p' -> 'm'\n     - 'w' -> 'k'\n     - 'z' -> 'g'\n     - 'g' -> 'o'\n     - 'j' -> 'q'\n     - 'w' -> 'k' (already mapped correctly)\n     - 'j' -> 'q' (already mapped correctly)\n\n5. **Check for Conflicts**:\n   - Ensure no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string and vice versa.\n   - In this case, all mappings are consistent and there are no conflicts.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all characters map correctly without conflicts, the strings \"pwzgjwj\" and \"mkgoqeq\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
