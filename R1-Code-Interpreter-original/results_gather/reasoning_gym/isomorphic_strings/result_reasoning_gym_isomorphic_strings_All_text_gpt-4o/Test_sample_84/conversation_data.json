    "To determine if the two strings \"dhlaqsstsm\" and \"nevkoffpsy\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"dhlaqsstsm\" and \"nevkoffpsy\" have a length of 10, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from the strings:\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string. If it is, ensure it maps to c2.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the first string. If it is, ensure it maps to c1.\n     - If either of these checks fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If both checks pass, add the mapping c1 -> c2 and c2 -> c1 to the respective dictionaries.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - Let's map the characters:\n     - 'd' -> 'n'\n     - 'h' -> 'e'\n     - 'l' -> 'v'\n     - 'a' -> 'k'\n     - 'q' -> 'o'\n     - 's' -> 'f'\n     - 't' -> 'p'\n     - 's' is already mapped to 'f', so 's' -> 'f' is consistent.\n     - 'm' -> 'y'\n   - All mappings are consistent and no two characters map to the same character in the other string.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all characters map consistently and uniquely, the strings \"dhlaqsstsm\" and \"nevkoffpsy\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
