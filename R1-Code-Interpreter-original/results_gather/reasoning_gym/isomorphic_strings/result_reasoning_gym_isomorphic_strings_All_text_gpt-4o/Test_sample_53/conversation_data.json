    "To determine if the two strings \"prmtt\" and \"otqpw\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"prmtt\" and \"otqpw\" have a length of 5, so we proceed.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - Also, create a reverse mapping from characters in the second string to characters in the first string to ensure no two characters map to the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - For each character in the first string, check if it has already been mapped:\n     - If it has been mapped, ensure it maps to the current character in the second string.\n     - If it hasn't been mapped, create a new mapping.\n   - Simultaneously, ensure that the reverse mapping is consistent.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Mapping**:\n   - 'p' in \"prmtt\" should map to 'o' in \"otqpw\".\n   - 'r' in \"prmtt\" should map to 't' in \"otqpw\".\n   - 'm' in \"prmtt\" should map to 'q' in \"otqpw\".\n   - 't' in \"prmtt\" should map to 'p' in \"otqpw\".\n   - The second 't' in \"prmtt\" should also map to 'p' in \"otqpw\", which is consistent with the previous mapping.\n\n5. **Reverse Mapping Check**:\n   - 'o' in \"otqpw\" maps back to 'p' in \"prmtt\".\n   - 't' in \"otqpw\" maps back to 'r' in \"prmtt\".\n   - 'q' in \"otqpw\" maps back to 'm' in \"prmtt\".\n   - 'p' in \"otqpw\" maps back to 't' in \"prmtt\".\n   - 'w' in \"otqpw\" should map back to a character in \"prmtt\", but since 'w' is not in the mapping, it indicates a new character.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - All characters in \"prmtt\" map uniquely to characters in \"otqpw\" and vice versa.\n   - The mapping is consistent and no two characters map to the same character in either direction.\n\nTherefore, the strings \"prmtt\" and \"otqpw\" are isomorphic.\n\n<<<True>>>"
