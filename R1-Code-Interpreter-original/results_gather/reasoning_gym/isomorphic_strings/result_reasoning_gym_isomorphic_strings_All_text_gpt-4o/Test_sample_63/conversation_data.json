    "To determine if the two strings \"lycayohcrt\" and \"klimdvripl\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - Both strings must be of the same length to be isomorphic. \n   - \"lycayohcrt\" has 10 characters, and \"klimdvripl\" also has 10 characters. \n   - Since the lengths are equal, we can proceed.\n\n2. **Initialize Mappings**:\n   - We need two dictionaries (or hash maps) to keep track of the mappings:\n     - `map_s1_to_s2` for mapping characters from the first string to the second string.\n     - `map_s2_to_s1` for mapping characters from the second string to the first string.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map Characters**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from the two strings:\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped in `map_s1_to_s2`:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, return False.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped in `map_s2_to_s1`:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c1. If not, return False.\n     - If neither character is mapped, create a new mapping in both dictionaries.\n\n4. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Let's map each character step by step:\n     - 'l' -> 'k'\n     - 'y' -> 'l'\n     - 'c' -> 'i'\n     - 'a' -> 'm'\n     - 'y' -> 'd' (This is a conflict because 'y' was previously mapped to 'l')\n     - At this point, we can conclude that the strings are not isomorphic because 'y' cannot map to both 'l' and 'd'.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since we found a conflict in the mapping, the strings \"lycayohcrt\" and \"klimdvripl\" are not isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
