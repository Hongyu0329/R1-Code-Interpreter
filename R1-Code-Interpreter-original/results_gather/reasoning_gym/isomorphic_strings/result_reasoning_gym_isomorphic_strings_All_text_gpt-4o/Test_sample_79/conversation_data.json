    "To determine if the two strings \"grsrc\" and \"hrlzv\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"grsrc\" and \"hrlzv\" have a length of 5, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings from characters in the first string to characters in the second string and vice versa.\n   - Let's denote the first string as `s1 = \"grsrc\"` and the second string as `s2 = \"hrlzv\"`.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character in the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters `(c1, c2)` from `s1` and `s2`:\n     - Check if `c1` is already mapped to a character in `s2`. If it is, ensure it maps to `c2`.\n     - Check if `c2` is already mapped to a character in `s1`. If it is, ensure it maps to `c1`.\n     - If either of these checks fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If both checks pass, record the mapping `c1 -> c2` and `c2 -> c1`.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For the first pair `(g, h)`: \n     - Map `g` to `h` and `h` to `g`.\n   - For the second pair `(r, r)`:\n     - Map `r` to `r` and `r` to `r`.\n   - For the third pair `(s, l)`:\n     - Map `s` to `l` and `l` to `s`.\n   - For the fourth pair `(r, z)`:\n     - `r` is already mapped to `r`, but now it needs to map to `z`, which is a conflict.\n     - This means the mapping is inconsistent, and the strings cannot be isomorphic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is a conflict in the mapping for the character `r`, the strings \"grsrc\" and \"hrlzv\" are not isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
