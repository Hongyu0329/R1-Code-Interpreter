    "To determine if the two strings \"rrl\" and \"nio\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, check if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If they are not, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"rrl\" and \"nio\" have a length of 3, so we proceed.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to track the mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string and vice versa.\n   - Let's denote the first string as `s1 = \"rrl\"` and the second string as `s2 = \"nio\"`.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character in the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters `(c1, c2)` from `s1` and `s2`:\n     - Check if `c1` is already mapped to a character in `s2`. If it is, ensure it maps to `c2`.\n     - Check if `c2` is already mapped to a character in `s1`. If it is, ensure it maps to `c1`.\n     - If either of these checks fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If `c1` is not mapped to any character, map it to `c2`.\n     - If `c2` is not mapped to any character, map it to `c1`.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For the first pair `(r, n)`: \n     - `r` is not mapped yet, so map `r` to `n`.\n     - `n` is not mapped yet, so map `n` to `r`.\n   - For the second pair `(r, i)`:\n     - `r` is already mapped to `n`, but now it needs to map to `i`, which is a conflict.\n     - Therefore, the mapping fails here, indicating the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is a conflict in mapping `r` to two different characters (`n` and `i`), the strings \"rrl\" and \"nio\" are not isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
