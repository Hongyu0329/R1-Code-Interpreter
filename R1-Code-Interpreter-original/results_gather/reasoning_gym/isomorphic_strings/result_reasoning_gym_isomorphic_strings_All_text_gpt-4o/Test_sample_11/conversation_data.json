    "To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to ensure that there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Let's analyze the given strings step by step:\n\n1. **Input Strings**: We have two strings, \"z\" and \"i\".\n\n2. **Length Check**: First, we check if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If they are not, they cannot be isomorphic. In this case, both strings have a length of 1, so they pass this check.\n\n3. **Character Mapping**: We need to establish a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string. We will use two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings:\n   - `map_s_to_t`: Maps characters from the first string to the second string.\n   - `map_t_to_s`: Maps characters from the second string to the first string.\n\n4. **Iterate and Map**: We iterate through each character in the strings:\n   - For the first (and only) character pair ('z', 'i'):\n     - Check if 'z' is already mapped to a character in `map_s_to_t`. If it is, it should map to 'i'. If it maps to a different character, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - Check if 'i' is already mapped to a character in `map_t_to_s`. If it is, it should map to 'z'. If it maps to a different character, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If neither character is mapped yet, we add the mapping 'z' -> 'i' in `map_s_to_t` and 'i' -> 'z' in `map_t_to_s`.\n\n5. **Final Check**: After processing all character pairs, if no conflicts were found in the mappings, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nIn this case, since both strings have only one character and they map to each other without any conflicts, the strings \"z\" and \"i\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
