    "To determine if the two strings \"ckhdqggke\" and \"zchjlttcp\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between every character in the first string to a character in the second string, and vice versa. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - Both strings must be of the same length to be isomorphic. \n   - \"ckhdqggke\" has 9 characters, and \"zchjlttcp\" also has 9 characters. \n   - Since the lengths are equal, we can proceed.\n\n2. **Create Mappings**:\n   - We need to create two mappings: one from the first string to the second and another from the second string to the first.\n   - This ensures that each character in one string maps to exactly one character in the other string and vice versa.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map Characters**:\n   - Initialize two dictionaries: `map1` for mapping characters from \"ckhdqggke\" to \"zchjlttcp\" and `map2` for the reverse.\n   - Iterate through each character pair (c1, c2) from the two strings:\n     - For the first pair (c1='c', c2='z'):\n       - Check if 'c' is already mapped in `map1`. If not, map 'c' to 'z'.\n       - Check if 'z' is already mapped in `map2`. If not, map 'z' to 'c'.\n     - For the second pair (c1='k', c2='c'):\n       - Check if 'k' is already mapped in `map1`. If not, map 'k' to 'c'.\n       - Check if 'c' is already mapped in `map2`. If not, map 'c' to 'k'.\n     - Continue this process for each character pair:\n       - (c1='h', c2='h'): map 'h' to 'h' and 'h' to 'h'.\n       - (c1='d', c2='j'): map 'd' to 'j' and 'j' to 'd'.\n       - (c1='q', c2='l'): map 'q' to 'l' and 'l' to 'q'.\n       - (c1='g', c2='t'): map 'g' to 't' and 't' to 'g'.\n       - (c1='g', c2='t'): 'g' is already mapped to 't' and 't' to 'g', so continue.\n       - (c1='k', c2='c'): 'k' is already mapped to 'c' and 'c' to 'k', so continue.\n       - (c1='e', c2='p'): map 'e' to 'p' and 'p' to 'e'.\n\n4. **Verify Mappings**:\n   - After iterating through all character pairs, ensure that the mappings are consistent.\n   - If any character in one string maps to more than one character in the other string, or vice versa, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - In this case, all mappings are consistent and one-to-one.\n   - Therefore, the strings \"ckhdqggke\" and \"zchjlttcp\" are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>."
