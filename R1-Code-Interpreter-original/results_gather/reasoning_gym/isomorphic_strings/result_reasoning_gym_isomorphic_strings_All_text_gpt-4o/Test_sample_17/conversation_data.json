    "To determine if the two strings \"pz\" and \"ow\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure that both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"pz\" has a length of 2, and \"ow\" also has a length of 2. Since they are the same length, we can proceed.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - Also, create a reverse mapping from characters in the second string to characters in the first string to ensure that no two characters map to the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - For each character in the first string, check if it has already been mapped to a character in the second string.\n   - Similarly, check if the character in the second string has already been mapped from a character in the first string.\n\n4. **Mapping Validation**:\n   - For the first character 'p' in \"pz\", map it to 'o' in \"ow\".\n   - For the second character 'z' in \"pz\", map it to 'w' in \"ow\".\n   - Ensure that 'o' is not already mapped from a different character and 'w' is not already mapped from a different character.\n\n5. **Check Consistency**:\n   - Ensure that the mapping is consistent throughout the strings. If any inconsistency is found, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n6. **Final Decision**:\n   - If all characters can be consistently mapped from the first string to the second string and vice versa, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nIn this case, the mappings are:\n- 'p' -> 'o'\n- 'z' -> 'w'\n\nAnd the reverse mappings are:\n- 'o' -> 'p'\n- 'w' -> 'z'\n\nSince all mappings are consistent and no two characters map to the same character, the strings \"pz\" and \"ow\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
