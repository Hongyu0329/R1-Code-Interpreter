    "To determine if the two strings \"endzfo\" and \"aocifv\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"endzfo\" and \"aocifv\" have a length of 6, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from \"endzfo\" and \"aocifv\":\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string. If it is, ensure it maps to c2.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the first string. If it is, ensure it maps to c1.\n     - If either of these checks fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If both checks pass, add the mapping c1 -> c2 and c2 -> c1 to the respective dictionaries.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - e -> a, a -> e\n   - n -> o, o -> n\n   - d -> c, c -> d\n   - z -> i, i -> z\n   - f -> f, f -> f (a character can map to itself)\n   - o -> v, v -> o\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - If all character pairs are successfully mapped without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nSince all character mappings are consistent and there are no conflicts, the strings \"endzfo\" and \"aocifv\" are isomorphic.\n\n<<<True>>>"
