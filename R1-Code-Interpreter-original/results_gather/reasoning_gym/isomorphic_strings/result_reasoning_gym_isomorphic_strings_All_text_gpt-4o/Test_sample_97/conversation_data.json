    "To determine if the two strings \"bhgpiytca\" and \"rtpsijgqz\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both strings \"bhgpiytca\" and \"rtpsijgqz\" have a length of 9, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to map characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - This ensures that each character in the first string maps to exactly one character in the second string and vice versa.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (char1 from the first string and char2 from the second string):\n     - Check if char1 is already mapped to a different character than char2 in the first dictionary.\n     - Check if char2 is already mapped to a different character than char1 in the second dictionary.\n     - If either condition is true, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - Otherwise, add the mapping char1 -> char2 in the first dictionary and char2 -> char1 in the second dictionary.\n\n4. **Final Check**:\n   - If we complete the iteration without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given strings:\n\n- Initialize two empty dictionaries: `map1` for \"bhgpiytca\" to \"rtpsijgqz\" and `map2` for \"rtpsijgqz\" to \"bhgpiytca\".\n- Iterate through each character pair:\n  - 'b' -> 'r': Add to both maps.\n  - 'h' -> 't': Add to both maps.\n  - 'g' -> 'p': Add to both maps.\n  - 'p' -> 's': Add to both maps.\n  - 'i' -> 'i': Add to both maps.\n  - 'y' -> 'j': Add to both maps.\n  - 't' -> 'g': Add to both maps.\n  - 'c' -> 'q': Add to both maps.\n  - 'a' -> 'z': Add to both maps.\n\n- No conflicts were found during the mapping process, so the strings are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
