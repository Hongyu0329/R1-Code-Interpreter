    "To determine if the two strings \"lpfjplcto\" and \"javhaftdl\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - Both strings must be of the same length to be isomorphic. \n   - \"lpfjplcto\" has 9 characters, and \"javhaftdl\" also has 9 characters. \n   - Since the lengths are equal, we can proceed.\n\n2. **Initialize Mappings**:\n   - We need two mappings: one from the first string to the second string and another from the second string to the first string. This ensures that no two characters map to the same character in either direction.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map Characters**:\n   - We will iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously and establish the mappings.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1, c2) from \"lpfjplcto\" and \"javhaftdl\":\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string. If it is, it must map to c2.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the first string. If it is, it must map to c1.\n     - If either of these conditions fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If neither character is mapped, establish the new mapping.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - l -> j\n   - p -> a\n   - f -> v\n   - j -> h\n   - p -> a (already mapped correctly)\n   - l -> j (already mapped correctly)\n   - c -> f\n   - t -> t\n   - o -> d\n\n5. **Check Consistency**:\n   - Ensure that the mappings are consistent throughout the strings.\n   - For example, 'p' consistently maps to 'a', and 'l' consistently maps to 'j'.\n   - No two different characters in the first string map to the same character in the second string, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all characters map consistently and uniquely, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
