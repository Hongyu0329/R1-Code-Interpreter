    "To determine if the two strings \"kjj\" and \"lnr\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure that both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"kjj\" has a length of 3, and \"lnr\" also has a length of 3. So, they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one character mapping from the first string to the second string.\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps): one for mapping characters from \"kjj\" to \"lnr\" and another for mapping characters from \"lnr\" to \"kjj\". This ensures that no two characters map to the same character in either direction.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"kjj\" and c2 from \"lnr\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the first dictionary:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the second dictionary:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If neither character is mapped, create a new mapping in both dictionaries.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Mapping**:\n   - For the first character pair ('k', 'l'):\n     - 'k' is not mapped yet, and 'l' is not mapped yet. Map 'k' to 'l' and 'l' to 'k'.\n   - For the second character pair ('j', 'n'):\n     - 'j' is not mapped yet, and 'n' is not mapped yet. Map 'j' to 'n' and 'n' to 'j'.\n   - For the third character pair ('j', 'r'):\n     - 'j' is already mapped to 'n'. Since 'r' is not 'n', the mapping is inconsistent.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the mapping for 'j' is inconsistent (it maps to 'n' but should map to 'r' for the strings to be isomorphic), the strings \"kjj\" and \"lnr\" are not isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
