    "To determine if the two strings \"zbl\" and \"vqr\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"zbl\" has a length of 3, and \"vqr\" also has a length of 3. So, they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - Also, create a reverse mapping from characters in the second string to characters in the first string to ensure no two characters map to the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - For each character in the first string, check if it has already been mapped to a character in the second string.\n   - If it has, ensure it maps to the current character in the second string.\n   - If it hasn't, map it to the current character in the second string.\n   - Simultaneously, ensure that the current character in the second string is not already mapped to a different character in the first string.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Mapping**:\n   - For 'z' in \"zbl\", map it to 'v' in \"vqr\".\n   - For 'b' in \"zbl\", map it to 'q' in \"vqr\".\n   - For 'l' in \"zbl\", map it to 'r' in \"vqr\".\n\n5. **Check Consistency**:\n   - Ensure that the mappings are consistent throughout the strings.\n   - 'z' consistently maps to 'v', 'b' to 'q', and 'l' to 'r'.\n   - There are no conflicts in the mapping, and no two characters in \"zbl\" map to the same character in \"vqr\".\n\n6. **Final Decision**:\n   - Since all characters map consistently and uniquely, the strings \"zbl\" and \"vqr\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
