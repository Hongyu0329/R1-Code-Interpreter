    "To determine if the two strings \"nj\" and \"gb\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"nj\" and \"gb\" have a length of 2, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - Also, create a reverse mapping from characters in the second string to characters in the first string to ensure no two characters map to the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from the two strings:\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string.\n     - If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c1 is not mapped, map it to c2.\n     - Similarly, check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the first string.\n     - If it is, ensure it maps to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c2 is not mapped, map it to c1.\n\n4. **Apply to \"nj\" and \"gb\"**:\n   - Map 'n' to 'g' and 'j' to 'b'.\n   - Check reverse mapping: 'g' to 'n' and 'b' to 'j'.\n   - Both mappings are consistent and do not violate any rules.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all characters can be consistently mapped without conflicts, the strings \"nj\" and \"gb\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
