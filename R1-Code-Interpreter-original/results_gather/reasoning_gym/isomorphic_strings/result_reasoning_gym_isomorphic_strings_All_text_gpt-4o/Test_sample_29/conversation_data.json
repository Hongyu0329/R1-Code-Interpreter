    "To determine if the two strings \"rggcdfxm\" and \"syyzurcm\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - Both strings must be of the same length to be isomorphic. \n   - \"rggcdfxm\" and \"syyzurcm\" both have 8 characters, so they pass the length check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to create a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - We also need to ensure that no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Initialize two dictionaries: `map_s_to_t` for mapping characters from the first string to the second string, and `map_t_to_s` for the reverse mapping.\n   - Iterate through each character pair (c1, c2) from the two strings simultaneously.\n\n4. **Mapping Validation**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2):\n     - Check if c1 is already in `map_s_to_t`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_s_to_t[c1]` is equal to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c1 is not in `map_s_to_t`, add the mapping `c1 -> c2`.\n     - Similarly, check if c2 is already in `map_t_to_s`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_t_to_s[c2]` is equal to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c2 is not in `map_t_to_s`, add the mapping `c2 -> c1`.\n\n5. **Check Each Character Pair**:\n   - For the first pair ('r', 's'):\n     - 'r' is not in `map_s_to_t`, and 's' is not in `map_t_to_s`, so add mappings: `r -> s` and `s -> r`.\n   - For the second pair ('g', 'y'):\n     - 'g' is not in `map_s_to_t`, and 'y' is not in `map_t_to_s`, so add mappings: `g -> y` and `y -> g`.\n   - For the third pair ('g', 'y'):\n     - 'g' is in `map_s_to_t` and maps to 'y', and 'y' is in `map_t_to_s` and maps to 'g', so continue.\n   - For the fourth pair ('c', 'z'):\n     - 'c' is not in `map_s_to_t`, and 'z' is not in `map_t_to_s`, so add mappings: `c -> z` and `z -> c`.\n   - For the fifth pair ('d', 'u'):\n     - 'd' is not in `map_s_to_t`, and 'u' is not in `map_t_to_s`, so add mappings: `d -> u` and `u -> d`.\n   - For the sixth pair ('f', 'r'):\n     - 'f' is not in `map_s_to_t`, and 'r' is not in `map_t_to_s`, so add mappings: `f -> r` and `r -> f`.\n   - For the seventh pair ('x', 'c'):\n     - 'x' is not in `map_s_to_t`, and 'c' is not in `map_t_to_s`, so add mappings: `x -> c` and `c -> x`.\n   - For the eighth pair ('m', 'm'):\n     - 'm' is not in `map_s_to_t`, and 'm' is not in `map_t_to_s`, so add mappings: `m -> m` and `m -> m`.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - All character pairs have been checked, and no conflicts were found in the mappings.\n   - Therefore, the strings \"rggcdfxm\" and \"syyzurcm\" are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>."
