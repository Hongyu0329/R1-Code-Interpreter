    "To determine if the two strings \"hvmf\" and \"xtcj\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"hvmf\" and \"xtcj\" both have a length of 4, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - Also, create a reverse mapping from characters in the second string to characters in the first string to ensure no two characters map to the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from the two strings:\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string.\n     - If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c1 is not mapped, check if c2 is already mapped to another character. If it is, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c2 is not mapped, create a new mapping from c1 to c2 and vice versa.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Mapping**:\n   - Pair 1: ('h', 'x')\n     - 'h' is not mapped, and 'x' is not mapped. Create mapping: 'h' -> 'x' and 'x' -> 'h'.\n   - Pair 2: ('v', 't')\n     - 'v' is not mapped, and 't' is not mapped. Create mapping: 'v' -> 't' and 't' -> 'v'.\n   - Pair 3: ('m', 'c')\n     - 'm' is not mapped, and 'c' is not mapped. Create mapping: 'm' -> 'c' and 'c' -> 'm'.\n   - Pair 4: ('f', 'j')\n     - 'f' is not mapped, and 'j' is not mapped. Create mapping: 'f' -> 'j' and 'j' -> 'f'.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - All characters have been mapped correctly without any conflicts.\n   - Therefore, the strings \"hvmf\" and \"xtcj\" are isomorphic.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
