    "To determine if the two strings \"lff\" and \"vzy\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"lff\" has a length of 3, and \"vzy\" also has a length of 3. So, they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one character mapping from the first string to the second string.\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps): one for mapping characters from the first string to the second, and another for mapping characters from the second string to the first. This ensures that no two characters map to the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"lff\" and c2 from \"vzy\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string. If it is, ensure it maps to c2.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the first string. If it is, ensure it maps to c1.\n     - If either of these checks fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If both checks pass, add the mapping c1 -> c2 and c2 -> c1 to the respective dictionaries.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Mapping**:\n   - First pair: ('l', 'v')\n     - 'l' is not mapped yet, and 'v' is not mapped yet. Map 'l' to 'v' and 'v' to 'l'.\n   - Second pair: ('f', 'z')\n     - 'f' is not mapped yet, and 'z' is not mapped yet. Map 'f' to 'z' and 'z' to 'f'.\n   - Third pair: ('f', 'y')\n     - 'f' is already mapped to 'z', but now it needs to map to 'y'. This is a conflict, so the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is a conflict in the mapping for the character 'f', the strings \"lff\" and \"vzy\" are not isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
