    "To determine if the two strings \"ppgik\" and \"kksyf\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"ppgik\" and \"kksyf\" have a length of 5, so we proceed.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one character mapping from the first string to the second string.\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps): one for mapping characters from the first string to the second, and another for mapping characters from the second string to the first. This ensures that no two characters map to the same character in either direction.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (char1 from \"ppgik\" and char2 from \"kksyf\"):\n     - Check if char1 is already mapped to a different character in the first dictionary. If it is, and it's not char2, return False.\n     - Check if char2 is already mapped to a different character in the second dictionary. If it is, and it's not char1, return False.\n     - If neither of the above conditions is met, map char1 to char2 in the first dictionary and char2 to char1 in the second dictionary.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - Let's go through the strings:\n     - 'p' maps to 'k': Add 'p' -> 'k' in the first dictionary and 'k' -> 'p' in the second dictionary.\n     - 'p' maps to 'k': Check existing mapping, which is consistent.\n     - 'g' maps to 's': Add 'g' -> 's' in the first dictionary and 's' -> 'g' in the second dictionary.\n     - 'i' maps to 'y': Add 'i' -> 'y' in the first dictionary and 'y' -> 'i' in the second dictionary.\n     - 'k' maps to 'f': Add 'k' -> 'f' in the first dictionary and 'f' -> 'k' in the second dictionary.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - If we complete the iteration without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nSince all character mappings are consistent and no conflicts arise, the strings \"ppgik\" and \"kksyf\" are isomorphic.\n\nFinal answer: <<<True>>>."
