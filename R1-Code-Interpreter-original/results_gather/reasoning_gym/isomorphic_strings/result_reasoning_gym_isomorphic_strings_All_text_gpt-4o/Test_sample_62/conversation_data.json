    "To determine if the two strings \"uskfsoisd\" and \"ymkjmodmi\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - Both strings must be of the same length to be isomorphic. \n   - \"uskfsoisd\" has 9 characters, and \"ymkjmodmi\" also has 9 characters. \n   - Since the lengths are equal, we can proceed.\n\n2. **Initialize Mappings**:\n   - We need two dictionaries (or hash maps) to keep track of the mappings:\n     - `map_s_to_t` for mapping characters from the first string to the second string.\n     - `map_t_to_s` for mapping characters from the second string to the first string.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map Characters**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from the strings \"uskfsoisd\" and \"ymkjmodmi\":\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in `map_s_to_t`.\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, return False.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in `map_t_to_s`.\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c1. If not, return False.\n     - If neither character is mapped, create a new mapping: map c1 to c2 in `map_s_to_t` and c2 to c1 in `map_t_to_s`.\n\n4. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Let's map each character step by step:\n     - 'u' -> 'y'\n     - 's' -> 'm'\n     - 'k' -> 'k'\n     - 'f' -> 'j'\n     - 's' -> 'm' (already mapped correctly)\n     - 'o' -> 'o'\n     - 'i' -> 'd'\n     - 's' -> 'm' (already mapped correctly)\n     - 'd' -> 'i'\n\n5. **Check for Consistency**:\n   - Ensure that no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string and vice versa.\n   - The mappings are consistent and one-to-one.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all characters map correctly and consistently, the strings \"uskfsoisd\" and \"ymkjmodmi\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
