    "To determine if the two strings \"gaiajmzdwq\" and \"kgrmvszneg\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both strings \"gaiajmzdwq\" and \"kgrmvszneg\" have a length of 10, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - Let's denote these dictionaries as `map_s1_to_s2` and `map_s2_to_s1`.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from the first and second string respectively:\n     - Check if c1 is already in `map_s1_to_s2`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_s1_to_s2[c1]` is equal to c2. If not, return False.\n     - If c1 is not in `map_s1_to_s2`, add the mapping `c1 -> c2`.\n     - Similarly, check if c2 is already in `map_s2_to_s1`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_s2_to_s1[c2]` is equal to c1. If not, return False.\n     - If c2 is not in `map_s2_to_s1`, add the mapping `c2 -> c1`.\n\n4. **Check for Conflicts**:\n   - During the iteration, if any conflict arises where a character maps to more than one character, return False.\n\n5. **Final Decision**:\n   - If the iteration completes without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's apply this to the given strings:\n\n- \"g\" maps to \"k\", \"a\" maps to \"g\", \"i\" maps to \"r\", \"j\" maps to \"m\", \"m\" maps to \"v\", \"z\" maps to \"s\", \"d\" maps to \"z\", \"w\" maps to \"n\", \"q\" maps to \"e\".\n- All mappings are consistent and there are no conflicts.\n\nTherefore, the strings \"gaiajmzdwq\" and \"kgrmvszneg\" are isomorphic.\n\n<<<True>>>"
