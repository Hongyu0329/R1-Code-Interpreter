    "To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to ensure that there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Let's analyze the given strings step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Strings**: The two strings provided are \"o\" and \"m\".\n\n2. **Check Lengths**: \n   - Both strings have a length of 1. For two strings to be isomorphic, they must be of the same length. Since both strings have the same length, we can proceed to the next step.\n\n3. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a mapping from each character in the first string to a character in the second string.\n   - For the first string \"o\", the character 'o' needs to map to the character 'm' in the second string.\n\n4. **Check for Consistent Mapping**:\n   - Since both strings are of length 1, there is only one character in each string. Therefore, the character 'o' in the first string can map to the character 'm' in the second string without any conflict.\n   - There are no other characters to consider, so there is no possibility of two characters mapping to the same character or a character mapping to multiple characters.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The mapping from 'o' to 'm' is valid and consistent with the rules of isomorphism.\n   - Therefore, the two strings \"o\" and \"m\" are isomorphic.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
