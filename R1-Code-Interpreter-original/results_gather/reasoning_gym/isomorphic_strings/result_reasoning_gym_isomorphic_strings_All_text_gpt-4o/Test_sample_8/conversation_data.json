    "To determine if the two strings \"ueqkkrzud\" and \"idoffvcwk\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - Both strings must be of the same length to be isomorphic. \n   - \"ueqkkrzud\" has 9 characters, and \"idoffvcwk\" also has 9 characters. \n   - Since the lengths are equal, we can proceed to the next step.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to create a mapping from each character in the first string to a character in the second string.\n   - We also need to ensure that no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Initialize two dictionaries: one for mapping characters from the first string to the second string (`map1`) and another for mapping characters from the second string to the first string (`map2`).\n   - Iterate through each character pair (c1, c2) from the two strings simultaneously.\n\n4. **Check and Update Mappings**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2):\n     - If c1 is already in `map1`, check if `map1[c1]` is equal to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c2 is already in `map2`, check if `map2[c2]` is equal to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c1 is not in `map1` and c2 is not in `map2`, add the mapping `map1[c1] = c2` and `map2[c2] = c1`.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - If we complete the iteration without conflicts in the mappings, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's apply this to the given strings:\n\n- Pair (u, i): map1[u] = i, map2[i] = u\n- Pair (e, d): map1[e] = d, map2[d] = e\n- Pair (q, o): map1[q] = o, map2[o] = q\n- Pair (k, f): map1[k] = f, map2[f] = k\n- Pair (k, f): map1[k] = f (consistent), map2[f] = k (consistent)\n- Pair (r, v): map1[r] = v, map2[v] = r\n- Pair (z, c): map1[z] = c, map2[c] = z\n- Pair (u, w): map1[u] = i (conflict, as it should map to w), map2[w] = u (conflict, as it should map to i)\n\nSince there is a conflict in the mapping for 'u', the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n<<<False>>>"
