    "To determine if the two strings \"fqaxgykxy\" and \"gzowtelws\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both strings \"fqaxgykxy\" and \"gzowtelws\" have a length of 9, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - Iterate through each character of both strings simultaneously.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from the strings:\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string.\n     - If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c1 is not mapped, check if c2 is already mapped to another character from the first string.\n     - If c2 is already mapped to a different character, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If both checks pass, map c1 to c2 and c2 to c1.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - Let's map the characters step by step:\n     - 'f' -> 'g', 'g' -> 'f'\n     - 'q' -> 'z', 'z' -> 'q'\n     - 'a' -> 'o', 'o' -> 'a'\n     - 'x' -> 'w', 'w' -> 'x'\n     - 'g' -> 't', 't' -> 'g' (Note: 'g' was previously mapped to 'f', so this fails)\n     - At this point, we find a conflict because 'g' was already mapped to 'f', but now it needs to map to 't'. This means the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since we found a character mapping conflict, the strings \"fqaxgykxy\" and \"gzowtelws\" are not isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
