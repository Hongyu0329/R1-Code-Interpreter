    "To determine if the two strings \"oqyuebx\" and \"vpahslc\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between every character in the first string to a character in the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"oqyuebx\" has 7 characters, and \"vpahslc\" also has 7 characters. So, they pass the length check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - This ensures that no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string and vice versa.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"oqyuebx\" and c2 from \"vpahslc\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the first string:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If neither character is mapped, create a new mapping from c1 to c2 and from c2 to c1.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - o -> v, q -> p, y -> a, u -> h, e -> s, b -> l, x -> c\n   - v -> o, p -> q, a -> y, h -> u, s -> e, l -> b, c -> x\n\n5. **Check for Consistency**:\n   - Ensure that the mapping is consistent throughout the strings.\n   - In this case, each character from \"oqyuebx\" maps uniquely to a character in \"vpahslc\" and vice versa.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all characters map consistently and uniquely, the strings \"oqyuebx\" and \"vpahslc\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
