    "To determine if the two strings \"mvqat\" and \"kewog\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if the two strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"mvqat\" and \"kewog\" have a length of 5, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings from characters in the first string to characters in the second string and vice versa.\n   - Let's denote these dictionaries as `map1` for mapping from \"mvqat\" to \"kewog\" and `map2` for mapping from \"kewog\" to \"mvqat\".\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"mvqat\" and c2 from \"kewog\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already in `map1`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map1[c1]` is equal to c2. If not, return False.\n     - If c1 is not in `map1`, add the mapping `map1[c1] = c2`.\n     - Similarly, check if c2 is already in `map2`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map2[c2]` is equal to c1. If not, return False.\n     - If c2 is not in `map2`, add the mapping `map2[c2] = c1`.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - Let's apply the above logic to the given strings:\n     - 'm' maps to 'k', and 'k' maps to 'm'.\n     - 'v' maps to 'e', and 'e' maps to 'v'.\n     - 'q' maps to 'w', and 'w' maps to 'q'.\n     - 'a' maps to 'o', and 'o' maps to 'a'.\n     - 't' maps to 'g', and 'g' maps to 't'.\n   - All mappings are consistent and one-to-one.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all characters map consistently and uniquely between the two strings, \"mvqat\" and \"kewog\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
