    "To determine if the two strings \"gg\" and \"sz\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, check if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If they are not, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"gg\" and \"sz\" have a length of 2, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one character mapping from the first string to the second string.\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to keep track of the mappings:\n     - `map_g_to_s`: Maps characters from \"gg\" to \"sz\".\n     - `map_s_to_g`: Maps characters from \"sz\" to \"gg\".\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character pair from both strings simultaneously.\n   - For the first pair ('g', 's'):\n     - Check if 'g' is already mapped to a different character in `map_g_to_s`. If it is, and the mapped character is not 's', return False.\n     - Check if 's' is already mapped to a different character in `map_s_to_g`. If it is, and the mapped character is not 'g', return False.\n     - If no conflicts, map 'g' to 's' in `map_g_to_s` and 's' to 'g' in `map_s_to_g`.\n   - For the second pair ('g', 'z'):\n     - Check if 'g' is already mapped to a different character in `map_g_to_s`. Since 'g' is already mapped to 's', and 'z' is different from 's', this is a conflict.\n     - Therefore, the strings cannot be isomorphic.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since we found a conflict in the mapping, the strings \"gg\" and \"sz\" are not isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
