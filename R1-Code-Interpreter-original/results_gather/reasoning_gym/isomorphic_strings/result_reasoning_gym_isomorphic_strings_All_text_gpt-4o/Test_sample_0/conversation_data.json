    "To determine if the two strings \"ybb\" and \"ytm\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"ybb\" and \"ytm\" both have a length of 3, so we proceed.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one character mapping from the first string to the second string.\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to track the mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string and vice versa.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (char1 from \"ybb\" and char2 from \"ytm\"):\n     - Check if char1 is already mapped to a different character in the second string. If it is, return False.\n     - Check if char2 is already mapped to a different character in the first string. If it is, return False.\n     - If neither character is mapped, establish a new mapping in both dictionaries.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For the first character 'y' in \"ybb\" and 'y' in \"ytm\":\n     - No existing mapping, so map 'y' to 'y' and 'y' to 'y'.\n   - For the second character 'b' in \"ybb\" and 't' in \"ytm\":\n     - No existing mapping, so map 'b' to 't' and 't' to 'b'.\n   - For the third character 'b' in \"ybb\" and 'm' in \"ytm\":\n     - 'b' is already mapped to 't', but now it needs to map to 'm', which is a conflict.\n     - Therefore, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is a conflict in the mapping (the character 'b' in \"ybb\" cannot map to both 't' and 'm' in \"ytm\"), the strings are not isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
