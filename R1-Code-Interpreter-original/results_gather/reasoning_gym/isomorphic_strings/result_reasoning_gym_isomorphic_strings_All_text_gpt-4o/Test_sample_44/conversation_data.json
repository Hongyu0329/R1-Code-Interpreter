    "To determine if the two strings \"nwswwz\" and \"xdyddk\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"nwswwz\" and \"xdyddk\" have a length of 6, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings from characters in the first string to characters in the second string and vice versa.\n   - Let's denote the first string as `s1 = \"nwswwz\"` and the second string as `s2 = \"xdyddk\"`.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character in the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters `(c1, c2)` from `s1` and `s2`:\n     - Check if `c1` is already mapped to a character in `s2`. If it is, ensure it maps to `c2`.\n     - Check if `c2` is already mapped to a character in `s1`. If it is, ensure it maps to `c1`.\n     - If either of these checks fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If both checks pass, record the mapping `c1 -> c2` and `c2 -> c1`.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For the first pair `(n, x)`, map `n` to `x` and `x` to `n`.\n   - For the second pair `(w, d)`, map `w` to `d` and `d` to `w`.\n   - For the third pair `(s, y)`, map `s` to `y` and `y` to `s`.\n   - For the fourth pair `(w, d)`, check the existing mapping. `w` is already mapped to `d`, and `d` is already mapped to `w`, so this is consistent.\n   - For the fifth pair `(w, d)`, again, the existing mapping is consistent.\n   - For the sixth pair `(z, k)`, map `z` to `k` and `k` to `z`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - All character mappings are consistent, and no two characters from `s1` map to the same character in `s2` and vice versa.\n   - Therefore, the strings \"nwswwz\" and \"xdyddk\" are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>."
