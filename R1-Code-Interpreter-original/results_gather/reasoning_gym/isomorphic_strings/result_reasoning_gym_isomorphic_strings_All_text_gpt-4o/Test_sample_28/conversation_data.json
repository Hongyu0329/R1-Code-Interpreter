    "To determine if the two strings \"yqmvk\" and \"pujax\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"yqmvk\" and \"pujax\" have a length of 5, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - Also, create a reverse mapping from characters in the second string to characters in the first string to ensure no two characters map to the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from the two strings:\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string. If it is, ensure it maps to c2.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the first string. If it is, ensure it maps to c1.\n     - If either of these checks fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If both checks pass, establish the mapping c1 -> c2 and c2 -> c1.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Mapping**:\n   - Pair 1: ('y', 'p')\n     - 'y' is not mapped yet, and 'p' is not mapped yet. Map 'y' to 'p' and 'p' to 'y'.\n   - Pair 2: ('q', 'u')\n     - 'q' is not mapped yet, and 'u' is not mapped yet. Map 'q' to 'u' and 'u' to 'q'.\n   - Pair 3: ('m', 'j')\n     - 'm' is not mapped yet, and 'j' is not mapped yet. Map 'm' to 'j' and 'j' to 'm'.\n   - Pair 4: ('v', 'a')\n     - 'v' is not mapped yet, and 'a' is not mapped yet. Map 'v' to 'a' and 'a' to 'v'.\n   - Pair 5: ('k', 'x')\n     - 'k' is not mapped yet, and 'x' is not mapped yet. Map 'k' to 'x' and 'x' to 'k'.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - After processing all character pairs, if no conflicts were found in the mappings, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nSince all character pairs have been successfully mapped without conflicts, the strings \"yqmvk\" and \"pujax\" are isomorphic.\n\n<<<True>>>"
