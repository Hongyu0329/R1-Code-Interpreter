    "To determine if the two strings \"rjsp\" and \"rwns\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"rjsp\" and \"rwns\" have a length of 4, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one mapping between characters of the first string (\"rjsp\") and the second string (\"rwns\").\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps): one for mapping characters from \"rjsp\" to \"rwns\" and another for the reverse mapping from \"rwns\" to \"rjsp\".\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"rjsp\" and c2 from \"rwns\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in \"rwns\". If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - Similarly, check if c2 is already mapped to a character in \"rjsp\". If it is, ensure it maps to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If neither character is mapped, create a new mapping in both dictionaries.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For \"rjsp\" and \"rwns\":\n     - 'r' maps to 'r' and vice versa.\n     - 'j' maps to 'w' and vice versa.\n     - 's' maps to 'n' and vice versa.\n     - 'p' maps to 's' and vice versa.\n   - All mappings are consistent and one-to-one.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - If we can iterate through all characters without conflicts in mapping, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nSince all characters map correctly without any conflicts, the strings \"rjsp\" and \"rwns\" are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>."
