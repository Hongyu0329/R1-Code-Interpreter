    "To determine if the two strings \"xbrxlhmka\" and \"tzfbeqjpx\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both strings \"xbrxlhmka\" and \"tzfbeqjpx\" have a length of 9, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to map characters from the first string to the second and vice versa.\n   - This ensures that no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string and vice versa.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (char1 from the first string and char2 from the second string):\n     - Check if char1 is already mapped to a character in the second string:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to char2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If char1 is not mapped, map it to char2.\n     - Similarly, check if char2 is already mapped to a character in the first string:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to char1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If char2 is not mapped, map it to char1.\n\n4. **Validation**:\n   - If all characters can be mapped correctly without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given strings:\n\n- **Mapping from \"xbrxlhmka\" to \"tzfbeqjpx\"**:\n  - 'x' -> 't'\n  - 'b' -> 'z'\n  - 'r' -> 'f'\n  - 'l' -> 'b'\n  - 'h' -> 'e'\n  - 'm' -> 'q'\n  - 'k' -> 'j'\n  - 'a' -> 'p'\n  - 'x' (again) -> 't' (consistent with previous mapping)\n\n- **Mapping from \"tzfbeqjpx\" to \"xbrxlhmka\"**:\n  - 't' -> 'x'\n  - 'z' -> 'b'\n  - 'f' -> 'r'\n  - 'b' -> 'l'\n  - 'e' -> 'h'\n  - 'q' -> 'm'\n  - 'j' -> 'k'\n  - 'p' -> 'a'\n  - 'x' -> 'x' (consistent with previous mapping)\n\nSince all mappings are consistent and there are no conflicts, the two strings are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
