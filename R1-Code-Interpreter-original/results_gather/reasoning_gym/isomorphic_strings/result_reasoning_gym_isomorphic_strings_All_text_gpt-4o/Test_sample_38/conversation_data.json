    "To determine if the two strings \"my\" and \"co\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, check if the two strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"my\" has a length of 2, and \"co\" also has a length of 2. Since they are of equal length, we can proceed to the next step.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one character mapping from the first string to the second string.\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to keep track of the mappings:\n     - `map_s_to_t` for mapping characters from \"my\" to \"co\".\n     - `map_t_to_s` for mapping characters from \"co\" to \"my\".\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (s_char, t_char) from \"my\" and \"co\":\n     - Check if s_char is already mapped in `map_s_to_t`:\n       - If it is, ensure that it maps to t_char. If not, return False.\n     - Check if t_char is already mapped in `map_t_to_s`:\n       - If it is, ensure that it maps to s_char. If not, return False.\n     - If neither character is mapped, create a new mapping in both dictionaries.\n\n4. **Check Each Pair**:\n   - For the first pair ('m', 'c'):\n     - 'm' is not in `map_s_to_t`, and 'c' is not in `map_t_to_s`.\n     - Add the mapping: `map_s_to_t['m'] = 'c'` and `map_t_to_s['c'] = 'm'`.\n   - For the second pair ('y', 'o'):\n     - 'y' is not in `map_s_to_t`, and 'o' is not in `map_t_to_s`.\n     - Add the mapping: `map_s_to_t['y'] = 'o'` and `map_t_to_s['o'] = 'y'`.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - If we successfully iterate through all character pairs without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nSince all character pairs have been successfully mapped without any conflicts, the strings \"my\" and \"co\" are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>."
