    "To determine if the two strings \"uq\" and \"ti\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, check if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If they are not, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"uq\" and \"ti\" have a length of 2, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to keep track of the character mappings from the first string to the second and vice versa.\n   - Let's call them `map_uq_to_ti` and `map_ti_to_uq`.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map Characters**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (char_uq, char_ti) from \"uq\" and \"ti\":\n     - Check if `char_uq` is already in `map_uq_to_ti`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_uq_to_ti[char_uq]` is equal to `char_ti`. If not, return False.\n       - If it is not, add the mapping `map_uq_to_ti[char_uq] = char_ti`.\n     - Similarly, check if `char_ti` is already in `map_ti_to_uq`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_ti_to_uq[char_ti]` is equal to `char_uq`. If not, return False.\n       - If it is not, add the mapping `map_ti_to_uq[char_ti] = char_uq`.\n\n4. **Check for Conflicts**:\n   - Ensure that no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string and vice versa.\n   - This is inherently checked by the dictionary logic above.\n\n5. **Final Decision**:\n   - If all character mappings are consistent and no conflicts are found, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the strings \"uq\" and \"ti\":\n\n- For the first pair ('u', 't'):\n  - 'u' is not in `map_uq_to_ti`, so add the mapping `map_uq_to_ti['u'] = 't'`.\n  - 't' is not in `map_ti_to_uq`, so add the mapping `map_ti_to_uq['t'] = 'u'`.\n\n- For the second pair ('q', 'i'):\n  - 'q' is not in `map_uq_to_ti`, so add the mapping `map_uq_to_ti['q'] = 'i'`.\n  - 'i' is not in `map_ti_to_uq`, so add the mapping `map_ti_to_uq['i'] = 'q'`.\n\nSince all character mappings are consistent and there are no conflicts, the strings \"uq\" and \"ti\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
