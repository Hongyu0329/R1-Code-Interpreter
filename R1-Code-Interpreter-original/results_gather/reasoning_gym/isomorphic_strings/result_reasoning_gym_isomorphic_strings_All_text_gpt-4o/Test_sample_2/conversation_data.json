    "To determine if the two strings \"ddnxwpepu\" and \"ttrhjfifm\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both strings \"ddnxwpepu\" and \"ttrhjfifm\" have a length of 9, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - Also, create a reverse mapping from characters in the second string to characters in the first string to ensure no two characters map to the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from the first string and c2 from the second string):\n     - If c1 is already mapped to a character, check if it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c1 is not mapped, check if c2 is already mapped to another character. If it is, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If both checks pass, map c1 to c2 and c2 to c1.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - Let's map the characters step by step:\n     - 'd' -> 't', 'd' -> 't' (consistent mapping)\n     - 'n' -> 'r'\n     - 'x' -> 'h'\n     - 'w' -> 'j'\n     - 'p' -> 'f'\n     - 'e' -> 'i'\n     - 'p' is already mapped to 'f', and the next character in the second string is 'f', which is consistent.\n     - 'u' -> 'm'\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - If all characters are consistently mapped without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nSince all characters in \"ddnxwpepu\" can be consistently mapped to characters in \"ttrhjfifm\" without any conflicts, the two strings are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
