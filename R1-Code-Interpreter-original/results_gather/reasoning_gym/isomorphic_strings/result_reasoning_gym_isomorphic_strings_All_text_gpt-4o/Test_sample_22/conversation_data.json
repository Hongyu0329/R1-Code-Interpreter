    "To determine if the two strings \"waq\" and \"hru\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure that both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"waq\" and \"hru\" both have a length of 3, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one character mapping from the first string to the second string.\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps): one for mapping characters from \"waq\" to \"hru\" and another for mapping characters from \"hru\" to \"waq\". This ensures that no two characters map to the same character in either direction.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"waq\" and c2 from \"hru\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the first dictionary:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c1 is not mapped, add the mapping c1 -> c2 to the first dictionary.\n     - Similarly, check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the second dictionary:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c2 is not mapped, add the mapping c2 -> c1 to the second dictionary.\n\n4. **Check for Consistency**:\n   - If all character mappings are consistent throughout the strings, then the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the strings \"waq\" and \"hru\":\n\n- **Mapping from \"waq\" to \"hru\"**:\n  - 'w' -> 'h'\n  - 'a' -> 'r'\n  - 'q' -> 'u'\n\n- **Mapping from \"hru\" to \"waq\"**:\n  - 'h' -> 'w'\n  - 'r' -> 'a'\n  - 'u' -> 'q'\n\nSince all mappings are consistent and no two characters map to the same character in either direction, the strings \"waq\" and \"hru\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
