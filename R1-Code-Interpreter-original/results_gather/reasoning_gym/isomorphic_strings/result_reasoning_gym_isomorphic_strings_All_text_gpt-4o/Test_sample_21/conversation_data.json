    "To determine if the two strings \"bbel\" and \"hhju\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"bbel\" has a length of 4, and \"hhju\" also has a length of 4. So, they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one character mapping from the first string to the second string.\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps): one for mapping characters from \"bbel\" to \"hhju\" and another for mapping characters from \"hhju\" to \"bbel\". This ensures that no two characters map to the same character in either direction.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"bbel\" and c2 from \"hhju\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the first dictionary.\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c1 is not mapped, map c1 to c2 in the first dictionary.\n     - Similarly, check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the second dictionary.\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c2 is not mapped, map c2 to c1 in the second dictionary.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For \"bbel\" and \"hhju\":\n     - 'b' maps to 'h', and 'h' maps to 'b'.\n     - 'b' maps to 'h', and 'h' maps to 'b' (consistent with the previous mapping).\n     - 'e' maps to 'j', and 'j' maps to 'e'.\n     - 'l' maps to 'u', and 'u' maps to 'l'.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - If all characters can be mapped consistently without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nSince all characters in \"bbel\" can be consistently mapped to characters in \"hhju\" and vice versa, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>."
