    "To determine if the two strings \"mm\" and \"tu\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, check if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If they are not, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - In this case, both strings \"mm\" and \"tu\" have a length of 2, so we proceed to the next step.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one character mapping from the first string to the second string.\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to keep track of the mappings:\n     - `map_s_to_t` for mapping characters from the first string \"mm\" to the second string \"tu\".\n     - `map_t_to_s` for mapping characters from the second string \"tu\" to the first string \"mm\".\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"mm\" and c2 from \"tu\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already in `map_s_to_t`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_s_to_t[c1]` is equal to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c1 is not in `map_s_to_t`, add the mapping `map_s_to_t[c1] = c2`.\n     - Similarly, check if c2 is already in `map_t_to_s`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_t_to_s[c2]` is equal to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c2 is not in `map_t_to_s`, add the mapping `map_t_to_s[c2] = c1`.\n\n4. **Check for Conflicts**:\n   - If at any point there is a conflict in the mappings (i.e., a character maps to two different characters), the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n5. **Final Decision**:\n   - If we complete the iteration without finding any conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the strings \"mm\" and \"tu\":\n\n- **Step 1**: Both strings have the same length (2).\n- **Step 2**: Initialize `map_s_to_t = {}` and `map_t_to_s = {}`.\n- **Step 3**: \n  - First pair: ('m', 't')\n    - 'm' is not in `map_s_to_t`, so add `map_s_to_t['m'] = 't'`.\n    - 't' is not in `map_t_to_s`, so add `map_t_to_s['t'] = 'm'`.\n  - Second pair: ('m', 'u')\n    - 'm' is in `map_s_to_t` and maps to 't', but we encounter 'u', which is a conflict.\n    - Therefore, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n- **Step 4**: A conflict was found in the mappings.\n\n- **Step 5**: Since there is a conflict, the strings \"mm\" and \"tu\" are not isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
