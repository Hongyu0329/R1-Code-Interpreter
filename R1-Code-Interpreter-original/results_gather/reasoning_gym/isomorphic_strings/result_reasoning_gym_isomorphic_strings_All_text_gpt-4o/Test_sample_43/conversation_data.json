    "To determine if the two strings \"mlekmkkbp\" and \"dsfusuurj\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - Both strings must be of the same length to be isomorphic. \n   - \"mlekmkkbp\" has 9 characters, and \"dsfusuurj\" also has 9 characters. \n   - Since the lengths are equal, we can proceed.\n\n2. **Initialize Mappings**:\n   - We need two dictionaries (or hash maps) to keep track of the mappings:\n     - `map_s1_to_s2` for mapping characters from the first string to the second string.\n     - `map_s2_to_s1` for mapping characters from the second string to the first string.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map Characters**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from the strings \"mlekmkkbp\" and \"dsfusuurj\":\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped in `map_s1_to_s2`:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, return False.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped in `map_s2_to_s1`:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c1. If not, return False.\n     - If neither character is mapped, create a new mapping: \n       - `map_s1_to_s2[c1] = c2`\n       - `map_s2_to_s1[c2] = c1`\n\n4. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Let's map the characters step by step:\n     - 'm' -> 'd'\n     - 'l' -> 's'\n     - 'e' -> 'f'\n     - 'k' -> 'u'\n     - 'm' is already mapped to 'd', and the current character in the second string is 's', which is a conflict. Therefore, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since we found a conflict in the mapping, the strings \"mlekmkkbp\" and \"dsfusuurj\" are not isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
