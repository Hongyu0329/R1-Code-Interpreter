    "To determine if the two strings \"itunoc\" and \"cowqdk\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if the two strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"itunoc\" and \"cowqdk\" have a length of 6, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - Let's call them `map_s1_to_s2` and `map_s2_to_s1`.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (char1 from \"itunoc\" and char2 from \"cowqdk\"):\n     - Check if char1 is already in `map_s1_to_s2`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_s1_to_s2[char1]` is equal to char2. If not, return False.\n       - If it is not, add the mapping `map_s1_to_s2[char1] = char2`.\n     - Check if char2 is already in `map_s2_to_s1`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_s2_to_s1[char2]` is equal to char1. If not, return False.\n       - If it is not, add the mapping `map_s2_to_s1[char2] = char1`.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For \"itunoc\" and \"cowqdk\":\n     - i -> c\n     - t -> o\n     - u -> w\n     - n -> q\n     - o -> d\n     - c -> k\n   - Check the reverse mapping:\n     - c -> i\n     - o -> t\n     - w -> u\n     - q -> n\n     - d -> o\n     - k -> c\n\n5. **Validation**:\n   - Ensure that no two different characters in \"itunoc\" map to the same character in \"cowqdk\" and vice versa.\n   - The mappings are consistent and one-to-one in both directions.\n\nSince all characters map correctly and consistently, the strings \"itunoc\" and \"cowqdk\" are isomorphic.\n\nFinal answer: <<<True>>>."
