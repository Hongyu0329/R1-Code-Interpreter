    "To determine if the two strings \"bby\" and \"pir\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, check if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If they are not, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"bby\" and \"pir\" have a length of 3, so we proceed.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one character mapping from the first string to the second string.\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to keep track of the mappings:\n     - `map_s1_to_s2` for mapping characters from \"bby\" to \"pir\".\n     - `map_s2_to_s1` for mapping characters from \"pir\" to \"bby\".\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"bby\" and c2 from \"pir\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped in `map_s1_to_s2`:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, return False.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped in `map_s2_to_s1`:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c1. If not, return False.\n     - If neither character is mapped, create a new mapping in both dictionaries.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For \"bby\" and \"pir\":\n     - 'b' maps to 'p' (first occurrence).\n     - 'b' maps to 'p' (second occurrence, consistent with the first).\n     - 'y' maps to 'r'.\n   - The reverse mappings are:\n     - 'p' maps to 'b'.\n     - 'r' maps to 'y'.\n\n5. **Check Consistency**:\n   - Ensure that the mappings are consistent throughout the strings.\n   - In this case, all mappings are consistent and no two characters map to the same character in either direction.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all characters map consistently and uniquely, the strings \"bby\" and \"pir\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
