    "To determine if the two strings \"atwwf\" and \"lwfpc\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, check if the two strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"atwwf\" and \"lwfpc\" have a length of 5, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to keep track of the character mappings from the first string to the second and vice versa.\n   - Let's denote the first string as `s1 = \"atwwf\"` and the second string as `s2 = \"lwfpc\"`.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map Characters**:\n   - Iterate through each character in the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters `(char1, char2)` from `s1` and `s2`:\n     - Check if `char1` is already mapped to a character in `s2`. If it is, ensure it maps to `char2`.\n     - Check if `char2` is already mapped to a character in `s1`. If it is, ensure it maps to `char1`.\n     - If either of these checks fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If both checks pass, record the mapping from `char1` to `char2` and from `char2` to `char1`.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For the first pair `(a, l)`, map `a` to `l` and `l` to `a`.\n   - For the second pair `(t, w)`, map `t` to `w` and `w` to `t`.\n   - For the third pair `(w, f)`, map `w` to `f` and `f` to `w`.\n   - For the fourth pair `(w, p)`, check the existing mapping for `w`. It should map to `f`, but here it maps to `p`, which is a conflict.\n   - Since there is a conflict in mapping `w` to two different characters (`f` and `p`), the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since we found a conflict in the character mapping, the strings \"atwwf\" and \"lwfpc\" are not isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
