    "To determine if the two strings \"htmgqlfpw\" and \"zlatoqjnu\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"htmgqlfpw\" and \"zlatoqjnu\" have a length of 9, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings from characters in the first string to characters in the second string and vice versa.\n   - Iterate through each character pair (c1, c2) from the two strings simultaneously.\n\n3. **Mapping Validation**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2):\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a different character in the second string. If it is, return False.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a different character in the first string. If it is, return False.\n     - If neither of the above conditions is met, establish the mapping c1 -> c2 and c2 -> c1.\n\n4. **Iterate through the strings**:\n   - For \"htmgqlfpw\" and \"zlatoqjnu\":\n     - h -> z\n     - t -> l\n     - m -> a\n     - g -> t\n     - q -> o\n     - l -> q\n     - f -> j\n     - p -> n\n     - w -> u\n\n5. **Check for Consistency**:\n   - Ensure that each character in the first string maps to exactly one character in the second string and vice versa.\n   - In this case, each character from \"htmgqlfpw\" maps uniquely to a character in \"zlatoqjnu\" and vice versa.\n\nSince all characters map uniquely and consistently between the two strings, they are isomorphic.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<True>>>"
