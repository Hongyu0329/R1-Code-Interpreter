    "To determine if the two strings \"xnxu\" and \"lnar\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"xnxu\" and \"lnar\" have a length of 4, so we proceed.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - Also, create a reverse mapping from characters in the second string to characters in the first string to ensure no two characters map to the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from the two strings:\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string.\n     - If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c1 is not mapped, check if c2 is already mapped to another character. If it is, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c2 is not mapped, create a new mapping from c1 to c2 and vice versa.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Mapping**:\n   - Pair 1: ('x', 'l')\n     - 'x' is not mapped yet, and 'l' is not mapped yet. Map 'x' to 'l' and 'l' to 'x'.\n   - Pair 2: ('n', 'n')\n     - 'n' is not mapped yet, and 'n' is not mapped yet. Map 'n' to 'n'.\n   - Pair 3: ('x', 'a')\n     - 'x' is already mapped to 'l', but now it needs to map to 'a'. This is a conflict, so the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is a conflict in mapping 'x' to two different characters ('l' and 'a'), the strings \"xnxu\" and \"lnar\" are not isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
