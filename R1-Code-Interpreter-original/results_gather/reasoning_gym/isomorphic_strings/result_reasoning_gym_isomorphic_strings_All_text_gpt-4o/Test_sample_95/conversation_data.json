    "To determine if the two strings \"tt\" and \"mw\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, check if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If they are not, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"tt\" and \"mw\" have a length of 2, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one character mapping from the first string to the second string.\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps): one for mapping characters from the first string to the second, and another for mapping characters from the second string to the first. This ensures that no two characters map to the same character in either direction.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through the characters of both strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"tt\" and c2 from \"mw\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the first dictionary. If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, add the mapping c1 -> c2.\n     - Similarly, check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the second dictionary. If it is, ensure it maps to c1. If not, add the mapping c2 -> c1.\n   - If at any point, the existing mapping does not match the current character pair, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n4. **Apply to \"tt\" and \"mw\"**:\n   - For the first character pair ('t', 'm'):\n     - 't' is not mapped yet, so map 't' -> 'm'.\n     - 'm' is not mapped yet, so map 'm' -> 't'.\n   - For the second character pair ('t', 'w'):\n     - 't' is already mapped to 'm', but now it needs to map to 'w'. This is a conflict, as 't' cannot map to two different characters ('m' and 'w').\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is a conflict in the mapping for 't', the strings \"tt\" and \"mw\" are not isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
