    "To determine if the two strings \"fvdz\" and \"swkd\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"fvdz\" and \"swkd\" both have a length of 4, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - Also, create a reverse mapping from characters in the second string to characters in the first string to ensure no two characters map to the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character pair (c1, c2) from the two strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair:\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string.\n     - If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c1 is not mapped, check if c2 is already mapped to another character. If it is, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c2 is not mapped, create a new mapping from c1 to c2 and vice versa.\n\n4. **Apply the Steps**:\n   - For the first pair ('f', 's'):\n     - 'f' is not mapped, and 's' is not mapped. Map 'f' to 's' and 's' to 'f'.\n   - For the second pair ('v', 'w'):\n     - 'v' is not mapped, and 'w' is not mapped. Map 'v' to 'w' and 'w' to 'v'.\n   - For the third pair ('d', 'k'):\n     - 'd' is not mapped, and 'k' is not mapped. Map 'd' to 'k' and 'k' to 'd'.\n   - For the fourth pair ('z', 'd'):\n     - 'z' is not mapped, and 'd' is not mapped. Map 'z' to 'd' and 'd' to 'z'.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - All character pairs have been successfully mapped without conflicts.\n   - Therefore, the strings \"fvdz\" and \"swkd\" are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
