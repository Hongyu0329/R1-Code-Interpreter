    "To determine if the two strings \"hdwd\" and \"cini\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"hdwd\" and \"cini\" both have a length of 4, so we proceed.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one mapping between characters of the first string (\"hdwd\") and the second string (\"cini\").\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps): one for mapping characters from \"hdwd\" to \"cini\" and another for mapping characters from \"cini\" to \"hdwd\". This ensures that no two characters map to the same character in either direction.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (char1 from \"hdwd\" and char2 from \"cini\"):\n     - Check if char1 is already mapped to a character in the first dictionary:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to char2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If char1 is not mapped, add the mapping char1 -> char2 to the first dictionary.\n     - Similarly, check if char2 is already mapped to a character in the second dictionary:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to char1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If char2 is not mapped, add the mapping char2 -> char1 to the second dictionary.\n\n4. **Check Each Pair**:\n   - For \"hdwd\" and \"cini\":\n     - 'h' maps to 'c', and 'c' maps to 'h'.\n     - 'd' maps to 'i', and 'i' maps to 'd'.\n     - 'w' maps to 'n', and 'n' maps to 'w'.\n     - 'd' (again) maps to 'i', and 'i' (again) maps to 'd'.\n   - All mappings are consistent and one-to-one.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all characters map correctly and consistently, the strings \"hdwd\" and \"cini\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
