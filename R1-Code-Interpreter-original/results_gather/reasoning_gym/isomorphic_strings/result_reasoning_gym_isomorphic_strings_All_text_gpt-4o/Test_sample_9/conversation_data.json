    "To determine if the two strings \"jtwuldk\" and \"rzwqltd\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"jtwuldk\" and \"rzwqltd\" have a length of 7, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - Also, create a reverse mapping from characters in the second string to characters in the first string to ensure no two characters map to the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from the first and second strings respectively:\n     - If c1 is already mapped to a character, check if it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c2 is already mapped to a character, check if it maps to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If neither character is mapped, create a new mapping from c1 to c2 and from c2 to c1.\n\n4. **Check Each Character Pair**:\n   - For \"jtwuldk\" and \"rzwqltd\":\n     - 'j' maps to 'r', and 'r' maps to 'j'.\n     - 't' maps to 'z', and 'z' maps to 't'.\n     - 'w' maps to 'w', and 'w' maps to 'w'.\n     - 'u' maps to 'q', and 'q' maps to 'u'.\n     - 'l' maps to 'l', and 'l' maps to 'l'.\n     - 'd' maps to 't', and 't' maps to 'd'.\n     - 'k' maps to 'd', and 'd' maps to 'k'.\n\n5. **Verify Mapping**:\n   - Ensure that the mapping is consistent throughout the strings.\n   - In this case, each character from the first string maps uniquely to a character in the second string and vice versa.\n\nSince all character mappings are consistent and no two characters map to the same character, the strings \"jtwuldk\" and \"rzwqltd\" are isomorphic.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<True>>>"
