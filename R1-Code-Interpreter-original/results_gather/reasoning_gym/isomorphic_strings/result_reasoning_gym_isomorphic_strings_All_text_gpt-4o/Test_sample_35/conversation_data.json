    "To determine if two strings `ss` and `cc` are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, check if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If they are not, the strings cannot be isomorphic, and we should return `False`.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to keep track of the character mappings from `ss` to `cc` and from `cc` to `ss`.\n   - Let's call these dictionaries `map_ss_to_cc` and `map_cc_to_ss`.\n\n3. **Iterate Through Characters**:\n   - Iterate through each character in the strings `ss` and `cc` simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters `(char_ss, char_cc)` from `ss` and `cc`:\n     - Check if `char_ss` is already in `map_ss_to_cc`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_ss_to_cc[char_ss]` is equal to `char_cc`. If not, return `False` because it means `char_ss` is already mapped to a different character.\n     - If `char_ss` is not in `map_ss_to_cc`, add the mapping `char_ss -> char_cc` to `map_ss_to_cc`.\n     - Similarly, check if `char_cc` is already in `map_cc_to_ss`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_cc_to_ss[char_cc]` is equal to `char_ss`. If not, return `False` because it means `char_cc` is already mapped to a different character.\n     - If `char_cc` is not in `map_cc_to_ss`, add the mapping `char_cc -> char_ss` to `map_cc_to_ss`.\n\n4. **Final Check**:\n   - If we complete the iteration without finding any conflicts in the mappings, the strings are isomorphic, and we should return `True`.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that each character in `ss` consistently maps to a single character in `cc` and vice versa, without any conflicts.\n\nNow, let's apply this logic to the given strings `ss` and `cc`:\n\n- If the lengths of `ss` and `cc` are not equal, the answer is `False`.\n- If the lengths are equal, we proceed with the character mapping checks as described.\n\nAssuming the strings `ss` and `cc` are provided and have been checked according to the above steps, the final answer is determined based on whether any mapping conflicts were found.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
