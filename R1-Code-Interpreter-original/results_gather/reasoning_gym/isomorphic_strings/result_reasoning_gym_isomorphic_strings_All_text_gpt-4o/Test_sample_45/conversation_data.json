    "To determine if the two strings \"qpaoy\" and \"xobpl\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"qpaoy\" and \"xobpl\" have a length of 5, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - Let's denote these dictionaries as `map1` for mapping from \"qpaoy\" to \"xobpl\" and `map2` for mapping from \"xobpl\" to \"qpaoy\".\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"qpaoy\" and c2 from \"xobpl\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already in `map1`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map1[c1]` is equal to c2. If not, return False.\n     - If c1 is not in `map1`, add the mapping `map1[c1] = c2`.\n     - Similarly, check if c2 is already in `map2`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map2[c2]` is equal to c1. If not, return False.\n     - If c2 is not in `map2`, add the mapping `map2[c2] = c1`.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - Let's apply the above logic to the given strings:\n     - Pair 1: ('q', 'x')\n       - `map1`: {'q': 'x'}\n       - `map2`: {'x': 'q'}\n     - Pair 2: ('p', 'o')\n       - `map1`: {'q': 'x', 'p': 'o'}\n       - `map2`: {'x': 'q', 'o': 'p'}\n     - Pair 3: ('a', 'b')\n       - `map1`: {'q': 'x', 'p': 'o', 'a': 'b'}\n       - `map2`: {'x': 'q', 'o': 'p', 'b': 'a'}\n     - Pair 4: ('o', 'p')\n       - `map1`: {'q': 'x', 'p': 'o', 'a': 'b', 'o': 'p'}\n       - `map2`: {'x': 'q', 'o': 'p', 'b': 'a', 'p': 'o'}\n     - Pair 5: ('y', 'l')\n       - `map1`: {'q': 'x', 'p': 'o', 'a': 'b', 'o': 'p', 'y': 'l'}\n       - `map2`: {'x': 'q', 'o': 'p', 'b': 'a', 'p': 'o', 'l': 'y'}\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - After processing all character pairs, if no conflicts were found in the mappings, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nSince all character mappings are consistent and no two characters map to the same character, the strings \"qpaoy\" and \"xobpl\" are isomorphic.\n\n<<<True>>>"
