    "To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to ensure that there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Let's analyze the given strings step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Strings**: The two strings provided are \"j\" and \"a\".\n\n2. **Check Lengths**: \n   - Both strings have a length of 1. \n   - Since they are of equal length, we can proceed to the next step. If they were of different lengths, they could not be isomorphic.\n\n3. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - For the first string \"j\" and the second string \"a\", we map 'j' to 'a'.\n\n4. **Check for Consistent Mapping**:\n   - Since both strings are of length 1, there is only one character in each string to map.\n   - The mapping 'j' -> 'a' is consistent because there are no other characters to consider.\n\n5. **Check for Unique Mapping**:\n   - No two characters in the first string map to the same character in the second string, as there is only one character in each string.\n   - A character can map to itself, but in this case, 'j' maps to 'a', which is allowed as long as the mapping is consistent and unique.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all conditions for isomorphism are satisfied (consistent and unique mapping), the two strings \"j\" and \"a\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
