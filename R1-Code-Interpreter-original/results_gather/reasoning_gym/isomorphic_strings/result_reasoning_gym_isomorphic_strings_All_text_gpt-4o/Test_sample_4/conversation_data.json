    "To determine if the two strings \"dcxeju\" and \"symfpn\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"dcxeju\" and \"symfpn\" have a length of 6, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings from characters in the first string to characters in the second string and vice versa.\n   - Let's denote the first string as `s1 = \"dcxeju\"` and the second string as `s2 = \"symfpn\"`.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character in the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters `(c1, c2)` from `s1` and `s2`:\n     - Check if `c1` is already mapped to a character in `s2`. If it is, ensure it maps to `c2`.\n     - Check if `c2` is already mapped to a character in `s1`. If it is, ensure it maps to `c1`.\n     - If either of these checks fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If both checks pass, record the mapping `c1 -> c2` and `c2 -> c1`.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For the given strings:\n     - 'd' maps to 's'\n     - 'c' maps to 'y'\n     - 'x' maps to 'm'\n     - 'e' maps to 'f'\n     - 'j' maps to 'p'\n     - 'u' maps to 'n'\n   - There are no conflicts in the mappings, and each character in `s1` maps to a unique character in `s2` and vice versa.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all characters map uniquely and consistently between the two strings, they are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
