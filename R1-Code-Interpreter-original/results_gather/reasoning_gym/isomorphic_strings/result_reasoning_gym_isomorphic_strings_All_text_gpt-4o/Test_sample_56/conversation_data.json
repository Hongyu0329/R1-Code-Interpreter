    "To determine if the two strings \"ghedkypk\" and \"vmnrkyqv\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"ghedkypk\" and \"vmnrkyqv\" have a length of 8, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings from characters in the first string to characters in the second string and vice versa.\n   - Iterate through each character pair (c1, c2) from the two strings simultaneously.\n\n3. **Mapping Validation**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2):\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string. If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the first string. If it is, ensure it maps to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If neither c1 nor c2 is mapped, create a new mapping from c1 to c2 and from c2 to c1.\n\n4. **Iterate through the strings**:\n   - For \"ghedkypk\" and \"vmnrkyqv\":\n     - g -> v\n     - h -> m\n     - e -> n\n     - d -> r\n     - k -> k\n     - y -> y\n     - p -> q\n     - k -> v (This is where the mapping fails because 'k' is already mapped to 'k', but now it needs to map to 'v'.)\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the mapping fails at the last character pair, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
