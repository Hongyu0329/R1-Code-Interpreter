    "To determine if the two strings \"tq\" and \"wl\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, ensure that both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"tq\" has a length of 2, and \"wl\" also has a length of 2. So, they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a one-to-one character mapping from the first string to the second string.\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps): one for mapping characters from the first string to the second, and another for mapping characters from the second string to the first. This ensures that no two characters map to the same character in either direction.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"tq\" and c2 from \"wl\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string. If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the first string. If it is, ensure it maps to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If neither character is mapped, create a new mapping for both c1 to c2 and c2 to c1.\n\n4. **Apply the Mapping**:\n   - For the first pair of characters ('t' from \"tq\" and 'w' from \"wl\"):\n     - 't' is not mapped yet, and 'w' is not mapped yet. So, map 't' to 'w' and 'w' to 't'.\n   - For the second pair of characters ('q' from \"tq\" and 'l' from \"wl\"):\n     - 'q' is not mapped yet, and 'l' is not mapped yet. So, map 'q' to 'l' and 'l' to 'q'.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - If we can iterate through all characters without any conflicts in mapping, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nSince all steps are satisfied without any conflicts, the strings \"tq\" and \"wl\" are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>."
