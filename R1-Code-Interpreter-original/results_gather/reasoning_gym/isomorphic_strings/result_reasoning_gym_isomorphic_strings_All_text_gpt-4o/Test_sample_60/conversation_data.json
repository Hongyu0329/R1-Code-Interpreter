    "To determine if the two strings \"icuztaax\" and \"kbzewlxl\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - Both strings must be of the same length to be isomorphic. \n   - \"icuztaax\" has 8 characters, and \"kbzewlxl\" also has 8 characters. \n   - Since the lengths are equal, we can proceed.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to create a mapping from each character in the first string to a character in the second string.\n   - We also need to ensure that no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Create two dictionaries: `map_s1_to_s2` for mapping characters from \"icuztaax\" to \"kbzewlxl\" and `map_s2_to_s1` for the reverse mapping.\n   - Iterate through each character pair (c1, c2) from \"icuztaax\" and \"kbzewlxl\".\n\n4. **Mapping Validation**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2):\n     - Check if c1 is already in `map_s1_to_s2`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_s1_to_s2[c1]` is equal to c2. If not, return False.\n     - If c1 is not in `map_s1_to_s2`, add the mapping `map_s1_to_s2[c1] = c2`.\n     - Similarly, check if c2 is already in `map_s2_to_s1`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map_s2_to_s1[c2]` is equal to c1. If not, return False.\n     - If c2 is not in `map_s2_to_s1`, add the mapping `map_s2_to_s1[c2] = c1`.\n\n5. **Character Pair Analysis**:\n   - i -> k: Add to map_s1_to_s2 and map_s2_to_s1.\n   - c -> b: Add to map_s1_to_s2 and map_s2_to_s1.\n   - u -> z: Add to map_s1_to_s2 and map_s2_to_s1.\n   - z -> e: Add to map_s1_to_s2 and map_s2_to_s1.\n   - t -> w: Add to map_s1_to_s2 and map_s2_to_s1.\n   - a -> l: Add to map_s1_to_s2 and map_s2_to_s1.\n   - a -> l: Check existing mapping, valid.\n   - x -> x: Add to map_s1_to_s2 and map_s2_to_s1.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - All character mappings are consistent and valid.\n   - No conflicts were found in the mappings.\n\nTherefore, the two strings \"icuztaax\" and \"kbzewlxl\" are isomorphic.\n\n<<<True>>>"
