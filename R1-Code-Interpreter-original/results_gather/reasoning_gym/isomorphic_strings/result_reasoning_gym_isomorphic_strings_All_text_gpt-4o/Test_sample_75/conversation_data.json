    "To determine if the two strings \"zkzay\" and \"zqpyh\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - Both strings must be of the same length to be isomorphic. \n   - \"zkzay\" and \"zqpyh\" both have a length of 5, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to create a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - We also need to ensure that no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Initialize two dictionaries: one for mapping characters from the first string to the second (`map1`) and another for mapping characters from the second string to the first (`map2`).\n   - Iterate through each character pair from both strings simultaneously.\n\n4. **Mapping Process**:\n   - For the first character pair ('z', 'z'):\n     - 'z' from the first string maps to 'z' in the second string.\n     - Update `map1` with {'z': 'z'} and `map2` with {'z': 'z'}.\n   - For the second character pair ('k', 'q'):\n     - 'k' from the first string maps to 'q' in the second string.\n     - Update `map1` with {'z': 'z', 'k': 'q'} and `map2` with {'z': 'z', 'q': 'k'}.\n   - For the third character pair ('z', 'p'):\n     - 'z' from the first string is already mapped to 'z' in the second string, but now it needs to map to 'p'.\n     - This is a conflict because a character cannot map to two different characters.\n     - Therefore, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since we found a conflict in the mapping, the strings \"zkzay\" and \"zqpyh\" are not isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
