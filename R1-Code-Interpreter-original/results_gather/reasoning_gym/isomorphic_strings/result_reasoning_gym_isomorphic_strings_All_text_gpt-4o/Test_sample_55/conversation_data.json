    "To determine if the two strings \"iugg\" and \"eszl\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, check if the two strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"iugg\" and \"eszl\" have a length of 4, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to keep track of the character mappings from the first string to the second and vice versa.\n   - Let's denote the first string as `s1 = \"iugg\"` and the second string as `s2 = \"eszl\"`.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map Characters**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters `(c1, c2)` from `s1` and `s2`:\n     - Check if `c1` is already mapped to a character in `s2`. If it is, ensure it maps to `c2`.\n     - Check if `c2` is already mapped to a character in `s1`. If it is, ensure it maps to `c1`.\n     - If either of these checks fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If both checks pass, record the mapping `c1 -> c2` and `c2 -> c1`.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping Process**:\n   - For the first pair `(i, e)`: \n     - `i` is not mapped yet, and `e` is not mapped yet. Map `i -> e` and `e -> i`.\n   - For the second pair `(u, s)`:\n     - `u` is not mapped yet, and `s` is not mapped yet. Map `u -> s` and `s -> u`.\n   - For the third pair `(g, z)`:\n     - `g` is not mapped yet, and `z` is not mapped yet. Map `g -> z` and `z -> g`.\n   - For the fourth pair `(g, l)`:\n     - `g` is already mapped to `z`, but here it is paired with `l`. This is a contradiction, so the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since we found a contradiction in the mapping process, the strings \"iugg\" and \"eszl\" are not isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
