    "To determine if the two strings \"evcrfmwl\" and \"hpawusgk\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - Both strings must be of the same length to be isomorphic. \n   - \"evcrfmwl\" has 8 characters, and \"hpawusgk\" also has 8 characters. \n   - Since the lengths are equal, we can proceed.\n\n2. **Initialize Mappings**:\n   - We need two dictionaries (or hash maps) to keep track of the mappings:\n     - `map_s1_to_s2` for mapping characters from the first string to the second string.\n     - `map_s2_to_s1` for mapping characters from the second string to the first string.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map Characters**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from the strings \"evcrfmwl\" and \"hpawusgk\":\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in `map_s1_to_s2`.\n       - If it is, ensure that it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in `map_s2_to_s1`.\n       - If it is, ensure that it maps to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If neither character is mapped, create a new mapping: c1 -> c2 in `map_s1_to_s2` and c2 -> c1 in `map_s2_to_s1`.\n\n4. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Let's map each character step by step:\n     - 'e' -> 'h', 'h' -> 'e'\n     - 'v' -> 'p', 'p' -> 'v'\n     - 'c' -> 'a', 'a' -> 'c'\n     - 'r' -> 'w', 'w' -> 'r'\n     - 'f' -> 'u', 'u' -> 'f'\n     - 'm' -> 's', 's' -> 'm'\n     - 'w' -> 'g', 'g' -> 'w'\n     - 'l' -> 'k', 'k' -> 'l'\n\n5. **Verify Mappings**:\n   - After processing all characters, ensure that all mappings are consistent and no two characters map to the same character in either direction.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all characters map consistently and uniquely between the two strings, the strings \"evcrfmwl\" and \"hpawusgk\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
