    "To determine if the two strings \"oiducczb\" and \"rfxszztj\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - Both strings must be of the same length to be isomorphic. \n   - \"oiducczb\" has 8 characters, and \"rfxszztj\" also has 8 characters. \n   - Since the lengths are equal, we can proceed to the next step.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to create a mapping from each character in \"oiducczb\" to a character in \"rfxszztj\".\n   - We also need to ensure that no two characters from \"oiducczb\" map to the same character in \"rfxszztj\".\n\n3. **Mapping Process**:\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps): one for mapping characters from \"oiducczb\" to \"rfxszztj\" and another for the reverse mapping.\n   - Iterate through each character pair from both strings simultaneously.\n\n4. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Pair 1: 'o' -> 'r'\n     - Map 'o' to 'r' and 'r' to 'o'.\n   - Pair 2: 'i' -> 'f'\n     - Map 'i' to 'f' and 'f' to 'i'.\n   - Pair 3: 'd' -> 'x'\n     - Map 'd' to 'x' and 'x' to 'd'.\n   - Pair 4: 'u' -> 's'\n     - Map 'u' to 's' and 's' to 'u'.\n   - Pair 5: 'c' -> 'z'\n     - Map 'c' to 'z' and 'z' to 'c'.\n   - Pair 6: 'c' -> 'z'\n     - 'c' is already mapped to 'z', which is consistent.\n   - Pair 7: 'z' -> 't'\n     - Map 'z' to 't' and 't' to 'z'.\n   - Pair 8: 'b' -> 'j'\n     - Map 'b' to 'j' and 'j' to 'b'.\n\n5. **Validation**:\n   - Ensure that the mapping is consistent throughout the strings.\n   - Check that no two characters from \"oiducczb\" map to the same character in \"rfxszztj\" and vice versa.\n   - The mappings are consistent and one-to-one.\n\nSince all character mappings are consistent and no two characters map to the same character, the strings \"oiducczb\" and \"rfxszztj\" are isomorphic.\n\nFinal answer: <<<True>>>."
