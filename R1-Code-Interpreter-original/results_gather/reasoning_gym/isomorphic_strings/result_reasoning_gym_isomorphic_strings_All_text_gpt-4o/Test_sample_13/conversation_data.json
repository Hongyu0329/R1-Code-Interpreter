    "To determine if the two strings \"uwdap\" and \"ajemq\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"uwdap\" and \"ajemq\" both have a length of 5, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - Let's denote these dictionaries as `map1` for mapping from \"uwdap\" to \"ajemq\" and `map2` for mapping from \"ajemq\" to \"uwdap\".\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"uwdap\" and c2 from \"ajemq\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already in `map1`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map1[c1]` is equal to c2. If not, return False.\n       - If it is not, add the mapping `map1[c1] = c2`.\n     - Check if c2 is already in `map2`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map2[c2]` is equal to c1. If not, return False.\n       - If it is not, add the mapping `map2[c2] = c1`.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For \"uwdap\" and \"ajemq\":\n     - 'u' maps to 'a', and 'a' maps to 'u'.\n     - 'w' maps to 'j', and 'j' maps to 'w'.\n     - 'd' maps to 'e', and 'e' maps to 'd'.\n     - 'a' maps to 'm', and 'm' maps to 'a'.\n     - 'p' maps to 'q', and 'q' maps to 'p'.\n\n5. **Check for Consistency**:\n   - Ensure that no two different characters in \"uwdap\" map to the same character in \"ajemq\" and vice versa.\n   - The mappings are consistent and one-to-one.\n\nSince all characters map consistently and the mappings are one-to-one, the strings \"uwdap\" and \"ajemq\" are isomorphic.\n\n<<<True>>>"
