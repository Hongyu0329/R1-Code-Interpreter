    "To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to ensure that there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Let's analyze the given strings step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Strings**: The two strings provided are \"z\" and \"q\".\n\n2. **Check Lengths**: \n   - Both strings have a length of 1. For two strings to be isomorphic, they must be of the same length. Since both strings have the same length, we can proceed to the next step.\n\n3. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to establish a mapping from each character in the first string to a character in the second string.\n   - For the string \"z\", the only character is 'z'.\n   - For the string \"q\", the only character is 'q'.\n   - We can map 'z' to 'q'.\n\n4. **Check for Unique Mapping**:\n   - Ensure that no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string.\n   - Since there is only one character in each string, this condition is trivially satisfied.\n\n5. **Check for Consistent Mapping**:\n   - Ensure that the mapping is consistent throughout the strings. Since both strings are of length 1, this condition is also trivially satisfied.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all conditions for isomorphism are satisfied, the strings \"z\" and \"q\" are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
