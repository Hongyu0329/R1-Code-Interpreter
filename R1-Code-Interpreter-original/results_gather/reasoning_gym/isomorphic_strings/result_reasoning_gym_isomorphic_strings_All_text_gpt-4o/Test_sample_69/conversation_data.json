    "To determine if the two strings \"imkmr\" and \"jdwof\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"imkmr\" has 5 characters, and \"jdwof\" also has 5 characters. So, they pass the length check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries (or hash maps) to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - Let's denote these dictionaries as `map1` for mapping from \"imkmr\" to \"jdwof\" and `map2` for mapping from \"jdwof\" to \"imkmr\".\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"imkmr\" and c2 from \"jdwof\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already in `map1`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map1[c1]` is equal to c2. If not, return False.\n       - If it is not, add the mapping `map1[c1] = c2`.\n     - Check if c2 is already in `map2`:\n       - If it is, ensure that `map2[c2]` is equal to c1. If not, return False.\n       - If it is not, add the mapping `map2[c2] = c1`.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For \"imkmr\" and \"jdwof\":\n     - i -> j: Add to `map1` and `map2`.\n     - m -> d: Add to `map1` and `map2`.\n     - k -> w: Add to `map1` and `map2`.\n     - m -> o: Check `map1` and `map2`. Here, `map1[m]` is already mapped to 'd', but now it needs to map to 'o', which is a conflict. Therefore, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is a conflict in the mapping (m is mapped to both d and o), the strings \"imkmr\" and \"jdwof\" are not isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
