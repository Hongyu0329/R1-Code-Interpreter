    "To determine if the two strings \"ygwuvzhcz\" and \"zicgwymly\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both strings \"ygwuvzhcz\" and \"zicgwymly\" have a length of 9, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - As we iterate through the characters of both strings, we will populate these dictionaries.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - For each character pair (c1, c2) from the strings \"ygwuvzhcz\" and \"zicgwymly\":\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string. If it is, ensure it maps to c2.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the first string. If it is, ensure it maps to c1.\n     - If either of these checks fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If both checks pass, add the mapping c1 -> c2 and c2 -> c1 to the respective dictionaries.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - Let's go through the characters:\n     - 'y' -> 'z'\n     - 'g' -> 'i'\n     - 'w' -> 'c'\n     - 'u' -> 'g'\n     - 'v' -> 'w'\n     - 'z' -> 'y'\n     - 'h' -> 'm'\n     - 'c' -> 'l'\n     - 'z' -> 'y' (already mapped correctly)\n     - 'l' -> 'y' (conflict: 'z' is already mapped to 'y')\n\n5. **Conflict Detection**:\n   - When we reach the last character 'l' in the second string, we find that 'y' is already mapped to 'z', which creates a conflict because 'l' cannot map to 'y' if 'z' is already mapped to 'y'.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is a conflict in the mapping, the strings \"ygwuvzhcz\" and \"zicgwymly\" are not isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
