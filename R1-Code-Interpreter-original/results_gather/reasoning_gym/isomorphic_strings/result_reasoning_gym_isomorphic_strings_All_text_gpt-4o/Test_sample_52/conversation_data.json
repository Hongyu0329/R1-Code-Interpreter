    "To determine if the two strings \"vkdkra\" and \"hgkoul\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"vkdkra\" and \"hgkoul\" have a length of 6, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to map characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - This ensures that no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string and vice versa.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"vkdkra\" and c2 from \"hgkoul\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string. If it is, ensure it maps to c2.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the first string. If it is, ensure it maps to c1.\n     - If either of these checks fails, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If both checks pass, add the mapping c1 -> c2 and c2 -> c1 to the respective dictionaries.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - v -> h, k -> g, d -> k, k -> o, r -> u, a -> l\n   - Check if these mappings are consistent:\n     - v maps to h, and h maps back to v.\n     - k maps to g, and g maps back to k.\n     - d maps to k, and k maps back to d (this is a conflict because k is already mapped to g).\n     - r maps to u, and u maps back to r.\n     - a maps to l, and l maps back to a.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The mapping d -> k conflicts with the previous mapping k -> g, which violates the rule that no two characters may map to the same character.\n   - Therefore, the strings \"vkdkra\" and \"hgkoul\" are not isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<False>>>."
