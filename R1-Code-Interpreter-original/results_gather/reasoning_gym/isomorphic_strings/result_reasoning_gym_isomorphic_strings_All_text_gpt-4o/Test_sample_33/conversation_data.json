    "To determine if the two strings \"ememihq\" and \"ththjua\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"ememihq\" and \"ththjua\" have a length of 7, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n   - This ensures that no two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string and vice versa.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character of the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters (c1 from \"ememihq\" and c2 from \"ththjua\"):\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - Check if c2 is already mapped to a character in the first string:\n       - If it is, ensure it maps to c1. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If neither character is mapped, create a new mapping from c1 to c2 and from c2 to c1.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - e -> t, m -> h, e -> t, m -> h, i -> j, h -> u, q -> a\n   - Check the reverse mapping:\n     - t -> e, h -> m, t -> e, h -> m, j -> i, u -> h, a -> q\n\n5. **Validation**:\n   - Ensure that all mappings are consistent throughout the strings.\n   - In this case, all mappings are consistent, and no two characters map to the same character in either direction.\n\nSince all checks are satisfied, the strings \"ememihq\" and \"ththjua\" are isomorphic.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>."
