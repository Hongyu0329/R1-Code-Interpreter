    "To determine if the two strings \"qm\" and \"sy\" are isomorphic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: \n   - First, check if the two strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - \"qm\" and \"sy\" both have a length of 2, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create a mapping from characters in the first string to characters in the second string.\n   - Also, create a reverse mapping from characters in the second string to characters in the first string to ensure that no two characters map to the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character pair (c1, c2) from the two strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair:\n     - Check if c1 is already mapped to a character in the second string.\n     - If it is, ensure that it maps to c2. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c1 is not mapped, check if c2 is already mapped to another character. If it is, the strings are not isomorphic.\n     - If c2 is not mapped, create a new mapping from c1 to c2 and vice versa.\n\n4. **Apply to \"qm\" and \"sy\"**:\n   - Pair 1: ('q', 's')\n     - 'q' is not mapped yet, and 's' is not mapped yet. Create mapping: 'q' -> 's' and 's' -> 'q'.\n   - Pair 2: ('m', 'y')\n     - 'm' is not mapped yet, and 'y' is not mapped yet. Create mapping: 'm' -> 'y' and 'y' -> 'm'.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - After processing all character pairs, if no conflicts were found, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nSince all character pairs from \"qm\" and \"sy\" can be mapped uniquely without conflicts, the strings are isomorphic.\n\n<<<True>>>"
