    "To determine if the two strings \"cuzuexe\" and \"mvpvtya\" are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string to the characters of the second string. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Length Check**: \n   - First, check if both strings have the same length. If they don't, they cannot be isomorphic.\n   - Both \"cuzuexe\" and \"mvpvtya\" have a length of 7, so they pass this check.\n\n2. **Character Mapping**:\n   - Create two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings from characters in the first string to characters in the second string and vice versa.\n   - Let's denote the first string as `s1 = \"cuzuexe\"` and the second string as `s2 = \"mvpvtya\"`.\n\n3. **Iterate and Map**:\n   - Iterate through each character in the strings simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of characters `(char1, char2)` from `s1` and `s2`:\n     - Check if `char1` is already mapped to a different character in `s2`. If so, return False.\n     - Check if `char2` is already mapped to a different character in `s1`. If so, return False.\n     - If neither mapping exists, create a new mapping from `char1` to `char2` and vice versa.\n\n4. **Detailed Mapping**:\n   - For the first pair `(c, m)`, map `c` to `m` and `m` to `c`.\n   - For the second pair `(u, v)`, map `u` to `v` and `v` to `u`.\n   - For the third pair `(z, p)`, map `z` to `p` and `p` to `z`.\n   - For the fourth pair `(u, v)`, check the existing mapping. `u` is already mapped to `v`, and `v` is mapped to `u`, so it is consistent.\n   - For the fifth pair `(e, t)`, map `e` to `t` and `t` to `e`.\n   - For the sixth pair `(x, y)`, map `x` to `y` and `y` to `x`.\n   - For the seventh pair `(e, a)`, check the existing mapping. `e` is mapped to `t`, but now it needs to map to `a`, which is inconsistent.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the mapping for `e` is inconsistent (it cannot map to both `t` and `a`), the strings are not isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
