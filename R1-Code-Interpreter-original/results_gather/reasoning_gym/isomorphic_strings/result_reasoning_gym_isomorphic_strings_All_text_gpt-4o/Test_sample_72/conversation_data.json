    "To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to ensure that there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the first string and the characters of the second string. Let's analyze the given strings step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Strings**: The two strings provided are \"ll\" and \"nr\".\n\n2. **Check Lengths**: \n   - Both strings must be of the same length to be isomorphic. \n   - \"ll\" has a length of 2, and \"nr\" also has a length of 2. \n   - Since the lengths are equal, we can proceed to the next step.\n\n3. **Character Mapping**:\n   - We need to create a mapping from each character in the first string to a character in the second string.\n   - Initialize two dictionaries (or hash maps) to keep track of the mappings:\n     - `map_s_to_t` for mapping characters from the first string to the second string.\n     - `map_t_to_s` for mapping characters from the second string to the first string.\n\n4. **Iterate and Map Characters**:\n   - For the first character 'l' in \"ll\" and 'n' in \"nr\":\n     - Check if 'l' is already mapped to a character in `map_s_to_t`. It is not, so map 'l' to 'n'.\n     - Check if 'n' is already mapped to a character in `map_t_to_s`. It is not, so map 'n' to 'l'.\n   - For the second character 'l' in \"ll\" and 'r' in \"nr\":\n     - 'l' is already mapped to 'n' in `map_s_to_t`. Check if this mapping is consistent with the current character 'r' in \"nr\". It is not consistent because 'l' should map to 'n', not 'r'.\n     - Since the mapping is inconsistent, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The mapping inconsistency indicates that the strings \"ll\" and \"nr\" are not isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
