    "\nassistant > To find the total number of legs, we need to know the number of legs each type of animal has:\n\n- Ants: 6 legs\n- Shrimps: 10 legs\n- Lobsters: 10 legs\n- Bees: 6 legs\n- Fireflies: 6 legs\n- Sea slugs: 0 legs (they are mollusks and do not have legs)\n- Chickens: 2 legs\n- Leeches: 0 legs (they are annelids and do not have legs)\n- Elephants: 4 legs\n- Woodlice: 14 legs\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and summing the results.
