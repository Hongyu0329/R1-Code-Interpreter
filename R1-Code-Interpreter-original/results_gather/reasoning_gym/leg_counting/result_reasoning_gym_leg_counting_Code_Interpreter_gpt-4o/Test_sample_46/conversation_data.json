    "\nassistant > To calculate the total number of legs, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has:\n\n- Birds typically have 2 legs.\n- Starfish have 5 arms, but they don't have legs in the traditional sense, so we'll consider them as having 0 legs.\n- Tigers have 4 legs.\n- Crickets have 6 legs.\n- Jellyfish do not have legs, so we'll consider them as having 0 legs.\n- Dogs have 4 legs.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of legs:\n\n- Total legs from birds = 15 birds * 2 legs/bird\n- Total legs from starfish = 11 starfish * 0 legs/starfish\n- Total legs from tigers = 7 tigers * 4 legs/tiger\n- Total legs from crickets = 13 crickets * 6 legs/cricket\n- Total legs from jellyfish = 11 jellyfish * 0 legs/jellyfish\n- Total legs from dogs = 4 dogs * 4 legs/dog\n\nLet's calculate the total number of legs.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Number of animals\nbirds = 15\nstarfish = 11\ntigers = 7\ncrickets = 13\njellyfish = 11\ndogs = 4\n\n# Legs per animal\nlegs_per_bird = 2\nlegs_per_starfish = 0\nlegs_per_tiger = 4\nlegs_per_cricket = 6\nlegs_per_jellyfish = 0\nlegs_per_dog = 4\n\n# Total legs calculation\ntotal_legs = (birds * legs_per_bird +\n              starfish * legs_per_starfish +\n              tigers * legs_per_tiger +\n              crickets * legs_per_cricket +\n              jellyfish * legs_per_jellyfish +\n              dogs * legs_per_dog)\n\ntotal_legs\nassistant > The total number of legs is <<<152>>>."
