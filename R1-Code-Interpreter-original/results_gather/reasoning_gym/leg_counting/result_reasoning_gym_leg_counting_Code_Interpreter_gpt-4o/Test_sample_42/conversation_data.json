    "\nassistant > To calculate the total number of legs, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has:\n\n- Insects typically have 6 legs.\n- Humans have 2 legs.\n- Starfish have 5 arms, but they do not have legs in the traditional sense, so we will consider them as having 0 legs.\n- Cows have 4 legs.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of legs:\n\n- Total legs from insects = 15 insects * 6 legs/insect\n- Total legs from humans = 14 humans * 2 legs/human\n- Total legs from starfish = 15 starfish * 0 legs/starfish\n- Total legs from cows = 4 cows * 4 legs/cow\n\nLet's compute the total number of legs.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Number of animals\nnum_insects = 15\nnum_humans = 14\nnum_starfish = 15\nnum_cows = 4\n\n# Legs per animal\nlegs_per_insect = 6\nlegs_per_human = 2\nlegs_per_starfish = 0\nlegs_per_cow = 4\n\n# Total legs calculation\ntotal_legs = (num_insects * legs_per_insect +\n              num_humans * legs_per_human +\n              num_starfish * legs_per_starfish +\n              num_cows * legs_per_cow)\n\ntotal_legs\nassistant > The total number of legs is <<<134>>>."
