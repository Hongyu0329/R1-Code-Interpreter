    "\nassistant > To calculate the total number of legs, we need to know the number of legs each type of animal has:\n\n- Insects, wasps, ants, butterflies, and cockroaches are all insects, and they typically have 6 legs each.\n- Lions are mammals and have 4 legs each.\n- Birds typically have 2 legs each.\n- Jellyfish do not have legs.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs:\n\n- Insects: 1 insect × 6 legs = 6 legs\n- Wasps: 3 wasps × 6 legs = 18 legs\n- Lions: 7 lions × 4 legs = 28 legs\n- Birds: 11 birds × 2 legs = 22 legs\n- Ants: 6 ants × 6 legs = 36 legs\n- Jellyfish: 2 jellyfish × 0 legs = 0 legs\n- Butterflies: 5 butterflies × 6 legs = 30 legs\n- Cockroaches: 6 cockroaches × 6 legs = 36 legs\n\nLet's sum these up to get the total number of legs.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_insect = 6\nlegs_per_wasp = 6\nlegs_per_lion = 4\nlegs_per_bird = 2\nlegs_per_ant = 6\nlegs_per_jellyfish = 0\nlegs_per_butterfly = 6\nlegs_per_cockroach = 6\n\n# Number of each type of animal\nnum_insects = 1\nnum_wasps = 3\nnum_lions = 7\nnum_birds = 11\nnum_ants = 6\nnum_jellyfish = 2\nnum_butterflies = 5\nnum_cockroaches = 6\n\n# Total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_insects * legs_per_insect +\n              num_wasps * legs_per_wasp +\n              num_lions * legs_per_lion +\n              num_birds * legs_per_bird +\n              num_ants * legs_per_ant +\n              num_jellyfish * legs_per_jellyfish +\n              num_butterflies * legs_per_butterfly +\n              num_cockroaches * legs_per_cockroach)\n\ntotal_legs\nassistant > The total number of legs is <<<176>>>."
