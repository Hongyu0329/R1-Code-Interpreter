    "\nassistant > To find the total number of legs, we need to know the number of legs each type of animal has:\n\n- Praying mantis: 6 legs\n- Chicken: 2 legs\n- Duck: 2 legs\n- Bee: 6 legs\n- Jellyfish: 0 legs (they have tentacles, not legs)\n- Flatworm: 0 legs (they are legless)\n- Firefly: 6 legs\n- Insect: 6 legs (general category)\n- Bird: 2 legs (general category)\n- Cockroach: 6 legs\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and summing the results.
