    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Praying mantis: 6 legs\n- Scorpion: 8 legs\n- Firefly: 6 legs\n- Crab: 10 legs\n- Beetle: 6 legs\n- Woodlouse: 14 legs\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type has, and then summing all these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"praying_mantis\": 6,\n    \"scorpion\": 8,\n    \"firefly\": 6,\n    \"crab\": 10,\n    \"beetle\": 6,\n    \"woodlouse\": 14\n}\n\n# Number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"praying_mantis\": 12,\n    \"scorpion\": 1,\n    \"firefly\": 14,\n    \"crab\": 15,\n    \"beetle\": 1,\n    \"woodlouse\": 15\n}\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * animal_counts[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the total number of legs for the given list of animals. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
