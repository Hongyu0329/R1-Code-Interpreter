    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Praying mantis: 6 legs\n- Cow: 4 legs\n- Wasp: 6 legs\n- Butterfly: 6 legs\n- Cricket: 6 legs\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of legs for praying mantises: \\(9 \\times 6\\)\n2. Calculate the total number of legs for cows: \\(13 \\times 4\\)\n3. Calculate the total number of legs for wasps: \\(2 \\times 6\\)\n4. Calculate the total number of legs for butterflies: \\(9 \\times 6\\)\n5. Calculate the total number of legs for crickets: \\(2 \\times 6\\)\n\nFinally, sum all these values to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_mantis = 6\nlegs_per_cow = 4\nlegs_per_wasp = 6\nlegs_per_butterfly = 6\nlegs_per_cricket = 6\n\n# Number of each type of animal\nnum_mantises = 9\nnum_cows = 13\nnum_wasps = 2\nnum_butterflies = 9\nnum_crickets = 2\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_mantises * legs_per_mantis +\n              num_cows * legs_per_cow +\n              num_wasps * legs_per_wasp +\n              num_butterflies * legs_per_butterfly +\n              num_crickets * legs_per_cricket)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 184. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is:\n\n<<<184>>>"
