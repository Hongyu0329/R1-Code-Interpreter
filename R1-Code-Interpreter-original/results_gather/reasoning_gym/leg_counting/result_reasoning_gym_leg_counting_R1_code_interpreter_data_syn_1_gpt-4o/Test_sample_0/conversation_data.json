    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the given animals and their respective counts. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each type of animal:\n\n- Lions have 4 legs.\n- Dogs have 4 legs.\n- Starfish have 0 legs (since they are not legged animals).\n- Giraffes have 4 legs.\n\nGiven the counts of each animal:\n- 8 lions\n- 1 dog\n- 12 starfish\n- 1 giraffe\n\nWe can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and then summing these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_lion = 4\nlegs_per_dog = 4\nlegs_per_starfish = 0\nlegs_per_giraffe = 4\n\n# Number of each type of animal\nnum_lions = 8\nnum_dogs = 1\nnum_starfish = 12\nnum_giraffes = 1\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_lions * legs_per_lion) + (num_dogs * legs_per_dog) + (num_starfish * legs_per_starfish) + (num_giraffes * legs_per_giraffe)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the total number of legs based on the given data. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 40. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n- Lions: 8 lions * 4 legs = 32 legs\n- Dogs: 1 dog * 4 legs = 4 legs\n- Starfish: 12 starfish * 0 legs = 0 legs\n- Giraffes: 1 giraffe * 4 legs = 4 legs\n\nAdding these together gives us a total of 40 legs.\n\n<<<40>>>"
