    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the given animals and their respective counts. We know the following:\n\n- Birds typically have 2 legs.\n- Cats have 4 legs.\n- Leeches have 0 legs (since they are invertebrates and do not have legs).\n\nGiven the counts:\n- 10 birds\n- 6 cats\n- 6 leeches\n\nWe can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and then summing these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\nnum_birds = 10\nnum_cats = 6\nnum_leeches = 6\n\n# Number of legs per animal\nlegs_per_bird = 2\nlegs_per_cat = 4\nlegs_per_leech = 0\n\n# Total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_birds * legs_per_bird) + (num_cats * legs_per_cat) + (num_leeches * legs_per_leech)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs correctly. \n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n- Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs each = 20 legs\n- Cats: 6 cats * 4 legs each = 24 legs\n- Leeches: 6 leeches * 0 legs each = 0 legs\n\nAdding these together gives us a total of 44 legs.\n\n<<<44>>>"
