    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the given list of animals and their respective counts. Each type of animal has a specific number of legs:\n\n- Horses have 4 legs.\n- Dogs have 4 legs.\n- Starfish have 0 legs (since they are not legged animals).\n- Chickens have 2 legs.\n\nGiven the counts of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then summing these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_horse = 4\nlegs_per_dog = 4\nlegs_per_starfish = 0\nlegs_per_chicken = 2\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nnum_horses = 12\nnum_dogs = 3\nnum_starfish = 5\nnum_chickens = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_horses * legs_per_horse) + (num_dogs * legs_per_dog) + (num_starfish * legs_per_starfish) + (num_chickens * legs_per_chicken)\n\n# Output the total number of legs\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 64. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n- Horses: 12 horses * 4 legs = 48 legs\n- Dogs: 3 dogs * 4 legs = 12 legs\n- Starfish: 5 starfish * 0 legs = 0 legs\n- Chickens: 2 chickens * 2 legs = 4 legs\n\nAdding these together gives us a total of 64 legs.\n\n<<<64>>>"
