    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the given animals and their respective counts. We know the typical number of legs for each type of animal:\n\n- Beetles typically have 6 legs.\n- Sea slugs typically have 0 legs.\n- Elephants typically have 4 legs.\n\nGiven the counts of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and then summing these products.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_beetle = 6\nlegs_per_sea_slug = 0\nlegs_per_elephant = 4\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nnum_beetles = 9\nnum_sea_slugs = 6\nnum_elephants = 8\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_beetles * legs_per_beetle) + (num_sea_slugs * legs_per_sea_slug) + (num_elephants * legs_per_elephant)\n\n# Print the total number of legs\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs for the given animals. \n\nThe total number of legs is 86.\n\n<<<86>>>"
