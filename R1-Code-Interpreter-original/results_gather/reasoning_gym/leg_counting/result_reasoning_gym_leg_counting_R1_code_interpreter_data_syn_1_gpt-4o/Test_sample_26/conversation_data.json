    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Lions: 4 legs each\n- Horses: 4 legs each\n- Jellyfish: 0 legs each (since they are invertebrates)\n- Shrimps: 10 legs each (as they are decapods)\n- Cockroaches: 6 legs each\n- Wasps: 6 legs each\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:\n\n- Total legs from lions = 6 lions * 4 legs/lion\n- Total legs from horses = 5 horses * 4 legs/horse\n- Total legs from jellyfish = 13 jellyfish * 0 legs/jellyfish\n- Total legs from shrimps = 15 shrimps * 10 legs/shrimp\n- Total legs from cockroaches = 5 cockroaches * 6 legs/cockroach\n- Total legs from wasps = 8 wasps * 6 legs/wasp\n\nNow, let's compute the total number of legs using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\nlions = 6\nhorses = 5\njellyfish = 13\nshrimps = 15\ncockroaches = 5\nwasps = 8\n\n# Number of legs per animal\nlegs_per_lion = 4\nlegs_per_horse = 4\nlegs_per_jellyfish = 0\nlegs_per_shrimp = 10\nlegs_per_cockroach = 6\nlegs_per_wasp = 6\n\n# Total legs calculation\ntotal_legs = (lions * legs_per_lion +\n              horses * legs_per_horse +\n              jellyfish * legs_per_jellyfish +\n              shrimps * legs_per_shrimp +\n              cockroaches * legs_per_cockroach +\n              wasps * legs_per_wasp)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 272. \n\nNow, let's summarize the final answer:\n\n<<<272>>>"
