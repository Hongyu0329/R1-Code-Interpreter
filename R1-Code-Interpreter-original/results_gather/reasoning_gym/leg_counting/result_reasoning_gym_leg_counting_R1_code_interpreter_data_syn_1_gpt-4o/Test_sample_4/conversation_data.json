    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the given list of animals and their respective counts. Each type of animal has a specific number of legs:\n\n- Flatworms: 0 legs\n- Sea slugs: 0 legs\n- Sheep: 4 legs\n- Chickens: 2 legs\n- Snakes: 0 legs\n- Cows: 4 legs\n- Humans: 2 legs\n- Ducks: 2 legs\n\nWe will multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"flatworms\": 0,\n    \"sea slugs\": 0,\n    \"sheep\": 4,\n    \"chickens\": 2,\n    \"snakes\": 0,\n    \"cows\": 4,\n    \"humans\": 2,\n    \"ducks\": 2\n}\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"flatworms\": 12,\n    \"sea slugs\": 11,\n    \"sheep\": 7,\n    \"chickens\": 6,\n    \"snakes\": 9,\n    \"cows\": 5,\n    \"humans\": 9,\n    \"ducks\": 2\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * animal_counts[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\n# Print the total number of legs\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 82. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<82>>>"
