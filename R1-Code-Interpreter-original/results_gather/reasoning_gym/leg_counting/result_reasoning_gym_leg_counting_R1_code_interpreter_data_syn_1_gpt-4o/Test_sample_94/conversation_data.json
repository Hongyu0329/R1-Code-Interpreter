    "To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs each type of animal has:\n\n1. Woodlouse: Typically, a woodlouse has 14 legs.\n2. Praying Mantis: A praying mantis has 6 legs.\n3. Giraffe: A giraffe has 4 legs.\n\nGiven the number of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then summing these products.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of legs using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of each type of animal\nnum_woodlouses = 11\nnum_praying_mantiss = 3\nnum_giraffes = 8\n\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_woodlouse = 14\nlegs_per_praying_mantis = 6\nlegs_per_giraffe = 4\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_woodlouses * legs_per_woodlouse) + \\\n             (num_praying_mantiss * legs_per_praying_mantis) + \\\n             (num_giraffes * legs_per_giraffe)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 204. \n\nTo summarize, we calculated the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has and then summing these products. The calculation is as follows:\n\n- Woodlouses: 11 * 14 = 154 legs\n- Praying Mantises: 3 * 6 = 18 legs\n- Giraffes: 8 * 4 = 32 legs\n\nAdding these together gives us a total of 204 legs.\n\n<<<204>>>"
