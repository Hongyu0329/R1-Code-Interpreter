    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Scorpions: 8 legs each\n- Shrimps: 10 legs each\n- Cats: 4 legs each\n- Giraffes: 4 legs each\n- Elephants: 4 legs each\n- Tigers: 4 legs each\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of legs for scorpions: \\(15 \\times 8\\)\n2. Calculate the total number of legs for shrimps: \\(14 \\times 10\\)\n3. Calculate the total number of legs for cats: \\(7 \\times 4\\)\n4. Calculate the total number of legs for giraffes: \\(9 \\times 4\\)\n5. Calculate the total number of legs for elephants: \\(8 \\times 4\\)\n6. Calculate the total number of legs for tigers: \\(12 \\times 4\\)\n\nFinally, sum all these values to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_scorpion = 8\nlegs_per_shrimp = 10\nlegs_per_cat = 4\nlegs_per_giraffe = 4\nlegs_per_elephant = 4\nlegs_per_tiger = 4\n\n# Number of each type of animal\nnum_scorpions = 15\nnum_shrimps = 14\nnum_cats = 7\nnum_giraffes = 9\nnum_elephants = 8\nnum_tigers = 12\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_scorpions * legs_per_scorpion +\n              num_shrimps * legs_per_shrimp +\n              num_cats * legs_per_cat +\n              num_giraffes * legs_per_giraffe +\n              num_elephants * legs_per_elephant +\n              num_tigers * legs_per_tiger)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs for the given animals is 404. \n\nLet's summarize the calculation:\n\n- Scorpions: \\(15 \\times 8 = 120\\) legs\n- Shrimps: \\(14 \\times 10 = 140\\) legs\n- Cats: \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\) legs\n- Giraffes: \\(9 \\times 4 = 36\\) legs\n- Elephants: \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\) legs\n- Tigers: \\(12 \\times 4 = 48\\) legs\n\nAdding these together gives us a total of \\(120 + 140 + 28 + 36 + 32 + 48 = 404\\) legs.\n\n<<<404>>>"
