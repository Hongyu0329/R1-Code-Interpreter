    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Ants: 6 legs each\n- Shrimps: 10 legs each\n- Lobsters: 10 legs each\n- Bees: 6 legs each\n- Fireflies: 6 legs each\n- Sea slugs: 0 legs each (they are mollusks and do not have legs)\n- Chickens: 2 legs each\n- Leeches: 0 legs each (they are annelids and do not have legs)\n- Elephants: 4 legs each\n- Woodlice: 14 legs each\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and sum them up using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\nnum_ants = 13\nnum_shrimps = 14\nnum_lobsters = 10\nnum_bees = 1\nnum_fireflies = 15\nnum_sea_slugs = 6\nnum_chickens = 5\nnum_leeches = 12\nnum_elephants = 6\nnum_woodlice = 4\n\n# Legs per animal\nlegs_per_ant = 6\nlegs_per_shrimp = 10\nlegs_per_lobster = 10\nlegs_per_bee = 6\nlegs_per_firefly = 6\nlegs_per_sea_slug = 0\nlegs_per_chicken = 2\nlegs_per_leech = 0\nlegs_per_elephant = 4\nlegs_per_woodlouse = 14\n\n# Total legs calculation\ntotal_legs = (\n    num_ants * legs_per_ant +\n    num_shrimps * legs_per_shrimp +\n    num_lobsters * legs_per_lobster +\n    num_bees * legs_per_bee +\n    num_fireflies * legs_per_firefly +\n    num_sea_slugs * legs_per_sea_slug +\n    num_chickens * legs_per_chicken +\n    num_leeches * legs_per_leech +\n    num_elephants * legs_per_elephant +\n    num_woodlice * legs_per_woodlouse\n)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
