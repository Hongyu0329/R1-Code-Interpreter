    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Cows: 4 legs each\n- Lobsters: 10 legs each\n- Crickets: 6 legs each\n- Birds: 2 legs each\n- Chickens: 2 legs each\n- Shrimps: 10 legs each\n- Insects: 6 legs each\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type has, and then summing all these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\ncows = 4\nlobsters = 3\ncrickets = 5\nbirds = 13\nchickens = 5\nshrimps = 4\ninsects = 8\n\n# Number of legs per animal\nlegs_per_cow = 4\nlegs_per_lobster = 10\nlegs_per_cricket = 6\nlegs_per_bird = 2\nlegs_per_chicken = 2\nlegs_per_shrimp = 10\nlegs_per_insect = 6\n\n# Total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (cows * legs_per_cow +\n              lobsters * legs_per_lobster +\n              crickets * legs_per_cricket +\n              birds * legs_per_bird +\n              chickens * legs_per_chicken +\n              shrimps * legs_per_shrimp +\n              insects * legs_per_insect)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 200. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is:\n\n<<<200>>>"
