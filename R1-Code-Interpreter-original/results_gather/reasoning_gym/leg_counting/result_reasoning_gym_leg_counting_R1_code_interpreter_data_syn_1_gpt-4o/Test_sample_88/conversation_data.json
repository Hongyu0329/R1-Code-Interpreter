    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Horses have 4 legs.\n- Praying mantises have 6 legs.\n- Chickens have 2 legs.\n- Insects (assuming generic insects) have 6 legs.\n- Lions have 4 legs.\n- Elephants have 4 legs.\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal by multiplying the number of animals by the number of legs each animal has.\n2. Sum up all the legs to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\nhorses = 14\npraying_mantises = 5\nchickens = 12\ninsects = 6\nlions = 6\nelephants = 12\n\n# Number of legs per animal\nlegs_per_horse = 4\nlegs_per_praying_mantis = 6\nlegs_per_chicken = 2\nlegs_per_insect = 6\nlegs_per_lion = 4\nlegs_per_elephant = 4\n\n# Total legs calculation\ntotal_legs = (horses * legs_per_horse +\n              praying_mantises * legs_per_praying_mantis +\n              chickens * legs_per_chicken +\n              insects * legs_per_insect +\n              lions * legs_per_lion +\n              elephants * legs_per_elephant)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 218. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<218>>>"
