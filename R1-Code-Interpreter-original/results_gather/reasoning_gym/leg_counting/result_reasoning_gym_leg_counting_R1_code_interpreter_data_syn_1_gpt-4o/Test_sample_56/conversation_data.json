    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Horses: 4 legs each\n- Ants: 6 legs each\n- Cows: 4 legs each\n- Snakes: 0 legs each\n- Crabs: 10 legs each\n- Shrimps: 10 legs each\n- Spiders: 8 legs each\n- Elephants: 4 legs each\n- Leeches: 0 legs each\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and sum them up using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"horses\": 4,\n    \"ants\": 6,\n    \"cows\": 4,\n    \"snakes\": 0,\n    \"crabs\": 10,\n    \"shrimps\": 10,\n    \"spiders\": 8,\n    \"elephants\": 4,\n    \"leeches\": 0\n}\n\n# Number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"horses\": 4,\n    \"ants\": 2,\n    \"cows\": 12,\n    \"snakes\": 3,\n    \"crabs\": 10,\n    \"shrimps\": 3,\n    \"spiders\": 8,\n    \"elephants\": 7,\n    \"leeches\": 6\n}\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * animal_counts[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 298. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given list of animals is:\n\n<<<298>>>"
