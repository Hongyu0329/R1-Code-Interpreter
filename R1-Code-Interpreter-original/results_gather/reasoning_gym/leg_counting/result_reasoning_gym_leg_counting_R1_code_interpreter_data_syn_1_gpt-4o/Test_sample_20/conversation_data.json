    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs for the given quantities of each animal.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the number of legs for each type of animal:\n- Flatworms: 0 legs (they are invertebrates without legs)\n- Scorpions: 8 legs\n- Fireflies: 6 legs\n- Beetles: 6 legs\n- Grasshoppers: 6 legs\n- Jellyfish: 0 legs (they are invertebrates without legs)\n- Praying mantises: 6 legs\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and summing up the results.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"flatworm\": 0,\n    \"scorpion\": 8,\n    \"firefly\": 6,\n    \"beetle\": 6,\n    \"grasshopper\": 6,\n    \"jellyfish\": 0,\n    \"praying mantis\": 6\n}\n\n# Number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"flatworm\": 3,\n    \"scorpion\": 3,\n    \"firefly\": 13,\n    \"beetle\": 7,\n    \"grasshopper\": 14,\n    \"jellyfish\": 3,\n    \"praying mantis\": 6\n}\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * animal_counts[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
