    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Deer: 4 legs\n- Cockroach: 6 legs\n- Praying Mantis: 6 legs\n- Sea Slug: 0 legs (since they are mollusks and do not have legs)\n- Butterfly: 6 legs\n- Giraffe: 4 legs\n- Sheep: 4 legs\n- Cat: 4 legs\n- Human: 2 legs\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and sum them up to get the final answer.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\ndeers = 6\ncockroaches = 11\npraying_mantises = 9\nsea_slugs = 15\nbutterflies = 11\ngiraffes = 12\nsheeps = 2\ncats = 9\nhumans = 11\n\n# Number of legs per animal\nlegs_per_deer = 4\nlegs_per_cockroach = 6\nlegs_per_praying_mantis = 6\nlegs_per_sea_slug = 0\nlegs_per_butterfly = 6\nlegs_per_giraffe = 4\nlegs_per_sheep = 4\nlegs_per_cat = 4\nlegs_per_human = 2\n\n# Total legs calculation\ntotal_legs = (deers * legs_per_deer +\n              cockroaches * legs_per_cockroach +\n              praying_mantises * legs_per_praying_mantis +\n              sea_slugs * legs_per_sea_slug +\n              butterflies * legs_per_butterfly +\n              giraffes * legs_per_giraffe +\n              sheeps * legs_per_sheep +\n              cats * legs_per_cat +\n              humans * legs_per_human)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
