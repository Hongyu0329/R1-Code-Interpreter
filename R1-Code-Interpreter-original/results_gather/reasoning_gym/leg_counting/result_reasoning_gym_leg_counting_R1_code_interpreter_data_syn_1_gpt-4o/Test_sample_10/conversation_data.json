    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Sea Slugs**: Sea slugs are mollusks and typically do not have legs. Therefore, the number of legs for sea slugs is 0.\n\n2. **Deers**: Deers are quadrupeds, meaning they have 4 legs each. So, for 12 deers, the total number of legs is \\(12 \\times 4\\).\n\n3. **Giraffes**: Giraffes are also quadrupeds, with 4 legs each. For 2 giraffes, the total number of legs is \\(2 \\times 4\\).\n\n4. **Elephants**: Elephants are quadrupeds as well, with 4 legs each. For 11 elephants, the total number of legs is \\(11 \\times 4\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\nsea_slugs = 3\ndeers = 12\ngiraffes = 2\nelephants = 11\n\n# Number of legs per animal\nlegs_per_sea_slug = 0\nlegs_per_deer = 4\nlegs_per_giraffe = 4\nlegs_per_elephant = 4\n\n# Total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (sea_slugs * legs_per_sea_slug) + (deers * legs_per_deer) + (giraffes * legs_per_giraffe) + (elephants * legs_per_elephant)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 100. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n- Sea Slugs: \\(3 \\times 0 = 0\\) legs\n- Deers: \\(12 \\times 4 = 48\\) legs\n- Giraffes: \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\) legs\n- Elephants: \\(11 \\times 4 = 44\\) legs\n\nAdding these together gives us a total of \\(0 + 48 + 8 + 44 = 100\\) legs.\n\n<<<100>>>"
