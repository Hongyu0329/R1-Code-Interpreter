    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Cockroach: 6 legs\n- Shrimp: 10 legs\n- Starfish: 5 legs\n- Firefly: 6 legs\n- Spider: 8 legs\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:\n\n1. Multiply the number of cockroaches by the number of legs per cockroach.\n2. Multiply the number of shrimps by the number of legs per shrimp.\n3. Multiply the number of starfishes by the number of legs per starfish.\n4. Multiply the number of fireflies by the number of legs per firefly.\n5. Multiply the number of spiders by the number of legs per spider.\n6. Sum all these results to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Number of legs per animal\nlegs_per_cockroach = 6\nlegs_per_shrimp = 10\nlegs_per_starfish = 5\nlegs_per_firefly = 6\nlegs_per_spider = 8\n\n# Number of each animal\nnum_cockroaches = 7\nnum_shrimps = 4\nnum_starfishes = 8\nnum_fireflies = 6\nnum_spiders = 10\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_cockroaches * legs_per_cockroach +\n              num_shrimps * legs_per_shrimp +\n              num_starfishes * legs_per_starfish +\n              num_fireflies * legs_per_firefly +\n              num_spiders * legs_per_spider)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 238. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<238>>>"
