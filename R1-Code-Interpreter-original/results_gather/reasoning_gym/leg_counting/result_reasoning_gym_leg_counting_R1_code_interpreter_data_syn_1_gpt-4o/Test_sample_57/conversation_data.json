    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the given list of animals and their respective counts. We know the typical number of legs for each type of animal:\n\n- Tigers have 4 legs.\n- Ducks have 2 legs.\n- Butterflies have 6 legs.\n- Leeches have 0 legs (since they are invertebrates).\n\nGiven the counts of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and then summing these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_tiger = 4\nlegs_per_duck = 2\nlegs_per_butterfly = 6\nlegs_per_leech = 0\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nnum_tigers = 3\nnum_ducks = 14\nnum_butterflies = 7\nnum_leeches = 6\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_tigers * legs_per_tiger) + (num_ducks * legs_per_duck) + \\\n             (num_butterflies * legs_per_butterfly) + (num_leeches * legs_per_leech)\n\n# Print the total number of legs\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 82. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n- Tigers: 3 tigers * 4 legs each = 12 legs\n- Ducks: 14 ducks * 2 legs each = 28 legs\n- Butterflies: 7 butterflies * 6 legs each = 42 legs\n- Leeches: 6 leeches * 0 legs each = 0 legs\n\nAdding these together gives us a total of 82 legs.\n\n<<<82>>>"
