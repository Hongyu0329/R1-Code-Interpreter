    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all the legs to get the total.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n- Sea slugs: 0 legs (they are mollusks and do not have legs)\n- Elephants: 4 legs\n- Woodlouses: 14 legs (7 pairs of legs)\n- Bees: 6 legs\n- Beetles: 6 legs\n- Leeches: 0 legs (they are annelids and do not have legs)\n- Lions: 4 legs\n- Dogs: 4 legs\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs using the given quantities of each animal.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"sea_slug\": 0,\n    \"elephant\": 4,\n    \"woodlouse\": 14,\n    \"bee\": 6,\n    \"beetle\": 6,\n    \"leech\": 0,\n    \"lion\": 4,\n    \"dog\": 4\n}\n\n# Define the number of each animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"sea_slug\": 6,\n    \"elephant\": 2,\n    \"woodlouse\": 10,\n    \"bee\": 9,\n    \"beetle\": 14,\n    \"leech\": 3,\n    \"lion\": 2,\n    \"dog\": 5\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * animal_counts[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\n# Output the total number of legs\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 314. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<314>>>"
