    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Sheep**: Each sheep has 4 legs. With 6 sheep, the total number of legs is \\(6 \\times 4\\).\n\n2. **Praying Mantis**: Each praying mantis has 6 legs. With 2 praying mantises, the total number of legs is \\(2 \\times 6\\).\n\n3. **Cockroach**: Each cockroach has 6 legs. With 3 cockroaches, the total number of legs is \\(3 \\times 6\\).\n\n4. **Duck**: Each duck has 2 legs. With 14 ducks, the total number of legs is \\(14 \\times 2\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\nnum_sheep = 6\nnum_praying_mantis = 2\nnum_cockroach = 3\nnum_duck = 14\n\n# Legs per animal\nlegs_per_sheep = 4\nlegs_per_praying_mantis = 6\nlegs_per_cockroach = 6\nlegs_per_duck = 2\n\n# Total legs calculation\ntotal_legs = (num_sheep * legs_per_sheep) + \\\n             (num_praying_mantis * legs_per_praying_mantis) + \\\n             (num_cockroach * legs_per_cockroach) + \\\n             (num_duck * legs_per_duck)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 82. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<82>>>"
