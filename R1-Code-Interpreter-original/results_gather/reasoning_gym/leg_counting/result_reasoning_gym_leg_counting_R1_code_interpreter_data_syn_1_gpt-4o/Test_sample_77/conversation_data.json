    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Elephants: 4 legs each\n- Praying mantises: 6 legs each\n- Cockroaches: 6 legs each\n- Flatworms: 0 legs each (since they are invertebrates and do not have legs)\n- Birds: 2 legs each\n- Woodlice: 14 legs each (woodlice are crustaceans and typically have 14 legs)\n- Tigers: 4 legs each\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and sum them up to get the final answer.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\nelephants = 8\npraying_mantises = 5\ncockroaches = 10\nflatworms = 15\nbirds = 9\nwoodlice = 2\ntigers = 13\n\n# Number of legs per animal\nlegs_per_elephant = 4\nlegs_per_praying_mantis = 6\nlegs_per_cockroach = 6\nlegs_per_flatworm = 0\nlegs_per_bird = 2\nlegs_per_woodlouse = 14\nlegs_per_tiger = 4\n\n# Total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (elephants * legs_per_elephant +\n              praying_mantises * legs_per_praying_mantis +\n              cockroaches * legs_per_cockroach +\n              flatworms * legs_per_flatworm +\n              birds * legs_per_bird +\n              woodlice * legs_per_woodlouse +\n              tigers * legs_per_tiger)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 220. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<220>>>"
