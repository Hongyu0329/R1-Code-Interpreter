    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Scorpions: 8 legs each\n- Humans: 2 legs each\n- Giraffes: 4 legs each\n- Crickets: 6 legs each\n- Fireflies: 6 legs each\n- Tigers: 4 legs each\n- Beetles: 6 legs each\n- Crabs: 10 legs each\n- Ants: 6 legs each\n- Cats: 4 legs each\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and sum them up using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"scorpions\": 8,\n    \"humans\": 2,\n    \"giraffes\": 4,\n    \"crickets\": 6,\n    \"fireflies\": 6,\n    \"tigers\": 4,\n    \"beetles\": 6,\n    \"crabs\": 10,\n    \"ants\": 6,\n    \"cats\": 4\n}\n\n# Number of each animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"scorpions\": 8,\n    \"humans\": 9,\n    \"giraffes\": 6,\n    \"crickets\": 3,\n    \"fireflies\": 9,\n    \"tigers\": 11,\n    \"beetles\": 13,\n    \"crabs\": 13,\n    \"ants\": 13,\n    \"cats\": 2\n}\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * animal_counts[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
