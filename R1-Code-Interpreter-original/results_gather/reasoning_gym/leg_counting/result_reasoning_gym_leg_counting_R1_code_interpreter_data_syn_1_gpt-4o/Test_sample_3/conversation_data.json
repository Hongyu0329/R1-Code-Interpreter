    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Ducks have 2 legs each.\n- Ants have 6 legs each.\n- Dogs have 4 legs each.\n- Sheep have 4 legs each.\n- Crickets have 6 legs each.\n- Tigers have 4 legs each.\n- Crabs have 10 legs each.\n- Sea slugs have 0 legs each.\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then summing all these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Number of each type of animal\nnum_ducks = 12\nnum_ants = 9\nnum_dogs = 13\nnum_sheep = 14\nnum_crickets = 15\nnum_tigers = 13\nnum_crabs = 5\nnum_sea_slugs = 11\n\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_duck = 2\nlegs_ant = 6\nlegs_dog = 4\nlegs_sheep = 4\nlegs_cricket = 6\nlegs_tiger = 4\nlegs_crab = 10\nlegs_sea_slug = 0\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_ducks * legs_duck +\n              num_ants * legs_ant +\n              num_dogs * legs_dog +\n              num_sheep * legs_sheep +\n              num_crickets * legs_cricket +\n              num_tigers * legs_tiger +\n              num_crabs * legs_crab +\n              num_sea_slugs * legs_sea_slug)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs for the given list of animals is 378. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<378>>>"
