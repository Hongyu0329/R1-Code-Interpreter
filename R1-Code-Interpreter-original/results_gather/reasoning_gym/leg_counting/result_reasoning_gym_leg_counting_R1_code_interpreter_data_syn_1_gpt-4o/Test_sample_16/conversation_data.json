    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Ducks have 2 legs.\n- Shrimps have 10 legs.\n- Lobsters have 10 legs.\n- Starfish have 0 legs.\n- Scorpions have 8 legs.\n- Horses have 4 legs.\n- Butterflies have 6 legs.\n- Bees have 6 legs.\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and sum them up to get the final answer.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"duck\": 2,\n    \"shrimp\": 10,\n    \"lobster\": 10,\n    \"starfish\": 0,\n    \"scorpion\": 8,\n    \"horse\": 4,\n    \"butterfly\": 6,\n    \"bee\": 6\n}\n\n# Number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"duck\": 7,\n    \"shrimp\": 3,\n    \"lobster\": 3,\n    \"starfish\": 13,\n    \"scorpion\": 14,\n    \"horse\": 11,\n    \"butterfly\": 2,\n    \"bee\": 8\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * count for animal, count in animal_counts.items())\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
