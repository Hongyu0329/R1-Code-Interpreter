    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Sheep: 4 legs\n- Dog: 4 legs\n- Tiger: 4 legs\n- Elephant: 4 legs\n- Firefly: 6 legs\n- Praying Mantis: 6 legs\n- Cockroach: 6 legs\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then summing all these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Number of legs per animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"sheep\": 4,\n    \"dog\": 4,\n    \"tiger\": 4,\n    \"elephant\": 4,\n    \"firefly\": 6,\n    \"praying_mantis\": 6,\n    \"cockroach\": 6\n}\n\n# Number of each animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"sheep\": 6,\n    \"dog\": 15,\n    \"tiger\": 1,\n    \"elephant\": 13,\n    \"firefly\": 15,\n    \"praying_mantis\": 14,\n    \"cockroach\": 2\n}\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * animal_counts[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 326. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is:\n\n<<<326>>>"
