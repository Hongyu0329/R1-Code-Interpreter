    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the number of each type of animal and the number of legs each animal has. \n\n1. **Identify the number of legs per animal:**\n   - Deer: 4 legs\n   - Chicken: 2 legs\n   - Grasshopper: 6 legs\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Total legs from deers = Number of deers * Legs per deer\n   - Total legs from chickens = Number of chickens * Legs per chicken\n   - Total legs from grasshoppers = Number of grasshoppers * Legs per grasshopper\n\n3. **Sum up all the legs to get the total number of legs.**\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\nnum_deers = 5\nnum_chickens = 2\nnum_grasshoppers = 14\n\n# Legs per animal\nlegs_per_deer = 4\nlegs_per_chicken = 2\nlegs_per_grasshopper = 6\n\n# Calculate total legs\ntotal_legs = (num_deers * legs_per_deer) + (num_chickens * legs_per_chicken) + (num_grasshoppers * legs_per_grasshopper)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 108. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<108>>>"
