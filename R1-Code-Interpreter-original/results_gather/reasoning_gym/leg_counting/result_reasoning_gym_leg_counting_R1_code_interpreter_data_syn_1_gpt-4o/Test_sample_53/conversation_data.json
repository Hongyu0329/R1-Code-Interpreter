    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the given list of animals and their respective counts. Each type of animal has a specific number of legs:\n\n- Birds typically have 2 legs.\n- Insects generally have 6 legs.\n- Horses have 4 legs.\n- Elephants have 4 legs.\n- Praying mantises have 6 legs.\n- Butterflies have 6 legs.\n\nGiven the counts of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then summing all these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_bird = 2\nlegs_per_insect = 6\nlegs_per_horse = 4\nlegs_per_elephant = 4\nlegs_per_praying_mantis = 6\nlegs_per_butterfly = 6\n\n# Number of each type of animal\nnum_birds = 10\nnum_insects = 4\nnum_horses = 11\nnum_elephants = 7\nnum_praying_mantises = 9\nnum_butterflies = 14\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_birds * legs_per_bird +\n              num_insects * legs_per_insect +\n              num_horses * legs_per_horse +\n              num_elephants * legs_per_elephant +\n              num_praying_mantises * legs_per_praying_mantis +\n              num_butterflies * legs_per_butterfly)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 254. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<254>>>"
