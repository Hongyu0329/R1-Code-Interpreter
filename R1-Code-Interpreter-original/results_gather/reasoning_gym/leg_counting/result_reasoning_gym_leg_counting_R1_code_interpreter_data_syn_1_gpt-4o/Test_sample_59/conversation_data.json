    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Cows**: Each cow has 4 legs. Therefore, 14 cows have \\(14 \\times 4\\) legs.\n2. **Cats**: Each cat also has 4 legs. Therefore, 13 cats have \\(13 \\times 4\\) legs.\n3. **Wasps**: Each wasp has 6 legs. Therefore, 12 wasps have \\(12 \\times 6\\) legs.\n4. **Praying Mantises**: Each praying mantis has 6 legs. Therefore, 8 praying mantises have \\(8 \\times 6\\) legs.\n\nWe will calculate the total number of legs by summing up the legs for each type of animal.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\ncows = 14\ncats = 13\nwasps = 12\npraying_mantises = 8\n\n# Legs per animal\nlegs_per_cow = 4\nlegs_per_cat = 4\nlegs_per_wasp = 6\nlegs_per_praying_mantis = 6\n\n# Total legs calculation\ntotal_legs = (cows * legs_per_cow) + (cats * legs_per_cat) + (wasps * legs_per_wasp) + (praying_mantises * legs_per_praying_mantis)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 228. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<228>>>"
