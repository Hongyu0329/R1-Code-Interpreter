    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. We will use the typical number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Cockroach: 6 legs\n- Sheep: 4 legs\n- Tiger: 4 legs\n- Firefly: 6 legs\n- Chicken: 2 legs\n- Bee: 6 legs\n- Beetle: 6 legs\n- Jellyfish: 0 legs (jellyfish do not have legs)\n- Praying Mantis: 6 legs\n- Ant: 6 legs\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then summing all these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"cockroach\": 6,\n    \"sheep\": 4,\n    \"tiger\": 4,\n    \"firefly\": 6,\n    \"chicken\": 2,\n    \"bee\": 6,\n    \"beetle\": 6,\n    \"jellyfish\": 0,\n    \"praying mantis\": 6,\n    \"ant\": 6\n}\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"cockroach\": 4,\n    \"sheep\": 5,\n    \"tiger\": 2,\n    \"firefly\": 14,\n    \"chicken\": 11,\n    \"bee\": 5,\n    \"beetle\": 14,\n    \"jellyfish\": 12,\n    \"praying mantis\": 10,\n    \"ant\": 1\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * count for animal, count in animal_counts.items())\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the total number of legs based on the given quantities and typical number of legs for each animal. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 338. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given list of animals is:\n\n<<<338>>>"
