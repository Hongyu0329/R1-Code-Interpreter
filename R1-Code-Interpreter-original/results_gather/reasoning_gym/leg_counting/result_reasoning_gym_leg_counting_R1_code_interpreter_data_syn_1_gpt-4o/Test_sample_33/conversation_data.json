    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Sheep: 4 legs\n- Woodlouse: 14 legs\n- Scorpion: 8 legs\n- Elephant: 4 legs\n- Cockroach: 6 legs\n- Praying Mantis: 6 legs\n- Tiger: 4 legs\n- Crab: 10 legs\n- Deer: 4 legs\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal by multiplying the number of animals by the number of legs each animal has. Finally, we will sum up all these values to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\nnum_sheep = 15\nnum_woodlouse = 6\nnum_scorpion = 14\nnum_elephant = 11\nnum_cockroach = 7\nnum_praying_mantis = 15\nnum_tiger = 4\nnum_crab = 2\nnum_deer = 15\n\n# Number of legs per animal\nlegs_sheep = 4\nlegs_woodlouse = 14\nlegs_scorpion = 8\nlegs_elephant = 4\nlegs_cockroach = 6\nlegs_praying_mantis = 6\nlegs_tiger = 4\nlegs_crab = 10\nlegs_deer = 4\n\n# Total legs calculation\ntotal_legs = (num_sheep * legs_sheep +\n              num_woodlouse * legs_woodlouse +\n              num_scorpion * legs_scorpion +\n              num_elephant * legs_elephant +\n              num_cockroach * legs_cockroach +\n              num_praying_mantis * legs_praying_mantis +\n              num_tiger * legs_tiger +\n              num_crab * legs_crab +\n              num_deer * legs_deer)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 528. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<528>>>"
