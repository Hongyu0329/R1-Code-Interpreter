    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the given list of animals and their respective counts. We know the typical number of legs for each type of animal:\n\n- Spiders have 8 legs.\n- Sea slugs have 0 legs.\n- Ducks have 2 legs.\n- Snakes have 0 legs.\n- Chickens have 2 legs.\n\nGiven the counts of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then summing these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    'spider': 8,\n    'sea_slug': 0,\n    'duck': 2,\n    'snake': 0,\n    'chicken': 2\n}\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    'spider': 11,\n    'sea_slug': 5,\n    'duck': 13,\n    'snake': 4,\n    'chicken': 1\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * count for animal, count in animal_counts.items())\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 116. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given list of animals is:\n\n<<<116>>>"
