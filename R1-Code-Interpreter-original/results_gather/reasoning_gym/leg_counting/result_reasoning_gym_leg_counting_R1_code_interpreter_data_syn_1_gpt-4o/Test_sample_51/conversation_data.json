    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Praying mantis: 6 legs\n- Chicken: 2 legs\n- Duck: 2 legs\n- Bee: 6 legs\n- Jellyfish: 0 legs (jellyfish do not have legs)\n- Flatworm: 0 legs (flatworms do not have legs)\n- Firefly: 6 legs\n- Insect: 6 legs (assuming generic insects)\n- Bird: 2 legs\n- Cockroach: 6 legs\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and summing up the results.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"praying_mantis\": 6,\n    \"chicken\": 2,\n    \"duck\": 2,\n    \"bee\": 6,\n    \"jellyfish\": 0,\n    \"flatworm\": 0,\n    \"firefly\": 6,\n    \"insect\": 6,\n    \"bird\": 2,\n    \"cockroach\": 6\n}\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"praying_mantis\": 3,\n    \"chicken\": 5,\n    \"duck\": 2,\n    \"bee\": 14,\n    \"jellyfish\": 1,\n    \"flatworm\": 7,\n    \"firefly\": 3,\n    \"insect\": 6,\n    \"bird\": 5,\n    \"cockroach\": 9\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * animal_counts[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 234. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given list of animals is:\n\n<<<234>>>"
