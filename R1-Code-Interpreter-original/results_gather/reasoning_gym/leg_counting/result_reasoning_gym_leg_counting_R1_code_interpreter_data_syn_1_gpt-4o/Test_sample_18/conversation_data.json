    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Deer: 4 legs\n- Beetle: 6 legs\n- Giraffe: 4 legs\n- Firefly: 6 legs\n- Ant: 6 legs\n- Chicken: 2 legs\n- Woodlouse: 14 legs\n- Cat: 4 legs\n- Human: 2 legs\n- Scorpion: 8 legs\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and sum them up using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\ndeers = 9\nbeetles = 2\ngiraffes = 15\nfireflies = 3\nants = 6\nchickens = 14\nwoodlouses = 2\ncats = 6\nhumans = 6\nscorpions = 4\n\n# Number of legs per animal\nlegs_per_deer = 4\nlegs_per_beetle = 6\nlegs_per_giraffe = 4\nlegs_per_firefly = 6\nlegs_per_ant = 6\nlegs_per_chicken = 2\nlegs_per_woodlouse = 14\nlegs_per_cat = 4\nlegs_per_human = 2\nlegs_per_scorpion = 8\n\n# Total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (deers * legs_per_deer +\n              beetles * legs_per_beetle +\n              giraffes * legs_per_giraffe +\n              fireflies * legs_per_firefly +\n              ants * legs_per_ant +\n              chickens * legs_per_chicken +\n              woodlouses * legs_per_woodlouse +\n              cats * legs_per_cat +\n              humans * legs_per_human +\n              scorpions * legs_per_scorpion)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
