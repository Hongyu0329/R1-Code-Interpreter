    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the number of each type of animal and the number of legs each animal has. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n- Spiders have 8 legs.\n- Scorpions have 8 legs.\n- Sheep have 4 legs.\n- Cows have 4 legs.\n- Cats have 4 legs.\n\nGiven the number of each animal:\n- 11 spiders\n- 5 scorpions\n- 3 sheep\n- 13 cows\n- 15 cats\n\nWe can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then summing all these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Number of each type of animal\nnum_spiders = 11\nnum_scorpions = 5\nnum_sheep = 3\nnum_cows = 13\nnum_cats = 15\n\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_spider = 8\nlegs_per_scorpion = 8\nlegs_per_sheep = 4\nlegs_per_cow = 4\nlegs_per_cat = 4\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_spiders * legs_per_spider) + \\\n             (num_scorpions * legs_per_scorpion) + \\\n             (num_sheep * legs_per_sheep) + \\\n             (num_cows * legs_per_cow) + \\\n             (num_cats * legs_per_cat)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 252. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<252>>>"
