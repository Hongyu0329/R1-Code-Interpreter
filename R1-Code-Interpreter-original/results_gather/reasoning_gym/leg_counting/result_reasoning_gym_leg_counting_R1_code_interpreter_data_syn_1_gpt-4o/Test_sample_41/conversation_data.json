    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the given list of animals and their respective counts. Each type of animal has a specific number of legs:\n\n- Humans have 2 legs.\n- Scorpions have 8 legs.\n- Fireflies have 6 legs.\n- Cows have 4 legs.\n- Praying mantises have 6 legs.\n- Starfish have 5 legs.\n- Sheep have 4 legs.\n\nWe will multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then sum all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"human\": 2,\n    \"scorpion\": 8,\n    \"firefly\": 6,\n    \"cow\": 4,\n    \"praying_mantis\": 6,\n    \"starfish\": 5,\n    \"sheep\": 4\n}\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"human\": 2,\n    \"scorpion\": 8,\n    \"firefly\": 7,\n    \"cow\": 9,\n    \"praying_mantis\": 9,\n    \"starfish\": 4,\n    \"sheep\": 8\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * count for animal, count in animal_counts.items())\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 252. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given list of animals is:\n\n<<<252>>>"
