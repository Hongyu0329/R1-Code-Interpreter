    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Lions: 4 legs each\n- Leeches: 0 legs each (since they are invertebrates)\n- Humans: 2 legs each\n- Bees: 6 legs each\n- Praying mantises: 6 legs each\n- Ants: 6 legs each\n- Crickets: 6 legs each\n- Spiders: 8 legs each\n- Flatworms: 0 legs each (since they are invertebrates)\n- Giraffes: 4 legs each\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"lion\": 4,\n    \"leech\": 0,\n    \"human\": 2,\n    \"bee\": 6,\n    \"praying_mantis\": 6,\n    \"ant\": 6,\n    \"cricket\": 6,\n    \"spider\": 8,\n    \"flatworm\": 0,\n    \"giraffe\": 4\n}\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"lion\": 2,\n    \"leech\": 3,\n    \"human\": 4,\n    \"bee\": 10,\n    \"praying_mantis\": 14,\n    \"ant\": 1,\n    \"cricket\": 1,\n    \"spider\": 4,\n    \"flatworm\": 2,\n    \"giraffe\": 12\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * count for animal, count in animal_counts.items())\n\n# Output the total number of legs\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 252. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given list of animals is:\n\n<<<252>>>"
