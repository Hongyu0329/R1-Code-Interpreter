    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs based on the given quantities of each animal.\n\n1. **Leech**: Leeches are invertebrates and do not have legs. So, 0 legs per leech.\n2. **Giraffe**: Giraffes are mammals and have 4 legs. So, 4 legs per giraffe.\n3. **Praying Mantis**: Praying mantises are insects and have 6 legs. So, 6 legs per praying mantis.\n4. **Starfish**: Starfish are echinoderms and do not have legs. So, 0 legs per starfish.\n5. **Butterfly**: Butterflies are insects and have 6 legs. So, 6 legs per butterfly.\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and summing these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Number of each type of animal\nnum_leeches = 3\nnum_giraffes = 9\nnum_praying_mantises = 3\nnum_starfish = 3\nnum_butterflies = 1\n\n# Number of legs per type of animal\nlegs_per_leech = 0\nlegs_per_giraffe = 4\nlegs_per_praying_mantis = 6\nlegs_per_starfish = 0\nlegs_per_butterfly = 6\n\n# Total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_leeches * legs_per_leech +\n              num_giraffes * legs_per_giraffe +\n              num_praying_mantises * legs_per_praying_mantis +\n              num_starfish * legs_per_starfish +\n              num_butterflies * legs_per_butterfly)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 60. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given list of animals is:\n\n<<<60>>>"
