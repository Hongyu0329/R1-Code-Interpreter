    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the given list of animals and their respective leg counts. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each type of animal:\n\n- Insects typically have 6 legs.\n- Spiders have 8 legs.\n- Horses have 4 legs.\n- Wasps, being insects, also have 6 legs.\n- Grasshoppers, another type of insect, have 6 legs.\n- Cats have 4 legs.\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and then summing these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_insect = 6\nlegs_per_spider = 8\nlegs_per_horse = 4\nlegs_per_wasp = 6\nlegs_per_grasshopper = 6\nlegs_per_cat = 4\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nnum_insects = 11\nnum_spiders = 4\nnum_horses = 12\nnum_wasps = 7\nnum_grasshoppers = 9\nnum_cats = 4\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_insects * legs_per_insect +\n              num_spiders * legs_per_spider +\n              num_horses * legs_per_horse +\n              num_wasps * legs_per_wasp +\n              num_grasshoppers * legs_per_grasshopper +\n              num_cats * legs_per_cat)\n\n# Output the total number of legs\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 258. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<258>>>"
