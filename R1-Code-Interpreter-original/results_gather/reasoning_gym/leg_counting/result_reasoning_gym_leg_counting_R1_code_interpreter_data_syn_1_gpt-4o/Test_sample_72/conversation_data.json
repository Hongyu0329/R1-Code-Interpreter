    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the given list of animals. Each type of animal has a specific number of legs:\n\n- Horses have 4 legs.\n- Elephants have 4 legs.\n- Wasps have 6 legs.\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and then summing these products.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_horse = 4\nlegs_per_elephant = 4\nlegs_per_wasp = 6\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nnum_horses = 6\nnum_elephants = 1\nnum_wasps = 12\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_horses * legs_per_horse) + (num_elephants * legs_per_elephant) + (num_wasps * legs_per_wasp)\n\n# Output the total number of legs\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 100. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n- Horses: 6 horses * 4 legs = 24 legs\n- Elephants: 1 elephant * 4 legs = 4 legs\n- Wasps: 12 wasps * 6 legs = 72 legs\n\nAdding these together gives us a total of 100 legs.\n\n<<<100>>>"
