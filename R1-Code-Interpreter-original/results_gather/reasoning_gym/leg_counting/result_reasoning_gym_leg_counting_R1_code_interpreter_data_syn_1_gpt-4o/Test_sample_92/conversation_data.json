    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs based on the given quantities of each animal.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the number of legs for each type of animal:\n- Shrimp: Typically, a shrimp has 10 legs.\n- Snake: Snakes have 0 legs.\n- Cow: Cows have 4 legs.\n- Flatworm: Flatworms have 0 legs.\n- Grasshopper: Grasshoppers have 6 legs.\n- Deer: Deers have 4 legs.\n- Wasp: Wasps have 6 legs.\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then summing up all these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"shrimp\": 10,\n    \"snake\": 0,\n    \"cow\": 4,\n    \"flatworm\": 0,\n    \"grasshopper\": 6,\n    \"deer\": 4,\n    \"wasp\": 6\n}\n\n# Number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"shrimp\": 6,\n    \"snake\": 1,\n    \"cow\": 6,\n    \"flatworm\": 3,\n    \"grasshopper\": 7,\n    \"deer\": 5,\n    \"wasp\": 14\n}\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * animal_counts[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs for the given list of animals is 230.\n\n<<<230>>>"
