    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Horses have 4 legs.\n- Lobsters have 10 legs.\n- Birds typically have 2 legs.\n- Deers have 4 legs.\n- Ants have 6 legs.\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:\n\n1. Multiply the number of horses by 4.\n2. Multiply the number of lobsters by 10.\n3. Multiply the number of birds by 2.\n4. Multiply the number of deers by 4.\n5. Multiply the number of ants by 6.\n\nFinally, sum all these results to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Number of each animal\nhorses = 11\nlobsters = 9\nbirds = 12\ndeers = 6\nants = 15\n\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_horses = horses * 4\nlegs_lobsters = lobsters * 10\nlegs_birds = birds * 2\nlegs_deers = deers * 4\nlegs_ants = ants * 6\n\n# Total number of legs\ntotal_legs = legs_horses + legs_lobsters + legs_birds + legs_deers + legs_ants\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 272. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<272>>>"
