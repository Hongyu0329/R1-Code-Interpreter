    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the given list of animals and their respective counts. We will use the typical number of legs for each type of animal:\n\n- Scorpions typically have 8 legs.\n- Jellyfish do not have legs, so they have 0 legs.\n- Beetles typically have 6 legs.\n- Cockroaches typically have 6 legs.\n\nGiven the counts of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and then summing these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_scorpion = 8\nlegs_per_jellyfish = 0\nlegs_per_beetle = 6\nlegs_per_cockroach = 6\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nnum_scorpions = 9\nnum_jellyfishs = 13\nnum_beetles = 2\nnum_cockroachs = 11\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_scorpions * legs_per_scorpion +\n              num_jellyfishs * legs_per_jellyfish +\n              num_beetles * legs_per_beetle +\n              num_cockroachs * legs_per_cockroach)\n\n# Output the total number of legs\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 150. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for 9 scorpions, 13 jellyfish, 2 beetles, and 11 cockroaches is:\n\n<<<150>>>"
