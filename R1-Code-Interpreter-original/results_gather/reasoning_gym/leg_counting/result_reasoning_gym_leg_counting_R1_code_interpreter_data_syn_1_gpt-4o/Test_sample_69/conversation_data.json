    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n- Lobsters: 10 legs\n- Butterflies: 6 legs\n- Praying mantises: 6 legs\n- Flatworms: 0 legs (they are legless)\n- Scorpions: 8 legs\n- Lions: 4 legs\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs:\n\n1. Lobsters: 10 lobsters * 10 legs = 100 legs\n2. Butterflies: 4 butterflies * 6 legs = 24 legs\n3. Praying mantises: 15 praying mantises * 6 legs = 90 legs\n4. Flatworms: 5 flatworms * 0 legs = 0 legs\n5. Scorpions: 8 scorpions * 8 legs = 64 legs\n6. Lions: 12 lions * 4 legs = 48 legs\n\nNow, let's sum these values to get the total number of legs.\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"lobster\": 10,\n    \"butterfly\": 6,\n    \"praying_mantis\": 6,\n    \"flatworm\": 0,\n    \"scorpion\": 8,\n    \"lion\": 4\n}\n\n# Number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"lobster\": 10,\n    \"butterfly\": 4,\n    \"praying_mantis\": 15,\n    \"flatworm\": 5,\n    \"scorpion\": 8,\n    \"lion\": 12\n}\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * animal_counts[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 326. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is:\n\n<<<326>>>"
