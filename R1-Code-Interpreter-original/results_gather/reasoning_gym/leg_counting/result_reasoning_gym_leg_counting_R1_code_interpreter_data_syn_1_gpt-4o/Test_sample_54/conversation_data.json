    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs based on the given quantities of each animal.\n\n1. **Shrimps**: Typically, shrimps have 10 legs.\n2. **Insects**: Insects generally have 6 legs.\n3. **Snakes**: Snakes have 0 legs.\n\nGiven:\n- 13 shrimps\n- 2 insects\n- 12 snakes\n\nWe can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and then summing these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_shrimp = 10\nlegs_per_insect = 6\nlegs_per_snake = 0\n\n# Number of each type of animal\nnum_shrimps = 13\nnum_insects = 2\nnum_snakes = 12\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_shrimps * legs_per_shrimp) + (num_insects * legs_per_insect) + (num_snakes * legs_per_snake)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 142. \n\nTo summarize the calculation:\n- Shrimps: 13 shrimps * 10 legs each = 130 legs\n- Insects: 2 insects * 6 legs each = 12 legs\n- Snakes: 12 snakes * 0 legs each = 0 legs\n\nAdding these together gives us a total of 142 legs.\n\n<<<142>>>"
