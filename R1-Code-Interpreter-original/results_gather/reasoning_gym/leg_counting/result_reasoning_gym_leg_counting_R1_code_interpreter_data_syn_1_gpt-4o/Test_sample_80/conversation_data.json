    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Starfish: 5 legs each\n- Praying mantis: 6 legs each\n- Grasshopper: 6 legs each\n- Cat: 4 legs each\n- Beetle: 6 legs each\n- Elephant: 4 legs each\n- Tiger: 4 legs each\n- Spider: 8 legs each\n- Snake: 0 legs each\n- Horse: 4 legs each\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then summing all these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"starfish\": 5,\n    \"praying_mantis\": 6,\n    \"grasshopper\": 6,\n    \"cat\": 4,\n    \"beetle\": 6,\n    \"elephant\": 4,\n    \"tiger\": 4,\n    \"spider\": 8,\n    \"snake\": 0,\n    \"horse\": 4\n}\n\n# Number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"starfish\": 10,\n    \"praying_mantis\": 4,\n    \"grasshopper\": 12,\n    \"cat\": 8,\n    \"beetle\": 8,\n    \"elephant\": 5,\n    \"tiger\": 6,\n    \"spider\": 4,\n    \"snake\": 4,\n    \"horse\": 12\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * animal_counts[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 350. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given list of animals is:\n\n<<<350>>>"
