    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the given list of animals and their respective counts. Each type of animal has a specific number of legs:\n\n- Cockroach: 6 legs\n- Butterfly: 6 legs\n- Cat: 4 legs\n- Giraffe: 4 legs\n- Spider: 8 legs\n\nWe will multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"cockroach\": 6,\n    \"butterfly\": 6,\n    \"cat\": 4,\n    \"giraffe\": 4,\n    \"spider\": 8\n}\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"cockroach\": 3,\n    \"butterfly\": 2,\n    \"cat\": 6,\n    \"giraffe\": 1,\n    \"spider\": 4\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(animal_counts[animal] * legs_per_animal[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 90. \n\nTo summarize, we calculated the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then summing up all these products.\n\n<<<90>>>"
