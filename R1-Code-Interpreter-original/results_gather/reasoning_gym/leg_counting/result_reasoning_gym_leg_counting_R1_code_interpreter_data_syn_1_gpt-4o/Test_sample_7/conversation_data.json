    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Tigers: 4 legs each\n- Bees: 6 legs each\n- Sea slugs: 0 legs each\n- Horses: 4 legs each\n- Elephants: 4 legs each\n- Wasps: 6 legs each\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:\n\n1. Multiply the number of tigers by 4.\n2. Multiply the number of bees by 6.\n3. Multiply the number of sea slugs by 0.\n4. Multiply the number of horses by 4.\n5. Multiply the number of elephants by 4.\n6. Multiply the number of wasps by 6.\n\nFinally, sum all these results to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Number of each animal\nnum_tigers = 12\nnum_bees = 10\nnum_sea_slugs = 1\nnum_horses = 11\nnum_elephants = 13\nnum_wasps = 5\n\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_tiger = 4\nlegs_per_bee = 6\nlegs_per_sea_slug = 0\nlegs_per_horse = 4\nlegs_per_elephant = 4\nlegs_per_wasp = 6\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_tigers * legs_per_tiger +\n              num_bees * legs_per_bee +\n              num_sea_slugs * legs_per_sea_slug +\n              num_horses * legs_per_horse +\n              num_elephants * legs_per_elephant +\n              num_wasps * legs_per_wasp)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 234. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is:\n\n<<<234>>>"
