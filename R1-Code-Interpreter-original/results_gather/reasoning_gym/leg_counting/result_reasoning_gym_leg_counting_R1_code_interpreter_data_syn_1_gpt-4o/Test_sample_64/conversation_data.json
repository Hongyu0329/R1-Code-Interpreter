    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Insect: Typically, insects have 6 legs.\n- Wasp: Wasps are also insects, so they have 6 legs each.\n- Lion: Lions are mammals and have 4 legs each.\n- Bird: Birds generally have 2 legs each.\n- Ant: Ants are insects, so they have 6 legs each.\n- Jellyfish: Jellyfish do not have legs, so they have 0 legs.\n- Butterfly: Butterflies are insects, so they have 6 legs each.\n- Cockroach: Cockroaches are insects, so they have 6 legs each.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs using these values:\n\n- 1 insect: 1 * 6 = 6 legs\n- 3 wasps: 3 * 6 = 18 legs\n- 7 lions: 7 * 4 = 28 legs\n- 11 birds: 11 * 2 = 22 legs\n- 6 ants: 6 * 6 = 36 legs\n- 2 jellyfish: 2 * 0 = 0 legs\n- 5 butterflies: 5 * 6 = 30 legs\n- 6 cockroaches: 6 * 6 = 36 legs\n\nNow, let's sum these values to get the total number of legs.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"insect\": 6,\n    \"wasp\": 6,\n    \"lion\": 4,\n    \"bird\": 2,\n    \"ant\": 6,\n    \"jellyfish\": 0,\n    \"butterfly\": 6,\n    \"cockroach\": 6\n}\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"insect\": 1,\n    \"wasp\": 3,\n    \"lion\": 7,\n    \"bird\": 11,\n    \"ant\": 6,\n    \"jellyfish\": 2,\n    \"butterfly\": 5,\n    \"cockroach\": 6\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * animal_counts[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\n# Output the total number of legs\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 176. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<176>>>"
