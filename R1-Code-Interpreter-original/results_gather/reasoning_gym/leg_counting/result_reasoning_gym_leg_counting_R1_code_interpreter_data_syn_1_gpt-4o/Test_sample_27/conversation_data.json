    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Chickens: 2 legs each\n- Praying mantises: 6 legs each\n- Sea slugs: 0 legs each\n- Ducks: 2 legs each\n- Starfish: 0 legs each\n- Lobsters: 10 legs each\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of legs for chickens: \\(11 \\times 2\\)\n2. Calculate the total number of legs for praying mantises: \\(10 \\times 6\\)\n3. Calculate the total number of legs for sea slugs: \\(1 \\times 0\\)\n4. Calculate the total number of legs for ducks: \\(15 \\times 2\\)\n5. Calculate the total number of legs for starfish: \\(14 \\times 0\\)\n6. Calculate the total number of legs for lobsters: \\(8 \\times 10\\)\n\nFinally, sum all these values to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\nchickens = 11\npraying_mantises = 10\nsea_slugs = 1\nducks = 15\nstarfish = 14\nlobsters = 8\n\n# Number of legs per animal\nlegs_per_chicken = 2\nlegs_per_praying_mantis = 6\nlegs_per_sea_slug = 0\nlegs_per_duck = 2\nlegs_per_starfish = 0\nlegs_per_lobster = 10\n\n# Total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (chickens * legs_per_chicken +\n              praying_mantises * legs_per_praying_mantis +\n              sea_slugs * legs_per_sea_slug +\n              ducks * legs_per_duck +\n              starfish * legs_per_starfish +\n              lobsters * legs_per_lobster)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 192. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is:\n\n<<<192>>>"
