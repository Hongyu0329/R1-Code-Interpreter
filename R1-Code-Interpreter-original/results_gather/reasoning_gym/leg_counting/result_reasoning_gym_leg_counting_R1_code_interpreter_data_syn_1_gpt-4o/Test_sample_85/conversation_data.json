    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Cows: 4 legs each\n- Cats: 4 legs each\n- Lions: 4 legs each\n- Wasps: 6 legs each\n- Shrimps: 10 legs each (decapods)\n- Grasshoppers: 6 legs each\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of legs for cows: \\(12 \\times 4\\)\n2. Calculate the total number of legs for cats: \\(2 \\times 4\\)\n3. Calculate the total number of legs for lions: \\(12 \\times 4\\)\n4. Calculate the total number of legs for wasps: \\(9 \\times 6\\)\n5. Calculate the total number of legs for shrimps: \\(10 \\times 10\\)\n6. Calculate the total number of legs for grasshoppers: \\(6 \\times 6\\)\n\nFinally, sum all these values to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\ncows = 12\ncats = 2\nlions = 12\nwasps = 9\nshrimps = 10\ngrasshoppers = 6\n\n# Number of legs per animal\nlegs_per_cow = 4\nlegs_per_cat = 4\nlegs_per_lion = 4\nlegs_per_wasp = 6\nlegs_per_shrimp = 10\nlegs_per_grasshopper = 6\n\n# Total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (cows * legs_per_cow) + (cats * legs_per_cat) + (lions * legs_per_lion) + \\\n             (wasps * legs_per_wasp) + (shrimps * legs_per_shrimp) + (grasshoppers * legs_per_grasshopper)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 294. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is:\n\n<<<294>>>"
