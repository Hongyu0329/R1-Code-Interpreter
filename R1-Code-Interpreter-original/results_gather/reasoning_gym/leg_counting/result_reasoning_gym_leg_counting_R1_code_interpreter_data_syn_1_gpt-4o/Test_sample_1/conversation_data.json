    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Elephants**: Each elephant has 4 legs. So, for 3 elephants, the total number of legs is \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n\n2. **Deers**: Each deer also has 4 legs. For 11 deers, the total number of legs is \\(11 \\times 4 = 44\\).\n\n3. **Fireflies**: Fireflies have 6 legs each. For 15 fireflies, the total number of legs is \\(15 \\times 6 = 90\\).\n\n4. **Lobsters**: Lobsters have 10 legs each. For 10 lobsters, the total number of legs is \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\).\n\n5. **Crabs**: Crabs have 10 legs each. For 9 crabs, the total number of legs is \\(9 \\times 10 = 90\\).\n\nNow, we will sum up all these legs to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nelephant_legs = 3 * 4\ndeer_legs = 11 * 4\nfirefly_legs = 15 * 6\nlobster_legs = 10 * 10\ncrab_legs = 9 * 10\n\n# Total number of legs\ntotal_legs = elephant_legs + deer_legs + firefly_legs + lobster_legs + crab_legs\n\n# Output the total number of legs\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 336. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is:\n\n<<<336>>>"
