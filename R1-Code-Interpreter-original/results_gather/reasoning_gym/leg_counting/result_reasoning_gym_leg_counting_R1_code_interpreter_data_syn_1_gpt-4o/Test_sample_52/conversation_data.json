    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Jellyfish: 0 legs\n- Spiders: 8 legs\n- Snakes: 0 legs\n- Crabs: 10 legs\n- Insects: 6 legs\n- Horses: 4 legs\n- Elephants: 4 legs\n\nGiven the quantities of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:\n\n- Total legs from jellyfish = 8 * 0\n- Total legs from spiders = 14 * 8\n- Total legs from snakes = 9 * 0\n- Total legs from crabs = 13 * 10\n- Total legs from insects = 12 * 6\n- Total legs from horses = 6 * 4\n- Total legs from elephants = 10 * 4\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to compute the total number of legs.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"jellyfish\": 0,\n    \"spider\": 8,\n    \"snake\": 0,\n    \"crab\": 10,\n    \"insect\": 6,\n    \"horse\": 4,\n    \"elephant\": 4\n}\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"jellyfish\": 8,\n    \"spider\": 14,\n    \"snake\": 9,\n    \"crab\": 13,\n    \"insect\": 12,\n    \"horse\": 6,\n    \"elephant\": 10\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * animal_counts[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\n# Print the total number of legs\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 378. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is:\n\n<<<378>>>"
