    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Here's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Horses have 4 legs.\n- Humans have 2 legs.\n- Lobsters have 10 legs.\n- Shrimps have 10 legs.\n- Ants have 6 legs.\n- Sheep have 4 legs.\n- Scorpions have 8 legs.\n\nGiven the number of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each animal by the number of legs that animal has, and then summing all these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Number of each animal\nnum_horses = 15\nnum_humans = 11\nnum_lobsters = 5\nnum_shrimps = 11\nnum_ants = 6\nnum_sheeps = 8\nnum_scorpions = 1\n\n# Number of legs for each animal\nlegs_per_horse = 4\nlegs_per_human = 2\nlegs_per_lobster = 10\nlegs_per_shrimp = 10\nlegs_per_ant = 6\nlegs_per_sheep = 4\nlegs_per_scorpion = 8\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_horses * legs_per_horse +\n              num_humans * legs_per_human +\n              num_lobsters * legs_per_lobster +\n              num_shrimps * legs_per_shrimp +\n              num_ants * legs_per_ant +\n              num_sheeps * legs_per_sheep +\n              num_scorpions * legs_per_scorpion)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 318. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<318>>>"
