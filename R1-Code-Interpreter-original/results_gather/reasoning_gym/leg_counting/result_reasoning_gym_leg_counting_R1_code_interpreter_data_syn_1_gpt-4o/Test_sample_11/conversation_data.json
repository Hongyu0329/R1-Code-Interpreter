    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the number of each type of animal and the number of legs each type of animal has. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n- Sheep have 4 legs each.\n- Dogs have 4 legs each.\n- Praying mantises have 6 legs each.\n\nGiven:\n- 6 sheep\n- 11 dogs\n- 12 praying mantises\n\nWe can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and then summing these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\nnum_sheep = 6\nnum_dogs = 11\nnum_praying_mantises = 12\n\n# Number of legs per animal\nlegs_per_sheep = 4\nlegs_per_dog = 4\nlegs_per_praying_mantis = 6\n\n# Total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_sheep * legs_per_sheep) + (num_dogs * legs_per_dog) + (num_praying_mantises * legs_per_praying_mantis)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 140. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n- Sheep: 6 sheep * 4 legs each = 24 legs\n- Dogs: 11 dogs * 4 legs each = 44 legs\n- Praying mantises: 12 praying mantises * 6 legs each = 72 legs\n\nAdding these together gives us a total of 140 legs.\n\n<<<140>>>"
