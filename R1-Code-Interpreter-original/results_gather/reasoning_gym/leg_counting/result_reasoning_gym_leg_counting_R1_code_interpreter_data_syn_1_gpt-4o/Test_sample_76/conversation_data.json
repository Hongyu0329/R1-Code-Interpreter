    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the given list of animals and their respective counts. Each type of animal has a specific number of legs:\n\n- Chickens have 2 legs.\n- Bees have 6 legs.\n- Deers have 4 legs.\n- Horses have 4 legs.\n- Starfish have 0 legs (since they are not typically considered to have legs).\n\nGiven the counts of each animal, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then summing these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    'chicken': 2,\n    'bee': 6,\n    'deer': 4,\n    'horse': 4,\n    'starfish': 0\n}\n\n# Define the number of each type of animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    'chicken': 4,\n    'bee': 3,\n    'deer': 4,\n    'horse': 12,\n    'starfish': 14\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(animal_counts[animal] * legs_per_animal[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 90. \n\nTo summarize, the total number of legs is calculated by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs that type of animal has, and then summing these products. The breakdown is as follows:\n\n- Chickens: 4 chickens * 2 legs = 8 legs\n- Bees: 3 bees * 6 legs = 18 legs\n- Deers: 4 deers * 4 legs = 16 legs\n- Horses: 12 horses * 4 legs = 48 legs\n- Starfish: 14 starfish * 0 legs = 0 legs\n\nAdding these together gives a total of 90 legs.\n\n<<<90>>>"
