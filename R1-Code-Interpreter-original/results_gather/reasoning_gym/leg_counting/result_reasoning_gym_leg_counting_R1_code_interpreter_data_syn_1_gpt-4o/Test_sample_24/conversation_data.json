    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs based on the given quantities of each animal.\n\n1. **Firefly**: Typically, a firefly is an insect, and insects generally have 6 legs.\n2. **Crab**: Crabs are crustaceans and usually have 10 legs.\n3. **Starfish**: Starfish, also known as sea stars, usually have 5 arms, but they don't have legs in the traditional sense. However, for the purpose of this problem, we can consider each arm as a leg, so we will count 5 legs for a starfish.\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of legs:\n\n- For 13 fireflies: \\(13 \\times 6\\) legs\n- For 9 crabs: \\(9 \\times 10\\) legs\n- For 15 starfish: \\(15 \\times 5\\) legs\n\nLet's compute this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\nnum_fireflies = 13\nnum_crabs = 9\nnum_starfish = 15\n\n# Legs per animal\nlegs_per_firefly = 6\nlegs_per_crab = 10\nlegs_per_starfish = 5\n\n# Total legs calculation\ntotal_legs = (num_fireflies * legs_per_firefly) + (num_crabs * legs_per_crab) + (num_starfish * legs_per_starfish)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 243. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<243>>>"
