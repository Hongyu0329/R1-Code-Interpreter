    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. We will use the typical number of legs for each animal:\n\n- Sea slugs: 0 legs\n- Shrimps: 10 legs\n- Crabs: 10 legs\n- Fireflies: 6 legs\n- Flatworms: 0 legs\n- Tigers: 4 legs\n- Wasps: 6 legs\n- Jellyfish: 0 legs\n- Birds: 2 legs\n- Lobsters: 10 legs\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and sum them up using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of legs for each animal\nlegs_per_animal = {\n    \"sea_slug\": 0,\n    \"shrimp\": 10,\n    \"crab\": 10,\n    \"firefly\": 6,\n    \"flatworm\": 0,\n    \"tiger\": 4,\n    \"wasp\": 6,\n    \"jellyfish\": 0,\n    \"bird\": 2,\n    \"lobster\": 10\n}\n\n# Define the number of each animal\nanimal_counts = {\n    \"sea_slug\": 8,\n    \"shrimp\": 6,\n    \"crab\": 7,\n    \"firefly\": 8,\n    \"flatworm\": 12,\n    \"tiger\": 11,\n    \"wasp\": 5,\n    \"jellyfish\": 12,\n    \"bird\": 4,\n    \"lobster\": 12\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of legs\ntotal_legs = sum(legs_per_animal[animal] * animal_counts[animal] for animal in animal_counts)\n\n# Output the total number of legs\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
