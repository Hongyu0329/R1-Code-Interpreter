    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the number of legs for each animal:\n- Lions have 4 legs.\n- Wasps have 6 legs.\n- Cows have 4 legs.\n- Crabs have 10 legs.\n\nGiven the quantities:\n- 3 lions\n- 6 wasps\n- 5 cows\n- 3 crabs\n\nWe can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and then summing these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each animal\nlegs_per_lion = 4\nlegs_per_wasp = 6\nlegs_per_cow = 4\nlegs_per_crab = 10\n\n# Number of each animal\nnum_lions = 3\nnum_wasps = 6\nnum_cows = 5\nnum_crabs = 3\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_lions * legs_per_lion) + (num_wasps * legs_per_wasp) + (num_cows * legs_per_cow) + (num_crabs * legs_per_crab)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs is calculated to be 98. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<98>>>"
