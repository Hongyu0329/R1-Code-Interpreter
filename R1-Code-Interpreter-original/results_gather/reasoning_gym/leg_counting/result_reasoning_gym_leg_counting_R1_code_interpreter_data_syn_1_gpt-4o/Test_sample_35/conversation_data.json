    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs based on the number of each type of animal and the number of legs each type of animal has. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n- Humans have 2 legs each.\n- Grasshoppers have 6 legs each.\n- Praying mantises have 6 legs each.\n- Deers have 4 legs each.\n\nGiven:\n- 10 humans\n- 7 grasshoppers\n- 8 praying mantises\n- 10 deers\n\nWe can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of each type of animal by the number of legs they have and then summing these products.\n\nLet's write a Python script to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Number of animals\nnum_humans = 10\nnum_grasshoppers = 7\nnum_praying_mantises = 8\nnum_deers = 10\n\n# Number of legs per animal\nlegs_per_human = 2\nlegs_per_grasshopper = 6\nlegs_per_praying_mantis = 6\nlegs_per_deer = 4\n\n# Total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_humans * legs_per_human) + \\\n             (num_grasshoppers * legs_per_grasshopper) + \\\n             (num_praying_mantises * legs_per_praying_mantis) + \\\n             (num_deers * legs_per_deer)\n\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total number of legs as 150. \n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for 10 humans, 7 grasshoppers, 8 praying mantises, and 10 deers is:\n\n<<<150>>>"
