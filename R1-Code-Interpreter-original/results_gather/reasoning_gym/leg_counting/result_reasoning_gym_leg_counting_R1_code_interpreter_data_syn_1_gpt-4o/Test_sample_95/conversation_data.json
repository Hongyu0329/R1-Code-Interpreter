    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs based on the given quantities of each animal.\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each animal:**\n   - Woodlouse: Typically, a woodlouse has 14 legs.\n   - Bird: Birds generally have 2 legs.\n   - Sea slug: Sea slugs do not have legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs:**\n   - For 1 woodlouse: \\(1 \\times 14\\) legs\n   - For 5 birds: \\(5 \\times 2\\) legs\n   - For 4 sea slugs: \\(4 \\times 0\\) legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals.**\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Number of legs for each type of animal\nlegs_per_woodlouse = 14\nlegs_per_bird = 2\nlegs_per_sea_slug = 0\n\n# Number of each type of animal\nnum_woodlice = 1\nnum_birds = 5\nnum_sea_slugs = 4\n\n# Calculate total number of legs\ntotal_legs = (num_woodlice * legs_per_woodlouse) + (num_birds * legs_per_bird) + (num_sea_slugs * legs_per_sea_slug)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_legs)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of legs.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total number of legs calculated is 24. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n- 1 woodlouse contributes \\(1 \\times 14 = 14\\) legs.\n- 5 birds contribute \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) legs.\n- 4 sea slugs contribute \\(4 \\times 0 = 0\\) legs.\n\nAdding these together gives a total of \\(14 + 10 + 0 = 24\\) legs.\n\n<<<24>>>"
