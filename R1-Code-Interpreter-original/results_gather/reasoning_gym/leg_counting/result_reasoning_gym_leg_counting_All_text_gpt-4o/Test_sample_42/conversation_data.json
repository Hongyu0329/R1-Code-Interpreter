    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze each type of animal step by step:\n\n1. **Insects**: \n   - Insects typically have 6 legs.\n   - We have 15 insects.\n   - Total legs from insects = 15 insects * 6 legs/insect = 90 legs.\n\n2. **Humans**: \n   - Humans have 2 legs.\n   - We have 14 humans.\n   - Total legs from humans = 14 humans * 2 legs/human = 28 legs.\n\n3. **Starfish**: \n   - Starfish typically have 5 arms, but they do not have legs. For the purpose of this problem, we assume starfish contribute 0 legs.\n   - We have 15 starfish.\n   - Total legs from starfish = 15 starfish * 0 legs/starfish = 0 legs.\n\n4. **Cows**: \n   - Cows have 4 legs.\n   - We have 4 cows.\n   - Total legs from cows = 4 cows * 4 legs/cow = 16 legs.\n\nNow, we sum up the total number of legs from all the animals:\n\n- Total legs = Legs from insects + Legs from humans + Legs from starfish + Legs from cows\n- Total legs = 90 legs (insects) + 28 legs (humans) + 0 legs (starfish) + 16 legs (cows)\n- Total legs = 134 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 134.\n\n<<<134>>>"
