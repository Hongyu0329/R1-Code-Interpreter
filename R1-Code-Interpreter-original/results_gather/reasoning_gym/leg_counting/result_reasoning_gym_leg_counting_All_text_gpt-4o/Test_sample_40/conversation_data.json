    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Cows: Cows are quadrupeds, meaning they have 4 legs.\n   - Butterflies: Butterflies are insects, and insects typically have 6 legs.\n   - Lobsters: Lobsters are crustaceans, and they have 10 legs.\n   - Beetles: Beetles are also insects, so they have 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each group of animals:**\n   - For cows: \n     - Number of cows = 5\n     - Legs per cow = 4\n     - Total legs for cows = 5 cows * 4 legs/cow = 20 legs\n\n   - For butterflies:\n     - Number of butterflies = 12\n     - Legs per butterfly = 6\n     - Total legs for butterflies = 12 butterflies * 6 legs/butterfly = 72 legs\n\n   - For lobsters:\n     - Number of lobsters = 12\n     - Legs per lobster = 10\n     - Total legs for lobsters = 12 lobsters * 10 legs/lobster = 120 legs\n\n   - For beetles:\n     - Number of beetles = 11\n     - Legs per beetle = 6\n     - Total legs for beetles = 11 beetles * 6 legs/beetle = 66 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all groups:**\n   - Total legs = Legs from cows + Legs from butterflies + Legs from lobsters + Legs from beetles\n   - Total legs = 20 (cows) + 72 (butterflies) + 120 (lobsters) + 66 (beetles)\n   - Total legs = 278\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 278.\n\n<<<278>>>"
