    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Praying mantis: Typically has 6 legs.\n   - Cow: Typically has 4 legs.\n   - Wasp: Typically has 6 legs.\n   - Butterfly: Typically has 6 legs.\n   - Cricket: Typically has 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For praying mantises: \n     - Number of praying mantises = 9\n     - Legs per praying mantis = 6\n     - Total legs for praying mantises = 9 * 6 = 54\n\n   - For cows:\n     - Number of cows = 13\n     - Legs per cow = 4\n     - Total legs for cows = 13 * 4 = 52\n\n   - For wasps:\n     - Number of wasps = 2\n     - Legs per wasp = 6\n     - Total legs for wasps = 2 * 6 = 12\n\n   - For butterflies:\n     - Number of butterflies = 9\n     - Legs per butterfly = 6\n     - Total legs for butterflies = 9 * 6 = 54\n\n   - For crickets:\n     - Number of crickets = 2\n     - Legs per cricket = 6\n     - Total legs for crickets = 2 * 6 = 12\n\n3. **Sum up the total number of legs for all animals:**\n   - Total legs = Total legs for praying mantises + Total legs for cows + Total legs for wasps + Total legs for butterflies + Total legs for crickets\n   - Total legs = 54 + 52 + 12 + 54 + 12 = 184\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals is 184.\n\nFinal answer: <<<184>>>"
