    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all the legs to get the total.\n\n1. **Praying Mantis**: \n   - Number of legs: 6\n   - Number of praying mantises: 3\n   - Total legs from praying mantises: 3 * 6 = 18\n\n2. **Chickens**: \n   - Number of legs: 2\n   - Number of chickens: 5\n   - Total legs from chickens: 5 * 2 = 10\n\n3. **Ducks**: \n   - Number of legs: 2\n   - Number of ducks: 2\n   - Total legs from ducks: 2 * 2 = 4\n\n4. **Bees**: \n   - Number of legs: 6\n   - Number of bees: 14\n   - Total legs from bees: 14 * 6 = 84\n\n5. **Jellyfish**: \n   - Number of legs: 0 (Jellyfish do not have legs)\n   - Number of jellyfish: 1\n   - Total legs from jellyfish: 1 * 0 = 0\n\n6. **Flatworms**: \n   - Number of legs: 0 (Flatworms do not have legs)\n   - Number of flatworms: 7\n   - Total legs from flatworms: 7 * 0 = 0\n\n7. **Fireflies**: \n   - Number of legs: 6\n   - Number of fireflies: 3\n   - Total legs from fireflies: 3 * 6 = 18\n\n8. **Insects**: \n   - Number of legs: 6\n   - Number of insects: 6\n   - Total legs from insects: 6 * 6 = 36\n\n9. **Birds**: \n   - Number of legs: 2\n   - Number of birds: 5\n   - Total legs from birds: 5 * 2 = 10\n\n10. **Cockroaches**: \n    - Number of legs: 6\n    - Number of cockroaches: 9\n    - Total legs from cockroaches: 9 * 6 = 54\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal:\n\n- Total legs = 18 (praying mantises) + 10 (chickens) + 4 (ducks) + 84 (bees) + 0 (jellyfish) + 0 (flatworms) + 18 (fireflies) + 36 (insects) + 10 (birds) + 54 (cockroaches)\n\n- Total legs = 234\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is:\n\n<<<234>>>"
