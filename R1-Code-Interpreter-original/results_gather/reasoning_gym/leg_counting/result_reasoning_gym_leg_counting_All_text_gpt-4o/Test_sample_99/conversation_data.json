    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze each type of animal step by step:\n\n1. **Beetles**: \n   - Beetles are insects, and most insects have 6 legs.\n   - Number of beetles = 15\n   - Total legs from beetles = 15 beetles * 6 legs/beetle = 90 legs\n\n2. **Scorpions**: \n   - Scorpions are arachnids, and arachnids typically have 8 legs.\n   - Number of scorpions = 2\n   - Total legs from scorpions = 2 scorpions * 8 legs/scorpion = 16 legs\n\n3. **Chickens**: \n   - Chickens are birds, and birds have 2 legs.\n   - Number of chickens = 6\n   - Total legs from chickens = 6 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 12 legs\n\n4. **Wasps**: \n   - Wasps are insects, and most insects have 6 legs.\n   - Number of wasps = 10\n   - Total legs from wasps = 10 wasps * 6 legs/wasp = 60 legs\n\n5. **Sheep**: \n   - Sheep are mammals, and mammals typically have 4 legs.\n   - Number of sheep = 10\n   - Total legs from sheep = 10 sheep * 4 legs/sheep = 40 legs\n\n6. **Sea Slugs**: \n   - Sea slugs are mollusks and do not have legs.\n   - Number of sea slugs = 2\n   - Total legs from sea slugs = 2 sea slugs * 0 legs/sea slug = 0 legs\n\n7. **Horses**: \n   - Horses are mammals, and mammals typically have 4 legs.\n   - Number of horses = 12\n   - Total legs from horses = 12 horses * 4 legs/horse = 48 legs\n\n8. **Bees**: \n   - Bees are insects, and most insects have 6 legs.\n   - Number of bees = 3\n   - Total legs from bees = 3 bees * 6 legs/bee = 18 legs\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal to get the total number of legs:\n\n- Total legs = 90 (beetles) + 16 (scorpions) + 12 (chickens) + 60 (wasps) + 40 (sheep) + 0 (sea slugs) + 48 (horses) + 18 (bees)\n\n- Total legs = 284\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 284.\n\n<<<284>>>"
