    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs for all the animals given in the list. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Chickens: Chickens are birds, and they have 2 legs.\n   - Praying mantises: These insects have 6 legs.\n   - Sea slugs: Sea slugs are mollusks and do not have legs.\n   - Ducks: Ducks are also birds, and they have 2 legs.\n   - Starfish: Starfish are echinoderms and typically have 5 arms, but they do not have legs in the traditional sense. For the purpose of this problem, we will consider them as having 0 legs.\n   - Lobsters: Lobsters are crustaceans and have 10 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Chickens: 11 chickens × 2 legs each = 22 legs\n   - Praying mantises: 10 praying mantises × 6 legs each = 60 legs\n   - Sea slugs: 1 sea slug × 0 legs = 0 legs\n   - Ducks: 15 ducks × 2 legs each = 30 legs\n   - Starfish: 14 starfish × 0 legs = 0 legs\n   - Lobsters: 8 lobsters × 10 legs each = 80 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all the animals:**\n   - Total legs = 22 (chickens) + 60 (praying mantises) + 0 (sea slug) + 30 (ducks) + 0 (starfish) + 80 (lobsters)\n   - Total legs = 192\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals listed is 192.\n\nFinal answer: <<<192>>>."
