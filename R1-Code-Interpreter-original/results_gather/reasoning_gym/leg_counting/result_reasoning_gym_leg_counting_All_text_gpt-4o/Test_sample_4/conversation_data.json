    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs for all the animals listed. Let's analyze each type of animal step by step:\n\n1. **Flatworms**: Flatworms are invertebrates and do not have legs. Therefore, the number of legs per flatworm is 0.\n\n2. **Sea Slugs**: Sea slugs are also invertebrates and do not have legs. Therefore, the number of legs per sea slug is 0.\n\n3. **Sheep**: Sheep are quadrupeds, meaning they have 4 legs each.\n\n4. **Chickens**: Chickens are birds and have 2 legs each.\n\n5. **Snakes**: Snakes are reptiles and do not have legs. Therefore, the number of legs per snake is 0.\n\n6. **Cows**: Cows are quadrupeds, meaning they have 4 legs each.\n\n7. **Humans**: Humans are bipeds, meaning they have 2 legs each.\n\n8. **Ducks**: Ducks are birds and have 2 legs each.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and sum them up:\n\n- **Flatworms**: 12 flatworms × 0 legs = 0 legs\n- **Sea Slugs**: 11 sea slugs × 0 legs = 0 legs\n- **Sheep**: 7 sheep × 4 legs = 28 legs\n- **Chickens**: 6 chickens × 2 legs = 12 legs\n- **Snakes**: 9 snakes × 0 legs = 0 legs\n- **Cows**: 5 cows × 4 legs = 20 legs\n- **Humans**: 9 humans × 2 legs = 18 legs\n- **Ducks**: 2 ducks × 2 legs = 4 legs\n\nFinally, add up all the legs:\n\n0 (flatworms) + 0 (sea slugs) + 28 (sheep) + 12 (chickens) + 0 (snakes) + 20 (cows) + 18 (humans) + 4 (ducks) = 82 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 82.\n\n<<<82>>>"
