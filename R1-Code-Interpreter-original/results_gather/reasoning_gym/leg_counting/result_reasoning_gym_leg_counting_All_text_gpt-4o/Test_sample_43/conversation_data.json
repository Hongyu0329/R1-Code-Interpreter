    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given in the list. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each type of animal:\n\n1. **Crickets**: Crickets are insects, and insects typically have 6 legs.\n   - Number of crickets = 15\n   - Total legs from crickets = 15 * 6 = 90\n\n2. **Praying Mantises**: Praying mantises are also insects, so they have 6 legs.\n   - Number of praying mantises = 2\n   - Total legs from praying mantises = 2 * 6 = 12\n\n3. **Jellyfish**: Jellyfish do not have legs.\n   - Number of jellyfish = 13\n   - Total legs from jellyfish = 13 * 0 = 0\n\n4. **Scorpions**: Scorpions are arachnids, and they have 8 legs.\n   - Number of scorpions = 5\n   - Total legs from scorpions = 5 * 8 = 40\n\n5. **Fireflies**: Fireflies are insects, so they have 6 legs.\n   - Number of fireflies = 5\n   - Total legs from fireflies = 5 * 6 = 30\n\n6. **Butterflies**: Butterflies are insects, so they have 6 legs.\n   - Number of butterflies = 8\n   - Total legs from butterflies = 8 * 6 = 48\n\n7. **Flatworms**: Flatworms do not have legs.\n   - Number of flatworms = 12\n   - Total legs from flatworms = 12 * 0 = 0\n\n8. **Cockroaches**: Cockroaches are insects, so they have 6 legs.\n   - Number of cockroaches = 14\n   - Total legs from cockroaches = 14 * 6 = 84\n\n9. **Spiders**: Spiders are arachnids, and they have 8 legs.\n   - Number of spiders = 11\n   - Total legs from spiders = 11 * 8 = 88\n\n10. **Cats**: Cats are mammals, and they have 4 legs.\n    - Number of cats = 6\n    - Total legs from cats = 6 * 4 = 24\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal to get the total number of legs:\n\n- Total legs = 90 (crickets) + 12 (praying mantises) + 0 (jellyfish) + 40 (scorpions) + 30 (fireflies) + 48 (butterflies) + 0 (flatworms) + 84 (cockroaches) + 88 (spiders) + 24 (cats)\n\n- Total legs = 416\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is:\n\n<<<416>>>"
