    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Beetles: Beetles are insects, and insects typically have 6 legs.\n   - Sea slugs: Sea slugs are mollusks and do not have legs.\n   - Elephants: Elephants are mammals and have 4 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For beetles: \n     - Number of beetles = 9\n     - Legs per beetle = 6\n     - Total legs from beetles = 9 beetles * 6 legs/beetle = 54 legs\n\n   - For sea slugs:\n     - Number of sea slugs = 6\n     - Legs per sea slug = 0\n     - Total legs from sea slugs = 6 sea slugs * 0 legs/sea slug = 0 legs\n\n   - For elephants:\n     - Number of elephants = 8\n     - Legs per elephant = 4\n     - Total legs from elephants = 8 elephants * 4 legs/elephant = 32 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = Legs from beetles + Legs from sea slugs + Legs from elephants\n   - Total legs = 54 legs (beetles) + 0 legs (sea slugs) + 32 legs (elephants) = 86 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is 86.\n\nFinal answer: <<<86>>>."
