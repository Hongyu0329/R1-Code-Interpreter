    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each type of animal:\n\n1. **Ants**: Ants have 6 legs.\n   - Number of ants = 13\n   - Total legs from ants = 13 * 6 = 78\n\n2. **Shrimps**: Shrimps have 10 legs.\n   - Number of shrimps = 14\n   - Total legs from shrimps = 14 * 10 = 140\n\n3. **Lobsters**: Lobsters have 10 legs.\n   - Number of lobsters = 10\n   - Total legs from lobsters = 10 * 10 = 100\n\n4. **Bee**: Bees have 6 legs.\n   - Number of bees = 1\n   - Total legs from bees = 1 * 6 = 6\n\n5. **Fireflies**: Fireflies have 6 legs.\n   - Number of fireflies = 15\n   - Total legs from fireflies = 15 * 6 = 90\n\n6. **Sea Slugs**: Sea slugs have 0 legs.\n   - Number of sea slugs = 6\n   - Total legs from sea slugs = 6 * 0 = 0\n\n7. **Chickens**: Chickens have 2 legs.\n   - Number of chickens = 5\n   - Total legs from chickens = 5 * 2 = 10\n\n8. **Leeches**: Leeches have 0 legs.\n   - Number of leeches = 12\n   - Total legs from leeches = 12 * 0 = 0\n\n9. **Elephants**: Elephants have 4 legs.\n   - Number of elephants = 6\n   - Total legs from elephants = 6 * 4 = 24\n\n10. **Woodlice**: Woodlice have 14 legs.\n    - Number of woodlice = 4\n    - Total legs from woodlice = 4 * 14 = 56\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal:\n\n- Total legs = 78 (ants) + 140 (shrimps) + 100 (lobsters) + 6 (bee) + 90 (fireflies) + 0 (sea slugs) + 10 (chickens) + 0 (leeches) + 24 (elephants) + 56 (woodlice)\n\n- Total legs = 504\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is:\n\n<<<504>>>"
