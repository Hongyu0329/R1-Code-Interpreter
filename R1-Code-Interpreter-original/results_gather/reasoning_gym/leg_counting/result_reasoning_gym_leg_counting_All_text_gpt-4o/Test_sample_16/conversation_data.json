    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each type of animal:\n\n1. **Ducks**: Ducks are birds, and birds typically have 2 legs.\n   - Number of ducks = 7\n   - Total legs from ducks = 7 ducks * 2 legs/duck = 14 legs\n\n2. **Shrimps**: Shrimps are crustaceans, and they typically have 10 legs.\n   - Number of shrimps = 3\n   - Total legs from shrimps = 3 shrimps * 10 legs/shrimp = 30 legs\n\n3. **Lobsters**: Lobsters are also crustaceans, and they typically have 10 legs.\n   - Number of lobsters = 3\n   - Total legs from lobsters = 3 lobsters * 10 legs/lobster = 30 legs\n\n4. **Starfish**: Starfish are echinoderms and do not have legs. They have arms, but for the purpose of this problem, they contribute 0 legs.\n   - Number of starfish = 13\n   - Total legs from starfish = 13 starfish * 0 legs/starfish = 0 legs\n\n5. **Scorpions**: Scorpions are arachnids, and they typically have 8 legs.\n   - Number of scorpions = 14\n   - Total legs from scorpions = 14 scorpions * 8 legs/scorpion = 112 legs\n\n6. **Horses**: Horses are mammals, and they typically have 4 legs.\n   - Number of horses = 11\n   - Total legs from horses = 11 horses * 4 legs/horse = 44 legs\n\n7. **Butterflies**: Butterflies are insects, and they typically have 6 legs.\n   - Number of butterflies = 2\n   - Total legs from butterflies = 2 butterflies * 6 legs/butterfly = 12 legs\n\n8. **Bees**: Bees are also insects, and they typically have 6 legs.\n   - Number of bees = 8\n   - Total legs from bees = 8 bees * 6 legs/bee = 48 legs\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal to get the total number of legs:\n\n- Total legs = 14 (ducks) + 30 (shrimps) + 30 (lobsters) + 0 (starfish) + 112 (scorpions) + 44 (horses) + 12 (butterflies) + 48 (bees)\n\n- Total legs = 290\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is:\n\n<<<290>>>"
