    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each type of animal:\n\n1. **Woodlouse**: A woodlouse typically has 14 legs.\n2. **Butterfly**: A butterfly has 6 legs.\n3. **Human**: A human has 2 legs.\n4. **Chicken**: A chicken has 2 legs.\n5. **Shrimp**: A shrimp typically has 10 legs.\n6. **Dog**: A dog has 4 legs.\n7. **Crab**: A crab typically has 10 legs.\n8. **Horse**: A horse has 4 legs.\n9. **Flatworm**: Flatworms do not have legs.\n10. **Wasp**: A wasp has 6 legs.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:\n\n1. **Woodlouses**: 3 woodlouses × 14 legs = 42 legs\n2. **Butterflies**: 10 butterflies × 6 legs = 60 legs\n3. **Human**: 1 human × 2 legs = 2 legs\n4. **Chickens**: 10 chickens × 2 legs = 20 legs\n5. **Shrimps**: 9 shrimps × 10 legs = 90 legs\n6. **Dogs**: 15 dogs × 4 legs = 60 legs\n7. **Crabs**: 2 crabs × 10 legs = 20 legs\n8. **Horses**: 11 horses × 4 legs = 44 legs\n9. **Flatworms**: 10 flatworms × 0 legs = 0 legs\n10. **Wasps**: 14 wasps × 6 legs = 84 legs\n\nFinally, we sum up all these values to get the total number of legs:\n\n42 (woodlouses) + 60 (butterflies) + 2 (human) + 20 (chickens) + 90 (shrimps) + 60 (dogs) + 20 (crabs) + 44 (horses) + 0 (flatworms) + 84 (wasps) = 422 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is:\n\n<<<422>>>"
