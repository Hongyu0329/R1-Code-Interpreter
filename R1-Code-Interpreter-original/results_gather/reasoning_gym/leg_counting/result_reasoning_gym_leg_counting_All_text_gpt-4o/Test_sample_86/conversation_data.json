    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each type of animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each type of animal:\n\n1. **Starfish**: Starfish typically have 5 arms, but they do not have legs in the traditional sense. For the purpose of this problem, we will consider starfish to have 0 legs.\n\n2. **Birds**: Birds generally have 2 legs.\n\n3. **Beetles**: Beetles, being insects, have 6 legs.\n\n4. **Sheep**: Sheep are quadrupeds, meaning they have 4 legs.\n\n5. **Sea slugs**: Sea slugs do not have legs. They are mollusks and move using a muscular foot, so for this problem, we will consider them to have 0 legs.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs:\n\n- **Starfish**: 5 starfish × 0 legs/starfish = 0 legs\n- **Birds**: 6 birds × 2 legs/bird = 12 legs\n- **Beetles**: 15 beetles × 6 legs/beetle = 90 legs\n- **Sheep**: 1 sheep × 4 legs/sheep = 4 legs\n- **Sea slugs**: 10 sea slugs × 0 legs/sea slug = 0 legs\n\nFinally, we sum up all the legs:\n\n0 (starfish) + 12 (birds) + 90 (beetles) + 4 (sheep) + 0 (sea slugs) = 106 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 106.\n\n<<<106>>>"
