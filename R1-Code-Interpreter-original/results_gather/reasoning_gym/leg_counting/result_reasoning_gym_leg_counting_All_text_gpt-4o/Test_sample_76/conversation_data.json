    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Chickens: Chickens have 2 legs each.\n   - Bees: Bees have 6 legs each.\n   - Deers: Deers have 4 legs each.\n   - Horses: Horses have 4 legs each.\n   - Starfish: Starfish have 0 legs each (they have arms, not legs).\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For chickens: 4 chickens × 2 legs each = 8 legs\n   - For bees: 3 bees × 6 legs each = 18 legs\n   - For deers: 4 deers × 4 legs each = 16 legs\n   - For horses: 12 horses × 4 legs each = 48 legs\n   - For starfish: 14 starfish × 0 legs each = 0 legs\n\n3. **Sum up the total number of legs:**\n   - Total legs = Legs from chickens + Legs from bees + Legs from deers + Legs from horses + Legs from starfish\n   - Total legs = 8 + 18 + 16 + 48 + 0\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 90\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 90.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<90>>>."
