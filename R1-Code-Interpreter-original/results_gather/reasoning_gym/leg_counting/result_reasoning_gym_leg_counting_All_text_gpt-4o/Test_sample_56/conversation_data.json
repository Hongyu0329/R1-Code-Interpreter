    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze the number of legs for each animal type:\n\n1. **Horses**: Each horse has 4 legs.\n   - Number of horses = 4\n   - Total legs from horses = 4 horses * 4 legs/horse = 16 legs\n\n2. **Ants**: Each ant has 6 legs.\n   - Number of ants = 2\n   - Total legs from ants = 2 ants * 6 legs/ant = 12 legs\n\n3. **Cows**: Each cow has 4 legs.\n   - Number of cows = 12\n   - Total legs from cows = 12 cows * 4 legs/cow = 48 legs\n\n4. **Snakes**: Snakes have 0 legs.\n   - Number of snakes = 3\n   - Total legs from snakes = 3 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs\n\n5. **Crabs**: Each crab has 10 legs.\n   - Number of crabs = 10\n   - Total legs from crabs = 10 crabs * 10 legs/crab = 100 legs\n\n6. **Shrimps**: Each shrimp has 10 legs.\n   - Number of shrimps = 3\n   - Total legs from shrimps = 3 shrimps * 10 legs/shrimp = 30 legs\n\n7. **Spiders**: Each spider has 8 legs.\n   - Number of spiders = 8\n   - Total legs from spiders = 8 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 64 legs\n\n8. **Elephants**: Each elephant has 4 legs.\n   - Number of elephants = 7\n   - Total legs from elephants = 7 elephants * 4 legs/elephant = 28 legs\n\n9. **Leeches**: Leeches have 0 legs.\n   - Number of leeches = 6\n   - Total legs from leeches = 6 leeches * 0 legs/leech = 0 legs\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal:\n\n- Total legs = 16 (horses) + 12 (ants) + 48 (cows) + 0 (snakes) + 100 (crabs) + 30 (shrimps) + 64 (spiders) + 28 (elephants) + 0 (leeches)\n\n- Total legs = 298\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 298.\n\n<<<298>>>"
