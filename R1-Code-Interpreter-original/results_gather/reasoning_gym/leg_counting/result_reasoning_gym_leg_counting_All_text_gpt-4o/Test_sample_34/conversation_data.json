    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - **Starfish:** Starfish typically have 5 arms, but they do not have legs in the traditional sense. For the purpose of this problem, we will consider starfish as having 0 legs.\n   - **Cricket:** Crickets have 6 legs.\n   - **Giraffe:** Giraffes, like most mammals, have 4 legs.\n   - **Cockroach:** Cockroaches have 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - **Starfish:** 5 starfish × 0 legs/starfish = 0 legs\n   - **Crickets:** 5 crickets × 6 legs/cricket = 30 legs\n   - **Giraffes:** 14 giraffes × 4 legs/giraffe = 56 legs\n   - **Cockroaches:** 13 cockroaches × 6 legs/cockroach = 78 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = 0 (starfish) + 30 (crickets) + 56 (giraffes) + 78 (cockroaches)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 0 + 30 + 56 + 78 = 164\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is 164.\n\nFinal answer: <<<164>>>"
