    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Elephants: Typically, an elephant has 4 legs.\n   - Deers: A deer also has 4 legs.\n   - Fireflies: Fireflies are insects, and insects generally have 6 legs.\n   - Lobsters: Lobsters are crustaceans and have 10 legs.\n   - Crabs: Crabs are also crustaceans and typically have 10 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For elephants: \n     - Number of elephants = 3\n     - Legs per elephant = 4\n     - Total legs from elephants = 3 * 4 = 12\n\n   - For deers:\n     - Number of deers = 11\n     - Legs per deer = 4\n     - Total legs from deers = 11 * 4 = 44\n\n   - For fireflies:\n     - Number of fireflies = 15\n     - Legs per firefly = 6\n     - Total legs from fireflies = 15 * 6 = 90\n\n   - For lobsters:\n     - Number of lobsters = 10\n     - Legs per lobster = 10\n     - Total legs from lobsters = 10 * 10 = 100\n\n   - For crabs:\n     - Number of crabs = 9\n     - Legs per crab = 10\n     - Total legs from crabs = 9 * 10 = 90\n\n3. **Sum up the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = Legs from elephants + Legs from deers + Legs from fireflies + Legs from lobsters + Legs from crabs\n   - Total legs = 12 + 44 + 90 + 100 + 90 = 336\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 336.\n\n<<<336>>>"
