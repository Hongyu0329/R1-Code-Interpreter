    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Scorpions: Scorpions are arachnids, and they typically have 8 legs.\n   - Jellyfish: Jellyfish do not have legs. They have tentacles, but for the purpose of this problem, we consider them to have 0 legs.\n   - Beetles: Beetles are insects, and they typically have 6 legs.\n   - Cockroaches: Cockroaches are also insects, and they typically have 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For scorpions: \n     - Number of scorpions = 9\n     - Legs per scorpion = 8\n     - Total legs from scorpions = 9 * 8 = 72\n   - For jellyfish:\n     - Number of jellyfish = 13\n     - Legs per jellyfish = 0\n     - Total legs from jellyfish = 13 * 0 = 0\n   - For beetles:\n     - Number of beetles = 2\n     - Legs per beetle = 6\n     - Total legs from beetles = 2 * 6 = 12\n   - For cockroaches:\n     - Number of cockroaches = 11\n     - Legs per cockroach = 6\n     - Total legs from cockroaches = 11 * 6 = 66\n\n3. **Sum up the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = Legs from scorpions + Legs from jellyfish + Legs from beetles + Legs from cockroaches\n   - Total legs = 72 + 0 + 12 + 66 = 150\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 150.\n\nFinal answer: <<<150>>>."
