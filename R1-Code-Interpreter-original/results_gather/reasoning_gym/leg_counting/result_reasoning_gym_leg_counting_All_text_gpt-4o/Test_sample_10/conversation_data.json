    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Sea slugs: Sea slugs are mollusks and do not have legs. Therefore, the number of legs per sea slug is 0.\n   - Deers: Deers are quadrupeds, meaning they have 4 legs each.\n   - Giraffes: Giraffes are also quadrupeds, so they have 4 legs each.\n   - Elephants: Elephants are quadrupeds as well, with 4 legs each.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For sea slugs: \n     - Number of sea slugs = 3\n     - Legs per sea slug = 0\n     - Total legs from sea slugs = 3 * 0 = 0\n   - For deers:\n     - Number of deers = 12\n     - Legs per deer = 4\n     - Total legs from deers = 12 * 4 = 48\n   - For giraffes:\n     - Number of giraffes = 2\n     - Legs per giraffe = 4\n     - Total legs from giraffes = 2 * 4 = 8\n   - For elephants:\n     - Number of elephants = 11\n     - Legs per elephant = 4\n     - Total legs from elephants = 11 * 4 = 44\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = Total legs from sea slugs + Total legs from deers + Total legs from giraffes + Total legs from elephants\n   - Total legs = 0 + 48 + 8 + 44 = 100\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 100.\n\nFinal answer: <<<100>>>"
