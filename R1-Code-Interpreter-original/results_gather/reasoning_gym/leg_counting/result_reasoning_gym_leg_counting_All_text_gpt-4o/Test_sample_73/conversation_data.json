    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each type of animal:\n\n1. **Birds**: Typically, birds have 2 legs.\n   - Number of birds = 6\n   - Total legs from birds = 6 * 2 = 12\n\n2. **Snakes**: Snakes do not have legs.\n   - Number of snakes = 3\n   - Total legs from snakes = 3 * 0 = 0\n\n3. **Starfish**: Starfish do not have legs; they have arms.\n   - Number of starfish = 13\n   - Total legs from starfish = 13 * 0 = 0\n\n4. **Crabs**: Crabs typically have 10 legs.\n   - Number of crabs = 15\n   - Total legs from crabs = 15 * 10 = 150\n\n5. **Ants**: Ants have 6 legs.\n   - Number of ants = 3\n   - Total legs from ants = 3 * 6 = 18\n\n6. **Sheep**: Sheep have 4 legs.\n   - Number of sheep = 2\n   - Total legs from sheep = 2 * 4 = 8\n\n7. **Chickens**: Chickens have 2 legs.\n   - Number of chickens = 11\n   - Total legs from chickens = 11 * 2 = 22\n\n8. **Crickets**: Crickets have 6 legs.\n   - Number of crickets = 7\n   - Total legs from crickets = 7 * 6 = 42\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal:\n\n- Total legs = 12 (birds) + 0 (snakes) + 0 (starfish) + 150 (crabs) + 18 (ants) + 8 (sheep) + 22 (chickens) + 42 (crickets)\n\n- Total legs = 252\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is:\n\n<<<252>>>"
