    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs based on the given quantities of each animal. Let's analyze each type of animal step by step:\n\n1. **Leech**: \n   - Leeches are invertebrates and do not have legs. \n   - Therefore, the number of legs per leech is 0.\n\n2. **Giraffe**: \n   - Giraffes are mammals and have 4 legs.\n   - Therefore, the number of legs per giraffe is 4.\n\n3. **Praying Mantis**: \n   - Praying mantises are insects and have 6 legs.\n   - Therefore, the number of legs per praying mantis is 6.\n\n4. **Starfish**: \n   - Starfish are echinoderms and do not have legs. They have arms, but for the purpose of this question, they are considered to have 0 legs.\n   - Therefore, the number of legs per starfish is 0.\n\n5. **Butterfly**: \n   - Butterflies are insects and have 6 legs.\n   - Therefore, the number of legs per butterfly is 6.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal based on the given quantities:\n\n- **Leeches**: \n  - Number of leeches = 3\n  - Total legs from leeches = 3 leeches * 0 legs/each = 0 legs\n\n- **Giraffes**: \n  - Number of giraffes = 9\n  - Total legs from giraffes = 9 giraffes * 4 legs/each = 36 legs\n\n- **Praying Mantises**: \n  - Number of praying mantises = 3\n  - Total legs from praying mantises = 3 praying mantises * 6 legs/each = 18 legs\n\n- **Starfish**: \n  - Number of starfish = 3\n  - Total legs from starfish = 3 starfish * 0 legs/each = 0 legs\n\n- **Butterfly**: \n  - Number of butterflies = 1\n  - Total legs from butterflies = 1 butterfly * 6 legs/each = 6 legs\n\nFinally, we sum up the total number of legs from all the animals:\n\nTotal legs = 0 (from leeches) + 36 (from giraffes) + 18 (from praying mantises) + 0 (from starfish) + 6 (from butterfly) = 60 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is:\n\n<<<60>>>"
