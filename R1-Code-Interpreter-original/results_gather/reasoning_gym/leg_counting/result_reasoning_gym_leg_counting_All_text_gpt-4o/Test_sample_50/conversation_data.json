    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Spiders: 8 legs\n   - Scorpions: 8 legs\n   - Sheep: 4 legs\n   - Cows: 4 legs\n   - Cats: 4 legs\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For spiders: \n     - Number of spiders = 11\n     - Total legs from spiders = 11 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 88 legs\n   - For scorpions:\n     - Number of scorpions = 5\n     - Total legs from scorpions = 5 scorpions * 8 legs/scorpion = 40 legs\n   - For sheep:\n     - Number of sheep = 3\n     - Total legs from sheep = 3 sheep * 4 legs/sheep = 12 legs\n   - For cows:\n     - Number of cows = 13\n     - Total legs from cows = 13 cows * 4 legs/cow = 52 legs\n   - For cats:\n     - Number of cats = 15\n     - Total legs from cats = 15 cats * 4 legs/cat = 60 legs\n\n3. **Sum up the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = Legs from spiders + Legs from scorpions + Legs from sheep + Legs from cows + Legs from cats\n   - Total legs = 88 + 40 + 12 + 52 + 60\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 252\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 252.\n\nFinal answer: <<<252>>>"
