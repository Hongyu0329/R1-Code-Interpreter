    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs for the given quantities of each animal. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - **Shrimp:** Typically, a shrimp has 10 legs.\n   - **Snake:** Snakes do not have legs.\n   - **Cow:** A cow has 4 legs.\n   - **Flatworm:** Flatworms do not have legs.\n   - **Grasshopper:** A grasshopper has 6 legs.\n   - **Deer:** A deer has 4 legs.\n   - **Wasp:** A wasp has 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - **Shrimps:** 6 shrimps × 10 legs/shrimp = 60 legs\n   - **Snake:** 1 snake × 0 legs/snake = 0 legs\n   - **Cows:** 6 cows × 4 legs/cow = 24 legs\n   - **Flatworms:** 3 flatworms × 0 legs/flatworm = 0 legs\n   - **Grasshoppers:** 7 grasshoppers × 6 legs/grasshopper = 42 legs\n   - **Deers:** 5 deers × 4 legs/deer = 20 legs\n   - **Wasps:** 14 wasps × 6 legs/wasp = 84 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs:**\n   - Total legs = 60 (shrimps) + 0 (snake) + 24 (cows) + 0 (flatworms) + 42 (grasshoppers) + 20 (deers) + 84 (wasps)\n   - Total legs = 230\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is 230.\n\nFinal answer: <<<230>>>."
