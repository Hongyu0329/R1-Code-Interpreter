    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all the legs to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Scorpions: Typically have 8 legs.\n   - Snakes: Have 0 legs.\n   - Tigers: Have 4 legs.\n   - Dogs: Have 4 legs.\n   - Horses: Have 4 legs.\n   - Lobsters: Typically have 10 legs.\n   - Jellyfish: Have 0 legs.\n   - Birds: Typically have 2 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Scorpions: 9 scorpions * 8 legs/scorpion = 72 legs\n   - Snakes: 1 snake * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs\n   - Tigers: 10 tigers * 4 legs/tiger = 40 legs\n   - Dogs: 4 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 16 legs\n   - Horses: 9 horses * 4 legs/horse = 36 legs\n   - Lobsters: 1 lobster * 10 legs/lobster = 10 legs\n   - Jellyfish: 14 jellyfish * 0 legs/jellyfish = 0 legs\n   - Birds: 12 birds * 2 legs/bird = 24 legs\n\n3. **Sum up all the legs:**\n   - Total legs = 72 (scorpions) + 0 (snakes) + 40 (tigers) + 16 (dogs) + 36 (horses) + 10 (lobsters) + 0 (jellyfish) + 24 (birds)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 72 + 0 + 40 + 16 + 36 + 10 + 0 + 24 = 198\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 198.\n\nFinal answer: <<<198>>>"
