    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs for the given quantities of each animal. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - **Flatworms:** Flatworms are invertebrates that do not have legs. Therefore, they have 0 legs.\n   - **Scorpions:** Scorpions are arachnids, and like all arachnids, they have 8 legs.\n   - **Fireflies:** Fireflies are insects, and insects have 6 legs.\n   - **Beetles:** Beetles are also insects, so they have 6 legs.\n   - **Grasshoppers:** Grasshoppers are insects, thus they have 6 legs.\n   - **Jellyfish:** Jellyfish do not have legs; they have tentacles. Therefore, they have 0 legs.\n   - **Praying Mantises:** Praying mantises are insects, so they have 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - **Flatworms:** 3 flatworms × 0 legs = 0 legs\n   - **Scorpions:** 3 scorpions × 8 legs = 24 legs\n   - **Fireflies:** 13 fireflies × 6 legs = 78 legs\n   - **Beetles:** 7 beetles × 6 legs = 42 legs\n   - **Grasshoppers:** 14 grasshoppers × 6 legs = 84 legs\n   - **Jellyfish:** 3 jellyfish × 0 legs = 0 legs\n   - **Praying Mantises:** 6 praying mantises × 6 legs = 36 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all the animals:**\n   - Total legs = 0 (flatworms) + 24 (scorpions) + 78 (fireflies) + 42 (beetles) + 84 (grasshoppers) + 0 (jellyfish) + 36 (praying mantises)\n   - Total legs = 264\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals is 264.\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<264>>>"
