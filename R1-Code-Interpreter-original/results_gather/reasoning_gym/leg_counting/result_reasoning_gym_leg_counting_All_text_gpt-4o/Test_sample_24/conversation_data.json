    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for the given animals: fireflies, crabs, and starfish. We will analyze each type of animal step by step to calculate the total number of legs.\n\n1. **Fireflies:**\n   - Fireflies are insects, and like most insects, they have 6 legs.\n   - We have 13 fireflies.\n   - To find the total number of legs for the fireflies, we multiply the number of fireflies by the number of legs each has:\n     \\[\n     13 \\text{ fireflies} \\times 6 \\text{ legs/firefly} = 78 \\text{ legs}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Crabs:**\n   - Crabs are crustaceans, and they typically have 10 legs.\n   - We have 9 crabs.\n   - To find the total number of legs for the crabs, we multiply the number of crabs by the number of legs each has:\n     \\[\n     9 \\text{ crabs} \\times 10 \\text{ legs/crab} = 90 \\text{ legs}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Starfish:**\n   - Starfish, also known as sea stars, usually have 5 arms, but they do not have legs in the traditional sense. However, for the purpose of this problem, we will consider each arm as a leg.\n   - We have 15 starfish.\n   - To find the total number of \"legs\" for the starfish, we multiply the number of starfish by the number of arms (considered as legs) each has:\n     \\[\n     15 \\text{ starfish} \\times 5 \\text{ arms/starfish} = 75 \\text{ legs}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total Calculation:**\n   - Now, we sum up the total number of legs from all the animals:\n     \\[\n     78 \\text{ legs (fireflies)} + 90 \\text{ legs (crabs)} + 75 \\text{ legs (starfish)} = 243 \\text{ legs}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is 243.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<243>>>."
