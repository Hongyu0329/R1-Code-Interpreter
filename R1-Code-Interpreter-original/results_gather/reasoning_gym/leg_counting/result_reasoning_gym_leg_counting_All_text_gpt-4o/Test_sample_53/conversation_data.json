    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Birds typically have 2 legs.\n   - Insects generally have 6 legs.\n   - Horses have 4 legs.\n   - Elephants have 4 legs.\n   - Praying mantises, being insects, have 6 legs.\n   - Butterflies, also insects, have 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each group of animals:**\n   - For birds: 10 birds × 2 legs/bird = 20 legs\n   - For insects: 4 insects × 6 legs/insect = 24 legs\n   - For horses: 11 horses × 4 legs/horse = 44 legs\n   - For elephants: 7 elephants × 4 legs/elephant = 28 legs\n   - For praying mantises: 9 praying mantises × 6 legs/mantis = 54 legs\n   - For butterflies: 14 butterflies × 6 legs/butterfly = 84 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all groups:**\n   - Total legs = 20 (birds) + 24 (insects) + 44 (horses) + 28 (elephants) + 54 (praying mantises) + 84 (butterflies)\n\n4. **Perform the addition:**\n   - Total legs = 20 + 24 + 44 + 28 + 54 + 84 = 254\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals is 254.\n\nFinal answer: <<<254>>>."
