    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Horses have 4 legs.\n   - Lobsters have 10 legs.\n   - Birds typically have 2 legs.\n   - Deers have 4 legs.\n   - Ants have 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For horses: 11 horses * 4 legs/horse = 44 legs\n   - For lobsters: 9 lobsters * 10 legs/lobster = 90 legs\n   - For birds: 12 birds * 2 legs/bird = 24 legs\n   - For deers: 6 deers * 4 legs/deer = 24 legs\n   - For ants: 15 ants * 6 legs/ant = 90 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = 44 (horses) + 90 (lobsters) + 24 (birds) + 24 (deers) + 90 (ants)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 44 + 90 + 24 + 24 + 90 = 272\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 272.\n\n<<<272>>>"
