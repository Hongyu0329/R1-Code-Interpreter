    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze each type of animal step by step:\n\n1. **Horses**: \n   - Each horse has 4 legs.\n   - Number of horses = 14.\n   - Total legs from horses = 14 horses * 4 legs/horse = 56 legs.\n\n2. **Praying Mantises**:\n   - Each praying mantis has 6 legs.\n   - Number of praying mantises = 5.\n   - Total legs from praying mantises = 5 mantises * 6 legs/mantis = 30 legs.\n\n3. **Chickens**:\n   - Each chicken has 2 legs.\n   - Number of chickens = 12.\n   - Total legs from chickens = 12 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 24 legs.\n\n4. **Insects**:\n   - Each insect typically has 6 legs.\n   - Number of insects = 6.\n   - Total legs from insects = 6 insects * 6 legs/insect = 36 legs.\n\n5. **Lions**:\n   - Each lion has 4 legs.\n   - Number of lions = 6.\n   - Total legs from lions = 6 lions * 4 legs/lion = 24 legs.\n\n6. **Elephants**:\n   - Each elephant has 4 legs.\n   - Number of elephants = 12.\n   - Total legs from elephants = 12 elephants * 4 legs/elephant = 48 legs.\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal to get the total number of legs:\n\n- Total legs = Legs from horses + Legs from praying mantises + Legs from chickens + Legs from insects + Legs from lions + Legs from elephants\n- Total legs = 56 + 30 + 24 + 36 + 24 + 48\n\nCalculating the sum:\n\n- Total legs = 218\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 218.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<218>>>."
