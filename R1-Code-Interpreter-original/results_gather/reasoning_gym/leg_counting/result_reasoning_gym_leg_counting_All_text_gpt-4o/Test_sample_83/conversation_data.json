    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Horses have 4 legs.\n   - Humans have 2 legs.\n   - Lobsters have 10 legs.\n   - Shrimps have 10 legs.\n   - Ants have 6 legs.\n   - Sheep have 4 legs.\n   - Scorpions have 8 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For horses: 15 horses × 4 legs/horse = 60 legs\n   - For humans: 11 humans × 2 legs/human = 22 legs\n   - For lobsters: 5 lobsters × 10 legs/lobster = 50 legs\n   - For shrimps: 11 shrimps × 10 legs/shrimp = 110 legs\n   - For ants: 6 ants × 6 legs/ant = 36 legs\n   - For sheep: 8 sheep × 4 legs/sheep = 32 legs\n   - For scorpions: 1 scorpion × 8 legs/scorpion = 8 legs\n\n3. **Sum up the total number of legs:**\n   - Total legs = 60 (horses) + 22 (humans) + 50 (lobsters) + 110 (shrimps) + 36 (ants) + 32 (sheep) + 8 (scorpions)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 60 + 22 + 50 + 110 + 36 + 32 + 8 = 318\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 318.\n\n<<<318>>>"
