    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each type of animal:\n\n1. **Praying Mantis**: \n   - Number of legs: 6\n   - Number of praying mantises: 5\n   - Total legs from praying mantises: 5 * 6 = 30\n\n2. **Bee**: \n   - Number of legs: 6\n   - Number of bees: 5\n   - Total legs from bees: 5 * 6 = 30\n\n3. **Horse**: \n   - Number of legs: 4\n   - Number of horses: 13\n   - Total legs from horses: 13 * 4 = 52\n\n4. **Starfish**: \n   - Number of legs: 0 (Starfish have arms, not legs)\n   - Number of starfish: 14\n   - Total legs from starfish: 14 * 0 = 0\n\n5. **Flatworm**: \n   - Number of legs: 0 (Flatworms do not have legs)\n   - Number of flatworms: 8\n   - Total legs from flatworms: 8 * 0 = 0\n\n6. **Grasshopper**: \n   - Number of legs: 6\n   - Number of grasshoppers: 8\n   - Total legs from grasshoppers: 8 * 6 = 48\n\n7. **Spider**: \n   - Number of legs: 8\n   - Number of spiders: 4\n   - Total legs from spiders: 4 * 8 = 32\n\n8. **Human**: \n   - Number of legs: 2\n   - Number of humans: 2\n   - Total legs from humans: 2 * 2 = 4\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal to get the total number of legs:\n\n- Total legs = 30 (praying mantises) + 30 (bees) + 52 (horses) + 0 (starfish) + 0 (flatworms) + 48 (grasshoppers) + 32 (spiders) + 4 (humans)\n\n- Total legs = 196\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is:\n\n<<<196>>>"
