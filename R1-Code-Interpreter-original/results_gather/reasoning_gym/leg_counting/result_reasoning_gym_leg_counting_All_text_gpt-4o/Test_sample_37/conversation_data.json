    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for the given animals: birds, cats, and leeches. We'll do this by calculating the number of legs each type of animal has and then summing them up.\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs per animal:**\n   - Birds typically have 2 legs.\n   - Cats have 4 legs.\n   - Leeches are invertebrates and do not have legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For birds: \n     - Number of birds = 10\n     - Legs per bird = 2\n     - Total legs from birds = 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs\n\n   - For cats:\n     - Number of cats = 6\n     - Legs per cat = 4\n     - Total legs from cats = 6 cats * 4 legs/cat = 24 legs\n\n   - For leeches:\n     - Number of leeches = 6\n     - Legs per leech = 0 (since leeches do not have legs)\n     - Total legs from leeches = 6 leeches * 0 legs/leech = 0 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = Legs from birds + Legs from cats + Legs from leeches\n   - Total legs = 20 legs (birds) + 24 legs (cats) + 0 legs (leeches)\n   - Total legs = 44 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is 44.\n\nFinal answer: <<<44>>>."
