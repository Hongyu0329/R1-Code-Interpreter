    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all the legs to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Lobsters: Typically, lobsters have 10 legs.\n   - Butterflies: Butterflies have 6 legs.\n   - Praying mantises: Praying mantises have 6 legs.\n   - Flatworms: Flatworms are a type of worm and do not have legs.\n   - Scorpions: Scorpions have 8 legs.\n   - Lions: Lions have 4 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Lobsters: 10 lobsters * 10 legs each = 100 legs\n   - Butterflies: 4 butterflies * 6 legs each = 24 legs\n   - Praying mantises: 15 praying mantises * 6 legs each = 90 legs\n   - Flatworms: 5 flatworms * 0 legs each = 0 legs\n   - Scorpions: 8 scorpions * 8 legs each = 64 legs\n   - Lions: 12 lions * 4 legs each = 48 legs\n\n3. **Sum up all the legs to get the total:**\n   - Total legs = 100 (lobsters) + 24 (butterflies) + 90 (praying mantises) + 0 (flatworms) + 64 (scorpions) + 48 (lions)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 100 + 24 + 90 + 0 + 64 + 48 = 326\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 326.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<326>>>."
