    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs for the given quantities of each animal. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Snakes: 0 legs (snakes are legless reptiles).\n   - Humans: 2 legs (humans are bipedal).\n   - Ducks: 2 legs (ducks are birds and have two legs).\n   - Fireflies: 6 legs (fireflies are insects, and insects have six legs).\n   - Crabs: 10 legs (crabs are decapods, meaning they have ten legs).\n   - Giraffes: 4 legs (giraffes are quadrupeds, meaning they have four legs).\n   - Lobsters: 10 legs (lobsters are also decapods, meaning they have ten legs).\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Snakes: 7 snakes × 0 legs = 0 legs\n   - Humans: 15 humans × 2 legs = 30 legs\n   - Ducks: 10 ducks × 2 legs = 20 legs\n   - Fireflies: 7 fireflies × 6 legs = 42 legs\n   - Crabs: 14 crabs × 10 legs = 140 legs\n   - Giraffes: 15 giraffes × 4 legs = 60 legs\n   - Lobsters: 10 lobsters × 10 legs = 100 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all the animals:**\n   - Total legs = 0 (snakes) + 30 (humans) + 20 (ducks) + 42 (fireflies) + 140 (crabs) + 60 (giraffes) + 100 (lobsters)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 0 + 30 + 20 + 42 + 140 + 60 + 100 = 392\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 392.\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<392>>>"
