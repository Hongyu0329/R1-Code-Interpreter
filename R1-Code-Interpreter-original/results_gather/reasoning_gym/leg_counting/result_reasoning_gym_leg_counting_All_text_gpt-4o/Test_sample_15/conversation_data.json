    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all the legs to get the total.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Leech: Leeches are invertebrates and do not have legs. They move by contracting and expanding their bodies.\n   - Cricket: Crickets are insects and have 6 legs.\n   - Praying Mantis: Praying mantises are also insects and have 6 legs.\n   - Ant: Ants are insects and have 6 legs.\n   - Tiger: Tigers are mammals and have 4 legs.\n   - Bee: Bees are insects and have 6 legs.\n   - Horse: Horses are mammals and have 4 legs.\n   - Starfish: Starfish are echinoderms and do not have legs. They have arms, typically five, but these are not considered legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Leeches: 1 leech × 0 legs = 0 legs\n   - Crickets: 13 crickets × 6 legs = 78 legs\n   - Praying Mantises: 7 praying mantises × 6 legs = 42 legs\n   - Ants: 11 ants × 6 legs = 66 legs\n   - Tiger: 1 tiger × 4 legs = 4 legs\n   - Bees: 2 bees × 6 legs = 12 legs\n   - Horse: 1 horse × 4 legs = 4 legs\n   - Starfish: 5 starfish × 0 legs = 0 legs\n\n3. **Sum up all the legs:**\n   - Total legs = 0 (leeches) + 78 (crickets) + 42 (praying mantises) + 66 (ants) + 4 (tiger) + 12 (bees) + 4 (horse) + 0 (starfish)\n   - Total legs = 206\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 206.\n\nFinal answer: <<<206>>>"
