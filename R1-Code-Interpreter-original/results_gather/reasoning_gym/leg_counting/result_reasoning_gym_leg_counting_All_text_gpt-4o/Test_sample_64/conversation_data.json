    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each type of animal given in the list. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each type of animal step by step:\n\n1. **Insect**: Generally, insects have 6 legs. \n   - Number of insects: 1\n   - Total legs from insects: 1 insect * 6 legs = 6 legs\n\n2. **Wasps**: Wasps are also insects, so they have 6 legs each.\n   - Number of wasps: 3\n   - Total legs from wasps: 3 wasps * 6 legs = 18 legs\n\n3. **Lions**: Lions are mammals and have 4 legs each.\n   - Number of lions: 7\n   - Total legs from lions: 7 lions * 4 legs = 28 legs\n\n4. **Birds**: Birds typically have 2 legs.\n   - Number of birds: 11\n   - Total legs from birds: 11 birds * 2 legs = 22 legs\n\n5. **Ants**: Ants are insects, so they have 6 legs each.\n   - Number of ants: 6\n   - Total legs from ants: 6 ants * 6 legs = 36 legs\n\n6. **Jellyfish**: Jellyfish do not have legs.\n   - Number of jellyfish: 2\n   - Total legs from jellyfish: 2 jellyfish * 0 legs = 0 legs\n\n7. **Butterflies**: Butterflies are insects, so they have 6 legs each.\n   - Number of butterflies: 5\n   - Total legs from butterflies: 5 butterflies * 6 legs = 30 legs\n\n8. **Cockroaches**: Cockroaches are insects, so they have 6 legs each.\n   - Number of cockroaches: 6\n   - Total legs from cockroaches: 6 cockroaches * 6 legs = 36 legs\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal to get the total number of legs:\n\n- Total legs = 6 (insects) + 18 (wasps) + 28 (lions) + 22 (birds) + 36 (ants) + 0 (jellyfish) + 30 (butterflies) + 36 (cockroaches)\n\nCalculating the sum:\n\n- Total legs = 6 + 18 + 28 + 22 + 36 + 0 + 30 + 36 = 176\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 176.\n\nFinal answer: <<<176>>>"
