    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Insects: Typically, insects have 6 legs.\n   - Spiders: Spiders have 8 legs.\n   - Horses: Horses have 4 legs.\n   - Wasps: Wasps, being insects, have 6 legs.\n   - Grasshoppers: Grasshoppers, also being insects, have 6 legs.\n   - Cats: Cats have 4 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For insects: 11 insects × 6 legs/insect = 66 legs\n   - For spiders: 4 spiders × 8 legs/spider = 32 legs\n   - For horses: 12 horses × 4 legs/horse = 48 legs\n   - For wasps: 7 wasps × 6 legs/wasp = 42 legs\n   - For grasshoppers: 9 grasshoppers × 6 legs/grasshopper = 54 legs\n   - For cats: 4 cats × 4 legs/cat = 16 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all the animals:**\n   - Total legs = 66 (insects) + 32 (spiders) + 48 (horses) + 42 (wasps) + 54 (grasshoppers) + 16 (cats)\n\n4. **Perform the addition:**\n   - Total legs = 66 + 32 + 48 + 42 + 54 + 16\n   - Total legs = 258\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals is 258.\n\nFinal answer: <<<258>>>."
