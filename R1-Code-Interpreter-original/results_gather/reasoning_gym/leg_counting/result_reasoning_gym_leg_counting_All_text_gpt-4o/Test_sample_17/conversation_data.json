    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - **Butterfly:** Typically, a butterfly has 6 legs.\n   - **Grasshopper:** A grasshopper also has 6 legs.\n   - **Human:** A human has 2 legs.\n   - **Insect:** The term \"insect\" is a general category, but typically, insects have 6 legs. Since no specific insect is mentioned, we'll assume the standard 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each group of animals:**\n   - **Butterflies:** There are 13 butterflies, and each has 6 legs.\n     \\[\n     13 \\times 6 = 78 \\text{ legs}\n     \\]\n   - **Grasshoppers:** There are 9 grasshoppers, and each has 6 legs.\n     \\[\n     9 \\times 6 = 54 \\text{ legs}\n     \\]\n   - **Humans:** There are 9 humans, and each has 2 legs.\n     \\[\n     9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ legs}\n     \\]\n   - **Insects:** There are 13 insects, and each has 6 legs.\n     \\[\n     13 \\times 6 = 78 \\text{ legs}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all groups:**\n   \\[\n   78 \\text{ (butterflies)} + 54 \\text{ (grasshoppers)} + 18 \\text{ (humans)} + 78 \\text{ (insects)} = 228 \\text{ legs}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 228.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<228>>>."
