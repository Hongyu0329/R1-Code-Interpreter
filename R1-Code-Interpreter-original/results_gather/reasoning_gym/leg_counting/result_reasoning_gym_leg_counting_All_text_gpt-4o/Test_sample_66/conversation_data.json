    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs for all the animals listed. Let's analyze each type of animal step by step:\n\n1. **Woodlouse**: A woodlouse typically has 14 legs. \n   - Number of woodlice: 14\n   - Total legs from woodlice: 14 woodlice * 14 legs/woodlouse = 196 legs\n\n2. **Jellyfish**: Jellyfish do not have legs. \n   - Number of jellyfish: 11\n   - Total legs from jellyfish: 11 jellyfish * 0 legs/jellyfish = 0 legs\n\n3. **Butterfly**: A butterfly has 6 legs.\n   - Number of butterflies: 9\n   - Total legs from butterflies: 9 butterflies * 6 legs/butterfly = 54 legs\n\n4. **Grasshopper**: A grasshopper has 6 legs.\n   - Number of grasshoppers: 2\n   - Total legs from grasshoppers: 2 grasshoppers * 6 legs/grasshopper = 12 legs\n\n5. **Flatworm**: Flatworms do not have legs.\n   - Number of flatworms: 13\n   - Total legs from flatworms: 13 flatworms * 0 legs/flatworm = 0 legs\n\n6. **Firefly**: A firefly has 6 legs.\n   - Number of fireflies: 8\n   - Total legs from fireflies: 8 fireflies * 6 legs/firefly = 48 legs\n\n7. **Dog**: A dog has 4 legs.\n   - Number of dogs: 15\n   - Total legs from dogs: 15 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 60 legs\n\n8. **Beetle**: A beetle has 6 legs.\n   - Number of beetles: 4\n   - Total legs from beetles: 4 beetles * 6 legs/beetle = 24 legs\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal to get the total number of legs:\n\n- Total legs = 196 (woodlice) + 0 (jellyfish) + 54 (butterflies) + 12 (grasshoppers) + 0 (flatworms) + 48 (fireflies) + 60 (dogs) + 24 (beetles)\n\n- Total legs = 394\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is:\n\n<<<394>>>"
