    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs for the given quantities of each animal. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Lions: Lions are mammals and have 4 legs.\n   - Horses: Horses are also mammals and have 4 legs.\n   - Jellyfish: Jellyfish do not have legs; they are invertebrates with tentacles.\n   - Shrimps: Shrimps are crustaceans and typically have 10 legs.\n   - Cockroaches: Cockroaches are insects and have 6 legs.\n   - Wasps: Wasps are insects and have 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For lions: 6 lions × 4 legs/lion = 24 legs\n   - For horses: 5 horses × 4 legs/horse = 20 legs\n   - For jellyfish: 13 jellyfish × 0 legs/jellyfish = 0 legs\n   - For shrimps: 15 shrimps × 10 legs/shrimp = 150 legs\n   - For cockroaches: 5 cockroaches × 6 legs/cockroach = 30 legs\n   - For wasps: 8 wasps × 6 legs/wasp = 48 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all the animals:**\n   - Total legs = 24 (lions) + 20 (horses) + 0 (jellyfish) + 150 (shrimps) + 30 (cockroaches) + 48 (wasps)\n   - Total legs = 272\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is 272.\n\nFinal answer: <<<272>>>"
