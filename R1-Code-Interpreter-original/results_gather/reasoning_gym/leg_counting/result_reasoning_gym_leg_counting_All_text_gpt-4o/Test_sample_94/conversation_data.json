    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Woodlouse: A woodlouse typically has 14 legs.\n   - Praying mantis: A praying mantis has 6 legs.\n   - Giraffe: A giraffe has 4 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each group of animals:**\n   - For woodlouses: \n     - Number of woodlouses = 11\n     - Legs per woodlouse = 14\n     - Total legs for woodlouses = 11 * 14 = 154\n\n   - For praying mantises:\n     - Number of praying mantises = 3\n     - Legs per praying mantis = 6\n     - Total legs for praying mantises = 3 * 6 = 18\n\n   - For giraffes:\n     - Number of giraffes = 8\n     - Legs per giraffe = 4\n     - Total legs for giraffes = 8 * 4 = 32\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all groups:**\n   - Total legs = Total legs for woodlouses + Total legs for praying mantises + Total legs for giraffes\n   - Total legs = 154 + 18 + 32 = 204\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is 204.\n\nFinal answer: <<<204>>>."
