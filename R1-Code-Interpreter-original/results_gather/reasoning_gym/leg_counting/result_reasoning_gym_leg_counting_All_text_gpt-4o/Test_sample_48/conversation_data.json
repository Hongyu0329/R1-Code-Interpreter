    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Wasp: Wasps are insects, and insects typically have 6 legs.\n   - Lobster: Lobsters are crustaceans and typically have 10 legs.\n   - Grasshopper: Grasshoppers are insects, and insects typically have 6 legs.\n   - Beetle: Beetles are insects, and insects typically have 6 legs.\n   - Crab: Crabs are crustaceans and typically have 10 legs.\n   - Woodlouse: Woodlice are crustaceans and typically have 14 legs.\n   - Cow: Cows are mammals and typically have 4 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For 1 wasp: \\(1 \\times 6 = 6\\) legs\n   - For 9 lobsters: \\(9 \\times 10 = 90\\) legs\n   - For 13 grasshoppers: \\(13 \\times 6 = 78\\) legs\n   - For 14 beetles: \\(14 \\times 6 = 84\\) legs\n   - For 7 crabs: \\(7 \\times 10 = 70\\) legs\n   - For 15 woodlouses: \\(15 \\times 14 = 210\\) legs\n   - For 4 cows: \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) legs\n\n3. **Sum up all the legs to get the total:**\n   - Total legs = \\(6 + 90 + 78 + 84 + 70 + 210 + 16\\)\n\n4. **Perform the addition:**\n   - \\(6 + 90 = 96\\)\n   - \\(96 + 78 = 174\\)\n   - \\(174 + 84 = 258\\)\n   - \\(258 + 70 = 328\\)\n   - \\(328 + 210 = 538\\)\n   - \\(538 + 16 = 554\\)\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 554.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<554>>>."
