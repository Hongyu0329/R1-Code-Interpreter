    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Spiders typically have 8 legs.\n   - Sea slugs generally have 0 legs as they are mollusks and do not have legs.\n   - Ducks have 2 legs.\n   - Snakes have 0 legs as they are legless reptiles.\n   - Chickens have 2 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For spiders: 11 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 88 legs\n   - For sea slugs: 5 sea slugs * 0 legs/sea slug = 0 legs\n   - For ducks: 13 ducks * 2 legs/duck = 26 legs\n   - For snakes: 4 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs\n   - For chickens: 1 chicken * 2 legs/chicken = 2 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = 88 (spiders) + 0 (sea slugs) + 26 (ducks) + 0 (snakes) + 2 (chicken) = 116 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 116.\n\nFinal answer: <<<116>>>."
