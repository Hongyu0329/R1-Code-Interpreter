    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Ducks: 2 legs\n   - Ants: 6 legs\n   - Dogs: 4 legs\n   - Sheep: 4 legs\n   - Crickets: 6 legs\n   - Tigers: 4 legs\n   - Crabs: 10 legs\n   - Sea slugs: 0 legs (sea slugs do not have legs)\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Ducks: 12 ducks * 2 legs/duck = 24 legs\n   - Ants: 9 ants * 6 legs/ant = 54 legs\n   - Dogs: 13 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 52 legs\n   - Sheep: 14 sheep * 4 legs/sheep = 56 legs\n   - Crickets: 15 crickets * 6 legs/cricket = 90 legs\n   - Tigers: 13 tigers * 4 legs/tiger = 52 legs\n   - Crabs: 5 crabs * 10 legs/crab = 50 legs\n   - Sea slugs: 11 sea slugs * 0 legs/sea slug = 0 legs\n\n3. **Sum up the total number of legs:**\n   - Total legs = 24 (ducks) + 54 (ants) + 52 (dogs) + 56 (sheep) + 90 (crickets) + 52 (tigers) + 50 (crabs) + 0 (sea slugs)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 24 + 54 + 52 + 56 + 90 + 52 + 50 + 0 = 378\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 378.\n\n<<<378>>>"
