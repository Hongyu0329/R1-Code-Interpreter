    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs based on the given quantities of each animal. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Praying mantis: Typically has 6 legs.\n   - Scorpion: Typically has 8 legs.\n   - Firefly: Typically has 6 legs.\n   - Crab: Typically has 10 legs.\n   - Beetle: Typically has 6 legs.\n   - Woodlouse: Typically has 14 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Praying mantises: 12 praying mantises × 6 legs each = 72 legs\n   - Scorpion: 1 scorpion × 8 legs = 8 legs\n   - Fireflies: 14 fireflies × 6 legs each = 84 legs\n   - Crabs: 15 crabs × 10 legs each = 150 legs\n   - Beetle: 1 beetle × 6 legs = 6 legs\n   - Woodlice: 15 woodlice × 14 legs each = 210 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = 72 (praying mantises) + 8 (scorpion) + 84 (fireflies) + 150 (crabs) + 6 (beetle) + 210 (woodlice)\n\n4. **Perform the addition:**\n   - Total legs = 72 + 8 + 84 + 150 + 6 + 210 = 530\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 530.\n\nFinal answer: <<<530>>>."
