    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all the legs to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Humans: 2 legs\n   - Scorpions: 8 legs\n   - Fireflies: 6 legs\n   - Cows: 4 legs\n   - Praying mantises: 6 legs\n   - Starfish: 5 legs (Note: Starfish are not typically counted in leg-based problems as they have arms, but for the sake of this problem, we'll consider them as having 5 \"legs.\")\n   - Sheep: 4 legs\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Humans: 2 humans * 2 legs/human = 4 legs\n   - Scorpions: 8 scorpions * 8 legs/scorpion = 64 legs\n   - Fireflies: 7 fireflies * 6 legs/firefly = 42 legs\n   - Cows: 9 cows * 4 legs/cow = 36 legs\n   - Praying mantises: 9 praying mantises * 6 legs/praying mantis = 54 legs\n   - Starfish: 4 starfish * 5 legs/starfish = 20 legs\n   - Sheep: 8 sheep * 4 legs/sheep = 32 legs\n\n3. **Sum up all the legs:**\n   - Total legs = 4 (humans) + 64 (scorpions) + 42 (fireflies) + 36 (cows) + 54 (praying mantises) + 20 (starfish) + 32 (sheep)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 4 + 64 + 42 + 36 + 54 + 20 + 32 = 252\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 252.\n\nFinal answer: <<<252>>>."
