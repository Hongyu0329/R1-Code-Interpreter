    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each type of animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each type of animal:\n\n1. **Crickets**: Crickets are insects, and insects typically have 6 legs.\n   - Number of crickets = 3\n   - Total legs from crickets = 3 crickets * 6 legs/cricket = 18 legs\n\n2. **Birds**: Birds generally have 2 legs.\n   - Number of birds = 10\n   - Total legs from birds = 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs\n\n3. **Leeches**: Leeches are annelids and do not have legs.\n   - Number of leeches = 6\n   - Total legs from leeches = 6 leeches * 0 legs/leech = 0 legs\n\n4. **Beetles**: Beetles are also insects, so they have 6 legs.\n   - Number of beetles = 6\n   - Total legs from beetles = 6 beetles * 6 legs/beetle = 36 legs\n\n5. **Praying Mantises**: Praying mantises are insects, and they have 6 legs.\n   - Number of praying mantises = 5\n   - Total legs from praying mantises = 5 mantises * 6 legs/mantis = 30 legs\n\n6. **Crabs**: Crabs are crustaceans and typically have 10 legs.\n   - Number of crabs = 12\n   - Total legs from crabs = 12 crabs * 10 legs/crab = 120 legs\n\n7. **Sea Slugs**: Sea slugs are mollusks and do not have legs.\n   - Number of sea slugs = 6\n   - Total legs from sea slugs = 6 sea slugs * 0 legs/slug = 0 legs\n\n8. **Starfish**: Starfish are echinoderms and do not have legs.\n   - Number of starfish = 10\n   - Total legs from starfish = 10 starfish * 0 legs/starfish = 0 legs\n\n9. **Ants**: Ants are insects, so they have 6 legs.\n   - Number of ants = 12\n   - Total legs from ants = 12 ants * 6 legs/ant = 72 legs\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal to get the total number of legs:\n\n- Total legs = 18 (crickets) + 20 (birds) + 0 (leeches) + 36 (beetles) + 30 (praying mantises) + 120 (crabs) + 0 (sea slugs) + 0 (starfish) + 72 (ants)\n\n- Total legs = 296\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 296.\n\n<<<296>>>"
