    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Sheep: Typically, a sheep has 4 legs.\n   - Dog: A dog also has 4 legs.\n   - Tiger: A tiger has 4 legs.\n   - Elephant: An elephant has 4 legs.\n   - Firefly: A firefly, being an insect, has 6 legs.\n   - Praying mantis: A praying mantis, also an insect, has 6 legs.\n   - Cockroach: A cockroach, another insect, has 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For sheep: 6 sheep × 4 legs/sheep = 24 legs\n   - For dogs: 15 dogs × 4 legs/dog = 60 legs\n   - For the tiger: 1 tiger × 4 legs/tiger = 4 legs\n   - For elephants: 13 elephants × 4 legs/elephant = 52 legs\n   - For fireflies: 15 fireflies × 6 legs/firefly = 90 legs\n   - For praying mantises: 14 praying mantises × 6 legs/praying mantis = 84 legs\n   - For cockroaches: 2 cockroaches × 6 legs/cockroach = 12 legs\n\n3. **Sum up all the legs:**\n   - Total legs = 24 (sheep) + 60 (dogs) + 4 (tiger) + 52 (elephants) + 90 (fireflies) + 84 (praying mantises) + 12 (cockroaches)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 24 + 60 + 4 + 52 + 90 + 84 + 12 = 326\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 326.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<326>>>."
