    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Crabs: Typically, crabs have 10 legs.\n   - Jellyfish: Jellyfish do not have legs.\n   - Giraffe: Giraffes have 4 legs.\n   - Sheep: Sheep have 4 legs.\n   - Lions: Lions have 4 legs.\n   - Ducks: Ducks have 2 legs.\n   - Bees: Bees have 6 legs.\n   - Cow: Cows have 4 legs.\n   - Spiders: Spiders have 8 legs.\n   - Beetles: Beetles have 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Crabs: 8 crabs * 10 legs = 80 legs\n   - Jellyfish: 14 jellyfish * 0 legs = 0 legs\n   - Giraffe: 1 giraffe * 4 legs = 4 legs\n   - Sheep: 9 sheep * 4 legs = 36 legs\n   - Lions: 15 lions * 4 legs = 60 legs\n   - Ducks: 12 ducks * 2 legs = 24 legs\n   - Bees: 3 bees * 6 legs = 18 legs\n   - Cow: 1 cow * 4 legs = 4 legs\n   - Spiders: 11 spiders * 8 legs = 88 legs\n   - Beetles: 4 beetles * 6 legs = 24 legs\n\n3. **Sum up all the legs:**\n   - Total legs = 80 (crabs) + 0 (jellyfish) + 4 (giraffe) + 36 (sheep) + 60 (lions) + 24 (ducks) + 18 (bees) + 4 (cow) + 88 (spiders) + 24 (beetles)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 80 + 0 + 4 + 36 + 60 + 24 + 18 + 4 + 88 + 24 = 338\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 338.\n\nFinal answer: <<<338>>>"
