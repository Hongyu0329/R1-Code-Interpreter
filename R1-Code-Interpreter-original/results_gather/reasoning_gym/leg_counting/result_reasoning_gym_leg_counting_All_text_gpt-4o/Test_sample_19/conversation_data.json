    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Scorpions: Typically, a scorpion has 8 legs.\n   - Shrimps: A shrimp has 10 legs.\n   - Cats: A cat has 4 legs.\n   - Giraffes: A giraffe has 4 legs.\n   - Elephants: An elephant has 4 legs.\n   - Tigers: A tiger has 4 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For scorpions: 15 scorpions * 8 legs/scorpion = 120 legs\n   - For shrimps: 14 shrimps * 10 legs/shrimp = 140 legs\n   - For cats: 7 cats * 4 legs/cat = 28 legs\n   - For giraffes: 9 giraffes * 4 legs/giraffe = 36 legs\n   - For elephants: 8 elephants * 4 legs/elephant = 32 legs\n   - For tigers: 12 tigers * 4 legs/tiger = 48 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = 120 (scorpions) + 140 (shrimps) + 28 (cats) + 36 (giraffes) + 32 (elephants) + 48 (tigers)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 120 + 140 + 28 + 36 + 32 + 48 = 404\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 404.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<404>>>."
