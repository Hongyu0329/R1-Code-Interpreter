    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs for the given quantities of each animal. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - **Starfish:** Starfish typically have 5 arms, but they do not have legs in the traditional sense. For the purpose of this problem, we will consider them as having 0 legs.\n   - **Leech:** Leeches are invertebrates and do not have legs. Therefore, they have 0 legs.\n   - **Beetle:** Beetles are insects, and insects have 6 legs.\n   - **Elephant:** Elephants are mammals and have 4 legs.\n   - **Praying Mantis:** Praying mantises are insects, and insects have 6 legs.\n   - **Cat:** Cats are mammals and have 4 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - **Starfish:** 2 starfish × 0 legs/starfish = 0 legs\n   - **Leech:** 5 leeches × 0 legs/leech = 0 legs\n   - **Beetle:** 8 beetles × 6 legs/beetle = 48 legs\n   - **Elephant:** 12 elephants × 4 legs/elephant = 48 legs\n   - **Praying Mantis:** 4 praying mantises × 6 legs/praying mantis = 24 legs\n   - **Cat:** 9 cats × 4 legs/cat = 36 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs:**\n   - Total legs = 0 (starfish) + 0 (leech) + 48 (beetle) + 48 (elephant) + 24 (praying mantis) + 36 (cat)\n   - Total legs = 156\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is 156.\n\nFinal answer: <<<156>>>."
