    "To solve the problem of counting the total number of legs for the given animals, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Lions: Typically, a lion has 4 legs.\n   - Wasps: Wasps are insects, and insects generally have 6 legs.\n   - Cows: A cow, like most quadrupeds, has 4 legs.\n   - Crabs: Crabs are crustaceans and usually have 10 legs.\n\n2. **Determine the number of each type of animal:**\n   - There are 3 lions.\n   - There are 6 wasps.\n   - There are 5 cows.\n   - There are 3 crabs.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For lions: 3 lions × 4 legs/lion = 12 legs\n   - For wasps: 6 wasps × 6 legs/wasp = 36 legs\n   - For cows: 5 cows × 4 legs/cow = 20 legs\n   - For crabs: 3 crabs × 10 legs/crab = 30 legs\n\n4. **Sum the total number of legs from all the animals:**\n   - Total legs = 12 (lions) + 36 (wasps) + 20 (cows) + 30 (crabs) = 98 legs\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the total number of legs for the given list of animals.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<98>>>."
