    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs per animal:**\n   - Sheep: Typically, a sheep has 4 legs.\n   - Dog: A dog also has 4 legs.\n   - Praying Mantis: A praying mantis has 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For sheep: \n     - Number of sheep = 6\n     - Legs per sheep = 4\n     - Total legs for sheep = 6 sheep * 4 legs/sheep = 24 legs\n\n   - For dogs:\n     - Number of dogs = 11\n     - Legs per dog = 4\n     - Total legs for dogs = 11 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 44 legs\n\n   - For praying mantises:\n     - Number of praying mantises = 12\n     - Legs per praying mantis = 6\n     - Total legs for praying mantises = 12 mantises * 6 legs/mantis = 72 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = Total legs for sheep + Total legs for dogs + Total legs for praying mantises\n   - Total legs = 24 legs (sheep) + 44 legs (dogs) + 72 legs (praying mantises)\n   - Total legs = 140 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 140.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<140>>>."
