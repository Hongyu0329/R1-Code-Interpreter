    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all the legs to get the total.\n\n1. **Humans**: Each human has 2 legs.\n   - Number of humans = 13\n   - Total legs from humans = 13 * 2 = 26\n\n2. **Wasps**: Wasps are insects, and typically have 6 legs.\n   - Number of wasps = 13\n   - Total legs from wasps = 13 * 6 = 78\n\n3. **Lobsters**: Lobsters have 10 legs.\n   - Number of lobsters = 4\n   - Total legs from lobsters = 4 * 10 = 40\n\n4. **Sea Slugs**: Sea slugs do not have legs.\n   - Number of sea slugs = 12\n   - Total legs from sea slugs = 12 * 0 = 0\n\n5. **Lions**: Each lion has 4 legs.\n   - Number of lions = 14\n   - Total legs from lions = 14 * 4 = 56\n\n6. **Deers**: Each deer has 4 legs.\n   - Number of deers = 13\n   - Total legs from deers = 13 * 4 = 52\n\n7. **Butterflies**: Butterflies are insects, and typically have 6 legs.\n   - Number of butterflies = 11\n   - Total legs from butterflies = 11 * 6 = 66\n\n8. **Praying Mantises**: Praying mantises are insects, and typically have 6 legs.\n   - Number of praying mantises = 3\n   - Total legs from praying mantises = 3 * 6 = 18\n\n9. **Shrimps**: Shrimps typically have 10 legs.\n   - Number of shrimps = 2\n   - Total legs from shrimps = 2 * 10 = 20\n\n10. **Insects**: The term \"insects\" generally refers to creatures with 6 legs.\n    - Number of insects = 14\n    - Total legs from insects = 14 * 6 = 84\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each category:\n\n- Total legs = 26 (humans) + 78 (wasps) + 40 (lobsters) + 0 (sea slugs) + 56 (lions) + 52 (deers) + 66 (butterflies) + 18 (praying mantises) + 20 (shrimps) + 84 (insects)\n\n- Total legs = 440\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is:\n\n<<<440>>>"
