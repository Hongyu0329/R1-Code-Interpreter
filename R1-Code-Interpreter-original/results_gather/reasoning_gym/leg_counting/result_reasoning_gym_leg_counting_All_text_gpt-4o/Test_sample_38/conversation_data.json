    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Sheep: Typically, a sheep has 4 legs.\n   - Praying mantis: A praying mantis has 6 legs.\n   - Cockroach: A cockroach also has 6 legs.\n   - Duck: A duck has 2 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For sheep: \n     - Number of sheep = 6\n     - Legs per sheep = 4\n     - Total legs for sheep = 6 * 4 = 24\n\n   - For praying mantises:\n     - Number of praying mantises = 2\n     - Legs per praying mantis = 6\n     - Total legs for praying mantises = 2 * 6 = 12\n\n   - For cockroaches:\n     - Number of cockroaches = 3\n     - Legs per cockroach = 6\n     - Total legs for cockroaches = 3 * 6 = 18\n\n   - For ducks:\n     - Number of ducks = 14\n     - Legs per duck = 2\n     - Total legs for ducks = 14 * 2 = 28\n\n3. **Sum up the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = Total legs for sheep + Total legs for praying mantises + Total legs for cockroaches + Total legs for ducks\n   - Total legs = 24 (sheep) + 12 (praying mantises) + 18 (cockroaches) + 28 (ducks)\n   - Total legs = 82\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 82.\n\nFinal answer: <<<82>>>."
