    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Deers: Typically, a deer has 4 legs.\n   - Chickens: A chicken has 2 legs.\n   - Grasshoppers: A grasshopper has 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For deers: \n     - Number of deers = 5\n     - Legs per deer = 4\n     - Total legs from deers = 5 deers * 4 legs/deer = 20 legs\n\n   - For chickens:\n     - Number of chickens = 2\n     - Legs per chicken = 2\n     - Total legs from chickens = 2 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 4 legs\n\n   - For grasshoppers:\n     - Number of grasshoppers = 14\n     - Legs per grasshopper = 6\n     - Total legs from grasshoppers = 14 grasshoppers * 6 legs/grasshopper = 84 legs\n\n3. **Sum up the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = Legs from deers + Legs from chickens + Legs from grasshoppers\n   - Total legs = 20 legs (deers) + 4 legs (chickens) + 84 legs (grasshoppers) = 108 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 108.\n\nFinal answer: <<<108>>>."
