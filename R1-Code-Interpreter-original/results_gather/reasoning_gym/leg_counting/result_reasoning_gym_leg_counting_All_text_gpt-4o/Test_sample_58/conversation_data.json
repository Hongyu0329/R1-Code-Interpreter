    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all the legs to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Chickens: Chickens have 2 legs.\n   - Fireflies: Fireflies have 6 legs.\n   - Starfish: Starfish typically have 0 legs as they have arms instead.\n   - Butterflies: Butterflies have 6 legs.\n   - Cockroaches: Cockroaches have 6 legs.\n   - Lobsters: Lobsters have 10 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For chickens: 5 chickens * 2 legs = 10 legs\n   - For fireflies: 8 fireflies * 6 legs = 48 legs\n   - For starfish: 5 starfish * 0 legs = 0 legs\n   - For butterflies: 6 butterflies * 6 legs = 36 legs\n   - For cockroaches: 2 cockroaches * 6 legs = 12 legs\n   - For lobsters: 9 lobsters * 10 legs = 90 legs\n\n3. **Sum up all the legs:**\n   - Total legs = 10 (chickens) + 48 (fireflies) + 0 (starfish) + 36 (butterflies) + 12 (cockroaches) + 90 (lobsters)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 10 + 48 + 0 + 36 + 12 + 90 = 196\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 196.\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<196>>>"
