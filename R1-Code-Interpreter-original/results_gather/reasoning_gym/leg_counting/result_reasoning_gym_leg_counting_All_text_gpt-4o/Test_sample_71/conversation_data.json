    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each type of animal step by step:\n\n1. **Lions**: \n   - Number of legs per lion: 4\n   - Number of lions: 2\n   - Total legs from lions: 2 lions * 4 legs/lion = 8 legs\n\n2. **Leeches**: \n   - Leeches do not have legs.\n   - Number of leeches: 3\n   - Total legs from leeches: 3 leeches * 0 legs/leech = 0 legs\n\n3. **Humans**: \n   - Number of legs per human: 2\n   - Number of humans: 4\n   - Total legs from humans: 4 humans * 2 legs/human = 8 legs\n\n4. **Bees**: \n   - Number of legs per bee: 6\n   - Number of bees: 10\n   - Total legs from bees: 10 bees * 6 legs/bee = 60 legs\n\n5. **Praying Mantises**: \n   - Number of legs per praying mantis: 6\n   - Number of praying mantises: 14\n   - Total legs from praying mantises: 14 mantises * 6 legs/mantis = 84 legs\n\n6. **Ants**: \n   - Number of legs per ant: 6\n   - Number of ants: 1\n   - Total legs from ants: 1 ant * 6 legs/ant = 6 legs\n\n7. **Crickets**: \n   - Number of legs per cricket: 6\n   - Number of crickets: 1\n   - Total legs from crickets: 1 cricket * 6 legs/cricket = 6 legs\n\n8. **Spiders**: \n   - Number of legs per spider: 8\n   - Number of spiders: 4\n   - Total legs from spiders: 4 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 32 legs\n\n9. **Flatworms**: \n   - Flatworms do not have legs.\n   - Number of flatworms: 2\n   - Total legs from flatworms: 2 flatworms * 0 legs/flatworm = 0 legs\n\n10. **Giraffes**: \n    - Number of legs per giraffe: 4\n    - Number of giraffes: 12\n    - Total legs from giraffes: 12 giraffes * 4 legs/giraffe = 48 legs\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal:\n\n- Total legs = 8 (lions) + 0 (leeches) + 8 (humans) + 60 (bees) + 84 (praying mantises) + 6 (ants) + 6 (crickets) + 32 (spiders) + 0 (flatworms) + 48 (giraffes)\n\n- Total legs = 252\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is:\n\n<<<252>>>"
