    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Tigers: Tigers are quadrupeds, meaning they have 4 legs.\n   - Ducks: Ducks are birds and typically have 2 legs.\n   - Butterflies: Butterflies are insects and have 6 legs.\n   - Leeches: Leeches are annelids (segmented worms) and do not have legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For tigers: \n     - Number of tigers = 3\n     - Legs per tiger = 4\n     - Total legs for tigers = 3 tigers * 4 legs/tiger = 12 legs\n\n   - For ducks:\n     - Number of ducks = 14\n     - Legs per duck = 2\n     - Total legs for ducks = 14 ducks * 2 legs/duck = 28 legs\n\n   - For butterflies:\n     - Number of butterflies = 7\n     - Legs per butterfly = 6\n     - Total legs for butterflies = 7 butterflies * 6 legs/butterfly = 42 legs\n\n   - For leeches:\n     - Number of leeches = 6\n     - Legs per leech = 0\n     - Total legs for leeches = 6 leeches * 0 legs/leech = 0 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = Total legs for tigers + Total legs for ducks + Total legs for butterflies + Total legs for leeches\n   - Total legs = 12 legs (tigers) + 28 legs (ducks) + 42 legs (butterflies) + 0 legs (leeches)\n   - Total legs = 82 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 82.\n\n<<<82>>>"
