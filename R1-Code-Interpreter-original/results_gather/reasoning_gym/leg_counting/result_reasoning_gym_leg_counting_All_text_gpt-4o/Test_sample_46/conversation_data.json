    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze each type of animal step by step:\n\n1. **Birds**: \n   - Birds typically have 2 legs.\n   - Given: 15 birds.\n   - Total legs from birds = 15 birds * 2 legs/bird = 30 legs.\n\n2. **Starfish**:\n   - Starfish are marine animals that do not have legs in the traditional sense. They have arms, but for the purpose of this problem, we consider them to have 0 legs.\n   - Given: 11 starfish.\n   - Total legs from starfish = 11 starfish * 0 legs/starfish = 0 legs.\n\n3. **Tigers**:\n   - Tigers are quadrupeds, meaning they have 4 legs.\n   - Given: 7 tigers.\n   - Total legs from tigers = 7 tigers * 4 legs/tiger = 28 legs.\n\n4. **Crickets**:\n   - Crickets are insects and have 6 legs.\n   - Given: 13 crickets.\n   - Total legs from crickets = 13 crickets * 6 legs/cricket = 78 legs.\n\n5. **Jellyfish**:\n   - Jellyfish do not have legs. They have tentacles, but for the purpose of this problem, we consider them to have 0 legs.\n   - Given: 11 jellyfish.\n   - Total legs from jellyfish = 11 jellyfish * 0 legs/jellyfish = 0 legs.\n\n6. **Dogs**:\n   - Dogs are quadrupeds, meaning they have 4 legs.\n   - Given: 4 dogs.\n   - Total legs from dogs = 4 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 16 legs.\n\nNow, we sum up the total number of legs from all the animals:\n\n- Total legs = Legs from birds + Legs from starfish + Legs from tigers + Legs from crickets + Legs from jellyfish + Legs from dogs\n- Total legs = 30 + 0 + 28 + 78 + 0 + 16 = 152\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 152.\n\nFinal answer: <<<152>>>."
