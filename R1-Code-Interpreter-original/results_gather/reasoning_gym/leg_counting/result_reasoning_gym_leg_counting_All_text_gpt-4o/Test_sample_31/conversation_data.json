    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Cockroach: 6 legs\n   - Sheep: 4 legs\n   - Tiger: 4 legs\n   - Firefly: 6 legs\n   - Chicken: 2 legs\n   - Bee: 6 legs\n   - Beetle: 6 legs\n   - Jellyfish: 0 legs (jellyfish do not have legs)\n   - Praying mantis: 6 legs\n   - Ant: 6 legs\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Cockroaches: 4 cockroaches * 6 legs = 24 legs\n   - Sheeps: 5 sheeps * 4 legs = 20 legs\n   - Tigers: 2 tigers * 4 legs = 8 legs\n   - Fireflies: 14 fireflies * 6 legs = 84 legs\n   - Chickens: 11 chickens * 2 legs = 22 legs\n   - Bees: 5 bees * 6 legs = 30 legs\n   - Beetles: 14 beetles * 6 legs = 84 legs\n   - Jellyfish: 12 jellyfish * 0 legs = 0 legs\n   - Praying mantises: 10 praying mantises * 6 legs = 60 legs\n   - Ant: 1 ant * 6 legs = 6 legs\n\n3. **Sum up all the legs:**\n   - Total legs = 24 (cockroaches) + 20 (sheeps) + 8 (tigers) + 84 (fireflies) + 22 (chickens) + 30 (bees) + 84 (beetles) + 0 (jellyfish) + 60 (praying mantises) + 6 (ant)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 24 + 20 + 8 + 84 + 22 + 30 + 84 + 0 + 60 + 6 = 338\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 338.\n\n<<<338>>>"
