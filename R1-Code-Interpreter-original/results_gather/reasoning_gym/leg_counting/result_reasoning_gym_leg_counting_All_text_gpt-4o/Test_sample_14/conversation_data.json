    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Wasps: Wasps are insects, and like most insects, they have 6 legs.\n   - Jellyfish: Jellyfish do not have legs. They have tentacles, but for the purpose of this problem, we consider them to have 0 legs.\n   - Elephants: Elephants are mammals and have 4 legs.\n   - Crabs: Crabs are crustaceans and typically have 10 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each group of animals:**\n   - For wasps: \n     - Number of wasps = 3\n     - Legs per wasp = 6\n     - Total legs for wasps = 3 wasps * 6 legs/wasp = 18 legs\n\n   - For jellyfish:\n     - Number of jellyfish = 10\n     - Legs per jellyfish = 0\n     - Total legs for jellyfish = 10 jellyfish * 0 legs/jellyfish = 0 legs\n\n   - For elephants:\n     - Number of elephants = 9\n     - Legs per elephant = 4\n     - Total legs for elephants = 9 elephants * 4 legs/elephant = 36 legs\n\n   - For crabs:\n     - Number of crabs = 13\n     - Legs per crab = 10\n     - Total legs for crabs = 13 crabs * 10 legs/crab = 130 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all groups:**\n   - Total legs = Legs from wasps + Legs from jellyfish + Legs from elephants + Legs from crabs\n   - Total legs = 18 (wasps) + 0 (jellyfish) + 36 (elephants) + 130 (crabs)\n   - Total legs = 184\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is 184.\n\nFinal answer: <<<184>>>"
