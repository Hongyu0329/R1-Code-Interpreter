    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all the legs to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Grasshopper: Typically has 6 legs.\n   - Spider: Typically has 8 legs.\n   - Tiger: Typically has 4 legs.\n   - Chicken: Typically has 2 legs.\n   - Starfish: Typically has 0 legs (they have arms, not legs).\n   - Ant: Typically has 6 legs.\n   - Snake: Typically has 0 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Grasshoppers: 2 grasshoppers * 6 legs each = 12 legs\n   - Spiders: 8 spiders * 8 legs each = 64 legs\n   - Tiger: 1 tiger * 4 legs = 4 legs\n   - Chickens: 2 chickens * 2 legs each = 4 legs\n   - Starfish: 5 starfish * 0 legs each = 0 legs\n   - Ants: 13 ants * 6 legs each = 78 legs\n   - Snakes: 2 snakes * 0 legs each = 0 legs\n\n3. **Sum up all the legs:**\n   - Total legs = 12 (grasshoppers) + 64 (spiders) + 4 (tiger) + 4 (chickens) + 0 (starfish) + 78 (ants) + 0 (snakes)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 12 + 64 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 78 + 0 = 162\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 162.\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<162>>>"
