    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Insects typically have 6 legs.\n   - Horses have 4 legs.\n   - Giraffes have 4 legs.\n   - Shrimps have 10 legs (as they are decapods).\n   - Humans have 2 legs.\n   - Sheep have 4 legs.\n   - Lobsters have 10 legs (as they are also decapods).\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For insects: 9 insects * 6 legs/insect = 54 legs\n   - For horses: 10 horses * 4 legs/horse = 40 legs\n   - For giraffes: 4 giraffes * 4 legs/giraffe = 16 legs\n   - For shrimps: 3 shrimps * 10 legs/shrimp = 30 legs\n   - For humans: 9 humans * 2 legs/human = 18 legs\n   - For sheep: 11 sheep * 4 legs/sheep = 44 legs\n   - For lobsters: 11 lobsters * 10 legs/lobster = 110 legs\n\n3. **Sum up all the legs:**\n   - Total legs = 54 (insects) + 40 (horses) + 16 (giraffes) + 30 (shrimps) + 18 (humans) + 44 (sheep) + 110 (lobsters)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 54 + 40 + 16 + 30 + 18 + 44 + 110 = 312\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 312.\n\n<<<312>>>"
