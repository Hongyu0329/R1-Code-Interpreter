    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each type of animal:\n\n1. **Crabs**: Typically, crabs have 10 legs. We have 10 crabs.\n   - Total legs from crabs = 10 crabs * 10 legs/crab = 100 legs\n\n2. **Shrimps**: Shrimps generally have 10 legs.\n   - Total legs from shrimps = 11 shrimps * 10 legs/shrimp = 110 legs\n\n3. **Deers**: Deers have 4 legs.\n   - Total legs from deers = 11 deers * 4 legs/deer = 44 legs\n\n4. **Birds**: Birds have 2 legs.\n   - Total legs from birds = 6 birds * 2 legs/bird = 12 legs\n\n5. **Firefly**: A firefly, being an insect, has 6 legs.\n   - Total legs from firefly = 1 firefly * 6 legs/firefly = 6 legs\n\n6. **Cat**: A cat has 4 legs.\n   - Total legs from cat = 1 cat * 4 legs/cat = 4 legs\n\n7. **Grasshoppers**: Grasshoppers, as insects, have 6 legs.\n   - Total legs from grasshoppers = 14 grasshoppers * 6 legs/grasshopper = 84 legs\n\n8. **Scorpion**: A scorpion has 8 legs.\n   - Total legs from scorpion = 1 scorpion * 8 legs/scorpion = 8 legs\n\n9. **Jellyfish**: Jellyfish do not have legs.\n   - Total legs from jellyfish = 11 jellyfish * 0 legs/jellyfish = 0 legs\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal:\n\n- Total legs = 100 (crabs) + 110 (shrimps) + 44 (deers) + 12 (birds) + 6 (firefly) + 4 (cat) + 84 (grasshoppers) + 8 (scorpion) + 0 (jellyfish)\n\nCalculating the sum:\n\n- Total legs = 100 + 110 + 44 + 12 + 6 + 4 + 84 + 8 + 0 = 368\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 368.\n\n<<<368>>>"
