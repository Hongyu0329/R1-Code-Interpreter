    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each type of animal:\n\n1. **Sea Slugs**: Sea slugs are mollusks and typically do not have legs. They move using a muscular foot. Therefore, each sea slug has 0 legs.\n\n2. **Shrimps**: Shrimps are crustaceans and typically have 10 legs. Therefore, each shrimp has 10 legs.\n\n3. **Crabs**: Crabs are also crustaceans and typically have 10 legs. Therefore, each crab has 10 legs.\n\n4. **Fireflies**: Fireflies are insects and typically have 6 legs. Therefore, each firefly has 6 legs.\n\n5. **Flatworms**: Flatworms are a type of worm and do not have legs. Therefore, each flatworm has 0 legs.\n\n6. **Tigers**: Tigers are mammals and have 4 legs. Therefore, each tiger has 4 legs.\n\n7. **Wasps**: Wasps are insects and typically have 6 legs. Therefore, each wasp has 6 legs.\n\n8. **Jellyfish**: Jellyfish are cnidarians and do not have legs. Therefore, each jellyfish has 0 legs.\n\n9. **Birds**: Birds are avians and typically have 2 legs. Therefore, each bird has 2 legs.\n\n10. **Lobsters**: Lobsters are crustaceans and typically have 10 legs. Therefore, each lobster has 10 legs.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:\n\n- Sea Slugs: 8 sea slugs × 0 legs = 0 legs\n- Shrimps: 6 shrimps × 10 legs = 60 legs\n- Crabs: 7 crabs × 10 legs = 70 legs\n- Fireflies: 8 fireflies × 6 legs = 48 legs\n- Flatworms: 12 flatworms × 0 legs = 0 legs\n- Tigers: 11 tigers × 4 legs = 44 legs\n- Wasps: 5 wasps × 6 legs = 30 legs\n- Jellyfish: 12 jellyfish × 0 legs = 0 legs\n- Birds: 4 birds × 2 legs = 8 legs\n- Lobsters: 12 lobsters × 10 legs = 120 legs\n\nFinally, we sum up all these values to get the total number of legs:\n\n0 + 60 + 70 + 48 + 0 + 44 + 30 + 0 + 8 + 120 = 380\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 380.\n\n<<<380>>>"
