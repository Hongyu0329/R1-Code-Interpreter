    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Horses have 4 legs.\n   - Dogs have 4 legs.\n   - Starfish have 0 legs (they have arms, not legs).\n   - Chickens have 2 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For horses: \n     - Number of horses = 12\n     - Legs per horse = 4\n     - Total legs from horses = 12 horses * 4 legs/horse = 48 legs\n\n   - For dogs:\n     - Number of dogs = 3\n     - Legs per dog = 4\n     - Total legs from dogs = 3 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 12 legs\n\n   - For starfish:\n     - Number of starfish = 5\n     - Legs per starfish = 0\n     - Total legs from starfish = 5 starfish * 0 legs/starfish = 0 legs\n\n   - For chickens:\n     - Number of chickens = 2\n     - Legs per chicken = 2\n     - Total legs from chickens = 2 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 4 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = Legs from horses + Legs from dogs + Legs from starfish + Legs from chickens\n   - Total legs = 48 legs (horses) + 12 legs (dogs) + 0 legs (starfish) + 4 legs (chickens)\n   - Total legs = 64 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 64.\n\n<<<64>>>"
