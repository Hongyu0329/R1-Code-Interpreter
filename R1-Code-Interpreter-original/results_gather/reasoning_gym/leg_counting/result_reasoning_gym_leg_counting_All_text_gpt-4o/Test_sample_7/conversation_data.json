    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs for the given quantities of each animal. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Tigers: Tigers are quadrupeds, meaning they have 4 legs.\n   - Bees: Bees are insects, and insects typically have 6 legs.\n   - Sea Slugs: Sea slugs are mollusks and do not have legs.\n   - Horses: Horses are also quadrupeds, so they have 4 legs.\n   - Elephants: Elephants are quadrupeds, having 4 legs.\n   - Wasps: Wasps are insects, and like bees, they have 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Tigers: 12 tigers × 4 legs each = 48 legs\n   - Bees: 10 bees × 6 legs each = 60 legs\n   - Sea Slugs: 1 sea slug × 0 legs = 0 legs\n   - Horses: 11 horses × 4 legs each = 44 legs\n   - Elephants: 13 elephants × 4 legs each = 52 legs\n   - Wasps: 5 wasps × 6 legs each = 30 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = 48 (tigers) + 60 (bees) + 0 (sea slugs) + 44 (horses) + 52 (elephants) + 30 (wasps)\n\n4. **Perform the final calculation:**\n   - Total legs = 48 + 60 + 0 + 44 + 52 + 30 = 234\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 234.\n\nFinal answer: <<<234>>>"
