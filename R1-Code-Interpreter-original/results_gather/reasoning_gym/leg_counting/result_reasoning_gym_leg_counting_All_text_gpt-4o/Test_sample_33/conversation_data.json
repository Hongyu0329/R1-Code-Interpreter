    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Sheep: 4 legs\n   - Woodlouse: 14 legs (woodlice are isopods, typically having 14 legs)\n   - Scorpion: 8 legs\n   - Elephant: 4 legs\n   - Cockroach: 6 legs\n   - Praying Mantis: 6 legs\n   - Tiger: 4 legs\n   - Crab: 10 legs (crabs are decapods, typically having 10 legs)\n   - Deer: 4 legs\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Sheeps: 15 sheeps * 4 legs = 60 legs\n   - Woodlouses: 6 woodlouses * 14 legs = 84 legs\n   - Scorpions: 14 scorpions * 8 legs = 112 legs\n   - Elephants: 11 elephants * 4 legs = 44 legs\n   - Cockroaches: 7 cockroaches * 6 legs = 42 legs\n   - Praying Mantises: 15 praying mantises * 6 legs = 90 legs\n   - Tigers: 4 tigers * 4 legs = 16 legs\n   - Crabs: 2 crabs * 10 legs = 20 legs\n   - Deers: 15 deers * 4 legs = 60 legs\n\n3. **Sum up all the legs:**\n   - Total legs = 60 (sheeps) + 84 (woodlouses) + 112 (scorpions) + 44 (elephants) + 42 (cockroaches) + 90 (praying mantises) + 16 (tigers) + 20 (crabs) + 60 (deers)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 60 + 84 + 112 + 44 + 42 + 90 + 16 + 20 + 60 = 528\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 528.\n\nFinal answer: <<<528>>>"
