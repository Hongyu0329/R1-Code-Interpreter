    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all the legs to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each type of animal:\n\n1. **Jellyfish**: Jellyfish do not have legs. They have tentacles, but for the purpose of this problem, we consider them to have 0 legs.\n\n2. **Wasps**: Wasps are insects, and like most insects, they have 6 legs.\n\n3. **Elephants**: Elephants are mammals and have 4 legs.\n\n4. **Ants**: Ants are also insects, so they have 6 legs.\n\n5. **Lobsters**: Lobsters are crustaceans and typically have 10 legs.\n\n6. **Humans**: Humans have 2 legs.\n\n7. **Butterflies**: Butterflies are insects, and they have 6 legs.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:\n\n- **Jellyfish**: 9 jellyfish * 0 legs = 0 legs\n- **Wasps**: 3 wasps * 6 legs = 18 legs\n- **Elephants**: 3 elephants * 4 legs = 12 legs\n- **Ants**: 11 ants * 6 legs = 66 legs\n- **Lobsters**: 13 lobsters * 10 legs = 130 legs\n- **Humans**: 5 humans * 2 legs = 10 legs\n- **Butterflies**: 10 butterflies * 6 legs = 60 legs\n\nFinally, we sum up all the legs:\n\n0 (jellyfish) + 18 (wasps) + 12 (elephants) + 66 (ants) + 130 (lobsters) + 10 (humans) + 60 (butterflies) = 296 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 296.\n\n<<<296>>>"
