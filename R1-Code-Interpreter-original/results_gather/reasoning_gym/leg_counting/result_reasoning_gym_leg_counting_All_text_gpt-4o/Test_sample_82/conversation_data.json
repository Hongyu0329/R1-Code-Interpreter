    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze each type of animal step by step:\n\n1. **Woodlouse**: \n   - A woodlouse typically has 14 legs.\n   - Given: 9 woodlouses.\n   - Total legs from woodlouses = 9 woodlouses * 14 legs/woodlouse = 126 legs.\n\n2. **Bird**: \n   - A bird typically has 2 legs.\n   - Given: 9 birds.\n   - Total legs from birds = 9 birds * 2 legs/bird = 18 legs.\n\n3. **Ant**: \n   - An ant typically has 6 legs.\n   - Given: 11 ants.\n   - Total legs from ants = 11 ants * 6 legs/ant = 66 legs.\n\n4. **Giraffe**: \n   - A giraffe typically has 4 legs.\n   - Given: 9 giraffes.\n   - Total legs from giraffes = 9 giraffes * 4 legs/giraffe = 36 legs.\n\n5. **Flatworm**: \n   - A flatworm does not have legs.\n   - Given: 5 flatworms.\n   - Total legs from flatworms = 5 flatworms * 0 legs/flatworm = 0 legs.\n\n6. **Dog**: \n   - A dog typically has 4 legs.\n   - Given: 10 dogs.\n   - Total legs from dogs = 10 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 40 legs.\n\nNow, we sum up the total number of legs from all the animals:\n\n- Total legs = Legs from woodlouses + Legs from birds + Legs from ants + Legs from giraffes + Legs from flatworms + Legs from dogs\n- Total legs = 126 + 18 + 66 + 36 + 0 + 40 = 286\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 286.\n\nFinal answer: <<<286>>>."
