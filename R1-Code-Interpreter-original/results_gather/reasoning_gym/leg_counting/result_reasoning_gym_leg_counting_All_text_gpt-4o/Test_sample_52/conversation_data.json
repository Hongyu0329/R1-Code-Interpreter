    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs for the given quantities of each animal. Let's analyze each type of animal step by step:\n\n1. **Jellyfish**: Jellyfish do not have legs. They have tentacles, but for the purpose of this problem, we consider them to have 0 legs.\n\n2. **Spiders**: Spiders are arachnids and typically have 8 legs.\n\n3. **Snakes**: Snakes do not have legs.\n\n4. **Crabs**: Crabs are crustaceans and typically have 10 legs.\n\n5. **Insects**: Insects have 6 legs.\n\n6. **Horses**: Horses are mammals and have 4 legs.\n\n7. **Elephants**: Elephants are mammals and have 4 legs.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal based on the given quantities:\n\n- **Jellyfish**: 8 jellyfish × 0 legs = 0 legs\n- **Spiders**: 14 spiders × 8 legs = 112 legs\n- **Snakes**: 9 snakes × 0 legs = 0 legs\n- **Crabs**: 13 crabs × 10 legs = 130 legs\n- **Insects**: 12 insects × 6 legs = 72 legs\n- **Horses**: 6 horses × 4 legs = 24 legs\n- **Elephants**: 10 elephants × 4 legs = 40 legs\n\nFinally, we sum up the total number of legs from all the animals:\n\n0 (jellyfish) + 112 (spiders) + 0 (snakes) + 130 (crabs) + 72 (insects) + 24 (horses) + 40 (elephants) = 378 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is:\n\n<<<378>>>"
