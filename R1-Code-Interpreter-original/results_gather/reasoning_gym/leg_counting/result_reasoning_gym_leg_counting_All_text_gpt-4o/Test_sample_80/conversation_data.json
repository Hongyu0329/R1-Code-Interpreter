    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each type of animal:\n\n1. **Starfish**: Starfish typically have 5 arms, but they do not have legs in the traditional sense. For the purpose of this problem, we will consider them as having 0 legs.\n   - Number of starfish: 10\n   - Legs per starfish: 0\n   - Total legs from starfish: 10 * 0 = 0\n\n2. **Praying Mantis**: Praying mantises have 6 legs.\n   - Number of praying mantises: 4\n   - Legs per praying mantis: 6\n   - Total legs from praying mantises: 4 * 6 = 24\n\n3. **Grasshopper**: Grasshoppers have 6 legs.\n   - Number of grasshoppers: 12\n   - Legs per grasshopper: 6\n   - Total legs from grasshoppers: 12 * 6 = 72\n\n4. **Cat**: Cats have 4 legs.\n   - Number of cats: 8\n   - Legs per cat: 4\n   - Total legs from cats: 8 * 4 = 32\n\n5. **Beetle**: Beetles have 6 legs.\n   - Number of beetles: 8\n   - Legs per beetle: 6\n   - Total legs from beetles: 8 * 6 = 48\n\n6. **Elephant**: Elephants have 4 legs.\n   - Number of elephants: 5\n   - Legs per elephant: 4\n   - Total legs from elephants: 5 * 4 = 20\n\n7. **Tiger**: Tigers have 4 legs.\n   - Number of tigers: 6\n   - Legs per tiger: 4\n   - Total legs from tigers: 6 * 4 = 24\n\n8. **Spider**: Spiders have 8 legs.\n   - Number of spiders: 4\n   - Legs per spider: 8\n   - Total legs from spiders: 4 * 8 = 32\n\n9. **Snake**: Snakes do not have legs.\n   - Number of snakes: 4\n   - Legs per snake: 0\n   - Total legs from snakes: 4 * 0 = 0\n\n10. **Horse**: Horses have 4 legs.\n    - Number of horses: 12\n    - Legs per horse: 4\n    - Total legs from horses: 12 * 4 = 48\n\nNow, we sum up all the total legs from each type of animal:\n\n- Total legs = 0 (starfish) + 24 (praying mantises) + 72 (grasshoppers) + 32 (cats) + 48 (beetles) + 20 (elephants) + 24 (tigers) + 32 (spiders) + 0 (snakes) + 48 (horses)\n\n- Total legs = 300\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is:\n\n<<<300>>>"
