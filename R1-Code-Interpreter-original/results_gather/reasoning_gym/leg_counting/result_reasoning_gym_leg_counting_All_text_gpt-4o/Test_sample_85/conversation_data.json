    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze each type of animal step by step:\n\n1. **Cows**: \n   - Cows are quadrupeds, meaning each cow has 4 legs.\n   - Given: 12 cows.\n   - Total legs from cows = 12 cows * 4 legs/cow = 48 legs.\n\n2. **Cats**: \n   - Cats are also quadrupeds, so each cat has 4 legs.\n   - Given: 2 cats.\n   - Total legs from cats = 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs.\n\n3. **Lions**: \n   - Lions, like cows and cats, are quadrupeds, with each lion having 4 legs.\n   - Given: 12 lions.\n   - Total legs from lions = 12 lions * 4 legs/lion = 48 legs.\n\n4. **Wasps**: \n   - Wasps are insects, and insects typically have 6 legs.\n   - Given: 9 wasps.\n   - Total legs from wasps = 9 wasps * 6 legs/wasp = 54 legs.\n\n5. **Shrimps**: \n   - Shrimps are crustaceans, and they typically have 10 legs.\n   - Given: 10 shrimps.\n   - Total legs from shrimps = 10 shrimps * 10 legs/shrimp = 100 legs.\n\n6. **Grasshoppers**: \n   - Grasshoppers are insects, so they have 6 legs.\n   - Given: 6 grasshoppers.\n   - Total legs from grasshoppers = 6 grasshoppers * 6 legs/grasshopper = 36 legs.\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal to get the total number of legs:\n\n- Total legs = Legs from cows + Legs from cats + Legs from lions + Legs from wasps + Legs from shrimps + Legs from grasshoppers\n- Total legs = 48 + 8 + 48 + 54 + 100 + 36\n- Total legs = 294\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 294.\n\n<<<294>>>"
