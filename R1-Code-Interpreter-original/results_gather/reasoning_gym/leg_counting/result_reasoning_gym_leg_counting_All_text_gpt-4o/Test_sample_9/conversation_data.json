    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Ants: 6 legs\n   - Elephants: 4 legs\n   - Cats: 4 legs\n   - Bees: 6 legs\n   - Sheep: 4 legs\n   - Deer: 4 legs\n   - Horses: 4 legs\n   - Crickets: 6 legs\n   - Beetles: 6 legs\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - 13 ants: \\(13 \\times 6 = 78\\) legs\n   - 10 elephants: \\(10 \\times 4 = 40\\) legs\n   - 1 cat: \\(1 \\times 4 = 4\\) legs\n   - 13 bees: \\(13 \\times 6 = 78\\) legs\n   - 4 sheep: \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) legs\n   - 11 deer: \\(11 \\times 4 = 44\\) legs\n   - 14 horses: \\(14 \\times 4 = 56\\) legs\n   - 1 cricket: \\(1 \\times 6 = 6\\) legs\n   - 8 beetles: \\(8 \\times 6 = 48\\) legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = 78 (ants) + 40 (elephants) + 4 (cat) + 78 (bees) + 16 (sheep) + 44 (deer) + 56 (horses) + 6 (cricket) + 48 (beetles)\n\n4. **Perform the addition:**\n   - Total legs = 78 + 40 + 4 + 78 + 16 + 44 + 56 + 6 + 48\n   - Total legs = 370\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 370.\n\n<<<370>>>"
