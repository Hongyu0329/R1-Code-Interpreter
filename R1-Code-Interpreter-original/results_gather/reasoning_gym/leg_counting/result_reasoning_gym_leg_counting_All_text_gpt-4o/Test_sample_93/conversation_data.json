    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all the legs to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Elephants**: \n   - Elephants have 4 legs.\n   - We have 10 elephants.\n   - Total legs from elephants = 10 elephants * 4 legs/elephant = 40 legs.\n\n2. **Starfish**:\n   - Starfish typically have 5 arms, but they do not have legs in the traditional sense. For the purpose of this problem, we consider them as having 0 legs.\n   - We have 11 starfish.\n   - Total legs from starfish = 11 starfish * 0 legs/starfish = 0 legs.\n\n3. **Cow**:\n   - Cows have 4 legs.\n   - We have 1 cow.\n   - Total legs from the cow = 1 cow * 4 legs/cow = 4 legs.\n\n4. **Butterflies**:\n   - Butterflies have 6 legs.\n   - We have 2 butterflies.\n   - Total legs from butterflies = 2 butterflies * 6 legs/butterfly = 12 legs.\n\n5. **Dogs**:\n   - Dogs have 4 legs.\n   - We have 12 dogs.\n   - Total legs from dogs = 12 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 48 legs.\n\n6. **Shrimps**:\n   - Shrimps have 10 legs.\n   - We have 11 shrimps.\n   - Total legs from shrimps = 11 shrimps * 10 legs/shrimp = 110 legs.\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal to get the total number of legs:\n\n- Total legs = 40 (elephants) + 0 (starfish) + 4 (cow) + 12 (butterflies) + 48 (dogs) + 110 (shrimps) = 214 legs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is:\n\n<<<214>>>."
