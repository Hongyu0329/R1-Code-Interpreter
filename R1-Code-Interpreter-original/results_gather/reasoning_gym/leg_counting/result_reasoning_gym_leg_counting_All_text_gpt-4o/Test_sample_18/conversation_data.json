    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Deer: 4 legs\n   - Beetle: 6 legs\n   - Giraffe: 4 legs\n   - Firefly: 6 legs\n   - Ant: 6 legs\n   - Chicken: 2 legs\n   - Woodlouse: 14 legs\n   - Cat: 4 legs\n   - Human: 2 legs\n   - Scorpion: 8 legs\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - 9 deers: \\(9 \\times 4 = 36\\) legs\n   - 2 beetles: \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) legs\n   - 15 giraffes: \\(15 \\times 4 = 60\\) legs\n   - 3 fireflies: \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\) legs\n   - 6 ants: \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) legs\n   - 14 chickens: \\(14 \\times 2 = 28\\) legs\n   - 2 woodlice: \\(2 \\times 14 = 28\\) legs\n   - 6 cats: \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\) legs\n   - 6 humans: \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\) legs\n   - 4 scorpions: \\(4 \\times 8 = 32\\) legs\n\n3. **Sum up all the legs:**\n   - Total legs = 36 (deers) + 12 (beetles) + 60 (giraffes) + 18 (fireflies) + 36 (ants) + 28 (chickens) + 28 (woodlice) + 24 (cats) + 12 (humans) + 32 (scorpions)\n\n4. **Calculate the final total:**\n   - Total legs = 36 + 12 + 60 + 18 + 36 + 28 + 28 + 24 + 12 + 32 = 286\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 286.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<286>>>."
