    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs for the given quantities of each animal. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - **Cockroach:** Typically, a cockroach has 6 legs.\n   - **Shrimp:** A shrimp has 10 legs (5 pairs of walking legs).\n   - **Starfish:** Starfish do not have legs in the traditional sense; they have tube feet. For the purpose of this problem, we will consider them as having 0 legs.\n   - **Firefly:** Like other insects, a firefly has 6 legs.\n   - **Spider:** A spider has 8 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - **Cockroaches:** 7 cockroaches × 6 legs each = 42 legs\n   - **Shrimps:** 4 shrimps × 10 legs each = 40 legs\n   - **Starfish:** 8 starfish × 0 legs each = 0 legs\n   - **Fireflies:** 6 fireflies × 6 legs each = 36 legs\n   - **Spiders:** 10 spiders × 8 legs each = 80 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = 42 (cockroaches) + 40 (shrimps) + 0 (starfish) + 36 (fireflies) + 80 (spiders)\n   - Total legs = 198\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 198.\n\nFinal answer: <<<198>>>"
