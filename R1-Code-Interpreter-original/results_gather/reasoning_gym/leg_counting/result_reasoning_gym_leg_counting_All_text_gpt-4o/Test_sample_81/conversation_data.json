    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for the given animals: deers, sea slugs, and fireflies. We will do this by considering the number of legs each type of animal typically has and then multiplying by the number of each animal provided.\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - **Deers:** Typically, a deer has 4 legs.\n   - **Sea slugs:** Sea slugs do not have legs. They are mollusks and move using a muscular foot.\n   - **Fireflies:** Fireflies are insects, and like most insects, they have 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - **Deers:** There are 9 deers, and each has 4 legs.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total legs from deers} = 9 \\times 4 = 36\n     \\]\n   - **Sea slugs:** There are 6 sea slugs, and each has 0 legs.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total legs from sea slugs} = 6 \\times 0 = 0\n     \\]\n   - **Fireflies:** There are 4 fireflies, and each has 6 legs.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total legs from fireflies} = 4 \\times 6 = 24\n     \\]\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total legs} = 36 \\, (\\text{from deers}) + 0 \\, (\\text{from sea slugs}) + 24 \\, (\\text{from fireflies}) = 60\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given animals is 60.\n\nFinal answer: <<<60>>>"
