    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Humans have 2 legs.\n   - Grasshoppers have 6 legs.\n   - Praying mantises have 6 legs.\n   - Deers have 4 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For humans: \n     - Number of humans = 10\n     - Legs per human = 2\n     - Total legs for humans = 10 humans * 2 legs/human = 20 legs\n\n   - For grasshoppers:\n     - Number of grasshoppers = 7\n     - Legs per grasshopper = 6\n     - Total legs for grasshoppers = 7 grasshoppers * 6 legs/grasshopper = 42 legs\n\n   - For praying mantises:\n     - Number of praying mantises = 8\n     - Legs per praying mantis = 6\n     - Total legs for praying mantises = 8 praying mantises * 6 legs/praying mantis = 48 legs\n\n   - For deers:\n     - Number of deers = 10\n     - Legs per deer = 4\n     - Total legs for deers = 10 deers * 4 legs/deer = 40 legs\n\n3. **Sum up the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = Total legs for humans + Total legs for grasshoppers + Total legs for praying mantises + Total legs for deers\n   - Total legs = 20 legs (humans) + 42 legs (grasshoppers) + 48 legs (praying mantises) + 40 legs (deers)\n   - Total legs = 150 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 150.\n\nFinal answer: <<<150>>>."
