    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Lions: Typically, a lion has 4 legs.\n   - Dogs: A dog also has 4 legs.\n   - Starfish: A starfish has 0 legs because it is not a legged animal; it has arms.\n   - Giraffes: A giraffe has 4 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For lions: There are 8 lions, and each has 4 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs for lions is:\n     \\[\n     8 \\text{ lions} \\times 4 \\text{ legs/lion} = 32 \\text{ legs}\n     \\]\n   - For the dog: There is 1 dog, and it has 4 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs for the dog is:\n     \\[\n     1 \\text{ dog} \\times 4 \\text{ legs/dog} = 4 \\text{ legs}\n     \\]\n   - For starfish: There are 12 starfish, and each has 0 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs for starfish is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ starfish} \\times 0 \\text{ legs/starfish} = 0 \\text{ legs}\n     \\]\n   - For the giraffe: There is 1 giraffe, and it has 4 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs for the giraffe is:\n     \\[\n     1 \\text{ giraffe} \\times 4 \\text{ legs/giraffe} = 4 \\text{ legs}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Add up the legs from all the animals:\n     \\[\n     32 \\text{ (lions)} + 4 \\text{ (dog)} + 0 \\text{ (starfish)} + 4 \\text{ (giraffe)} = 40 \\text{ legs}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals is 40.\n\nFinal answer: <<<40>>>."
