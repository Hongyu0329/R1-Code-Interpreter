    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given in the list. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each animal step by step:\n\n1. **Giraffe**: \n   - Number of legs: 4\n   - Number of giraffes: 1\n   - Total legs from giraffes: 1 * 4 = 4\n\n2. **Grasshopper**: \n   - Number of legs: 6\n   - Number of grasshoppers: 2\n   - Total legs from grasshoppers: 2 * 6 = 12\n\n3. **Firefly**: \n   - Number of legs: 6\n   - Number of fireflies: 14\n   - Total legs from fireflies: 14 * 6 = 84\n\n4. **Deer**: \n   - Number of legs: 4\n   - Number of deers: 9\n   - Total legs from deers: 9 * 4 = 36\n\n5. **Leech**: \n   - Number of legs: 0 (leeches do not have legs)\n   - Number of leeches: 15\n   - Total legs from leeches: 15 * 0 = 0\n\n6. **Shrimp**: \n   - Number of legs: 10 (shrimps typically have 10 legs)\n   - Number of shrimps: 2\n   - Total legs from shrimps: 2 * 10 = 20\n\n7. **Tiger**: \n   - Number of legs: 4\n   - Number of tigers: 3\n   - Total legs from tigers: 3 * 4 = 12\n\n8. **Cat**: \n   - Number of legs: 4\n   - Number of cats: 8\n   - Total legs from cats: 8 * 4 = 32\n\n9. **Beetle**: \n   - Number of legs: 6\n   - Number of beetles: 11\n   - Total legs from beetles: 11 * 6 = 66\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal:\n\n- Total legs = 4 (giraffes) + 12 (grasshoppers) + 84 (fireflies) + 36 (deers) + 0 (leeches) + 20 (shrimps) + 12 (tigers) + 32 (cats) + 66 (beetles)\n\nCalculating the sum:\n\n- Total legs = 4 + 12 + 84 + 36 + 0 + 20 + 12 + 32 + 66 = 266\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 266.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<266>>>."
