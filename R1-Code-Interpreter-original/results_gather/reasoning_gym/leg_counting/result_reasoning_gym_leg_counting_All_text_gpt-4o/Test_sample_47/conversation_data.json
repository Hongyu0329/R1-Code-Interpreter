    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Cockroach: Typically, a cockroach has 6 legs.\n   - Butterfly: A butterfly also has 6 legs.\n   - Cat: A cat has 4 legs.\n   - Giraffe: A giraffe has 4 legs.\n   - Spider: A spider has 8 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For cockroaches: \n     - Number of cockroaches = 3\n     - Legs per cockroach = 6\n     - Total legs for cockroaches = 3 * 6 = 18\n\n   - For butterflies:\n     - Number of butterflies = 2\n     - Legs per butterfly = 6\n     - Total legs for butterflies = 2 * 6 = 12\n\n   - For cats:\n     - Number of cats = 6\n     - Legs per cat = 4\n     - Total legs for cats = 6 * 4 = 24\n\n   - For giraffes:\n     - Number of giraffes = 1\n     - Legs per giraffe = 4\n     - Total legs for giraffes = 1 * 4 = 4\n\n   - For spiders:\n     - Number of spiders = 4\n     - Legs per spider = 8\n     - Total legs for spiders = 4 * 8 = 32\n\n3. **Sum up the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = Legs from cockroaches + Legs from butterflies + Legs from cats + Legs from giraffes + Legs from spiders\n   - Total legs = 18 (cockroaches) + 12 (butterflies) + 24 (cats) + 4 (giraffes) + 32 (spiders)\n   - Total legs = 90\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 90.\n\nFinal answer: <<<90>>>."
