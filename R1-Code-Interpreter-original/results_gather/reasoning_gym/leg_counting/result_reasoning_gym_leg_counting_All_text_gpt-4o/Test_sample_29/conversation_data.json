    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each animal given in the list. Finally, we sum up all these products to get the total number of legs.\n\nLet's analyze each type of animal:\n\n1. **Cows**: Cows are quadrupeds, meaning they have 4 legs.\n   - Number of cows = 6\n   - Total legs from cows = 6 cows * 4 legs/cow = 24 legs\n\n2. **Shrimps**: Shrimps have 10 legs.\n   - Number of shrimps = 6\n   - Total legs from shrimps = 6 shrimps * 10 legs/shrimp = 60 legs\n\n3. **Lions**: Lions are also quadrupeds, so they have 4 legs.\n   - Number of lions = 2\n   - Total legs from lions = 2 lions * 4 legs/lion = 8 legs\n\n4. **Insects**: Insects typically have 6 legs.\n   - Number of insects = 7\n   - Total legs from insects = 7 insects * 6 legs/insect = 42 legs\n\n5. **Sheep**: Sheep are quadrupeds, having 4 legs.\n   - Number of sheep = 8\n   - Total legs from sheep = 8 sheep * 4 legs/sheep = 32 legs\n\n6. **Crabs**: Crabs have 10 legs.\n   - Number of crabs = 6\n   - Total legs from crabs = 6 crabs * 10 legs/crab = 60 legs\n\n7. **Wasps**: Wasps are insects, so they have 6 legs.\n   - Number of wasps = 3\n   - Total legs from wasps = 3 wasps * 6 legs/wasp = 18 legs\n\n8. **Butterflies**: Butterflies are insects, so they have 6 legs.\n   - Number of butterflies = 6\n   - Total legs from butterflies = 6 butterflies * 6 legs/butterfly = 36 legs\n\n9. **Snakes**: Snakes do not have legs.\n   - Number of snakes = 11\n   - Total legs from snakes = 11 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs\n\n10. **Giraffe**: Giraffes are quadrupeds, having 4 legs.\n    - Number of giraffes = 1\n    - Total legs from giraffes = 1 giraffe * 4 legs/giraffe = 4 legs\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal:\n\n- Total legs = 24 (cows) + 60 (shrimps) + 8 (lions) + 42 (insects) + 32 (sheep) + 60 (crabs) + 18 (wasps) + 36 (butterflies) + 0 (snakes) + 4 (giraffe)\n\nCalculating the sum:\n\n- Total legs = 24 + 60 + 8 + 42 + 32 + 60 + 18 + 36 + 0 + 4 = 284\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is 284.\n\n<<<284>>>"
