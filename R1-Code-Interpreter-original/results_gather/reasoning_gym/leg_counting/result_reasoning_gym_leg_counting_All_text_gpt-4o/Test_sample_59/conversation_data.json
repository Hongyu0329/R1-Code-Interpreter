    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs per animal:**\n   - Cows: Typically, a cow has 4 legs.\n   - Cats: A cat also has 4 legs.\n   - Wasps: Wasps have 6 legs, as they are insects.\n   - Praying mantises: Like wasps, praying mantises are insects and have 6 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - For cows: \n     - Number of cows = 14\n     - Legs per cow = 4\n     - Total legs for cows = 14 cows * 4 legs/cow = 56 legs\n\n   - For cats:\n     - Number of cats = 13\n     - Legs per cat = 4\n     - Total legs for cats = 13 cats * 4 legs/cat = 52 legs\n\n   - For wasps:\n     - Number of wasps = 12\n     - Legs per wasp = 6\n     - Total legs for wasps = 12 wasps * 6 legs/wasp = 72 legs\n\n   - For praying mantises:\n     - Number of praying mantises = 8\n     - Legs per praying mantis = 6\n     - Total legs for praying mantises = 8 praying mantises * 6 legs/praying mantis = 48 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs from all animals:**\n   - Total legs = Legs from cows + Legs from cats + Legs from wasps + Legs from praying mantises\n   - Total legs = 56 (cows) + 52 (cats) + 72 (wasps) + 48 (praying mantises)\n   - Total legs = 228\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for all the animals combined is 228.\n\n<<<228>>>"
