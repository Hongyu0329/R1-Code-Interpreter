    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs for the given quantities of each animal. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Sea slugs: Sea slugs are mollusks and typically do not have legs. They move using a muscular foot.\n   - Elephants: Elephants are mammals and have 4 legs.\n   - Woodlouses: Woodlouses, also known as pill bugs or roly-polies, are crustaceans and have 14 legs.\n   - Bees: Bees are insects and have 6 legs.\n   - Beetles: Beetles are also insects and have 6 legs.\n   - Leeches: Leeches are annelids and do not have legs. They move by contracting and expanding their bodies.\n   - Lions: Lions are mammals and have 4 legs.\n   - Dogs: Dogs are mammals and have 4 legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - Sea slugs: 6 sea slugs × 0 legs = 0 legs\n   - Elephants: 2 elephants × 4 legs = 8 legs\n   - Woodlouses: 10 woodlouses × 14 legs = 140 legs\n   - Bees: 9 bees × 6 legs = 54 legs\n   - Beetles: 14 beetles × 6 legs = 84 legs\n   - Leeches: 3 leeches × 0 legs = 0 legs\n   - Lions: 2 lions × 4 legs = 8 legs\n   - Dogs: 5 dogs × 4 legs = 20 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs:**\n   - Total legs = 0 (sea slugs) + 8 (elephants) + 140 (woodlouses) + 54 (bees) + 84 (beetles) + 0 (leeches) + 8 (lions) + 20 (dogs)\n   - Total legs = 314\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given list of animals is 314.\n\nFinal answer: <<<314>>>."
