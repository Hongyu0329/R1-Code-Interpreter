    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of legs for each type of animal and then sum them up. Let's analyze each type of animal step by step:\n\n1. **Elephants**: \n   - Elephants are quadrupeds, meaning they have 4 legs.\n   - If there are 8 elephants, the total number of legs is \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\).\n\n2. **Praying Mantises**:\n   - Praying mantises are insects, and insects typically have 6 legs.\n   - If there are 5 praying mantises, the total number of legs is \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\).\n\n3. **Cockroaches**:\n   - Cockroaches are also insects, so they have 6 legs.\n   - If there are 10 cockroaches, the total number of legs is \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\).\n\n4. **Flatworms**:\n   - Flatworms are a type of worm and do not have legs.\n   - If there are 15 flatworms, the total number of legs is \\(15 \\times 0 = 0\\).\n\n5. **Birds**:\n   - Birds are bipeds, meaning they have 2 legs.\n   - If there are 9 birds, the total number of legs is \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\).\n\n6. **Woodlice**:\n   - Woodlice are crustaceans and typically have 14 legs.\n   - If there are 2 woodlice, the total number of legs is \\(2 \\times 14 = 28\\).\n\n7. **Tigers**:\n   - Tigers are quadrupeds, so they have 4 legs.\n   - If there are 13 tigers, the total number of legs is \\(13 \\times 4 = 52\\).\n\nNow, we sum up all the legs from each type of animal:\n\n- Elephants: 32 legs\n- Praying Mantises: 30 legs\n- Cockroaches: 60 legs\n- Flatworms: 0 legs\n- Birds: 18 legs\n- Woodlice: 28 legs\n- Tigers: 52 legs\n\nTotal number of legs = 32 + 30 + 60 + 0 + 18 + 28 + 52 = 220\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs is:\n\n<<<220>>>"
