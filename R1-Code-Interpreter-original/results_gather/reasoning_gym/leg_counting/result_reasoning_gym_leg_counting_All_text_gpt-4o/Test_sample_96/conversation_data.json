    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has and then calculate the total number of legs for the given quantities of each animal. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - **Wasps:** Wasps are insects, and like most insects, they have 6 legs.\n   - **Scorpions:** Scorpions are arachnids, and they have 8 legs.\n   - **Beetles:** Beetles are also insects, so they have 6 legs.\n   - **Ducks:** Ducks are birds, and they have 2 legs.\n   - **Fireflies:** Fireflies are insects, so they have 6 legs.\n   - **Sea slugs:** Sea slugs are mollusks and do not have legs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal:**\n   - **Wasps:** 3 wasps × 6 legs each = 18 legs\n   - **Scorpions:** 6 scorpions × 8 legs each = 48 legs\n   - **Beetles:** 11 beetles × 6 legs each = 66 legs\n   - **Ducks:** 9 ducks × 2 legs each = 18 legs\n   - **Fireflies:** 5 fireflies × 6 legs each = 30 legs\n   - **Sea slugs:** 11 sea slugs × 0 legs each = 0 legs\n\n3. **Sum the total number of legs:**\n   - Total legs = 18 (wasps) + 48 (scorpions) + 66 (beetles) + 18 (ducks) + 30 (fireflies) + 0 (sea slugs)\n   - Total legs = 180\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs for the given list of animals is 180.\n\nFinal answer: <<<180>>>"
