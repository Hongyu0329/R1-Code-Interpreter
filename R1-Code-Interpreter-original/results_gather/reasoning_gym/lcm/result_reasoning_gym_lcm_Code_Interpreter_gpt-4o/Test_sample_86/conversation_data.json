    "\nassistant > To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)}\n\\]\n\nwhere GCD is the greatest common divisor. Since 39 and 43 are both prime numbers, their GCD is 1. Therefore, the LCM is simply the product of the two numbers.\n\nLet's calculate the LCM of 39 and 43.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 39\nb = 43\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the formula\nlcm = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)\nlcm\nassistant > The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 39 and 43 is <<<1677>>>."
