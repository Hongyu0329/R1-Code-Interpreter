    "\nassistant > To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)}\n\\]\n\nwhere GCD is the greatest common divisor. Since 73 and 67 are both prime numbers, their GCD is 1. Therefore, the LCM is simply the product of the two numbers.\n\nLet's calculate the LCM of 73 and 67.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 73\nb = 67\n\n# Calculate the LCM\nlcm = abs(a * b)\n\nlcm\nassistant > The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 73 and 67 is <<<4891>>>."
