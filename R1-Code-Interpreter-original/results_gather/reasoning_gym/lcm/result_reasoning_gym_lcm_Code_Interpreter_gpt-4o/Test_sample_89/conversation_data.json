    "\nassistant > To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)}\n\\]\n\nwhere GCD is the greatest common divisor. Since 43 and 37 are both prime numbers, their GCD is 1. Therefore, the LCM is simply the product of the two numbers.\n\nLet's calculate it.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 43\nb = 37\n\n# Calculate the LCM\nlcm = abs(a * b)\n\nlcm\nassistant > The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 43 and 37 is <<<1591>>>."
