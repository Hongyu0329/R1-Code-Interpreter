    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 24 and 72, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **24**: \n     - 24 can be divided by 2 (the smallest prime number) to get 12.\n     - 12 can be divided by 2 to get 6.\n     - 6 can be divided by 2 to get 3.\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 24 is \\(2^3 \\times 3^1\\).\n   - **72**:\n     - 72 can be divided by 2 to get 36.\n     - 36 can be divided by 2 to get 18.\n     - 18 can be divided by 2 to get 9.\n     - 9 can be divided by 3 to get 3.\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 72 is \\(2^3 \\times 3^2\\).\n\n3. **Determine the LCM Using Prime Factorization**:\n   - To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - For the prime number 2, the highest power is \\(2^3\\).\n   - For the prime number 3, the highest power is \\(3^2\\).\n   - Therefore, the LCM is \\(2^3 \\times 3^2\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n   - Calculate \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n   - Multiply these results: \\(8 \\times 9 = 72\\).\n\n5. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 72 is divisible by both 24 and 72.\n   - 72 divided by 24 equals 3, which is an integer.\n   - 72 divided by 72 equals 1, which is an integer.\n   - Therefore, 72 is indeed the LCM of 24 and 72.\n\nThe Least Common Multiple of 24 and 72 is 72.\n\n<<<72>>>"
