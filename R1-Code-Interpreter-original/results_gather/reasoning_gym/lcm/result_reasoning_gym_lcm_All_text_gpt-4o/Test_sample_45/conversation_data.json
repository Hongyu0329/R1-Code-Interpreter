    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 42 and 26, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **42**: \n     - 42 is divisible by 2 (the smallest prime number), so 42 รท 2 = 21.\n     - 21 is divisible by 3, so 21 รท 3 = 7.\n     - 7 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 42 is \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1\\).\n   - **26**:\n     - 26 is divisible by 2, so 26 รท 2 = 13.\n     - 13 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 26 is \\(2^1 \\times 13^1\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations: 2, 3, 7, 13.\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations:\n     - For 2: The highest power is \\(2^1\\).\n     - For 3: The highest power is \\(3^1\\).\n     - For 7: The highest power is \\(7^1\\).\n     - For 13: The highest power is \\(13^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together:\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1 \\times 13^1\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\)\n     - \\(6 \\times 7 = 42\\)\n     - \\(42 \\times 13 = 546\\)\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 42 and 26 is 546.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<546>>>"
