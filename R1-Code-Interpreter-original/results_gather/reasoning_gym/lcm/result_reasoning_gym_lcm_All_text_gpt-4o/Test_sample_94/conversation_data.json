    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 61 and 61, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: The LCM of two or more numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers.\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**: We are given the numbers 61 and 61. Since both numbers are the same, this simplifies the process.\n\n3. **Check for Repetition**: When the numbers are identical, the LCM is simply the number itself. This is because any number is divisible by itself, and there is no smaller positive integer that can be divisible by 61 other than 61 itself.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: \n   - The number 61 is a prime number, meaning it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - Since both numbers are the same, the LCM is 61.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The LCM of two identical numbers is the number itself.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 61 and 61 is:\n\n<<<61>>>"
