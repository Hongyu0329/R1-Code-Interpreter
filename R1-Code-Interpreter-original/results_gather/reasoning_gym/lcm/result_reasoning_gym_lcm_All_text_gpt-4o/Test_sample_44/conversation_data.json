    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 60: \n     - 60 is even, divide by 2: 60 ÷ 2 = 30\n     - 30 is even, divide by 2: 30 ÷ 2 = 15\n     - 15 is divisible by 3: 15 ÷ 3 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factorization of 60: \\(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5\\)\n\n   - For 50:\n     - 50 is even, divide by 2: 50 ÷ 2 = 25\n     - 25 is divisible by 5: 25 ÷ 5 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factorization of 50: \\(2 \\times 5^2\\)\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**: For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - Prime number 2: The highest power is \\(2^2\\) (from 60).\n   - Prime number 3: The highest power is \\(3^1\\) (from 60).\n   - Prime number 5: The highest power is \\(5^2\\) (from 50).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2\\)\n   - LCM = 4 × 3 × 25\n   - LCM = 12 × 25\n   - LCM = 300\n\n5. **Verify the Result**: Ensure that 300 is divisible by both 60 and 50.\n   - 300 ÷ 60 = 5 (an integer, so divisible)\n   - 300 ÷ 50 = 6 (an integer, so divisible)\n\nThus, the Least Common Multiple of 60 and 50 is 300.\n\n<<<300>>>"
