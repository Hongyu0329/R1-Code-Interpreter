    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 3 and 18, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **List the Multiples of Each Number**:\n   - Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, ...\n   - Multiples of 18: 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, ...\n\n3. **Identify the Common Multiples**:\n   - From the lists above, the common multiples of 3 and 18 are: 18, 36, 54, ...\n\n4. **Select the Smallest Common Multiple**:\n   - The smallest common multiple from the list is 18.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check divisibility: \n     - 18 รท 3 = 6 (which is an integer)\n     - 18 รท 18 = 1 (which is an integer)\n   - Since 18 is divisible by both 3 and 18, it confirms that 18 is indeed the LCM.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 3 and 18 is 18.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<18>>>"
