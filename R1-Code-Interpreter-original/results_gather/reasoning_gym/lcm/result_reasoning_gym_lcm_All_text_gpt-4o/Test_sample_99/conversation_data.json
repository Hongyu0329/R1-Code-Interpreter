    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the prime factorization method. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of Each Number:**\n   - **48:** \n     - 48 is even, so divide by 2: 48 ÷ 2 = 24\n     - 24 is even, so divide by 2: 24 ÷ 2 = 12\n     - 12 is even, so divide by 2: 12 ÷ 2 = 6\n     - 6 is even, so divide by 2: 6 ÷ 2 = 3\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 48 is \\(2^4 \\times 3^1\\).\n\n   - **99:**\n     - 99 is odd, so check divisibility by 3: 99 ÷ 3 = 33\n     - 33 is odd, so check divisibility by 3: 33 ÷ 3 = 11\n     - 11 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 99 is \\(3^2 \\times 11^1\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime:**\n   - From the prime factorizations:\n     - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, and 11.\n     - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^4\\).\n     - The highest power of 3 is \\(3^2\\).\n     - The highest power of 11 is \\(11^1\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM:**\n   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number and multiplying them together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM} = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 11^1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Calculate \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n   - Calculate \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n   - Multiply these results: \\(16 \\times 9 = 144\\).\n   - Finally, multiply by 11: \\(144 \\times 11 = 1584\\).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 48 and 99 is 1584.\n\n<<<1584>>>"
