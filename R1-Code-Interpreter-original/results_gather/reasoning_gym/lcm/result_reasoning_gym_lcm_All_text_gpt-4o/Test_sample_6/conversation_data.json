    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 48 and 6, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **48**: \n     - 48 is even, so divide by 2: 48 ÷ 2 = 24\n     - 24 is even, so divide by 2: 24 ÷ 2 = 12\n     - 12 is even, so divide by 2: 12 ÷ 2 = 6\n     - 6 is even, so divide by 2: 6 ÷ 2 = 3\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 48 is \\(2^4 \\times 3^1\\).\n\n   - **6**:\n     - 6 is even, so divide by 2: 6 ÷ 2 = 3\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 6 is \\(2^1 \\times 3^1\\).\n\n3. **Determine the LCM Using Prime Factorization**:\n   - To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - For the prime number 2, the highest power is \\(2^4\\) (from 48).\n   - For the prime number 3, the highest power is \\(3^1\\) (common in both 48 and 6).\n   - Therefore, the LCM is \\(2^4 \\times 3^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n   - Calculate \\(3^1 = 3\\).\n   - Multiply these results: \\(16 \\times 3 = 48\\).\n\n5. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 48 is divisible by both original numbers:\n     - 48 ÷ 48 = 1 (divisible)\n     - 48 ÷ 6 = 8 (divisible)\n   - Since 48 is divisible by both 48 and 6, it confirms that 48 is indeed the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 48 and 6 is 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
