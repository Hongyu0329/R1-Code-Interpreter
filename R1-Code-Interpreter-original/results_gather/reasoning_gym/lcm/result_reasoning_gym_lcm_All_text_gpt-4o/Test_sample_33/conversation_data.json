    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 37 and 37, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: The LCM of two or more integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers.\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**: We are given the numbers 37 and 37. Since both numbers are the same, this simplifies the process.\n\n3. **Consider the Properties of LCM**:\n   - If two numbers are the same, the LCM is the number itself. This is because the smallest number that both numbers divide into without a remainder is the number itself.\n\n4. **Apply the Property**: Since both numbers are 37, the LCM of 37 and 37 is simply 37.\n\n5. **Verify**: \n   - Check divisibility: 37 is divisible by 37 (since any number is divisible by itself).\n   - There is no smaller positive integer than 37 that both numbers can divide into without a remainder.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The LCM of 37 and 37 is 37.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<37>>>"
