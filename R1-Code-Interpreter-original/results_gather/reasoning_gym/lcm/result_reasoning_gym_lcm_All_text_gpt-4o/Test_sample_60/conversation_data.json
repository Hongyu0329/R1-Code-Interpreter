    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The Least Common Multiple of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**:\n   - We are given two numbers: 73 and 67.\n\n3. **Check if the Numbers are Prime**:\n   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - 73 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 73.\n   - 67 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 67.\n\n4. **LCM of Two Prime Numbers**:\n   - When both numbers are prime, the LCM is simply the product of the two numbers. This is because the only common multiple they have is their product, as they have no other common factors.\n\n5. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the two numbers: 73 * 67.\n\n6. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - 73 * 67 = 4891.\n\n7. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 4891 is divisible by both 73 and 67:\n     - 4891 รท 73 = 67 (exact division, no remainder).\n     - 4891 รท 67 = 73 (exact division, no remainder).\n   - Since 4891 is divisible by both numbers, it confirms that 4891 is indeed the LCM.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the Least Common Multiple of 73 and 67.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<4891>>>."
