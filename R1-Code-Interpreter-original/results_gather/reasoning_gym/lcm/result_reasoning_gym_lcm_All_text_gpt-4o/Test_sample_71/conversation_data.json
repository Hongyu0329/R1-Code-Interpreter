    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n\n3. **Prime Factorization of 93**:\n   - 93 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.\n   - Sum of digits of 93 is 9 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3. So, 93 is divisible by 3.\n   - Dividing 93 by 3 gives 31. \n   - 31 is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 93 is \\(3 \\times 31\\).\n\n4. **Prime Factorization of 90**:\n   - 90 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n   - Dividing 90 by 2 gives 45.\n   - Sum of digits of 45 is 4 + 5 = 9, which is divisible by 3. So, 45 is divisible by 3.\n   - Dividing 45 by 3 gives 15.\n   - Sum of digits of 15 is 1 + 5 = 6, which is divisible by 3. So, 15 is divisible by 3.\n   - Dividing 15 by 3 gives 5.\n   - 5 is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 90 is \\(2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\).\n\n5. **Determine the LCM**:\n   - To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - From 93: \\(3^1\\), \\(31^1\\)\n   - From 90: \\(2^1\\), \\(3^2\\), \\(5^1\\)\n   - The LCM will be \\(2^1 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 31^1\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - \\(2^1 = 2\\)\n   - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n   - \\(5^1 = 5\\)\n   - \\(31^1 = 31\\)\n   - Multiply these together: \\(2 \\times 9 \\times 5 \\times 31\\).\n\n7. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, calculate \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\).\n   - Then, calculate \\(18 \\times 5 = 90\\).\n   - Finally, calculate \\(90 \\times 31\\).\n   - \\(90 \\times 31 = 2790\\).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 93 and 90 is 2790.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2790>>>."
