    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 52 and 66, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 52:\n     - 52 is even, so divide by 2: \\(52 \\div 2 = 26\\)\n     - 26 is even, so divide by 2 again: \\(26 \\div 2 = 13\\)\n     - 13 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 52 is \\(2^2 \\times 13\\).\n\n   - For 66:\n     - 66 is even, so divide by 2: \\(66 \\div 2 = 33\\)\n     - 33 is divisible by 3: \\(33 \\div 3 = 11\\)\n     - 11 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 66 is \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 11\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations: 2, 3, 11, 13.\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations:\n     - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^2\\) (from 52).\n     - The highest power of 3 is \\(3^1\\) (from 66).\n     - The highest power of 11 is \\(11^1\\) (from 66).\n     - The highest power of 13 is \\(13^1\\) (from 52).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM:\n   \\[\n   LCM = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1\n   \\]\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\)\n     - \\(12 \\times 11 = 132\\)\n     - \\(132 \\times 13 = 1716\\)\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 52 and 66 is 1716.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1716>>>."
