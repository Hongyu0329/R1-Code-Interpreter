    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 38: \n     - 38 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 38 รท 2 = 19, and 19 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 38 is \\(2 \\times 19\\).\n   - For 4:\n     - 4 is also an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 4 รท 2 = 2, and 2 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 4 is \\(2^2\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations.\n   - For 38: the prime factors are 2 and 19.\n   - For 4: the prime factor is 2.\n   - The highest power of 2 from both factorizations is \\(2^2\\).\n   - The highest power of 19 is \\(19^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime factors together.\n   - LCM = \\(2^2 \\times 19^1\\).\n   - Calculate: \\(2^2 = 4\\) and \\(19^1 = 19\\).\n   - Multiply these results: \\(4 \\times 19 = 76\\).\n\n5. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 76 is divisible by both original numbers.\n   - 76 รท 38 = 2 (an integer, so divisible).\n   - 76 รท 4 = 19 (an integer, so divisible).\n\nThus, the Least Common Multiple of 38 and 4 is 76.\n\nFinal answer: <<<76>>>."
