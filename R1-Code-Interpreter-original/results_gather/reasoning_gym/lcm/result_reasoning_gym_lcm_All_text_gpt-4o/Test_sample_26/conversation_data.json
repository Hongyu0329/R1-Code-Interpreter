    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 52: \n     - 52 is even, so divide by 2: \\(52 \\div 2 = 26\\)\n     - 26 is even, so divide by 2: \\(26 \\div 2 = 13\\)\n     - 13 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 52 is \\(2^2 \\times 13\\).\n\n   - For 46:\n     - 46 is even, so divide by 2: \\(46 \\div 2 = 23\\)\n     - 23 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 46 is \\(2^1 \\times 23\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**: For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - Prime number 2: The highest power is \\(2^2\\) (from 52).\n   - Prime number 13: The highest power is \\(13^1\\) (from 52).\n   - Prime number 23: The highest power is \\(23^1\\) (from 46).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^2 \\times 13^1 \\times 23^1\\)\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 13 = 52\\)\n     - \\(52 \\times 23 = 1196\\)\n\n5. **Verify**: Ensure that 1196 is divisible by both 52 and 46.\n   - \\(1196 \\div 52 = 23\\) (an integer, so divisible)\n   - \\(1196 \\div 46 = 26\\) (an integer, so divisible)\n\nThus, the LCM of 52 and 46 is 1196.\n\n<<<1196>>>"
