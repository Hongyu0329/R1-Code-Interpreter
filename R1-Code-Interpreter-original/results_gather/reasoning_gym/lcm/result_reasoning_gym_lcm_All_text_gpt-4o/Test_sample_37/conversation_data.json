    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 78 and 45, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 78:\n     - 78 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 78 \\div 2 = 39 \\)\n     - 39 is divisible by 3: \\( 39 \\div 3 = 13 \\)\n     - 13 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 78 is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 13 \\).\n\n   - For 45:\n     - 45 is divisible by 3: \\( 45 \\div 3 = 15 \\)\n     - 15 is divisible by 3: \\( 15 \\div 3 = 5 \\)\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 45 is \\( 3^2 \\times 5 \\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations: 2, 3, 5, 13.\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations:\n     - The highest power of 2 is \\( 2^1 \\) (from 78).\n     - The highest power of 3 is \\( 3^2 \\) (from 45).\n     - The highest power of 5 is \\( 5^1 \\) (from 45).\n     - The highest power of 13 is \\( 13^1 \\) (from 78).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM:\n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM} = 2^1 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 13^1\n   \\]\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\( 2^1 = 2 \\)\n     - \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n     - \\( 5^1 = 5 \\)\n     - \\( 13^1 = 13 \\)\n   - Multiply these together:\n     - \\( 2 \\times 9 = 18 \\)\n     - \\( 18 \\times 5 = 90 \\)\n     - \\( 90 \\times 13 = 1170 \\)\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 78 and 45 is 1170.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1170>>>."
