    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 81 and 32, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **81**: \n     - 81 is a power of 3. \n     - 81 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 3^4.\n   - **32**: \n     - 32 is a power of 2.\n     - 32 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2^5.\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - For LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2 and 3.\n   - The highest power of 2 is 2^5 (from 32).\n   - The highest power of 3 is 3^4 (from 81).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = 2^5 × 3^4.\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate 2^5: \n     - 2^5 = 32.\n   - Calculate 3^4:\n     - 3^4 = 81.\n   - Multiply these results:\n     - LCM = 32 × 81.\n\n6. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Perform the multiplication: \n     - 32 × 81 = 2592.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 81 and 32 is 2592.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2592>>>."
