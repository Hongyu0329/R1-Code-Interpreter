    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The Least Common Multiple of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 62: \n     - 62 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 62 ÷ 2 = 31\n     - 31 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 62 is \\(2^1 \\times 31^1\\).\n   - For 32:\n     - 32 is also an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 32 ÷ 2 = 16\n     - 16 ÷ 2 = 8\n     - 8 ÷ 2 = 4\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 32 is \\(2^5\\).\n\n3. **Determine the LCM Using Prime Factorization**:\n   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - From the factorizations:\n     - The prime number 2 appears in both factorizations. The highest power of 2 is \\(2^5\\).\n     - The prime number 31 appears only in the factorization of 62. The highest power of 31 is \\(31^1\\).\n   - Therefore, the LCM is \\(2^5 \\times 31^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^5\\): \n     - \\(2^5 = 32\\).\n   - Calculate \\(32 \\times 31\\):\n     - \\(32 \\times 31 = 992\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The Least Common Multiple of 62 and 32 is 992.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<992>>>"
