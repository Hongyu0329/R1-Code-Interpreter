    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 27 and 35, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **27**: \n     - 27 is divisible by 3. \n     - 27 รท 3 = 9\n     - 9 is also divisible by 3.\n     - 9 รท 3 = 3\n     - 3 is divisible by 3.\n     - 3 รท 3 = 1\n     - So, the prime factorization of 27 is \\(3^3\\).\n   - **35**:\n     - 35 is divisible by 5.\n     - 35 รท 5 = 7\n     - 7 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 35 is \\(5^1 \\times 7^1\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - From the prime factorizations, identify the highest power of each prime number present in either number.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 3, 5, and 7.\n   - The highest power of 3 is \\(3^3\\).\n   - The highest power of 5 is \\(5^1\\).\n   - The highest power of 7 is \\(7^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(3^3 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(3^3 = 27\\).\n   - Multiply 27 by 5: \\(27 \\times 5 = 135\\).\n   - Multiply 135 by 7: \\(135 \\times 7 = 945\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 27 and 35 is 945.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<945>>>"
