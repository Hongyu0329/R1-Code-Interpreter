    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 59 and 59, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: The LCM of two or more integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers.\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**: We are given the numbers 59 and 59. Since both numbers are the same, this simplifies the process.\n\n3. **Recognize the Property of LCM with Identical Numbers**: When you have two identical numbers, the LCM is simply that number itself. This is because the smallest number that both numbers divide into without a remainder is the number itself.\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: \n   - Since both numbers are 59, the LCM must be 59 because 59 is divisible by 59.\n   - There are no other numbers involved, so no further calculation is needed.\n\n5. **Conclude the Calculation**: The LCM of 59 and 59 is 59.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 59 and 59 is:\n\n<<<59>>>"
