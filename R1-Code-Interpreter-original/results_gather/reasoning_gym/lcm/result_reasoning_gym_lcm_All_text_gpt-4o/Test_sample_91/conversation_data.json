    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 35 and 14, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **35**: The prime factors of 35 are 5 and 7. So, 35 = 5 × 7.\n   - **14**: The prime factors of 14 are 2 and 7. So, 14 = 2 × 7.\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations.\n   - For 35 and 14, the prime numbers are 2, 5, and 7.\n   - Determine the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:\n     - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^1\\) (from 14).\n     - The highest power of 5 is \\(5^1\\) (from 35).\n     - The highest power of 7 is \\(7^1\\) (appears in both 35 and 14).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate the product: \n     - \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\)\n     - \\(10 \\times 7 = 70\\)\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 70 is divisible by both 35 and 14:\n     - 70 ÷ 35 = 2 (an integer, so divisible)\n     - 70 ÷ 14 = 5 (an integer, so divisible)\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 35 and 14 is 70.\n\nFinal answer: <<<70>>>"
