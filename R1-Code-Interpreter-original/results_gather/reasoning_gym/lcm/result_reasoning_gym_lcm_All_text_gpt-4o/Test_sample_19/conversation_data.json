    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 32 and 30, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - 32: The prime factorization of 32 is \\(2^5\\).\n   - 30: The prime factorization of 30 is \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - For LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - Prime number 2: The highest power is \\(2^5\\) (from 32).\n   - Prime number 3: The highest power is \\(3^1\\) (from 30).\n   - Prime number 5: The highest power is \\(5^1\\) (from 30).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^5 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^5 = 32\\).\n   - Multiply 32 by 3: \\(32 \\times 3 = 96\\).\n   - Multiply 96 by 5: \\(96 \\times 5 = 480\\).\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 480 is divisible by both 32 and 30.\n   - \\(480 \\div 32 = 15\\), which is an integer.\n   - \\(480 \\div 30 = 16\\), which is an integer.\n   - Since 480 is divisible by both numbers, it confirms that 480 is the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 32 and 30 is:\n\n<<<480>>>"
