    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 94: \n     - 94 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 94 รท 2 = 47\n     - 47 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 94 is \\(2 \\times 47\\).\n\n   - For 47:\n     - 47 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is simply 47.\n\n3. **Identify the Unique Prime Factors**: List all the prime factors from both numbers.\n   - The prime factors of 94 are 2 and 47.\n   - The prime factor of 47 is 47.\n\n4. **Determine the Highest Power of Each Prime Factor**: For each prime factor, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations.\n   - For the prime factor 2, the highest power is \\(2^1\\) (from 94).\n   - For the prime factor 47, the highest power is \\(47^1\\) (from both 94 and 47).\n\n5. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 47^1 = 2 \\times 47 = 94\\).\n\n6. **Verify**: Check that 94 is divisible by both original numbers.\n   - 94 รท 94 = 1 (divisible)\n   - 94 รท 47 = 2 (divisible)\n\nSince 94 is divisible by both 94 and 47, it confirms that 94 is indeed the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 94 and 47 is:\n\n<<<94>>>"
