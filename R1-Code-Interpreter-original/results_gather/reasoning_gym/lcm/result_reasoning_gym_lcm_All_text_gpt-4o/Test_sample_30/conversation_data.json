    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 40 and 86, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **40**: \n     - 40 is even, so divide by 2: 40 ÷ 2 = 20\n     - 20 is even, so divide by 2: 20 ÷ 2 = 10\n     - 10 is even, so divide by 2: 10 ÷ 2 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 40 is \\(2^3 \\times 5\\).\n   - **86**:\n     - 86 is even, so divide by 2: 86 ÷ 2 = 43\n     - 43 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 86 is \\(2 \\times 43\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - From the prime factorizations:\n     - The prime factors are 2, 5, and 43.\n     - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^3\\) (from 40).\n     - The highest power of 5 is \\(5^1\\) (from 40).\n     - The highest power of 43 is \\(43^1\\) (from 86).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor and multiplying them together.\n   - LCM = \\(2^3 \\times 5^1 \\times 43^1\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n   - Multiply 8 by 5: \\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\).\n   - Multiply 40 by 43: \\(40 \\times 43 = 1720\\).\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 1720 is divisible by both 40 and 86:\n     - 1720 ÷ 40 = 43 (an integer, so divisible).\n     - 1720 ÷ 86 = 20 (an integer, so divisible).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 40 and 86 is 1720.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1720>>>."
