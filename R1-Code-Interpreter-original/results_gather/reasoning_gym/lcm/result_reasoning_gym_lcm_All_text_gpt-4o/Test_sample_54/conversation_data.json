    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 99 and 9, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - **99**: \n     - 99 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 9 + 9 = 18, is divisible by 3).\n     - 99 ÷ 3 = 33\n     - 33 is also divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 3 + 3 = 6, is divisible by 3).\n     - 33 ÷ 3 = 11\n     - 11 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 99 is \\(3^2 \\times 11\\).\n\n   - **9**:\n     - 9 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 9, is divisible by 3).\n     - 9 ÷ 3 = 3\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 9 is \\(3^2\\).\n\n3. **Determine the LCM Using Prime Factorization**:\n   - For each prime factor, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations of both numbers.\n   - The prime factors involved are 3 and 11.\n   - For 3, the highest power is \\(3^2\\) (appears in both 99 and 9).\n   - For 11, the highest power is \\(11^1\\) (appears in 99).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime factors together:\n   - LCM = \\(3^2 \\times 11^1 = 9 \\times 11 = 99\\).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check that 99 is divisible by both 99 and 9:\n     - 99 ÷ 99 = 1 (divisible)\n     - 99 ÷ 9 = 11 (divisible)\n\nThus, the Least Common Multiple of 99 and 9 is 99.\n\nFinal answer: <<<99>>>."
