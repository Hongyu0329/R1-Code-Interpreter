    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n\n3. **Prime Factorization of 57**:\n   - 57 is not an even number, so it is not divisible by 2.\n   - The sum of the digits of 57 is 5 + 7 = 12, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 57 is divisible by 3.\n   - Dividing 57 by 3 gives 19, which is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 57 is \\(3 \\times 19\\).\n\n4. **Prime Factorization of 38**:\n   - 38 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n   - Dividing 38 by 2 gives 19, which is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 38 is \\(2 \\times 19\\).\n\n5. **Determine the LCM**:\n   - To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, and 19.\n   - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^1\\).\n   - The highest power of 3 is \\(3^1\\).\n   - The highest power of 19 is \\(19^1\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply these highest powers together: \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 19^1 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 19\\).\n   - Calculate the product: \n     - \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\)\n     - \\(6 \\times 19 = 114\\)\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 57 and 38 is 114.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<114>>>"
