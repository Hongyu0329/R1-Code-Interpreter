    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 4 and 50, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 4: \n     - 4 is 2 × 2, or \\(2^2\\).\n   - For 50:\n     - 50 is 2 × 25, and 25 is 5 × 5, so 50 is 2 × \\(5^2\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - We need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2 and 5.\n   - For 2: The highest power is \\(2^2\\) (from 4).\n   - For 5: The highest power is \\(5^2\\) (from 50).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n   - Calculate \\(5^2 = 25\\).\n   - Multiply these results: 4 × 25 = 100.\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 100 is divisible by both 4 and 50.\n   - 100 ÷ 4 = 25, which is an integer.\n   - 100 ÷ 50 = 2, which is an integer.\n   - Since 100 is divisible by both numbers, it confirms that 100 is the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 4 and 50 is 100.\n\nFinal answer: <<<100>>>."
