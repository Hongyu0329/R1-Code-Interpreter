    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 50: \n     - 50 is divisible by 2 (the smallest prime number), so 50 ÷ 2 = 25.\n     - 25 is divisible by 5, so 25 ÷ 5 = 5.\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 50 is \\(2^1 \\times 5^2\\).\n\n   - For 38:\n     - 38 is divisible by 2, so 38 ÷ 2 = 19.\n     - 19 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 38 is \\(2^1 \\times 19^1\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**: For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 5, and 19.\n   - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^1\\).\n   - The highest power of 5 is \\(5^2\\).\n   - The highest power of 19 is \\(19^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 5^2 \\times 19^1\\).\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(5^2 = 25\\).\n     - \\(2 \\times 25 = 50\\).\n     - \\(50 \\times 19 = 950\\).\n\n5. **Verify**: Ensure that 950 is divisible by both 50 and 38.\n   - 950 ÷ 50 = 19 (an integer, so divisible).\n   - 950 ÷ 38 = 25 (an integer, so divisible).\n\nThus, the LCM of 50 and 38 is 950.\n\n<<<950>>>"
