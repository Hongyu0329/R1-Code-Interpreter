    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 38: \n     - 38 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 38 รท 2 = 19, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 38 is \\(2 \\times 19\\).\n\n   - For 90:\n     - 90 is also an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 90 รท 2 = 45.\n     - 45 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 4 + 5 = 9, is divisible by 3).\n     - 45 รท 3 = 15.\n     - 15 is also divisible by 3.\n     - 15 รท 3 = 5, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 90 is \\(2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**: For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The primes we have are 2, 3, 5, and 19.\n   - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^1\\) (appears in both factorizations).\n   - The highest power of 3 is \\(3^2\\) (appears in the factorization of 90).\n   - The highest power of 5 is \\(5^1\\) (appears in the factorization of 90).\n   - The highest power of 19 is \\(19^1\\) (appears in the factorization of 38).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 19^1\\)\n   - LCM = \\(2 \\times 9 \\times 5 \\times 19\\)\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, calculate \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\).\n   - Then, calculate \\(18 \\times 5 = 90\\).\n   - Finally, calculate \\(90 \\times 19\\).\n     - \\(90 \\times 19 = 1710\\).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 38 and 90 is 1710.\n\n<<<1710>>>"
