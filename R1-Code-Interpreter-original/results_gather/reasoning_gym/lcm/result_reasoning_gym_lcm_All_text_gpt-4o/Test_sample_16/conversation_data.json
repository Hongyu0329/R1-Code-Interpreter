    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 65 and 25, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **65**: \n     - 65 is divisible by 5 (since it ends in 5).\n     - 65 รท 5 = 13\n     - 13 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 65 is \\(5 \\times 13\\).\n   - **25**:\n     - 25 is a perfect square of 5.\n     - 25 = \\(5 \\times 5\\) or \\(5^2\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - We need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 5 and 13.\n   - For 5, the highest power is \\(5^2\\) (from 25).\n   - For 13, the highest power is \\(13^1\\) (from 65).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together.\n   - LCM = \\(5^2 \\times 13^1\\).\n   - Calculate \\(5^2 = 25\\).\n   - Calculate \\(25 \\times 13\\):\n     - \\(25 \\times 13 = 325\\).\n\n5. **Verify the LCM**:\n   - Check that 325 is divisible by both 65 and 25.\n   - 325 รท 65 = 5 (exact division, no remainder).\n   - 325 รท 25 = 13 (exact division, no remainder).\n   - Since 325 is divisible by both numbers, it confirms that 325 is indeed the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 65 and 25 is:\n\n<<<325>>>"
