    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 45 and 90, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **45**: \n     - 45 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 4 + 5 = 9, is divisible by 3).\n     - 45 ÷ 3 = 15\n     - 15 is also divisible by 3.\n     - 15 ÷ 3 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 45 is \\(3^2 \\times 5\\).\n   - **90**:\n     - 90 is divisible by 2 (since it is an even number).\n     - 90 ÷ 2 = 45\n     - We already know the prime factorization of 45 from above.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 90 is \\(2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\).\n\n3. **Determine the LCM Using Prime Factorization**:\n   - To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - From the factorizations:\n     - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, and 5.\n     - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^1\\).\n     - The highest power of 3 is \\(3^2\\).\n     - The highest power of 5 is \\(5^1\\).\n   - Therefore, the LCM is \\(2^1 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Calculate the product: \n     - \\(2^1 = 2\\)\n     - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n     - \\(5^1 = 5\\)\n   - Multiply these together: \n     - \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\)\n     - \\(18 \\times 5 = 90\\)\n\n5. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 90 is divisible by both 45 and 90:\n     - 90 ÷ 45 = 2 (an integer, so 90 is divisible by 45)\n     - 90 ÷ 90 = 1 (an integer, so 90 is divisible by 90)\n\nThus, the Least Common Multiple of 45 and 90 is 90.\n\nFinal answer: <<<90>>>"
