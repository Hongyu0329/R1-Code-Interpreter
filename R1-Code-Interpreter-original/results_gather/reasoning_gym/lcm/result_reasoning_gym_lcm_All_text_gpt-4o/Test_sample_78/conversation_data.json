    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**: Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 62: \n     - 62 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 62 ÷ 2 = 31\n     - 31 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 62 is \\(2 \\times 31\\).\n\n   - For 92:\n     - 92 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 92 ÷ 2 = 46\n     - 46 is also an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 46 ÷ 2 = 23\n     - 23 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 92 is \\(2^2 \\times 23\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**: For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 23, and 31.\n   - The highest power of 2 in the factorizations is \\(2^2\\) (from 92).\n   - The highest power of 23 is \\(23^1\\) (from 92).\n   - The highest power of 31 is \\(31^1\\) (from 62).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^2 \\times 23^1 \\times 31^1\\)\n   - LCM = 4 × 23 × 31\n\n4. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, calculate 4 × 23 = 92.\n   - Then, calculate 92 × 31.\n     - 92 × 31 = 2852.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 62 and 92 is 2852.\n\n<<<2852>>>"
