    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 33 and 73, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - 33: The prime factors of 33 are 3 and 11 (since 33 = 3 Ã— 11).\n   - 73: 73 is a prime number, so its only prime factor is 73 itself.\n\n3. **Identify the Unique Prime Factors**:\n   - The unique prime factors from both numbers are 3, 11, and 73.\n\n4. **Determine the Highest Power of Each Prime Factor**:\n   - For 3: The highest power is \\(3^1\\) (from 33).\n   - For 11: The highest power is \\(11^1\\) (from 33).\n   - For 73: The highest power is \\(73^1\\) (from 73).\n\n5. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by multiplying the highest powers of all prime factors together.\n   - LCM = \\(3^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 73^1\\).\n\n6. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, calculate \\(3 \\times 11 = 33\\).\n   - Then, calculate \\(33 \\times 73\\).\n   - To multiply 33 by 73, you can use the standard multiplication method:\n     - \\(33 \\times 73 = 33 \\times (70 + 3) = 33 \\times 70 + 33 \\times 3\\).\n     - \\(33 \\times 70 = 2310\\).\n     - \\(33 \\times 3 = 99\\).\n     - Add the results: \\(2310 + 99 = 2409\\).\n\n7. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 2409 is divisible by both 33 and 73:\n     - \\(2409 \\div 33 = 73\\), which is an integer.\n     - \\(2409 \\div 73 = 33\\), which is also an integer.\n   - Since 2409 is divisible by both numbers, it confirms that 2409 is indeed the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 33 and 73 is:\n\n<<<2409>>>"
