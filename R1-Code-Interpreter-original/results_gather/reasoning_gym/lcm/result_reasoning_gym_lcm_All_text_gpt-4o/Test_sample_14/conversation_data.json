    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 52 and 6, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **52**: \n     - 52 is even, so divide by 2: \\(52 \\div 2 = 26\\).\n     - 26 is even, so divide by 2 again: \\(26 \\div 2 = 13\\).\n     - 13 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 52 is \\(2^2 \\times 13\\).\n   - **6**:\n     - 6 is even, so divide by 2: \\(6 \\div 2 = 3\\).\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 6 is \\(2^1 \\times 3\\).\n\n3. **Determine the LCM Using Prime Factorization**:\n   - To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, and 13.\n   - For 2, the highest power is \\(2^2\\) (from 52).\n   - For 3, the highest power is \\(3^1\\) (from 6).\n   - For 13, the highest power is \\(13^1\\) (from 52).\n   - Therefore, the LCM is \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 13^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n   - Calculate \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n   - Calculate \\(12 \\times 13 = 156\\).\n\n5. **Verify the LCM**:\n   - Check that 156 is divisible by both 52 and 6.\n   - \\(156 \\div 52 = 3\\), which is an integer.\n   - \\(156 \\div 6 = 26\\), which is an integer.\n   - Since 156 is divisible by both numbers, it confirms that 156 is the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 52 and 6 is 156.\n\n<<<156>>>"
