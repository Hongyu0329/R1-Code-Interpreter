    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 3 and 96, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 3, the prime factorization is simply 3 (since 3 is a prime number).\n   - For 96, we can break it down as follows:\n     - 96 is even, so divide by 2: 96 ÷ 2 = 48\n     - 48 is even, so divide by 2: 48 ÷ 2 = 24\n     - 24 is even, so divide by 2: 24 ÷ 2 = 12\n     - 12 is even, so divide by 2: 12 ÷ 2 = 6\n     - 6 is even, so divide by 2: 6 ÷ 2 = 3\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 × 3.\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - From the factorizations:\n     - The prime factors are 2 and 3.\n     - The highest power of 2 present is 2^5 (from 96).\n     - The highest power of 3 present is 3^1 (from both 3 and 96).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor from the factorizations.\n   - LCM = 2^5 × 3^1 = 32 × 3 = 96.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check that 96 is divisible by both 3 and 96:\n     - 96 ÷ 3 = 32, which is an integer.\n     - 96 ÷ 96 = 1, which is an integer.\n   - Therefore, 96 is indeed the smallest number that both 3 and 96 divide into without leaving a remainder.\n\nThe Least Common Multiple of 3 and 96 is 96.\n\n<<<96>>>"
