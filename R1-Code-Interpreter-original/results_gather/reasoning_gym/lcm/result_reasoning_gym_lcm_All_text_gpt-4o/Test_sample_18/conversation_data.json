    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The Least Common Multiple of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **11**: Since 11 is a prime number, its prime factorization is simply 11.\n   - **69**: We need to find the prime factors of 69.\n     - 69 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 6 + 9 = 15, is divisible by 3).\n     - Dividing 69 by 3 gives 23, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 69 is \\(3 \\times 23\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - We need to consider all prime numbers that appear in the factorizations of both numbers and take the highest power of each.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 3, 11, and 23.\n   - For 11, the highest power is \\(11^1\\).\n   - For 69, the highest powers are \\(3^1\\) and \\(23^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by multiplying the highest powers of all prime numbers involved.\n   - LCM = \\(3^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 23^1\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, calculate \\(3 \\times 11 = 33\\).\n   - Then, calculate \\(33 \\times 23\\).\n     - \\(33 \\times 23 = 759\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The Least Common Multiple of 11 and 69 is 759.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<759>>>"
