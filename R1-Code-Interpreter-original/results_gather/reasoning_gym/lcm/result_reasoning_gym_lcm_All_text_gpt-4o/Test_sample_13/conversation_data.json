    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 54 and 63, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 54:\n     - 54 is even, so divide by 2: \\(54 \\div 2 = 27\\)\n     - 27 is divisible by 3: \\(27 \\div 3 = 9\\)\n     - 9 is divisible by 3: \\(9 \\div 3 = 3\\)\n     - 3 is divisible by 3: \\(3 \\div 3 = 1\\)\n     - So, the prime factorization of 54 is \\(2^1 \\times 3^3\\).\n\n   - For 63:\n     - 63 is divisible by 3: \\(63 \\div 3 = 21\\)\n     - 21 is divisible by 3: \\(21 \\div 3 = 7\\)\n     - 7 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 63 is \\(3^2 \\times 7^1\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - We need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, and 7.\n   - For 2: The highest power is \\(2^1\\) (from 54).\n   - For 3: The highest power is \\(3^3\\) (from 54).\n   - For 7: The highest power is \\(7^1\\) (from 63).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together:\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 3^3 \\times 7^1\\).\n\n4. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(3^3 = 27\\).\n   - Multiply: \\(2 \\times 27 = 54\\).\n   - Multiply: \\(54 \\times 7 = 378\\).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 54 and 63 is 378.\n\n<<<378>>>"
