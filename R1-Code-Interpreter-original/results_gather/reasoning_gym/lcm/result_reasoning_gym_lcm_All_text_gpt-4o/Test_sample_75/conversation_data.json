    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 80:\n     - 80 is even, divide by 2: 80 ÷ 2 = 40\n     - 40 is even, divide by 2: 40 ÷ 2 = 20\n     - 20 is even, divide by 2: 20 ÷ 2 = 10\n     - 10 is even, divide by 2: 10 ÷ 2 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factorization of 80: \\(2^4 \\times 5^1\\)\n\n   - For 75:\n     - 75 is odd, divide by 3: 75 ÷ 3 = 25\n     - 25 is not divisible by 3, divide by 5: 25 ÷ 5 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factorization of 75: \\(3^1 \\times 5^2\\)\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**: For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - Prime number 2: Highest power is \\(2^4\\) (from 80)\n   - Prime number 3: Highest power is \\(3^1\\) (from 75)\n   - Prime number 5: Highest power is \\(5^2\\) (from 75)\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2\\)\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(2^4 = 16\\)\n     - \\(3^1 = 3\\)\n     - \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n     - Multiply these together: \\(16 \\times 3 \\times 25\\)\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, multiply 16 and 3: \\(16 \\times 3 = 48\\)\n   - Then, multiply the result by 25: \\(48 \\times 25 = 1200\\)\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The LCM of 80 and 75 is 1200.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1200>>>"
