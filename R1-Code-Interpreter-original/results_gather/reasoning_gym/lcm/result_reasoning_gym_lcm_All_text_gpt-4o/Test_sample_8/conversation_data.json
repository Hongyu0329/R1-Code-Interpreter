    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 17 and 98, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **17**: Since 17 is a prime number, its prime factorization is simply 17 itself.\n   - **98**: We need to factorize 98.\n     - 98 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 98 \\div 2 = 49 \\).\n     - 49 is not divisible by 2, but it is \\( 7 \\times 7 \\) (since 7 is a prime number).\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 98 is \\( 2 \\times 7^2 \\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - From the prime factorizations:\n     - For 17: \\( 17^1 \\).\n     - For 98: \\( 2^1 \\times 7^2 \\).\n   - The LCM will include the highest power of each prime number present in the factorizations.\n   - The primes involved are 2, 7, and 17.\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes:\n     - \\( 2^1 \\) (from 98),\n     - \\( 7^2 \\) (from 98),\n     - \\( 17^1 \\) (from 17).\n   - Therefore, the LCM is \\( 2^1 \\times 7^2 \\times 17^1 \\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\( 7^2 = 49 \\).\n   - Multiply the results: \n     - \\( 2 \\times 49 = 98 \\).\n     - \\( 98 \\times 17 = 1666 \\).\n\n6. **Verify**:\n   - Check that 1666 is divisible by both 17 and 98:\n     - \\( 1666 \\div 17 = 98 \\) (exact division).\n     - \\( 1666 \\div 98 = 17 \\) (exact division).\n\nThus, the Least Common Multiple of 17 and 98 is 1666.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1666>>>."
