    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 32 and 35, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - Find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - 32: The prime factorization of 32 is \\(2^5\\) because 32 can be divided by 2 five times (32 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1).\n   - 35: The prime factorization of 35 is \\(5^1 \\times 7^1\\) because 35 can be divided by 5 once (35 → 7) and 7 is a prime number.\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations: 2, 5, and 7.\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations.\n   - For 2, the highest power is \\(2^5\\) (from 32).\n   - For 5, the highest power is \\(5^1\\) (from 35).\n   - For 7, the highest power is \\(7^1\\) (from 35).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^5 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^5 = 32\\).\n   - Multiply 32 by 5: \\(32 \\times 5 = 160\\).\n   - Multiply 160 by 7: \\(160 \\times 7 = 1120\\).\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 1120 is divisible by both 32 and 35.\n   - 1120 ÷ 32 = 35, which is an integer.\n   - 1120 ÷ 35 = 32, which is an integer.\n\nSince 1120 is divisible by both 32 and 35, it is indeed the LCM.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1120>>>."
