    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 30 and 32, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **30**: The prime factorization of 30 is \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5\\).\n   - **32**: The prime factorization of 32 is \\(2^5\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - For LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, and 5.\n   - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^5\\) (from 32).\n   - The highest power of 3 is \\(3^1\\) (from 30).\n   - The highest power of 5 is \\(5^1\\) (from 30).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together:\n   \\[\n   LCM = 2^5 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\n   \\]\n   - Calculate each part:\n     - \\(2^5 = 32\\)\n     - \\(3^1 = 3\\)\n     - \\(5^1 = 5\\)\n   - Multiply these results together:\n     - \\(32 \\times 3 = 96\\)\n     - \\(96 \\times 5 = 480\\)\n\n5. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 480 is divisible by both 30 and 32:\n     - \\(480 \\div 30 = 16\\) (an integer, so divisible)\n     - \\(480 \\div 32 = 15\\) (an integer, so divisible)\n\nThus, the Least Common Multiple of 30 and 32 is 480.\n\nFinal answer: <<<480>>>"
