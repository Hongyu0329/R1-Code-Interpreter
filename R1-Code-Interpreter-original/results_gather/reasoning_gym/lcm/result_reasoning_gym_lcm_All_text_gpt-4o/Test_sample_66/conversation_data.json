    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 74 and 6, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **74**: \n     - 74 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 74 ÷ 2 = 37\n     - 37 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 74 is \\(2 \\times 37\\).\n   - **6**:\n     - 6 is also an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 6 is \\(2 \\times 3\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations: 2, 3, 37.\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations.\n   - **2**: The highest power is \\(2^1\\) (appears in both 74 and 6).\n   - **3**: The highest power is \\(3^1\\) (appears in 6).\n   - **37**: The highest power is \\(37^1\\) (appears in 74).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together:\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 37^1\\)\n   - LCM = 2 × 3 × 37\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, multiply 2 and 3:\n     - 2 × 3 = 6\n   - Then, multiply the result by 37:\n     - 6 × 37 = 222\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 74 and 6 is 222.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<222>>>"
