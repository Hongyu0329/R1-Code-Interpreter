    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 80 and 75, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **80**: \n     - 80 is even, so divide by 2: 80 ÷ 2 = 40\n     - 40 is even, so divide by 2: 40 ÷ 2 = 20\n     - 20 is even, so divide by 2: 20 ÷ 2 = 10\n     - 10 is even, so divide by 2: 10 ÷ 2 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 80 is \\(2^4 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n   - **75**:\n     - 75 is not even, so divide by 3: 75 ÷ 3 = 25\n     - 25 is not divisible by 3, so divide by 5: 25 ÷ 5 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 75 is \\(3^1 \\times 5^2\\).\n\n3. **Determine the LCM Using Prime Factorization**:\n   - To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - From 80: \\(2^4\\), \\(5^1\\)\n   - From 75: \\(3^1\\), \\(5^2\\)\n   - LCM will be \\(2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Calculate each part:\n     - \\(2^4 = 16\\)\n     - \\(3^1 = 3\\)\n     - \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n   - Multiply these together: \\(16 \\times 3 \\times 25\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, multiply 16 and 3: \\(16 \\times 3 = 48\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by 25: \\(48 \\times 25\\).\n   - To simplify, break it down:\n     - \\(48 \\times 25 = (50 - 2) \\times 25 = 50 \\times 25 - 2 \\times 25\\).\n     - \\(50 \\times 25 = 1250\\).\n     - \\(2 \\times 25 = 50\\).\n     - Subtract: \\(1250 - 50 = 1200\\).\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The LCM of 80 and 75 is 1200.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1200>>>"
