    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 86: \n     - 86 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 86 ÷ 2 = 43\n     - 43 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 86 is \\(2 \\times 43\\).\n\n   - For 32:\n     - 32 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 32 ÷ 2 = 16\n     - 16 is also even, so divide by 2 again.\n     - 16 ÷ 2 = 8\n     - 8 ÷ 2 = 4\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 32 is \\(2^5\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**: For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2 and 43.\n   - The highest power of 2 in the factorizations is \\(2^5\\) (from 32).\n   - The highest power of 43 is \\(43^1\\) (from 86).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^5 \\times 43^1\\)\n   - Calculate \\(2^5 = 32\\)\n   - Multiply 32 by 43:\n     - 32 × 43 = 1376\n\n5. **Verify**: Ensure that 1376 is divisible by both 86 and 32.\n   - 1376 ÷ 86 = 16 (an integer, so divisible)\n   - 1376 ÷ 32 = 43 (an integer, so divisible)\n\nThus, the LCM of 86 and 32 is 1376.\n\n<<<1376>>>"
