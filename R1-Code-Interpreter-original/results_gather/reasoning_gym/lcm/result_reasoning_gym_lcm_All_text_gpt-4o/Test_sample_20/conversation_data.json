    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 18 and 21, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 18: \n     - 18 is divisible by 2 (the smallest prime number), so 18 รท 2 = 9.\n     - 9 is divisible by 3, so 9 รท 3 = 3.\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 18 is \\(2^1 \\times 3^2\\).\n   - For 21:\n     - 21 is not divisible by 2, so we try the next smallest prime number, which is 3.\n     - 21 รท 3 = 7.\n     - 7 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 21 is \\(3^1 \\times 7^1\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - We need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, and 7.\n   - For 2: The highest power is \\(2^1\\) (from 18).\n   - For 3: The highest power is \\(3^2\\) (from 18).\n   - For 7: The highest power is \\(7^1\\) (from 21).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1\\).\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(2^1 = 2\\).\n     - \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n     - \\(7^1 = 7\\).\n     - Multiply these together: \\(2 \\times 9 \\times 7\\).\n     - \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\).\n     - \\(18 \\times 7 = 126\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 18 and 21 is 126.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<126>>>"
