    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 26: \n     - 26 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 26 ÷ 2 = 13, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 26 is \\(2 \\times 13\\).\n\n   - For 100:\n     - 100 is also an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 100 ÷ 2 = 50, which is still even, so divide by 2 again.\n     - 50 ÷ 2 = 25, which is divisible by 5.\n     - 25 ÷ 5 = 5, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 100 is \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**: To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 5, and 13.\n   - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^2\\) (from 100).\n   - The highest power of 5 is \\(5^2\\) (from 100).\n   - The highest power of 13 is \\(13^1\\) (from 26).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 13\\)\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n     - \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 25 = 100\\)\n     - \\(100 \\times 13 = 1300\\)\n\n5. **Verify**: Ensure that 1300 is divisible by both 26 and 100.\n   - 1300 ÷ 26 = 50, which is an integer.\n   - 1300 ÷ 100 = 13, which is an integer.\n\nSince 1300 is divisible by both 26 and 100, it is indeed the LCM.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1300>>>."
