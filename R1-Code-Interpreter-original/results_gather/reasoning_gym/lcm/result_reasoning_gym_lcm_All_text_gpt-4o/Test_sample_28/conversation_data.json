    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 37 and 74, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - 37 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is \\(37^1\\).\n   - 74 can be divided by 2 (since it's even), giving us \\(74 = 2 \\times 37\\). Therefore, the prime factorization of 74 is \\(2^1 \\times 37^1\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - From the prime factorizations, we identify the highest power of each prime number present in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2 and 37.\n   - For 2, the highest power is \\(2^1\\) (from 74).\n   - For 37, the highest power is \\(37^1\\) (from both 37 and 74).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by multiplying the highest powers of all prime numbers involved.\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 37^1 = 2 \\times 37 = 74\\).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check that 74 is divisible by both 37 and 74.\n   - 74 divided by 37 equals 2, which is an integer.\n   - 74 divided by 74 equals 1, which is an integer.\n   - Therefore, 74 is indeed the smallest number that both 37 and 74 divide into without leaving a remainder.\n\nThus, the Least Common Multiple of 37 and 74 is 74.\n\nFinal answer: <<<74>>>."
