    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the prime factorization method. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of Each Number:**\n   - **48:** \n     - 48 is even, divide by 2: 48 ÷ 2 = 24\n     - 24 is even, divide by 2: 24 ÷ 2 = 12\n     - 12 is even, divide by 2: 12 ÷ 2 = 6\n     - 6 is even, divide by 2: 6 ÷ 2 = 3\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factorization of 48: \\(2^4 \\times 3^1\\)\n\n   - **76:**\n     - 76 is even, divide by 2: 76 ÷ 2 = 38\n     - 38 is even, divide by 2: 38 ÷ 2 = 19\n     - 19 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factorization of 76: \\(2^2 \\times 19^1\\)\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime:**\n   - For the prime number 2, the highest power is \\(2^4\\) (from 48).\n   - For the prime number 3, the highest power is \\(3^1\\) (from 48).\n   - For the prime number 19, the highest power is \\(19^1\\) (from 76).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM:**\n   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - LCM = \\(2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 19^1\\)\n\n4. **Perform the Multiplication:**\n   - Calculate \\(2^4 = 16\\)\n   - Multiply 16 by 3: \\(16 \\times 3 = 48\\)\n   - Multiply 48 by 19: \\(48 \\times 19 = 912\\)\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 48 and 76 is 912.\n\nFinal answer: <<<912>>>"
