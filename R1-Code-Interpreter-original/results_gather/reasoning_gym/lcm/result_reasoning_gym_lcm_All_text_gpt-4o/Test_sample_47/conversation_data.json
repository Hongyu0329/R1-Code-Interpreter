    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 57 and 45, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **57**: \n     - 57 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 5 + 7 = 12, is divisible by 3).\n     - 57 รท 3 = 19, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 57 is \\(3^1 \\times 19^1\\).\n   - **45**:\n     - 45 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 4 + 5 = 9, is divisible by 3).\n     - 45 รท 3 = 15, which is also divisible by 3.\n     - 15 รท 3 = 5, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 45 is \\(3^2 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n3. **Determine the LCM Using Prime Factorization**:\n   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - From the factorizations:\n     - The prime numbers are 3, 5, and 19.\n     - The highest power of 3 is \\(3^2\\) (from 45).\n     - The highest power of 5 is \\(5^1\\) (from 45).\n     - The highest power of 19 is \\(19^1\\) (from 57).\n   - Therefore, the LCM is \\(3^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 19^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Calculate each part:\n     - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n     - \\(5^1 = 5\\)\n     - \\(19^1 = 19\\)\n   - Multiply these together:\n     - \\(9 \\times 5 = 45\\)\n     - \\(45 \\times 19 = 855\\)\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 57 and 45 is 855.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<855>>>"
