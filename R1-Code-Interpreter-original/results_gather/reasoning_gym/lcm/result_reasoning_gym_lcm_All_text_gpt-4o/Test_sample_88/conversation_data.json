    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - 29 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is \\(29^1\\).\n   - 33 can be factored into prime numbers as \\(3^1 \\times 11^1\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - For the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 29, 3, and 11.\n   - The highest power of 29 is \\(29^1\\).\n   - The highest power of 3 is \\(3^1\\).\n   - The highest power of 11 is \\(11^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(29^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 11^1\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, calculate \\(3 \\times 11 = 33\\).\n   - Then, calculate \\(29 \\times 33\\).\n   - \\(29 \\times 33 = 957\\).\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 957 is divisible by both 29 and 33.\n   - \\(957 \\div 29 = 33\\), which is an integer.\n   - \\(957 \\div 33 = 29\\), which is also an integer.\n   - Since 957 is divisible by both numbers, it confirms that 957 is indeed the LCM.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the LCM of 29 and 33.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<957>>>."
