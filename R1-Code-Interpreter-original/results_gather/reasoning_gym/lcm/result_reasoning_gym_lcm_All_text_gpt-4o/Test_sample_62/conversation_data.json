    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 16 and 36, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 16: \n     - 16 is an even number, so divide by 2: 16 ÷ 2 = 8\n     - 8 is also even, divide by 2: 8 ÷ 2 = 4\n     - 4 is even, divide by 2: 4 ÷ 2 = 2\n     - 2 is even, divide by 2: 2 ÷ 2 = 1\n     - So, the prime factorization of 16 is \\(2^4\\).\n\n   - For 36:\n     - 36 is even, divide by 2: 36 ÷ 2 = 18\n     - 18 is even, divide by 2: 18 ÷ 2 = 9\n     - 9 is not even, divide by 3: 9 ÷ 3 = 3\n     - 3 is a prime number, divide by 3: 3 ÷ 3 = 1\n     - So, the prime factorization of 36 is \\(2^2 \\times 3^2\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - We need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - For the prime number 2, the highest power is \\(2^4\\) (from 16).\n   - For the prime number 3, the highest power is \\(3^2\\) (from 36).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by multiplying these highest powers together.\n   - LCM = \\(2^4 \\times 3^2\\).\n\n4. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^4\\): \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n   - Calculate \\(3^2\\): \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n   - Multiply these results: \\(16 \\times 9 = 144\\).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 16 and 36 is 144.\n\n<<<144>>>"
