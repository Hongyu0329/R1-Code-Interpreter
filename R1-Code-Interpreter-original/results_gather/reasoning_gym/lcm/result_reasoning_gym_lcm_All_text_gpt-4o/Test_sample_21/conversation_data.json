    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - The LCM can be found using the prime factorization method, where we find the prime factors of each number and take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations.\n\n3. **Prime Factorization of 94**:\n   - 94 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n   - Divide 94 by 2: \\( 94 \\div 2 = 47 \\).\n   - 47 is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 94 is \\( 2^1 \\times 47^1 \\).\n\n4. **Prime Factorization of 59**:\n   - 59 is a prime number, meaning it is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 59 is \\( 59^1 \\).\n\n5. **Determine the LCM**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations: 2, 47, and 59.\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations:\n     - For 2, the highest power is \\( 2^1 \\).\n     - For 47, the highest power is \\( 47^1 \\).\n     - For 59, the highest power is \\( 59^1 \\).\n   - Multiply these together to find the LCM:\n     \\[\n     \\text{LCM} = 2^1 \\times 47^1 \\times 59^1 = 2 \\times 47 \\times 59\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the Product**:\n   - First, calculate \\( 2 \\times 47 = 94 \\).\n   - Then, calculate \\( 94 \\times 59 \\).\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     94 \\times 59 = 5546\n     \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 94 and 59 is 5546.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5546>>>"
