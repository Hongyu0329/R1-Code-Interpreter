    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 60: \n     - 60 is even, so divide by 2: 60 รท 2 = 30\n     - 30 is even, so divide by 2: 30 รท 2 = 15\n     - 15 is divisible by 3: 15 รท 3 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 60 is \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n   - For 59:\n     - 59 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is \\(59^1\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - We need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, 5, and 59.\n   - From 60: \\(2^2, 3^1, 5^1\\)\n   - From 59: \\(59^1\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by multiplying the highest powers of all prime numbers involved.\n   - LCM = \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 59^1\\)\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, calculate \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n   - Then, multiply 4 by 3: \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n   - Next, multiply 12 by 5: \\(12 \\times 5 = 60\\).\n   - Finally, multiply 60 by 59: \\(60 \\times 59 = 3540\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 60 and 59 is 3540.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3540>>>"
