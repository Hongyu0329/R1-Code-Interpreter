    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 51 and 54, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **51**: \n     - 51 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 5 + 1 = 6, is divisible by 3).\n     - 51 รท 3 = 17, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 51 is \\(3^1 \\times 17^1\\).\n   - **54**:\n     - 54 is divisible by 2 (since it is an even number).\n     - 54 รท 2 = 27.\n     - 27 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 2 + 7 = 9, is divisible by 3).\n     - 27 รท 3 = 9.\n     - 9 is divisible by 3.\n     - 9 รท 3 = 3.\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 54 is \\(2^1 \\times 3^3\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - We need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, and 17.\n   - For 2: The highest power is \\(2^1\\) (from 54).\n   - For 3: The highest power is \\(3^3\\) (from 54).\n   - For 17: The highest power is \\(17^1\\) (from 51).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by multiplying these highest powers together:\n   \\[\n   LCM = 2^1 \\times 3^3 \\times 17^1\n   \\]\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(3^3 = 27\\)\n     - \\(2^1 \\times 27 = 2 \\times 27 = 54\\)\n     - \\(54 \\times 17 = 918\\)\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 51 and 54 is 918.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<918>>>."
