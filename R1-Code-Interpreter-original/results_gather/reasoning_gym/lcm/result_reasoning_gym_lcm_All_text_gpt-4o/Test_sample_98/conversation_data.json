    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 35 and 95, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **35**: \n     - 35 is divisible by 5 (since it ends in 5).\n     - 35 รท 5 = 7, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 35 is \\(5 \\times 7\\).\n   - **95**:\n     - 95 is divisible by 5 (since it ends in 5).\n     - 95 รท 5 = 19, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 95 is \\(5 \\times 19\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations.\n   - For 35: \\(5^1 \\times 7^1\\)\n   - For 95: \\(5^1 \\times 19^1\\)\n   - The primes involved are 5, 7, and 19.\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations.\n   - \\(5^1\\) (appears in both, highest power is 1)\n   - \\(7^1\\) (appears in 35)\n   - \\(19^1\\) (appears in 95)\n   - Multiply these together to get the LCM:\n     - LCM = \\(5^1 \\times 7^1 \\times 19^1 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 19\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(5 \\times 7 = 35\\).\n   - Then, calculate \\(35 \\times 19\\).\n   - \\(35 \\times 19 = 665\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 35 and 95 is 665.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<665>>>"
