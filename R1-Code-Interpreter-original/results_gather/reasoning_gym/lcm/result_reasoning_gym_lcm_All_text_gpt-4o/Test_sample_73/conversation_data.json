    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 40 and 68, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 40:\n     - 40 is even, so divide by 2: 40 ÷ 2 = 20\n     - 20 is even, so divide by 2: 20 ÷ 2 = 10\n     - 10 is even, so divide by 2: 10 ÷ 2 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 40 is \\(2^3 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n   - For 68:\n     - 68 is even, so divide by 2: 68 ÷ 2 = 34\n     - 34 is even, so divide by 2: 34 ÷ 2 = 17\n     - 17 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 68 is \\(2^2 \\times 17^1\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers found in the factorizations: 2, 5, and 17.\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations:\n     - For 2, the highest power is \\(2^3\\) (from 40).\n     - For 5, the highest power is \\(5^1\\) (from 40).\n     - For 17, the highest power is \\(17^1\\) (from 68).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together:\n   - LCM = \\(2^3 \\times 5^1 \\times 17^1\\).\n\n4. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n   - Multiply 8 by 5: \\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\).\n   - Multiply 40 by 17: \\(40 \\times 17 = 680\\).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 40 and 68 is 680.\n\n<<<680>>>"
