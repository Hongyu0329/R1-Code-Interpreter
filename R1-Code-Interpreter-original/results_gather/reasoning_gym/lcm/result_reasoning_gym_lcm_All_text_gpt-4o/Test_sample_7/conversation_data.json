    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 34 and 50, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **34**: \n     - 34 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 34 รท 2 = 17\n     - 17 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 34 is \\(2 \\times 17\\).\n   - **50**:\n     - 50 is also an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 50 รท 2 = 25\n     - 25 is not a prime number; it is divisible by 5.\n     - 25 รท 5 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 50 is \\(2 \\times 5^2\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - From the prime factorizations:\n     - For the prime number 2, the highest power is \\(2^1\\) (appears in both 34 and 50).\n     - For the prime number 5, the highest power is \\(5^2\\) (appears in 50).\n     - For the prime number 17, the highest power is \\(17^1\\) (appears in 34).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 5^2 \\times 17^1\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^1 = 2\\).\n   - Calculate \\(5^2 = 25\\).\n   - Calculate \\(17^1 = 17\\).\n   - Multiply these together: \\(2 \\times 25 \\times 17\\).\n   - First, calculate \\(2 \\times 25 = 50\\).\n   - Then, calculate \\(50 \\times 17\\).\n   - \\(50 \\times 17 = 850\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 34 and 50 is 850.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<850>>>"
