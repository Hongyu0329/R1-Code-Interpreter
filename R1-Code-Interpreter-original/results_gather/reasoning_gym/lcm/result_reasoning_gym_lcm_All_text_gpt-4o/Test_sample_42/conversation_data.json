    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 24 and 28, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - 24: \n     - 24 is divisible by 2: 24 ÷ 2 = 12\n     - 12 is divisible by 2: 12 ÷ 2 = 6\n     - 6 is divisible by 2: 6 ÷ 2 = 3\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 24 is \\(2^3 \\times 3^1\\).\n   - 28:\n     - 28 is divisible by 2: 28 ÷ 2 = 14\n     - 14 is divisible by 2: 14 ÷ 2 = 7\n     - 7 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 28 is \\(2^2 \\times 7^1\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers found in the factorizations: 2, 3, and 7.\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations:\n     - For 2, the highest power is \\(2^3\\) (from 24).\n     - For 3, the highest power is \\(3^1\\) (from 24).\n     - For 7, the highest power is \\(7^1\\) (from 28).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together:\n   - LCM = \\(2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1\\).\n\n4. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n   - Multiply 8 by 3: \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\).\n   - Multiply 24 by 7: \\(24 \\times 7 = 168\\).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 24 and 28 is 168.\n\nFinal answer: <<<168>>>."
