    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 24 and 22, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **24**: \n     - 24 is divisible by 2 (the smallest prime number).\n     - 24 ÷ 2 = 12\n     - 12 is divisible by 2.\n     - 12 ÷ 2 = 6\n     - 6 is divisible by 2.\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 24 is \\(2^3 \\times 3^1\\).\n\n   - **22**:\n     - 22 is divisible by 2.\n     - 22 ÷ 2 = 11\n     - 11 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 22 is \\(2^1 \\times 11^1\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - From the prime factorizations, identify the highest power of each prime number present in either number.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, and 11.\n   - For 2, the highest power is \\(2^3\\) (from 24).\n   - For 3, the highest power is \\(3^1\\) (from 24).\n   - For 11, the highest power is \\(11^1\\) (from 22).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 11^1\\)\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n     - \\(3^1 = 3\\)\n     - \\(11^1 = 11\\)\n     - Multiply these together: \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\)\n     - Then, \\(24 \\times 11 = 264\\)\n\n5. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 264 is divisible by both 24 and 22.\n   - 264 ÷ 24 = 11 (an integer, so divisible)\n   - 264 ÷ 22 = 12 (an integer, so divisible)\n\nThus, the Least Common Multiple of 24 and 22 is 264.\n\nFinal answer: <<<264>>>"
