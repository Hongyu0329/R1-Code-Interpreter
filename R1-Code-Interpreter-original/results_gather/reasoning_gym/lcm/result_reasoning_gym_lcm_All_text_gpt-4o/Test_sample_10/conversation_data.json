    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n\n3. **Prime Factorization of 95**:\n   - 95 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.\n   - The sum of the digits of 95 is 9 + 5 = 14, which is not divisible by 3, so 95 is not divisible by 3.\n   - 95 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Dividing 95 by 5 gives 19.\n   - 19 is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 95 is \\(5 \\times 19\\).\n\n4. **Prime Factorization of 14**:\n   - 14 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2. Dividing 14 by 2 gives 7.\n   - 7 is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 14 is \\(2 \\times 7\\).\n\n5. **Determine the LCM**:\n   - To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 5, 7, and 19.\n   - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^1\\).\n   - The highest power of 5 is \\(5^1\\).\n   - The highest power of 7 is \\(7^1\\).\n   - The highest power of 19 is \\(19^1\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply these highest powers together: \n   \\[\n   LCM = 2^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1 \\times 19^1 = 2 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 19\n   \\]\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\)\n     - \\(10 \\times 7 = 70\\)\n     - \\(70 \\times 19 = 1330\\)\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 95 and 14 is 1330.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1330>>>"
