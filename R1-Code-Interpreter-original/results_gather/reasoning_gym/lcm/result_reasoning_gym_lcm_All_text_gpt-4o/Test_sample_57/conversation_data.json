    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 99 and 78, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 99:\n     - 99 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 9 + 9 = 18, is divisible by 3).\n     - 99 รท 3 = 33\n     - 33 is also divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 3 + 3 = 6, is divisible by 3).\n     - 33 รท 3 = 11\n     - 11 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 99 is \\(3^2 \\times 11\\).\n\n   - For 78:\n     - 78 is divisible by 2 (since it is an even number).\n     - 78 รท 2 = 39\n     - 39 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 3 + 9 = 12, is divisible by 3).\n     - 39 รท 3 = 13\n     - 13 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 78 is \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 13\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - We need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, 11, and 13.\n   - For 2: The highest power is \\(2^1\\) (from 78).\n   - For 3: The highest power is \\(3^2\\) (from 99).\n   - For 11: The highest power is \\(11^1\\) (from 99).\n   - For 13: The highest power is \\(13^1\\) (from 78).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 3^2 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1\\).\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(2^1 = 2\\)\n     - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n     - \\(11^1 = 11\\)\n     - \\(13^1 = 13\\)\n   - Multiply these together:\n     - \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\)\n     - \\(18 \\times 11 = 198\\)\n     - \\(198 \\times 13 = 2574\\)\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 99 and 78 is 2574.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2574>>>."
