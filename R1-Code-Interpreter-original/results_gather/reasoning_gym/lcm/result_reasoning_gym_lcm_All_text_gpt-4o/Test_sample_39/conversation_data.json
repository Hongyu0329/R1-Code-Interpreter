    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 66 and 80, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **66**: \n     - 66 is divisible by 2 (the smallest prime number), so 66 ÷ 2 = 33.\n     - 33 is divisible by 3, so 33 ÷ 3 = 11.\n     - 11 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 66 is \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 11\\).\n   - **80**:\n     - 80 is divisible by 2, so 80 ÷ 2 = 40.\n     - 40 is divisible by 2, so 40 ÷ 2 = 20.\n     - 20 is divisible by 2, so 20 ÷ 2 = 10.\n     - 10 is divisible by 2, so 10 ÷ 2 = 5.\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 80 is \\(2^4 \\times 5\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - We need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, 5, and 11.\n   - For 2, the highest power is \\(2^4\\) (from 80).\n   - For 3, the highest power is \\(3^1\\) (from 66).\n   - For 5, the highest power is \\(5^1\\) (from 80).\n   - For 11, the highest power is \\(11^1\\) (from 66).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^1\\).\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n     - \\(16 \\times 3 = 48\\).\n     - \\(48 \\times 5 = 240\\).\n     - \\(240 \\times 11 = 2640\\).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 66 and 80 is 2640.\n\n<<<2640>>>"
