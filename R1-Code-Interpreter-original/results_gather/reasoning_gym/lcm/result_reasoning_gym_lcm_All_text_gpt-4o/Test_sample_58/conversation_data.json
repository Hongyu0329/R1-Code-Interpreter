    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 92:\n     - 92 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 92 \\div 2 = 46 \\)\n     - 46 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 46 \\div 2 = 23 \\)\n     - 23 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 92 is \\( 2^2 \\times 23 \\).\n\n   - For 12:\n     - 12 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 12 \\div 2 = 6 \\)\n     - 6 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 6 \\div 2 = 3 \\)\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 12 is \\( 2^2 \\times 3 \\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**: For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations.\n   - Prime 2: The highest power is \\( 2^2 \\) (appears in both 92 and 12).\n   - Prime 3: The highest power is \\( 3^1 \\) (appears in 12).\n   - Prime 23: The highest power is \\( 23^1 \\) (appears in 92).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 23^1 \\)\n   - LCM = \\( 4 \\times 3 \\times 23 \\)\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, calculate \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\).\n   - Then, calculate \\( 12 \\times 23 \\).\n     - \\( 12 \\times 23 = 276 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The LCM of 92 and 12 is 276.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<276>>>"
