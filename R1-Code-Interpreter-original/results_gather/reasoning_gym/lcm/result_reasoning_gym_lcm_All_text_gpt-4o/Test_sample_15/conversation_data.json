    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 74: \n     - 74 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 74 ÷ 2 = 37\n     - 37 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 74 is \\(2 \\times 37\\).\n\n   - For 44:\n     - 44 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 44 ÷ 2 = 22\n     - 22 is also an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 22 ÷ 2 = 11\n     - 11 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 44 is \\(2^2 \\times 11\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**: For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime factors involved are 2, 11, and 37.\n   - The highest power of 2 in the factorizations is \\(2^2\\) (from 44).\n   - The highest power of 11 is \\(11^1\\) (from 44).\n   - The highest power of 37 is \\(37^1\\) (from 74).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^2 \\times 11^1 \\times 37^1\\)\n   - LCM = 4 × 11 × 37\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, calculate 4 × 11 = 44.\n   - Then, calculate 44 × 37.\n     - 44 × 37 = 1628 (using standard multiplication).\n\n6. **Verify**: Ensure that 1628 is divisible by both 74 and 44.\n   - 1628 ÷ 74 = 22 (an integer, so divisible).\n   - 1628 ÷ 44 = 37 (an integer, so divisible).\n\nThus, the LCM of 74 and 44 is 1628.\n\n<<<1628>>>"
