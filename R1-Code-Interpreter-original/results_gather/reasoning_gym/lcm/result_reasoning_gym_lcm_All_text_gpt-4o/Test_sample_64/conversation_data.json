    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 98 and 6, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 98:\n     - 98 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 98 \\div 2 = 49 \\)\n     - 49 is not divisible by 2, try the next prime number, 3. It is not divisible by 3.\n     - 49 is divisible by 7: \\( 49 \\div 7 = 7 \\)\n     - 7 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 98 is \\( 2 \\times 7^2 \\).\n\n   - For 6:\n     - 6 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 6 \\div 2 = 3 \\)\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 6 is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers found in the factorizations: 2, 3, and 7.\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations:\n     - The highest power of 2 is \\( 2^1 \\) (appears in both 98 and 6).\n     - The highest power of 3 is \\( 3^1 \\) (appears in 6).\n     - The highest power of 7 is \\( 7^2 \\) (appears in 98).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM} = 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\( 2^1 = 2 \\)\n     - \\( 3^1 = 3 \\)\n     - \\( 7^2 = 49 \\)\n     - Multiply these together: \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 49 = 6 \\times 49 = 294 \\)\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 98 and 6 is 294.\n\n<<<294>>>"
