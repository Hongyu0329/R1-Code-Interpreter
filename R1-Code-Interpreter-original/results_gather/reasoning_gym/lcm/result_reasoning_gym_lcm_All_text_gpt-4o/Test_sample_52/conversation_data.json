    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 100 and 5, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - 100: The prime factorization of 100 is \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\).\n   - 5: The prime factorization of 5 is \\(5^1\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - For the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - Prime number 2: Appears in 100 as \\(2^2\\). It does not appear in 5.\n   - Prime number 5: Appears in 100 as \\(5^2\\) and in 5 as \\(5^1\\). The highest power is \\(5^2\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n   - Calculate \\(5^2 = 25\\).\n   - Multiply these results: \\(4 \\times 25 = 100\\).\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 100 is divisible by both original numbers:\n     - 100 รท 100 = 1 (divisible)\n     - 100 รท 5 = 20 (divisible)\n\nSince 100 is divisible by both 100 and 5, it confirms that 100 is indeed the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 100 and 5 is:\n\n<<<100>>>"
