    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - The first step in finding the LCM is to perform the prime factorization of each number.\n   - However, in this case, we notice that 39 and 43 are relatively small numbers, and we can check if they are prime numbers.\n\n3. **Check if the Numbers are Prime**:\n   - A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - 43 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 43.\n   - 39 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 3 and 13 (39 = 3 × 13).\n\n4. **LCM of Two Numbers**:\n   - If one of the numbers is prime and the other is not a multiple of the prime number, the LCM is simply the product of the two numbers.\n   - Since 43 is a prime number and 39 is not a multiple of 43, the LCM is 39 × 43.\n\n5. **Calculate the Product**:\n   - Multiply the two numbers: 39 × 43.\n   - Perform the multiplication: \n     - 39 × 43 = 1677.\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 1677 is divisible by both 39 and 43.\n   - 1677 ÷ 39 = 43, which is an integer.\n   - 1677 ÷ 43 = 39, which is an integer.\n   - Since 1677 is divisible by both 39 and 43, it confirms that 1677 is indeed the LCM.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the LCM of 39 and 43.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1677>>>."
