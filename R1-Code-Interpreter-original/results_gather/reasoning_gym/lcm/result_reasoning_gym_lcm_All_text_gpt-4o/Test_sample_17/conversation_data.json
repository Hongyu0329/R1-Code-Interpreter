    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 88 and 6, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **88**: \n     - 88 is even, so divide by 2: 88 รท 2 = 44\n     - 44 is even, so divide by 2: 44 รท 2 = 22\n     - 22 is even, so divide by 2: 22 รท 2 = 11\n     - 11 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 88 is \\(2^3 \\times 11\\).\n   - **6**:\n     - 6 is even, so divide by 2: 6 รท 2 = 3\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 6 is \\(2^1 \\times 3\\).\n\n3. **Determine the LCM Using Prime Factorization**:\n   - To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, and 11.\n   - For 2, the highest power is \\(2^3\\) (from 88).\n   - For 3, the highest power is \\(3^1\\) (from 6).\n   - For 11, the highest power is \\(11^1\\) (from 88).\n   - Therefore, the LCM is \\(2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 11^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n   - Calculate \\(3^1 = 3\\).\n   - Calculate \\(11^1 = 11\\).\n   - Multiply these together: \\(8 \\times 3 \\times 11\\).\n   - First, multiply 8 and 3: \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by 11: \\(24 \\times 11 = 264\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 88 and 6 is 264.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<264>>>"
