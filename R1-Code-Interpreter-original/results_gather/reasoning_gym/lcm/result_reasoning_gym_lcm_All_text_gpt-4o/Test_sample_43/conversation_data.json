    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 6 and 94, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **6**: The prime factorization of 6 is \\(2 \\times 3\\).\n   - **94**: The prime factorization of 94 is \\(2 \\times 47\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations of both numbers.\n   - For 6 and 94, the prime numbers are 2, 3, and 47.\n   - Determine the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:\n     - For 2: The highest power is \\(2^1\\) (appears in both 6 and 94).\n     - For 3: The highest power is \\(3^1\\) (appears in 6).\n     - For 47: The highest power is \\(47^1\\) (appears in 94).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 47^1\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\).\n   - Then, calculate \\(6 \\times 47 = 282\\).\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 282 is divisible by both 6 and 94:\n     - \\(282 \\div 6 = 47\\), which is an integer.\n     - \\(282 \\div 94 = 3\\), which is an integer.\n   - Since 282 is divisible by both numbers, it confirms that 282 is the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 6 and 94 is 282.\n\n<<<282>>>"
