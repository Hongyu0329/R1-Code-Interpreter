    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 78 and 75, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **78**: \n     - 78 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 78 \\div 2 = 39 \\)\n     - 39 is divisible by 3: \\( 39 \\div 3 = 13 \\)\n     - 13 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 78 is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 13 \\).\n   - **75**:\n     - 75 is divisible by 3: \\( 75 \\div 3 = 25 \\)\n     - 25 is \\( 5 \\times 5 \\) or \\( 5^2 \\).\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 75 is \\( 3 \\times 5^2 \\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations: 2, 3, 5, 13.\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations:\n     - For 2: The highest power is \\( 2^1 \\) (from 78).\n     - For 3: The highest power is \\( 3^1 \\) (common in both).\n     - For 5: The highest power is \\( 5^2 \\) (from 75).\n     - For 13: The highest power is \\( 13^1 \\) (from 78).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together:\n   \\[\n   LCM = 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\times 13^1\n   \\]\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\)\n     - \\( 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\) (since \\( 5^2 = 25 \\))\n     - \\( 150 \\times 13 = 1950 \\)\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 78 and 75 is 1950.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1950>>>."
