    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 26 and 94, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **26**: \n     - 26 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 26 รท 2 = 13, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 26 is \\(2 \\times 13\\).\n   - **94**:\n     - 94 is also an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 94 รท 2 = 47, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 94 is \\(2 \\times 47\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - From the prime factorizations:\n     - For the prime number 2, the highest power is \\(2^1\\).\n     - For the prime number 13, the highest power is \\(13^1\\).\n     - For the prime number 47, the highest power is \\(47^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 13^1 \\times 47^1\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2 \\times 13 = 26\\).\n   - Then, calculate \\(26 \\times 47\\).\n   - \\(26 \\times 47 = 1222\\).\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 1222 is divisible by both 26 and 94.\n   - 1222 รท 26 = 47, which is an integer.\n   - 1222 รท 94 = 13, which is an integer.\n   - Since 1222 is divisible by both numbers, it confirms that 1222 is the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 26 and 94 is:\n\n<<<1222>>>"
