    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 13 and 39, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - 13 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is \\(13^1\\).\n   - 39 can be factored into \\(3 \\times 13\\), so its prime factorization is \\(3^1 \\times 13^1\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - From the prime factorizations, identify the highest power of each prime number present in either number.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 3 and 13.\n   - For 3, the highest power is \\(3^1\\).\n   - For 13, the highest power is \\(13^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by taking the product of the highest powers of all prime numbers identified.\n   - LCM = \\(3^1 \\times 13^1 = 3 \\times 13 = 39\\).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check that 39 is divisible by both 13 and 39.\n   - 39 divided by 13 equals 3, which is an integer.\n   - 39 divided by 39 equals 1, which is an integer.\n   - Therefore, 39 is indeed the smallest number that both 13 and 39 divide into without leaving a remainder.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined that the Least Common Multiple of 13 and 39 is 39.\n\nFinal answer: <<<39>>>."
