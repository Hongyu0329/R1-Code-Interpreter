    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 60 and 100, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 60:\n     - 60 is divisible by 2: \\( 60 \\div 2 = 30 \\)\n     - 30 is divisible by 2: \\( 30 \\div 2 = 15 \\)\n     - 15 is divisible by 3: \\( 15 \\div 3 = 5 \\)\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 60 is \\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\).\n\n   - For 100:\n     - 100 is divisible by 2: \\( 100 \\div 2 = 50 \\)\n     - 50 is divisible by 2: \\( 50 \\div 2 = 25 \\)\n     - 25 is divisible by 5: \\( 25 \\div 5 = 5 \\)\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 100 is \\( 2^2 \\times 5^2 \\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations: 2, 3, and 5.\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations:\n     - For 2: The highest power is \\( 2^2 \\).\n     - For 3: The highest power is \\( 3^1 \\).\n     - For 5: The highest power is \\( 5^2 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together:\n   - LCM = \\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\).\n\n4. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\( 2^2 = 4 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 3^1 = 3 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 5^2 = 25 \\).\n   - Multiply these results: \\( 4 \\times 3 \\times 25 \\).\n\n5. **Final Calculation**:\n   - \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\).\n   - \\( 12 \\times 25 = 300 \\).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 60 and 100 is 300.\n\n<<<300>>>"
