    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 50 and 74, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **50**: \n     - 50 is divisible by 2 (the smallest prime number), so divide 50 by 2: \n       - 50 ÷ 2 = 25\n     - 25 is not divisible by 2, so try the next prime number, which is 3. 25 is not divisible by 3.\n     - Try the next prime number, which is 5:\n       - 25 ÷ 5 = 5\n       - 5 ÷ 5 = 1\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 50 is \\(2^1 \\times 5^2\\).\n\n   - **74**:\n     - 74 is divisible by 2, so divide 74 by 2:\n       - 74 ÷ 2 = 37\n     - 37 is a prime number, so it cannot be divided further by any number other than 1 and itself.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 74 is \\(2^1 \\times 37^1\\).\n\n3. **Determine the LCM Using Prime Factorization**:\n   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - From the factorizations:\n     - The prime numbers involved are 2, 5, and 37.\n     - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^1\\).\n     - The highest power of 5 is \\(5^2\\).\n     - The highest power of 37 is \\(37^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM:\n     - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 5^2 \\times 37^1\\)\n     - LCM = 2 × 25 × 37\n     - LCM = 50 × 37\n     - LCM = 1850\n\n5. **Verify the LCM**:\n   - Check that 1850 is divisible by both 50 and 74:\n     - 1850 ÷ 50 = 37 (an integer, so divisible)\n     - 1850 ÷ 74 = 25 (an integer, so divisible)\n\nThus, the Least Common Multiple of 50 and 74 is 1850.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1850>>>."
