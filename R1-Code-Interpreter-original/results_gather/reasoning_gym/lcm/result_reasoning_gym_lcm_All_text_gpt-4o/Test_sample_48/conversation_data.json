    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 48 and 4, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **List the Multiples**:\n   - List some multiples of each number to find a common multiple.\n   - Multiples of 48: 48, 96, 144, 192, ...\n   - Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, ...\n\n3. **Identify the Common Multiples**:\n   - From the lists above, identify the common multiples.\n   - Common multiples of 48 and 4: 48, 96, 144, ...\n\n4. **Select the Least Common Multiple**:\n   - The smallest number in the list of common multiples is the LCM.\n   - The smallest common multiple is 48.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Verify that 48 is divisible by both 48 and 4.\n   - 48 รท 48 = 1 (exact division)\n   - 48 รท 4 = 12 (exact division)\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 48 is divisible by both numbers, it is indeed the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 48 and 4 is:\n\n<<<48>>>"
