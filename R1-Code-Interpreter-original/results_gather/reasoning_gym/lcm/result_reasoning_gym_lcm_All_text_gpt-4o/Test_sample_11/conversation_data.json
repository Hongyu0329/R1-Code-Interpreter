    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 60 and 48, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 60:\n     - 60 is divisible by 2: \\(60 \\div 2 = 30\\)\n     - 30 is divisible by 2: \\(30 \\div 2 = 15\\)\n     - 15 is divisible by 3: \\(15 \\div 3 = 5\\)\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 60 is \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n   - For 48:\n     - 48 is divisible by 2: \\(48 \\div 2 = 24\\)\n     - 24 is divisible by 2: \\(24 \\div 2 = 12\\)\n     - 12 is divisible by 2: \\(12 \\div 2 = 6\\)\n     - 6 is divisible by 2: \\(6 \\div 2 = 3\\)\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 48 is \\(2^4 \\times 3^1\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - We need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - For the prime number 2, the highest power is \\(2^4\\) (from 48).\n   - For the prime number 3, the highest power is \\(3^1\\) (common in both).\n   - For the prime number 5, the highest power is \\(5^1\\) (from 60).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\\)\n   - Calculate:\n     - \\(2^4 = 16\\)\n     - \\(3^1 = 3\\)\n     - \\(5^1 = 5\\)\n   - LCM = \\(16 \\times 3 \\times 5\\)\n   - LCM = \\(48 \\times 5\\)\n   - LCM = 240\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 60 and 48 is 240.\n\n<<<240>>>"
