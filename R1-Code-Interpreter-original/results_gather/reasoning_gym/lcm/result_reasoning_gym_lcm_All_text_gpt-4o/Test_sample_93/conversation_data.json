    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 45 and 20, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **45**: \n     - 45 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 4 + 5 = 9, is divisible by 3).\n     - 45 ÷ 3 = 15\n     - 15 is also divisible by 3.\n     - 15 ÷ 3 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 45 is \\(3^2 \\times 5\\).\n   - **20**:\n     - 20 is divisible by 2 (since it is an even number).\n     - 20 ÷ 2 = 10\n     - 10 is also divisible by 2.\n     - 10 ÷ 2 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 20 is \\(2^2 \\times 5\\).\n\n3. **Determine the LCM Using Prime Factorization**:\n   - To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - From 45: \\(3^2\\) and \\(5^1\\)\n   - From 20: \\(2^2\\) and \\(5^1\\)\n   - The LCM will be the product of the highest powers of all primes:\n     - \\(2^2\\) (from 20)\n     - \\(3^2\\) (from 45)\n     - \\(5^1\\) (common in both, take the highest which is 5)\n   - Therefore, the LCM is \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n   - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n   - \\(5^1 = 5\\)\n   - Multiply these together: \\(4 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 180\\).\n\n5. **Verify the LCM**:\n   - Check that 180 is divisible by both 45 and 20:\n     - 180 ÷ 45 = 4 (an integer, so divisible)\n     - 180 ÷ 20 = 9 (an integer, so divisible)\n\nThus, the Least Common Multiple of 45 and 20 is 180.\n\nFinal answer: <<<180>>>."
