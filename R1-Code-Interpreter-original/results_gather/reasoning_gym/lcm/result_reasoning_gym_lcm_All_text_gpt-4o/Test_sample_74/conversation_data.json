    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 3 and 72, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 3, the prime factorization is simply 3 (since 3 is a prime number).\n   - For 72, we perform the prime factorization:\n     - 72 is even, so divide by 2: 72 ÷ 2 = 36\n     - 36 is even, so divide by 2: 36 ÷ 2 = 18\n     - 18 is even, so divide by 2: 18 ÷ 2 = 9\n     - 9 is divisible by 3, so divide by 3: 9 ÷ 3 = 3\n     - 3 is divisible by 3, so divide by 3: 3 ÷ 3 = 1\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 72 is \\(2^3 \\times 3^2\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations: 2 and 3.\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations:\n     - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^3\\) (from 72).\n     - The highest power of 3 is \\(3^2\\) (from 72).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together:\n   - LCM = \\(2^3 \\times 3^2\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n   - Calculate \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n   - Multiply these results: \\(8 \\times 9 = 72\\).\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 72 is divisible by both 3 and 72:\n     - 72 ÷ 3 = 24 (which is an integer).\n     - 72 ÷ 72 = 1 (which is an integer).\n   - Since 72 is divisible by both numbers, it confirms that 72 is indeed the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 3 and 72 is 72.\n\n<<<72>>>"
