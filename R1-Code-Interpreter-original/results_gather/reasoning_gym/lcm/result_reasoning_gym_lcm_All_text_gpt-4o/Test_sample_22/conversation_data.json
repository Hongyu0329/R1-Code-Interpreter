    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**: Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 57:\n     - 57 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 5 + 7 = 12, is divisible by 3).\n     - 57 ÷ 3 = 19, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 57 is \\(3^1 \\times 19^1\\).\n\n   - For 72:\n     - 72 is divisible by 2 (since it is even).\n     - 72 ÷ 2 = 36, which is also even.\n     - 36 ÷ 2 = 18, which is also even.\n     - 18 ÷ 2 = 9, which is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 9, is divisible by 3).\n     - 9 ÷ 3 = 3, which is divisible by 3.\n     - 3 ÷ 3 = 1.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 72 is \\(2^3 \\times 3^2\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**: For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, and 19.\n   - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^3\\) (from 72).\n   - The highest power of 3 is \\(3^2\\) (from 72).\n   - The highest power of 19 is \\(19^1\\) (from 57).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 19^1\\).\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n     - \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n     - \\(8 \\times 9 = 72\\).\n     - \\(72 \\times 19 = 1368\\).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 57 and 72 is 1368.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1368>>>."
