    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 80 and 86, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **80**: \n     - 80 is even, so divide by 2: 80 ÷ 2 = 40\n     - 40 is even, so divide by 2: 40 ÷ 2 = 20\n     - 20 is even, so divide by 2: 20 ÷ 2 = 10\n     - 10 is even, so divide by 2: 10 ÷ 2 = 5\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 80 is \\(2^4 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n   - **86**:\n     - 86 is even, so divide by 2: 86 ÷ 2 = 43\n     - 43 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 86 is \\(2^1 \\times 43^1\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - From the prime factorizations, identify the highest power of each prime number that appears in either factorization.\n   - For the prime number 2, the highest power is \\(2^4\\) (from 80).\n   - For the prime number 5, the highest power is \\(5^1\\) (from 80).\n   - For the prime number 43, the highest power is \\(43^1\\) (from 86).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^4 \\times 5^1 \\times 43^1\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n   - Multiply 16 by 5: \\(16 \\times 5 = 80\\).\n   - Multiply 80 by 43: \\(80 \\times 43 = 3440\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 80 and 86 is 3440.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3440>>>"
