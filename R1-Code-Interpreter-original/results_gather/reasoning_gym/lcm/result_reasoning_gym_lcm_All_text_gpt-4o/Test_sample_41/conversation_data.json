    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 39 and 76, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **39**: \n     - 39 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 3 + 9 = 12, is divisible by 3).\n     - Dividing 39 by 3 gives 13, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 39 is \\(3 \\times 13\\).\n   - **76**:\n     - 76 is even, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - Dividing 76 by 2 gives 38, which is also even and divisible by 2.\n     - Dividing 38 by 2 gives 19, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 76 is \\(2^2 \\times 19\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - From the prime factorizations:\n     - The prime factors are 2, 3, 13, and 19.\n     - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^2\\) (from 76).\n     - The highest power of 3 is \\(3^1\\) (from 39).\n     - The highest power of 13 is \\(13^1\\) (from 39).\n     - The highest power of 19 is \\(19^1\\) (from 76).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor and multiplying them together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM} = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 13^1 \\times 19^1\n   \\]\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\)\n     - \\(12 \\times 13 = 156\\)\n     - \\(156 \\times 19 = 2964\\)\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 39 and 76 is 2964.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2964>>>"
