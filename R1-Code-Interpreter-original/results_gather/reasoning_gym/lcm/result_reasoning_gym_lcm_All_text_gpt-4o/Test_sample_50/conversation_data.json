    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 99 and 63, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 99:\n     - 99 is divisible by 3: \\(99 \\div 3 = 33\\)\n     - 33 is divisible by 3: \\(33 \\div 3 = 11\\)\n     - 11 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 99 is \\(3^2 \\times 11\\).\n   - For 63:\n     - 63 is divisible by 3: \\(63 \\div 3 = 21\\)\n     - 21 is divisible by 3: \\(21 \\div 3 = 7\\)\n     - 7 is a prime number.\n     - So, the prime factorization of 63 is \\(3^2 \\times 7\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - We need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 3, 7, and 11.\n   - For 3, the highest power is \\(3^2\\) (appears in both factorizations).\n   - For 7, the highest power is \\(7^1\\) (appears in the factorization of 63).\n   - For 11, the highest power is \\(11^1\\) (appears in the factorization of 99).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1\\).\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n     - \\(9 \\times 7 = 63\\)\n     - \\(63 \\times 11 = 693\\)\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 99 and 63 is 693.\n\nFinal answer: <<<693>>>."
