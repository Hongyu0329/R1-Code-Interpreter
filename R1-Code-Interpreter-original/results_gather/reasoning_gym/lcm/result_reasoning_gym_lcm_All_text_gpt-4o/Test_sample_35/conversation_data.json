    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 15 and 99, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **15**: The prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5. So, 15 = 3 × 5.\n   - **99**: The prime factors of 99 are 3 and 11. So, 99 = 3² × 11.\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - For LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of either number.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 3, 5, and 11.\n   - The highest power of 3 is 3² (from 99).\n   - The highest power of 5 is 5¹ (from 15).\n   - The highest power of 11 is 11¹ (from 99).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime factors together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = 3² × 5¹ × 11¹\n   - LCM = 9 × 5 × 11\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, calculate 9 × 5 = 45.\n   - Then, calculate 45 × 11.\n   - 45 × 11 = 495.\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 495 is divisible by both 15 and 99.\n   - 495 ÷ 15 = 33, which is an integer.\n   - 495 ÷ 99 = 5, which is an integer.\n   - Since 495 is divisible by both numbers, it confirms that 495 is the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 15 and 99 is 495.\n\n<<<495>>>"
