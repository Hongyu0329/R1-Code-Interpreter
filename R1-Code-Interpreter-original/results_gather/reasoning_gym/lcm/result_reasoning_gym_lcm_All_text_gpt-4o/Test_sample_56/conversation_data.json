    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 44 and 88, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **44**: \n     - 44 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 44 ÷ 2 = 22\n     - 22 is also even, so divide by 2 again.\n     - 22 ÷ 2 = 11\n     - 11 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 44 is \\(2^2 \\times 11\\).\n   - **88**:\n     - 88 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 88 ÷ 2 = 44\n     - We already know the factorization of 44 from above.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 88 is \\(2^3 \\times 11\\).\n\n3. **Determine the LCM Using Prime Factorization**:\n   - To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - For the prime number 2, the highest power is \\(2^3\\) (from 88).\n   - For the prime number 11, the highest power is \\(11^1\\) (from both 44 and 88).\n   - Therefore, the LCM is \\(2^3 \\times 11\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n   - \\(8 \\times 11 = 88\\)\n\n5. **Verify**:\n   - Check that 88 is divisible by both 44 and 88.\n   - 88 ÷ 44 = 2 (an integer, so 88 is divisible by 44)\n   - 88 ÷ 88 = 1 (an integer, so 88 is divisible by 88)\n\nThus, the Least Common Multiple of 44 and 88 is 88.\n\nFinal answer: <<<88>>>."
