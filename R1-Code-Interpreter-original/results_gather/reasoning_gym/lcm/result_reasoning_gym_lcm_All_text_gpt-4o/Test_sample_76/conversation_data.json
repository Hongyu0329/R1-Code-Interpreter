    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 94: \n     - 94 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 94 ÷ 2 = 47\n     - 47 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 94 is \\(2 \\times 47\\).\n\n   - For 36:\n     - 36 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 36 ÷ 2 = 18\n     - 18 is also even, so divide by 2 again.\n     - 18 ÷ 2 = 9\n     - 9 is divisible by 3.\n     - 9 ÷ 3 = 3\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 36 is \\(2^2 \\times 3^2\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**: For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime factors involved are 2, 3, and 47.\n   - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^2\\) (from 36).\n   - The highest power of 3 is \\(3^2\\) (from 36).\n   - The highest power of 47 is \\(47^1\\) (from 94).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 47\\)\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n     - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 9 = 36\\)\n     - \\(36 \\times 47 = 1692\\)\n\n5. **Verify**: Ensure that 1692 is divisible by both 94 and 36.\n   - 1692 ÷ 94 = 18 (an integer, so divisible)\n   - 1692 ÷ 36 = 47 (an integer, so divisible)\n\nThus, the LCM of 94 and 36 is 1692.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1692>>>."
