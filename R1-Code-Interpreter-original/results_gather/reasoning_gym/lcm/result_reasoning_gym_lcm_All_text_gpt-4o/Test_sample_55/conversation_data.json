    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 95 and 25, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **95**: \n     - 95 is divisible by 5 (since it ends in 5).\n     - 95 รท 5 = 19\n     - 19 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 95 is \\(5^1 \\times 19^1\\).\n   - **25**:\n     - 25 is a perfect square of 5.\n     - 25 = 5 ร 5 = \\(5^2\\).\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 25 is \\(5^2\\).\n\n3. **Determine the LCM Using Prime Factorization**:\n   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - For the prime number 5, the highest power is \\(5^2\\) (from 25).\n   - For the prime number 19, the highest power is \\(19^1\\) (from 95).\n   - Therefore, the LCM is \\(5^2 \\times 19^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n   - \\(19^1 = 19\\)\n   - Multiply these together: \\(25 \\times 19\\).\n   - Calculate \\(25 \\times 19\\):\n     - \\(25 \\times 19 = 475\\).\n\n5. **Verify the LCM**:\n   - Check that 475 is divisible by both 95 and 25.\n   - \\(475 รท 95 = 5\\), which is an integer.\n   - \\(475 รท 25 = 19\\), which is an integer.\n   - Since 475 is divisible by both numbers, it confirms that 475 is indeed the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 95 and 25 is 475.\n\n<<<475>>>"
