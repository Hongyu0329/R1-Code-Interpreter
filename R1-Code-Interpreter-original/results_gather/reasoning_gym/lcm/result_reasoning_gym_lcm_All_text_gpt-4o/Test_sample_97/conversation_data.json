    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 30 and 15, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **List the Prime Factors**:\n   - Prime factorization involves breaking down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 30: \n     - 30 can be divided by 2 (the smallest prime number), resulting in 15.\n     - 15 can be divided by 3, resulting in 5.\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 30 is \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5\\).\n   - For 15:\n     - 15 can be divided by 3, resulting in 5.\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 15 is \\(3 \\times 5\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - From the prime factorizations:\n     - The prime factors involved are 2, 3, and 5.\n     - The highest power of 2 present is \\(2^1\\) (from 30).\n     - The highest power of 3 present is \\(3^1\\) (from both 30 and 15).\n     - The highest power of 5 present is \\(5^1\\) (from both 30 and 15).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor and multiplying them together.\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\).\n   - Then, calculate \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\).\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 30 is divisible by both original numbers:\n     - 30 divided by 30 equals 1 (divisible).\n     - 30 divided by 15 equals 2 (divisible).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 30 and 15 is 30.\n\nFinal answer: <<<30>>>."
