    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 84 and 93, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n\n   - **84**:\n     - 84 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 84 \\div 2 = 42 \\)\n     - 42 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 42 \\div 2 = 21 \\)\n     - 21 is divisible by 3: \\( 21 \\div 3 = 7 \\)\n     - 7 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 84 is \\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1 \\).\n\n   - **93**:\n     - 93 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n     - Sum of digits of 93 is 12, which is divisible by 3, so divide by 3: \\( 93 \\div 3 = 31 \\)\n     - 31 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 93 is \\( 3^1 \\times 31^1 \\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations: 2, 3, 7, 31.\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations.\n\n   - **2**: Appears in 84 as \\( 2^2 \\).\n   - **3**: Appears in both 84 and 93 as \\( 3^1 \\).\n   - **7**: Appears in 84 as \\( 7^1 \\).\n   - **31**: Appears in 93 as \\( 31^1 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together:\n   \\[\n   LCM = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1 \\times 31^1\n   \\]\n\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\( 2^2 = 4 \\)\n     - \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\)\n     - \\( 12 \\times 7 = 84 \\)\n     - \\( 84 \\times 31 = 2604 \\)\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 84 and 93 is 2604.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2604>>>."
