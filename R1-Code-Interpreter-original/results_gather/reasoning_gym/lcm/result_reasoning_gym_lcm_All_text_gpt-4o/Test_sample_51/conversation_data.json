    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 84 and 28, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Start by finding the prime factorization of each number.\n\n   - **84**: \n     - Divide by 2: 84 ÷ 2 = 42\n     - Divide by 2: 42 ÷ 2 = 21\n     - Divide by 3: 21 ÷ 3 = 7\n     - 7 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factorization of 84 is \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1\\).\n\n   - **28**:\n     - Divide by 2: 28 ÷ 2 = 14\n     - Divide by 2: 14 ÷ 2 = 7\n     - 7 is a prime number.\n     - Prime factorization of 28 is \\(2^2 \\times 7^1\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**: For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n\n   - Prime number 2: The highest power is \\(2^2\\) (appears in both 84 and 28).\n   - Prime number 3: The highest power is \\(3^1\\) (appears in 84).\n   - Prime number 7: The highest power is \\(7^1\\) (appears in both 84 and 28).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n\n   \\[\n   LCM = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n\n   - \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\)\n   - \\(12 \\times 7 = 84\\)\n\n6. **Verify**: Check that 84 is divisible by both original numbers:\n\n   - 84 ÷ 84 = 1 (divisible)\n   - 84 ÷ 28 = 3 (divisible)\n\nSince 84 is divisible by both 84 and 28, it confirms that 84 is indeed the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 84 and 28 is:\n\n<<<84>>>"
