    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 81 and 30, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 81:\n     - 81 is a power of 3. We can divide 81 by 3 repeatedly until we reach 1.\n     - 81 ÷ 3 = 27\n     - 27 ÷ 3 = 9\n     - 9 ÷ 3 = 3\n     - 3 ÷ 3 = 1\n     - So, the prime factorization of 81 is \\(3^4\\).\n   - For 30:\n     - 30 is divisible by 2, 3, and 5.\n     - 30 ÷ 2 = 15\n     - 15 ÷ 3 = 5\n     - 5 ÷ 5 = 1\n     - So, the prime factorization of 30 is \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - We need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, and 5.\n   - For 2: The highest power is \\(2^1\\) (from 30).\n   - For 3: The highest power is \\(3^4\\) (from 81).\n   - For 5: The highest power is \\(5^1\\) (from 30).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by multiplying the highest powers of all prime factors.\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 3^4 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n4. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(3^4\\): \\(3^4 = 81\\).\n   - Multiply the results: \\(2 \\times 81 \\times 5\\).\n   - First, calculate \\(2 \\times 81 = 162\\).\n   - Then, calculate \\(162 \\times 5 = 810\\).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 81 and 30 is 810.\n\nFinal answer: <<<810>>>."
