    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 15 and 12, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - 15 can be factored into prime numbers as: \\(15 = 3 \\times 5\\).\n   - 12 can be factored into prime numbers as: \\(12 = 2^2 \\times 3\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations of both numbers.\n   - For 15 and 12, the prime numbers are 2, 3, and 5.\n   - Determine the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:\n     - For the prime number 2, the highest power is \\(2^2\\) (from 12).\n     - For the prime number 3, the highest power is \\(3^1\\) (common in both).\n     - For the prime number 5, the highest power is \\(5^1\\) (from 15).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n   - Multiply 4 by 3 to get 12.\n   - Multiply 12 by 5 to get 60.\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 60 is divisible by both 15 and 12:\n     - 60 รท 15 = 4 (an integer, so divisible).\n     - 60 รท 12 = 5 (an integer, so divisible).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 15 and 12 is 60.\n\nFinal answer: <<<60>>>."
