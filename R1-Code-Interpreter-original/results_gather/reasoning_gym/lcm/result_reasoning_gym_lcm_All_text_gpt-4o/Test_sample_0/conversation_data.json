    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 4 and 93, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **4**: The prime factorization of 4 is \\(2^2\\).\n   - **93**: The prime factorization of 93 is \\(3^1 \\times 31^1\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - For the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 3, and 31.\n   - From 4, we have \\(2^2\\).\n   - From 93, we have \\(3^1\\) and \\(31^1\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by multiplying the highest powers of all prime numbers involved.\n   - LCM = \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 31^1\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n   - Multiply 4 by 3: \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n   - Multiply 12 by 31: \\(12 \\times 31 = 372\\).\n\n6. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 372 is divisible by both 4 and 93.\n   - \\(372 \\div 4 = 93\\), which is an integer.\n   - \\(372 \\div 93 = 4\\), which is an integer.\n\nSince 372 is divisible by both 4 and 93, it confirms that 372 is indeed the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 4 and 93 is:\n\n<<<372>>>"
