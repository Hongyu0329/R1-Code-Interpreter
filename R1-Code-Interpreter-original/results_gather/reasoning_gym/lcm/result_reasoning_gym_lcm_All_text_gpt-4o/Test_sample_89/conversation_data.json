    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The Least Common Multiple of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**:\n   - We are given the numbers 43 and 37.\n\n3. **Check for Prime Numbers**:\n   - Both 43 and 37 are prime numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n4. **LCM of Two Prime Numbers**:\n   - When both numbers are prime, the LCM is simply the product of the two numbers. This is because the only common multiple they have is their product, as they do not share any other factors.\n\n5. **Calculate the Product**:\n   - Multiply the two numbers: 43 * 37.\n\n6. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - 43 * 37 = 1591.\n\n7. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - Double-check the multiplication to ensure accuracy:\n     - 43 * 37 can be broken down as:\n       - (40 + 3) * 37 = (40 * 37) + (3 * 37)\n       - 40 * 37 = 1480\n       - 3 * 37 = 111\n       - Adding these results: 1480 + 111 = 1591\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 43 and 37 is 1591.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1591>>>"
