    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 90 and 60, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 90:\n     - 90 is divisible by 2: \\(90 \\div 2 = 45\\)\n     - 45 is divisible by 3: \\(45 \\div 3 = 15\\)\n     - 15 is divisible by 3: \\(15 \\div 3 = 5\\)\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 90 is \\(2^1 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n   - For 60:\n     - 60 is divisible by 2: \\(60 \\div 2 = 30\\)\n     - 30 is divisible by 2: \\(30 \\div 2 = 15\\)\n     - 15 is divisible by 3: \\(15 \\div 3 = 5\\)\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 60 is \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - We need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - For the prime number 2, the highest power is \\(2^2\\) (from 60).\n   - For the prime number 3, the highest power is \\(3^2\\) (from 90).\n   - For the prime number 5, the highest power is \\(5^1\\) (common in both).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime numbers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\\)\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n     - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n     - \\(5^1 = 5\\)\n     - Multiply these together: \\(4 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 180\\)\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 90 and 60 is 180.\n\nFinal answer: <<<180>>>."
