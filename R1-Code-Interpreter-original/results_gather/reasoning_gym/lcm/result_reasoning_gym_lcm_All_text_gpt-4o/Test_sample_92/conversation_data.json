    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 8 and 54, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 8: \n     - 8 is divisible by 2, so divide by 2: 8 ÷ 2 = 4\n     - 4 is divisible by 2, so divide by 2: 4 ÷ 2 = 2\n     - 2 is divisible by 2, so divide by 2: 2 ÷ 2 = 1\n     - Prime factorization of 8 is \\(2^3\\).\n\n   - For 54:\n     - 54 is divisible by 2, so divide by 2: 54 ÷ 2 = 27\n     - 27 is divisible by 3, so divide by 3: 27 ÷ 3 = 9\n     - 9 is divisible by 3, so divide by 3: 9 ÷ 3 = 3\n     - 3 is divisible by 3, so divide by 3: 3 ÷ 3 = 1\n     - Prime factorization of 54 is \\(2^1 \\times 3^3\\).\n\n3. **Determine the LCM Using Prime Factorization**:\n   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - From the factorizations:\n     - The prime number 2 appears as \\(2^3\\) in 8 and \\(2^1\\) in 54. The highest power is \\(2^3\\).\n     - The prime number 3 appears as \\(3^0\\) in 8 (since 8 has no factor of 3) and \\(3^3\\) in 54. The highest power is \\(3^3\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply the highest powers of all prime factors together:\n   - LCM = \\(2^3 \\times 3^3\\)\n   - Calculate \\(2^3 = 8\\) and \\(3^3 = 27\\).\n   - Multiply these results: \\(8 \\times 27 = 216\\).\n\n5. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Check that 216 is divisible by both 8 and 54:\n     - 216 ÷ 8 = 27 (an integer, so divisible)\n     - 216 ÷ 54 = 4 (an integer, so divisible)\n\nThus, the Least Common Multiple of 8 and 54 is 216.\n\nFinal answer: <<<216>>>."
