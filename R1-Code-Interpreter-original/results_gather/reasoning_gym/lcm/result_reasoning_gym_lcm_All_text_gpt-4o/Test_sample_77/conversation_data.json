    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 30 and 65, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - **30**: \n     - 30 can be divided by 2 (the smallest prime number), giving 30 ÷ 2 = 15.\n     - 15 can be divided by 3, giving 15 ÷ 3 = 5.\n     - 5 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 30 is \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5\\).\n   - **65**:\n     - 65 can be divided by 5, giving 65 ÷ 5 = 13.\n     - 13 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 65 is \\(5 \\times 13\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations: 2, 3, 5, 13.\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations.\n     - For 2: The highest power is \\(2^1\\) (from 30).\n     - For 3: The highest power is \\(3^1\\) (from 30).\n     - For 5: The highest power is \\(5^1\\) (appears in both 30 and 65).\n     - For 13: The highest power is \\(13^1\\) (from 65).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 13^1\\).\n   - LCM = 2 × 3 × 5 × 13.\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, multiply 2 and 3: \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by 5: \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\).\n   - Finally, multiply the result by 13: \\(30 \\times 13 = 390\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 30 and 65 is 390.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<390>>>"
