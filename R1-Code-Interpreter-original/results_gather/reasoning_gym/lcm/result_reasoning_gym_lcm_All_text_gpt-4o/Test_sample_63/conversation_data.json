    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 64 and 4, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - 64: \n     - 64 is a power of 2. \n     - 64 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2^6.\n   - 4:\n     - 4 is also a power of 2.\n     - 4 = 2 × 2 = 2^2.\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - For LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - Here, the only prime number involved is 2.\n   - The highest power of 2 in the factorizations is 2^6 (from 64).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Since the highest power of 2 is 2^6, the LCM is 2^6.\n\n5. **Verify the LCM**:\n   - Check that 2^6 (which is 64) is divisible by both original numbers:\n     - 64 ÷ 64 = 1 (divisible)\n     - 64 ÷ 4 = 16 (divisible)\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 64 and 4 is 64.\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 64 and 4 is:\n\n<<<64>>>"
