    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 44 and 72, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n   - For 44:\n     - 44 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 44 \\div 2 = 22 \\)\n     - 22 is even, so divide by 2 again: \\( 22 \\div 2 = 11 \\)\n     - 11 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 44 is \\( 2^2 \\times 11 \\).\n\n   - For 72:\n     - 72 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 72 \\div 2 = 36 \\)\n     - 36 is even, so divide by 2 again: \\( 36 \\div 2 = 18 \\)\n     - 18 is even, so divide by 2 again: \\( 18 \\div 2 = 9 \\)\n     - 9 is divisible by 3: \\( 9 \\div 3 = 3 \\)\n     - 3 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 72 is \\( 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\).\n\n2. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**:\n   - List all the prime numbers that appear in the factorizations: 2, 3, and 11.\n   - For each prime number, take the highest power that appears in the factorizations:\n     - The highest power of 2 is \\( 2^3 \\) (from 72).\n     - The highest power of 3 is \\( 3^2 \\) (from 72).\n     - The highest power of 11 is \\( 11^1 \\) (from 44).\n\n3. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM:\n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM} = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 11^1\n   \\]\n   - Calculate each part:\n     - \\( 2^3 = 8 \\)\n     - \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n     - \\( 11^1 = 11 \\)\n   - Multiply these results:\n     - \\( 8 \\times 9 = 72 \\)\n     - \\( 72 \\times 11 = 792 \\)\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 44 and 72 is 792.\n\nFinal answer: <<<792>>>."
