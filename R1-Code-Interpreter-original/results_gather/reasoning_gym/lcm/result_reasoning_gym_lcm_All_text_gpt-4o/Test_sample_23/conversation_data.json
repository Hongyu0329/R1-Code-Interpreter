    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 26: \n     - 26 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 26 ÷ 2 = 13, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 26 is \\(2 \\times 13\\).\n   - For 20:\n     - 20 is also an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n     - 20 ÷ 2 = 10, which is also even, so divide by 2 again.\n     - 10 ÷ 2 = 5, which is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 20 is \\(2^2 \\times 5\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**: For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime numbers involved are 2, 5, and 13.\n   - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^2\\) (from 20).\n   - The highest power of 5 is \\(5^1\\) (from 20).\n   - The highest power of 13 is \\(13^1\\) (from 26).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 13^1\\)\n   - LCM = 4 × 5 × 13\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, calculate 4 × 5 = 20.\n   - Then, calculate 20 × 13.\n   - 20 × 13 = 260.\n\n6. **Verify**: Ensure that 260 is divisible by both original numbers.\n   - 260 ÷ 26 = 10 (an integer, so divisible).\n   - 260 ÷ 20 = 13 (an integer, so divisible).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 26 and 20 is 260.\n\n<<<260>>>"
