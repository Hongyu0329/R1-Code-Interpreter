    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of LCM**: \n   - The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - First, we need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n\n3. **Prime Factorization of 91**:\n   - 91 is not an even number, so it is not divisible by 2.\n   - The sum of the digits of 91 is 9 + 1 = 10, which is not divisible by 3, so 91 is not divisible by 3.\n   - 91 ends in 1, so it is not divisible by 5.\n   - Check divisibility by 7: 91 ÷ 7 = 13, which is an integer. So, 91 = 7 × 13.\n\n4. **Prime Factorization of 30**:\n   - 30 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2: 30 ÷ 2 = 15.\n   - 15 is divisible by 3: 15 ÷ 3 = 5.\n   - 5 is a prime number.\n   - So, 30 = 2 × 3 × 5.\n\n5. **List the Prime Factors**:\n   - 91: 7, 13\n   - 30: 2, 3, 5\n\n6. **Determine the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - From 91: 7^1, 13^1\n   - From 30: 2^1, 3^1, 5^1\n   - LCM = 2^1 × 3^1 × 5^1 × 7^1 × 13^1\n\n7. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - LCM = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - 2 × 3 = 6\n     - 6 × 5 = 30\n     - 30 × 7 = 210\n     - 210 × 13 = 2730\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The LCM of 91 and 30 is 2730.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2730>>>"
