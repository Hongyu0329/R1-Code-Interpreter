    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Break down each number into its prime factors.\n   - For 70: \n     - 70 is divisible by 2 (the smallest prime number), so 70 รท 2 = 35.\n     - 35 is divisible by 5, so 35 รท 5 = 7.\n     - 7 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 70 is \\(2 \\times 5 \\times 7\\).\n\n   - For 46:\n     - 46 is divisible by 2, so 46 รท 2 = 23.\n     - 23 is a prime number.\n     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 46 is \\(2 \\times 23\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Power of Each Prime**: For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n   - The prime factors involved are 2, 5, 7, and 23.\n   - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^1\\) (appears in both factorizations).\n   - The highest power of 5 is \\(5^1\\) (appears in the factorization of 70).\n   - The highest power of 7 is \\(7^1\\) (appears in the factorization of 70).\n   - The highest power of 23 is \\(23^1\\) (appears in the factorization of 46).\n\n4. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n   - LCM = \\(2^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1 \\times 23^1\\)\n   - LCM = \\(2 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 23\\)\n\n5. **Perform the Multiplication**:\n   - First, calculate \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\).\n   - Then, calculate \\(10 \\times 7 = 70\\).\n   - Finally, calculate \\(70 \\times 23\\).\n     - Break it down: \\(70 \\times 23 = 70 \\times (20 + 3) = 70 \\times 20 + 70 \\times 3\\).\n     - Calculate \\(70 \\times 20 = 1400\\).\n     - Calculate \\(70 \\times 3 = 210\\).\n     - Add them together: \\(1400 + 210 = 1610\\).\n\nTherefore, the Least Common Multiple of 70 and 46 is 1610.\n\n<<<1610>>>"
