    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to find the GCD of the two numbers, 39 and 76. Once we have the GCD, we can use the formula above to calculate the LCM.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation using Python code to find the GCD and then the LCM.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 39\nb = 76\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the relationship between GCD and LCM\nlcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the LCM of 39 and 76.",
