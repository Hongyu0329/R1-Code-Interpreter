    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nIn this case, the numbers are 59 and 59. Since both numbers are the same, the GCD of 59 and 59 is 59. Therefore, the LCM can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(59, 59) = \\frac{59 \\times 59}{59} = 59 \\]\n\nLet's verify this with a Python script to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 59\nb = 59\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the formula\nlcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 59, which confirms our calculation. Since both numbers are the same, the LCM is simply the number itself.\n\n<<<59>>>"
