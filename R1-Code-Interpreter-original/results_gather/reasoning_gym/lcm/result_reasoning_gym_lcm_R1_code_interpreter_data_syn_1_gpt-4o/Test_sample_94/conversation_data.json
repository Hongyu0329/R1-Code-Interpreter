    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the LCM and the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nIn this case, the numbers are 61 and 61. Since both numbers are the same, the GCD of 61 and 61 is 61. Therefore, the LCM of two identical numbers is the number itself.\n\nLet's verify this using a Python script:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 61\nb = 61\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the formula\nlcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output as 61. This confirms our reasoning that the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two identical numbers, such as 61 and 61, is the number itself.\n\n<<<61>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of these numbers: 61, 61\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
