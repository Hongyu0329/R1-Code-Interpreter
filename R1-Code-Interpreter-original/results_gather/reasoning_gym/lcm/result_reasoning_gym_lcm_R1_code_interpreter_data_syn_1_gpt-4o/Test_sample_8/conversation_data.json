    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nGiven the numbers 17 and 98, we need to:\n\n1. Calculate the GCD of 17 and 98.\n2. Use the GCD to find the LCM using the formula above.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 17\nb = 98\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the formula\nlcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the LCM of 17 and 98.",
