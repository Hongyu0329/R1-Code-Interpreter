    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nGiven the numbers 64 and 4, we can calculate the LCM using this formula. First, we need to find the GCD of 64 and 4. Once we have the GCD, we can use it to find the LCM.\n\nLet's calculate the GCD and then use it to find the LCM.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given numbers\na = 64\nb = 4\n\n# Calculate GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate LCM using the formula\nlcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n\n# Output the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the LCM.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output as 64. This means the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 64 and 4 is 64.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that 64 is already a multiple of 4, so the smallest number that both 64 and 4 divide into without a remainder is 64 itself.\n\n<<<64>>>"
