    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nGiven the numbers 3 and 96, we can calculate their LCM using this formula. First, we need to find the GCD of 3 and 96, and then use it to find the LCM.\n\nLet's write a Python script to compute this:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 3\nb = 96\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the formula\nlcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the LCM of 3 and 96 using the GCD method. Let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output as 96. This means the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 3 and 96 is 96. \n\nThe reasoning behind this is that 96 is already a multiple of 3, so the smallest number that both 3 and 96 divide into without a remainder is 96 itself.\n\n<<<96>>>"
