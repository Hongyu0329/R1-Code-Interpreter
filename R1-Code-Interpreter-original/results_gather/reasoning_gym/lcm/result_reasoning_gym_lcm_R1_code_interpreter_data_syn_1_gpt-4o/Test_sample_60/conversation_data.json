    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nGiven the numbers 73 and 67, we need to:\n\n1. Calculate the GCD of 73 and 67.\n2. Use the GCD to find the LCM using the formula above.\n\nSince 73 and 67 are both prime numbers, their GCD is 1. Therefore, the LCM can be calculated directly as the product of the two numbers.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 73\nb = 67\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the formula\nlcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the LCM.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 4891. This means the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 73 and 67 is 4891.\n\n<<<4891>>>"
