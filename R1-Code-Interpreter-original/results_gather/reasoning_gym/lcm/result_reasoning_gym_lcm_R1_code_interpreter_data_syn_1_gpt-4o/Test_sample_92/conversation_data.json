    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nGiven the numbers 8 and 54, we need to:\n\n1. Calculate the GCD of 8 and 54.\n2. Use the GCD to find the LCM using the formula above.\n\nLet's write a Python script to compute the GCD and then use it to find the LCM.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given numbers\na = 8\nb = 54\n\n# Calculate GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate LCM using the formula\nlcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n\n# Output the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the LCM.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 216. This means the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 8 and 54 is 216.\n\n<<<216>>>"
