    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nGiven the numbers 94 and 47, we need to:\n\n1. Calculate the GCD of 94 and 47.\n2. Use the GCD to find the LCM using the formula above.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 94\nb = 47\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the relationship between GCD and LCM\nlcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n\n# Output the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the LCM.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 94. This means that the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 94 and 47 is 94. \n\nSince 47 is a factor of 94 (94 = 47 * 2), the LCM of 94 and 47 is simply 94.\n\n<<<94>>>"
