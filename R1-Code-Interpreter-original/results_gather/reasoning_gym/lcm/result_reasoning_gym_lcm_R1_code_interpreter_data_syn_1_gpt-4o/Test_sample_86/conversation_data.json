    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nFor the numbers 39 and 43, we first need to find their GCD. Since 39 and 43 are both prime numbers, their GCD is 1. Therefore, the LCM can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(39, 43) = \\frac{39 \\times 43}{1} = 39 \\times 43 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 39\nb = 43\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the formula\nlcm = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the LCM of 39 and 43.",
