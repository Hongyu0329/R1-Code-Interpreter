    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nGiven the numbers 44 and 88, we can calculate their GCD first and then use it to find the LCM.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation using Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 44\nb = 88\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the relationship between GCD and LCM\nlcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the LCM of 44 and 88.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 88. This means that the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 44 and 88 is 88.\n\n<<<88>>>"
