    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to find the GCD of the numbers 35 and 14. Then, we can use the formula to find the LCM.\n\nLet's calculate the GCD and then use it to find the LCM.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 35\nb = 14\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the relationship between GCD and LCM\nlcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the LCM.",
