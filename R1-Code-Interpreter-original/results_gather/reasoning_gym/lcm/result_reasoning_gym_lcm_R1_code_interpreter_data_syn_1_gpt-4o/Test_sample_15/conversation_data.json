    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the GCD of the two numbers, 74 and 44. Then, we can use the formula to find the LCM.\n\nLet's write a Python script to compute the GCD and then use it to find the LCM.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 74\nb = 44\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the relationship between GCD and LCM\nlcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the LCM of 74 and 44 using the GCD method. Let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output, which is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 74 and 44.\n\nThe LCM of 74 and 44 is 1628.\n\n<<<1628>>>"
