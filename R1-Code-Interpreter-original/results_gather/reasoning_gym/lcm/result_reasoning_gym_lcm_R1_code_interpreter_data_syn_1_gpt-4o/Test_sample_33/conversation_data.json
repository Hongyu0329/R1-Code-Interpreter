    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nIn this case, the numbers are 37 and 37. Since both numbers are the same, the GCD of 37 and 37 is 37. Therefore, the LCM of two identical numbers is the number itself.\n\nLet's verify this using a simple Python script to compute the LCM.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 37\nb = 37\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the formula\nlcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output as 37. This confirms our reasoning that the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two identical numbers, such as 37 and 37, is the number itself.\n\n<<<37>>>"
