    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nGiven the numbers 3 and 72, we need to:\n\n1. Calculate the GCD of 3 and 72.\n2. Use the GCD to find the LCM using the formula above.\n\nLet's write a Python script to compute this:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 3\nb = 72\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the formula\nlcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the LCM.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output as 72. This means the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 3 and 72 is 72.\n\n<<<72>>>"
