    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the GCD of the two numbers, 99 and 63. Then, we can use the formula to find the LCM.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation using Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 99\nb = 63\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the relationship between GCD and LCM\nlcm = abs(a * b) // gcd\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the LCM of 99 and 63 by first finding their GCD and then using the formula to find the LCM. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 99 and 63 as 693. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<693>>>"
