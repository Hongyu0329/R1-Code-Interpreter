    "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and LCM. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the GCD of the two numbers, 29 and 33. Since 29 is a prime number and does not divide 33, the GCD of 29 and 33 is 1.\n\nNow, we can use the formula to find the LCM:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(29, 33) = \\frac{|29 \\times 33|}{1} = 29 \\times 33 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers\na = 29\nb = 33\n\n# Calculate the LCM using the formula\nlcm = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lcm)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the LCM of 29 and 33.",
