    "Let me analyze this Tsumego (Go problem) step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we see:\n   - There are several groups of stones on the board\n   - The main action seems to be in the lower right area\n   - There's a black group connected from X1 to X4\n   - There's a white group in the lower right that might be vulnerable\n\n2) Looking for weaknesses:\n   - The white stones at F3, G2, H2 form a group\n   - This group appears to be connected to G1\n   - Black has stones at F2, F1, G3, H3, I2 surrounding these white stones\n\n3) Key observations:\n   - The white stones at G2, H2 are crucial for white's survival\n   - If black can cut off or capture these stones, it would be a significant gain\n   - The point at G1 is particularly important as it's a vital connection point\n\n4) Analysis of potential moves:\n   - Looking at the shape, if Black can play at G1, it would cut off the white stones\n   - G1 would create a situation where the white stones at G2 and H2 would be in atari\n   - White cannot escape because they are surrounded by black stones\n\n5) Testing the sequence:\n   - If Black plays G1:\n     * White cannot connect at H1 because it would be self-atari\n     * White cannot save both G2 and H2\n     * The white stones will be captured\n\nThe key move is G1. This move creates a cutting point that white cannot defend against. It puts the white stones in an impossible situation where they cannot escape or make two eyes.\n\n<<<G1>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Tsumego time.
