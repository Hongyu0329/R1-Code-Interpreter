    "Let me analyze this Tsumego (Go problem) step by step.\n\n1) First, let's identify the key area of focus:\n   - There's a group of white stones (O) in the upper left corner\n   - Black stones (X) are surrounding them from multiple sides\n   - The key is to find a move that will lead to capturing white stones\n\n2) Looking at the white group:\n   - Main white stones are at B11, C11, C10\n   - Connected to O stones at A12, C12\n   - This group appears to be under pressure\n\n3) Let's analyze potential vital points:\n   - The space at B10 is already filled by Black\n   - D11 is an empty point that looks critical\n   - This could be a key intersection for cutting off white's escape\n\n4) Reading the sequence:\n   - If Black plays at D11:\n     * It cuts off the white stones\n     * White has no way to connect or make two eyes\n     * The white group becomes captured\n\n5) Verification:\n   - After Black D11:\n     * White can't escape to the right (blocked)\n     * Can't make eyes within the confined space\n     * No way to connect to other white stones\n     * The group will be captured\n\nThe key move is D11. This move cuts off the white group's escape route and ensures capture of the white stones in the corner.\n\n<<<D11>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
