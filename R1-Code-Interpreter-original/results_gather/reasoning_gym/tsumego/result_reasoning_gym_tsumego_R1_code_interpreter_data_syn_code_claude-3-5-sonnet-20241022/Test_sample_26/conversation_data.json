    "Let me analyze this Tsumego (Go problem) step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand the position:\n   - There are several groups of stones on the board\n   - The most interesting area appears to be in the bottom right corner\n   - There's a group of white stones (O) that might be vulnerable\n\n2) In the bottom right corner:\n   - White has stones at K1, K2, K3, L2, L3\n   - Black has stones at J1, J2, J3, L2, M3\n   - There's a key empty point at L1\n\n3) Looking at liberties:\n   - The white group has limited liberties\n   - The empty point at L1 seems critical\n   - If Black can force a sequence here, it might capture some stones\n\n4) Let's analyze the key point:\n   - L1 is a vital point for both sides\n   - If Black plays at L1, it threatens to capture the white stones\n   - White would need to respond, but might not have enough liberties\n\n5) Let's verify this is the key move:\n   - Playing at L1 would put immediate pressure on the white stones\n   - White's group would be in serious trouble\n   - The surrounding black stones are strong enough to maintain the pressure\n\nAfter analyzing the position, it's clear that L1 is the key move for Black. This move would create a situation where White's stones cannot escape and would be captured.\n\n<<<L1>>>"
