    "Let me analyze this Go position and find the best move to capture white stones.\n\nLet's break this down:\n1. We need to find a move that can capture the maximum number of white stones\n2. Looking at the board, there's a cluster of white stones in the top-left area (B8, C8, B6, C6, D6, B5)\n3. We need to check if there's a move that can capture these stones by finding their liberties\n\nLet me write code to help analyze the position and find potential capturing moves:\n\n```python\ndef create_board():\n    board = [['.'] * 10 for _ in range(10)]\n    # Add black stones (X)\n    black_stones = [(8,2), (7,3), (6,3), (5,4), (4,1), (3,1), (2,2), (2,8), (8,0)]\n    # Add white stones (O)\n    white_stones = [(7,1), (7,2), (5,1), (5,2), (5,0), (6,0), (8,5)]\n    \n    for x, y in black_stones:\n        board[y][x] = 'X'\n    for x, y in white_stones:\n        board[y][x] = 'O'\n    return board\n\ndef get_liberties(board, x, y, visited=None):\n    if visited is None:\n        visited = set()\n    \n    if x < 0 or x >= 10 or y < 0 or y >= 10:\n        return set()\n    \n    stone = board[y][x]\n    if stone == '.':\n        return {(x,y)}\n    \n    if stone not in 'OX' or (x,y) in visited:\n        return set()\n    \n    visited.add((x,y))\n    liberties = set()\n    \n    # Check all adjacent positions\n    for dx, dy in [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]:\n        new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy\n        liberties.update(get_liberties(board, new_x, new_y, visited))\n    \n    return liberties\n\ndef find_capturing_moves(board):\n    potential_moves = []\n    \n    # Find all white groups and their liberties\n    visited = set()\n    for y in range(10):\n        for x in range(10):\n            if board[y][x] == 'O' and (x,y) not in visited:\n                liberties = get_liberties(board, x, y)\n                if len(liberties) == 1:\n                    liberty = liberties.pop()\n                    potential_moves.append((liberty, (x,y)))\n    \n    return potential_moves\n\nboard = create_board()\nmoves = find_capturing_moves(board)\n\n# Convert coordinates to Go notation\ndef coord_to_notation(x, y):\n    return f\"{chr(65+x)}{10-y}\"\n\nfor move, stone in moves:\n    print(f\"Move at {coord_to_notation(move[0], move[1])} can capture stone at {coord_to_notation(stone[0], stone[1])}\")\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the position, I can see that the key move is at C5 (coordinates C,5). This move would capture several white stones by cutting off their last liberty.\n\nWhen Black plays at C5:\n1. It will capture the white stones at B5, B6, C6, and D6\n2. These stones are already surrounded on three sides by black stones\n3. Playing at C5 removes their last liberty, resulting in their capture\n\nThis is the most efficient move as it captures the maximum number of white stones in a single move.\n\n<<<C5>>>"
