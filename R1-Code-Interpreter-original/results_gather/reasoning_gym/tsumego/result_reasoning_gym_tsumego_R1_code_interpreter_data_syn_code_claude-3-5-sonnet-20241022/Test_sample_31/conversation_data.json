    "Let me analyze this Tsumego (Go problem) step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're looking at:\n   - There's a group of white stones (O) in the upper left area (B8, C8, C7)\n   - These white stones are surrounded by black stones (X)\n   - The key is to find a move that will capture these white stones\n\n2) In Go, to capture stones, we need to remove all liberties (empty adjacent points) from the opponent's stones.\n\n3) Looking at the white group:\n   - It consists of three stones: B8, C8, C7\n   - Currently has liberties at D8 and D7\n   - These are the points we need to focus on\n\n4) The principle of capturing:\n   - We need to fill all liberties while maintaining our own stones' safety\n   - The move should not allow white to escape or create a ko situation\n\n5) Analysis:\n   - If Black plays at D7, White can play at D8 and vice versa\n   - However, if Black plays at D8:\n   - White cannot play at D7 because it would be self-atari\n   - This makes D8 the key move\n\nThe move at D8 is the vital point because:\n1) It takes away a critical liberty\n2) White cannot respond effectively at D7 as it would be self-atari\n3) The white group will be captured on the next move\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is D8.\n\n<<<D8>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
