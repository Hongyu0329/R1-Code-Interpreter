    "Let me analyze this Tsumego (Go problem) step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand the position:\n   - There's a group of white stones in the bottom left corner\n   - The key white stones are at C1, O5, O4, O3\n   - Black has surrounded most of these stones\n   - We need to find a move that will lead to capturing white stones\n\n2) Let's look for vital points:\n   - The white stones at O5, O4, O3 form a chain\n   - This chain has limited liberties\n   - Black stones around it are relatively secure\n\n3) Looking at the shape:\n   - The point at B3 seems to be a key point\n   - It would reduce white's liberties significantly\n   - It creates a net around the white stones\n\n4) Let's verify the sequence:\n   - If Black plays at B3:\n     - White can't escape easily\n     - The surrounding black stones are well connected\n     - White's liberties are severely limited\n\n5) After analyzing the position and possible variations, B3 appears to be the key move that will lead to capturing the white stones. This move:\n   - Creates a net around the white stones\n   - Reduces white's liberties\n   - Makes use of the existing black structure\n   - Prevents white from making two eyes or escaping\n\n<<<B3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Tsumego time.
