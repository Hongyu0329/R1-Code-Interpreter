    "Let me analyze this Tsumego (Go problem) step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand the position:\n   - There's a group of white stones (O) in the upper right\n   - Black (X) has surrounded most of these stones\n   - The key is to find a move that will lead to capturing these white stones\n\n2) Looking at the white group:\n   - It consists of three stones at F8, G8, and G7\n   - These stones are almost completely surrounded\n   - They have potential escape routes that need to be blocked\n\n3) Key observations:\n   - The white stones are in a precarious position\n   - Black needs to find a move that will ensure capture\n   - We need to look for vital points that restrict white's liberties\n\n4) Let's analyze the liberties of the white group:\n   - The main liberties appear to be around H8\n   - H8 seems to be a critical point\n\n5) If Black plays at H8:\n   - It would connect Black's stones\n   - It would completely surround the white group\n   - White would have no way to escape or make two eyes\n\nAfter analyzing the position, the key move becomes clear. Black should play at H8.\n\nThis move:\n- Connects Black's stones\n- Completes the surrounding of the white group\n- Leaves white with no way to escape or make two eyes\n- Ensures the capture of the three white stones\n\n<<<H8>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
