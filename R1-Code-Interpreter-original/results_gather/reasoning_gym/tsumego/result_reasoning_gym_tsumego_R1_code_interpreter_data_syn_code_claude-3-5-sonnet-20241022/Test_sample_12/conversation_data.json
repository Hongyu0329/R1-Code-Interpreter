    "Let me analyze this Tsumego (Go problem) step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand the position:\n   - There's a group of white stones (O) in the bottom left area\n   - Black stones (X) surround these white stones partially\n   - The key is to find a move that will lead to capturing white stones\n\n2) Looking at the white group:\n   - Main white stones are at B4, C4, B5, C5\n   - These stones are connected\n   - There's a weakness in their shape\n\n3) Analyzing potential moves:\n   - The most critical area is around the white stones\n   - We need to look for moves that could cut off white's escape routes\n   - D4 looks like a vital point as it's at the edge of the white group\n\n4) Let's verify D4 as the key move:\n   - If Black plays at D4:\n     * White is surrounded on three sides\n     * White can't escape to the right due to Black's strength\n     * White's group will be captured\n\n5) After D4:\n   - White has no way to save the stones\n   - The surrounding black stones are strong enough\n   - This creates a capturing net (geta)\n\nThe move D4 is the key move that leads to the capture of the white stones. It's a classic capturing technique in Go where you place a stone at a vital point that prevents the opponent's stones from escaping.\n\n<<<D4>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Tsumego time.
