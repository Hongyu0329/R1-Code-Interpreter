    "Let me analyze this Tsumego (Go problem) step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand the position:\n   - There's a group of white stones in the center (D3, E3, D2)\n   - Black has surrounding stones creating pressure\n   - The key is to find a move that will lead to capturing white stones\n\n2) Let's identify key points:\n   - The white stones are connected but have limited liberties\n   - Black needs to reduce white's liberties while maintaining its own connections\n   - Need to check if there are any vital points that could trap the white stones\n\n3) Let's analyze potential moves:\n   - Looking at the shape, the white stones in D3, E3, and D2 are the main target\n   - Black needs to find a move that will eventually lead to capturing these stones\n   - The empty point at E2 seems critical\n\n4) Let's verify the sequence:\n   - If Black plays at E2:\n     * It threatens to cut off and capture the white stones\n     * White can't escape easily due to surrounding black stones\n     * The white stones will be trapped\n\n5) Testing the sequence:\n   - Black E2\n   - If White tries to escape, Black can maintain pressure and eventually capture\n\nThe key move is E2 (coordinates 'E2'). This move creates a situation where White's stones will be captured as they don't have enough liberties to escape, and Black's surrounding position is strong enough to maintain the capture.\n\n<<<E2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
