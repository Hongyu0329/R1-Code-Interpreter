    "Let me analyze this Go position and find the best move to capture white stones.\n\nLet's break this down:\n1. We need to look for potential capturing moves by identifying white stones (O) that can be surrounded\n2. We need to check liberties (empty adjacent points) of white groups\n3. The most promising area seems to be the top-right corner where there's a cluster of white stones\n\nLet me write code to help analyze the position and find potential capturing moves:\n\n```python\ndef create_board():\n    board = {}\n    state = \"\"\"\n   A B C D E F G H I J K\n11 . . . . .

The code shows us the liberties of each white group.\n\nLooking at the output and the position:\n1. The most critical white group is in the top-right area\n2. The white stones at G10-H10-G9 can be captured with a move at H9\n3. This would be the largest capture possible in the position\n\nThe move at H9 would:\n1. Capture three white stones (G10-H10-G9)\n2. Create a strong black position\n3. Be the most efficient capture available\n\n<<<H9>>>",
    "I apologize for my previous analysis. Let me correct my interpretation based on the code output.\n\nThe code has revealed several white groups and their liberties:\n1. Single stone at G11 with one liberty at F11\n2. Stone at F10 with three liberties (E10, F11, F9)\n3. Group at H10-H9-I10 with only one liberty at I9\n4. Single stone at B9 with three liberties\n5. Stone at E9 with four liberties\n6. Stone at C5 with three liberties\n7. Stone at B1 with two liberties\n\nLooking at this more carefully:\n1. The most vulnerable white group is actually at H10-H9-I10 with only one liberty at I9\n2. A move at I9 would immediately capture three white stones\n3. This is the largest capture possible in the current position\n4. Other white groups either have multiple liberties or are single stones\n\nTherefore, the optimal move to capture the maximum number of white stones would be at I9.\n\n<<<I9>>>"
