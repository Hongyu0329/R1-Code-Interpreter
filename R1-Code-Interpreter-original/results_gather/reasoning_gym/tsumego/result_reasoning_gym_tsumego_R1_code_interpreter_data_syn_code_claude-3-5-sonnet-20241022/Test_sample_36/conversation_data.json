    "Let me analyze this Tsumego (Go problem) step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand the position:\n   - There's a group of white stones (O) in the upper right corner\n   - Black (X) has stones surrounding this white group\n   - The white group seems to be in danger of being captured\n\n2) Let's identify key points:\n   - The white group consists of stones at J9, K9, L9, K8, L8\n   - Black has surrounding stones at I9, G9, L10, K11, L11\n   - There appears to be a potential weakness in the white group's shape\n\n3) Let's analyze the vital points:\n   - Looking at the shape, K10 appears to be a critical point\n   - If Black can play at K10, it would create a situation where White cannot escape\n\n4) Let's verify the sequence:\n   - If Black plays at K10:\n     * It would create a situation where White is completely surrounded\n     * White would have no way to make two eyes\n     * White would not be able to connect to any other stones\n     * The white group would be captured\n\n5) Testing the move:\n   - K10 would be between white stones\n   - It would create a position where White has no escape\n   - No other move seems to accomplish the same goal as effectively\n\nAfter analyzing the position and potential sequences, the key move for Black is K10. This move creates a position where White cannot escape and the group will be captured.\n\n<<<K10>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
