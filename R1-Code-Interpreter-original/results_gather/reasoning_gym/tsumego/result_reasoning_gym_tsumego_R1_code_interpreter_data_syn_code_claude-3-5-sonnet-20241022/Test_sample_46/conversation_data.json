    "Let me analyze this Go position and find the best move to capture white stones.\n\nLet's break this down:\n1. We need to find a move that can capture the maximum number of white stones\n2. We need to look for groups of white stones that can be surrounded\n3. We need to check if there are any weak points in white's formation\n\nLooking at the board:\n- There's a significant cluster of white stones in the center (around C5-E5)\n- Some white stones are already partially surrounded\n- We need to find a move that can complete the encirclement\n\nLet me write code to analyze possible moves and their capturing potential:\n\n```python\ndef print_board(board):\n    print(\"   A B C D E F G H I J\")\n    for i in range(10):\n        row = 10 - i\n        print(f\"{row:2d} {' '.join(board[i])}\")\n\ndef is_valid(x, y):\n    return 0 <= x < 10 and 0 <= y < 10\n\ndef get_neighbors(x, y):\n    return [(x+dx, y+dy) for dx, dy in [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)] if is_valid(x+dx, y+dy)]\n\ndef count_captures(board, move_x, move_y):\n    if board[move_y][move_x] != '.':\n        return -1\n    \n    # Temporarily place the black stone\n    board[move_y][move_x] = 'X'\n    \n    # Check for captures\n    captured = set()\n    checked = set()\n    \n    def check_group(x, y, stone):\n        if (x, y) in checked:\n            return False\n        checked.add((x, y))\n        \n        if board[y][x] == '.':\n            return False\n        if board[y][x] != stone:\n            return True\n        \n        group = {(x, y)}\n        liberty = False\n        stack = [(x, y)]\n        \n        while stack:\n            cx, cy = stack.pop()\n            for nx, ny in get_neighbors(cx, cy):\n                if board[ny][nx] == '.':\n                    liberty = True\n                elif board[ny][nx] == stone and (nx, ny) not in group:\n                    group.add((nx, ny))\n                    stack.append((nx, ny))\n        \n        if not liberty:\n            captured.update(group)\n        return True\n\n    # Check all adjacent positions\n    for nx, ny in get_neighbors(move_x, move_y):\n        if board[ny][nx] == 'O':\n            check_group(nx, ny, 'O')\n    \n    # Remove the temporary stone\n    board[move_y][move_x] = '.'\n    \n    return len(captured)\n\n# Initialize the board\nboard = [['.'] * 10 for _ in range(10)]\n# Set up the position\nposition = \"\"\"\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . .

Connecting with the black stones at E6 and E4\n2. Creating a complete enclosure around the white stones\n3. Leaving the white stones with no liberties, thus capturing them\n\nThe move at E7 is the most effective as it captures the maximum number of white stones in a single move by completing the surrounding formation."
