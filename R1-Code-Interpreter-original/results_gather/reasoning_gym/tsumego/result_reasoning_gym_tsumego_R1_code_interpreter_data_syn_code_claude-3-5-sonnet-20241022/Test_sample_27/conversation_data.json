    "Let me analyze this Tsumego (Go problem) step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand the position:\n   - There's a group of white stones (O) in the center-left area\n   - Black stones (X) surround these white stones partially\n   - The key is to find a move that will lead to capturing white stones\n\n2) Looking at the white group:\n   - Main white stones are at C4, D4, E4, D3, E2, F1\n   - These stones are partially surrounded by black stones\n   - We need to find a vital point that will trap these stones\n\n3) Key observations:\n   - The white stones don't have two eyes\n   - There appears to be a weakness around D3-D4 area\n   - Black might be able to cut off or capture some stones\n\n4) Let's analyze the possible moves:\n   - Looking at the shape, D5 appears to be a critical point\n   - This move would:\n     * Split white's potential eye space\n     * Create a strong connection for black\n     * Force white into a difficult position\n\n5) After D5:\n   - White would have trouble making two eyes\n   - The stones would be effectively captured\n   - No easy escape route for white\n\nThe key move appears to be D5, as it's the vital point that splits white's potential eye space and creates a strong position for black to capture the white stones.\n\n<<<D5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Tsumego time.
