    "Let me analyze this Tsumego (Go problem) step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand the position:\n   - There's a group of black stones (X) connected from D2-D3 up to D8-D10\n   - White stones (O) are surrounding parts of this black group\n   - The key area of focus is around the center where black and white stones interact\n\n2) Looking for vital points:\n   - The white stones at E8-E9-F9 form a group that might be vulnerable\n   - There's a potential cutting point at F8\n   - Black needs to find a move that can capture some white stones\n\n3) Strategic analysis:\n   - If Black can play at F8, it would create a situation where the white stones at E8-E9-F9 would be in trouble\n   - After F8, White would have difficulty connecting or escaping\n   - The white stones would be caught in a ladder or net\n\n4) Testing the sequence:\n   - Black plays F8\n   - If White tries to escape at G8, Black can follow at G9\n   - If White tries to connect at G9, Black can still capture\n\nThe key move is F8. This move creates a situation where White cannot save the stones at E8-E9-F9. It's a classic capturing technique in Go where you place a stone at a vital point that splits the opponent's group and makes it impossible to form two eyes or escape.\n\n<<<F8>>>"
