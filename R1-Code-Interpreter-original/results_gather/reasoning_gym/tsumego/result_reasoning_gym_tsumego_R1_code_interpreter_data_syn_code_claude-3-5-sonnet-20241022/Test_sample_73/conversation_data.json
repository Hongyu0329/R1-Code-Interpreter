    "Let me analyze this Go position and find the best move for Black to capture the maximum number of White stones.\n\nLet me think through this:\n\n1) First, I need to understand the current position:\n   - There are several white stones (O) scattered on the board\n   - Black stones (X) are mainly concentrated in the middle-right area\n   - Looking for potential capturing moves that could surround white stones\n\n2) I'll write code to:\n   - Represent the board\n   - Check for potential capturing moves\n   - Evaluate which move captures the most stones\n\n```python\ndef create_board():\n    board = {}\n    board_str = \"\"\"\n   A B C D E F G H I J K L M\n13 . . . .

This move will capture the white stones at G4, I4, and J4 by completing the encirclement.\n\nThe move at F3 works because:\n1) It connects with existing black stones at F4 and I3\n2) Creates a complete surrounding of the white stones\n3) Leaves the white stones with no liberties, thus capturing them\n\n<<<F3>>>",
    "I apologize for my previous analysis. Let me review the code output and the position again.\n\nThe code has found that J5 is actually the best move, capturing 4 white stones. Let me analyze why this is better:\n\nLooking at the position around J5:\n1) There are white stones at J4, K4, I4, and J3\n2) Black stones are already placed at:\n   - I5 and K5 (above)\n   - I3 and K3 (below)\n   - X2 (further below)\n\nWhen Black plays at J5:\n1) It creates a complete enclosure of the four white stones\n2) The white stones at J4, K4, I4, and J3 become completely surrounded with no liberties\n3) This forms a perfect capture pattern with existing black stones\n\nThis is indeed better than my previous suggestion of F3 because:\n1) It captures more stones (4 vs 3)\n2) The capture is immediate and definite\n3) The position is already set up with supporting black stones\n\n<<<J5>>>"
