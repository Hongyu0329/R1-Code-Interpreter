    "Let me analyze this Tsumego (Go problem) step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand the position:\n   - There's a group of white stones in the upper right corner\n   - Black has some stones surrounding these white stones\n   - The key would be to find a move that leads to capturing white stones\n\n2) Looking at the shape:\n   - White stones at J11, K12, I10, I9, I8 form a group\n   - Black stones at I11, H10, G9, H8, J10, J9, K9, J8 surround them\n   - There appears to be potential weakness in white's shape\n\n3) Let's analyze the liberties:\n   - The white group seems to have limited liberties\n   - Key points to consider would be around H11, I11, and K11 area\n\n4) The vital point appears to be at K11:\n   - If Black plays at K11:\n     - It reduces white's liberties\n     - White can't escape easily\n     - It creates a capturing net\n\n5) After K11:\n   - White's group will be in atari\n   - White cannot escape due to surrounding black stones\n   - This leads to capture of the white stones\n\nThe key move is K11. This move creates a situation where white's stones cannot escape and will be captured.\n\n<<<K11>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Tsumego time.
