    "Let me analyze this Tsumego (Go problem) step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand the position:\n   - There's a group of black stones connected from G3 to I3\n   - White stones at I8, H2, I2, B1, F1, and I1\n   - The black stones seem to be surrounding some white stones\n   - We need to find a move that captures white stones\n\n2) Looking at the position:\n   - The white stones at H2, I2, and I1 form a group\n   - These white stones are already mostly surrounded by black\n   - We need to find a move that completes the capture\n\n3) Let's analyze the liberties (empty points adjacent to stones) of the white group:\n   - The white stones at H2, I2, and I1 are connected\n   - They currently have liberties at H1 and G2\n\n4) Key observation:\n   - If Black can play at H1, it would reduce white's liberties to just G2\n   - Then if Black can also play at G2, the white group would be captured\n\n5) The move at H1 appears to be the vital point:\n   - It reduces white's liberties immediately\n   - It threatens to complete the capture\n   - White cannot escape after this move\n\nAfter analyzing the position, the key move for Black is H1. This move will reduce the white group's liberties and lead to a capture.\n\n<<<H1>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
