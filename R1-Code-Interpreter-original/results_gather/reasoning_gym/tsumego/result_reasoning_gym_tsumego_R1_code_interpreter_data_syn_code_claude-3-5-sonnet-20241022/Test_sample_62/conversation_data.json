    "Let me analyze this Tsumego (Go problem) step by step.\n\n1) First, let's identify the key area:\n   - There's a group of white stones (O) on the right side\n   - Black stones (X) are surrounding them from multiple directions\n   - The key area appears to be around columns J-M and rows 4-7\n\n2) Looking at the shape:\n   - White has a group at M6-M7 area\n   - Black has stones at M7, L7, L4, L3\n   - White seems to have some weaknesses in their shape\n\n3) Strategic analysis:\n   - Black needs to find a move that can capture some white stones\n   - The white stones in the M6-M7 area look vulnerable\n   - We need to look for a move that can cut off white's escape routes\n\n4) Key observations:\n   - The white stones at M6-M7 are connected to other white stones\n   - Black has stones at M7 and L7 which are putting pressure from above\n   - The key would be to find a move that can isolate and capture white stones\n\n5) Looking at the vital points:\n   - M5 looks like a critical point\n   - It would cut off the white stones above from the ones below\n   - After M5, white would be in trouble as their stones would be separated\n\nAfter analyzing the position, the key move appears to be at M5. This move would:\n1) Cut white's group into two parts\n2) Create a capturing sequence\n3) Leave white without good responses\n\nThe move at M5 would be decisive because:\n- It separates white's stones\n- White can't connect back due to black's surrounding stones\n- Some white stones will be captured as a result\n\n<<<M5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Tsumego time.
