    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to find a move for Black that captures some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Weak Groups**: \n   - The White stones at D9, F7, F6, G6, and H6 form a group that is surrounded by Black stones. This group is a potential target for capture.\n\n2. **Liberty Count**:\n   - The White group has liberties at E6, E7, and G7. These are the points where Black can play to reduce White's liberties.\n\n3. **Key Points**:\n   - Playing at E6 would reduce the liberties of the White group significantly. It would also threaten to capture the White stones directly if White does not respond correctly.\n\n4. **Evaluate Other Moves**:\n   - Playing at E7 or G7 would also reduce liberties, but E6 is more direct and forces White to respond immediately to avoid capture.\n\n5. **Consider White's Responses**:\n   - If Black plays at E6, White must respond to prevent immediate capture. If White plays at E7 or G7, Black can continue to reduce liberties and eventually capture the group.\n\n6. **Final Decision**:\n   - The move at E6 is the most effective in capturing the White stones because it directly reduces the liberties of the White group and forces White into a defensive position.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is at coordinates <<<E6>>>."
