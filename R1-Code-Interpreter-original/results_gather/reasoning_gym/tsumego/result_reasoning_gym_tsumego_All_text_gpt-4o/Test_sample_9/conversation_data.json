    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move for Black (X) that will capture some White (O) stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Vulnerable White Stones:**\n   - The White stones at B12, C12, B11, and C11 are surrounded by Black stones on the left and top, making them potential targets for capture.\n\n2. **Examine Black's Surrounding Stones:**\n   - Black has stones at A12, D12, A11, and D10, which are in proximity to the White stones and can be used to form a net or a ladder to capture them.\n\n3. **Potential Key Moves:**\n   - A move at D11 would place a Black stone adjacent to the White stones at C11 and B11, potentially cutting off their escape routes and capturing them.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Move at D11:**\n   - Placing a Black stone at D11 would create a situation where the White stones at B11 and C11 have no liberties left, as they are surrounded by Black stones on all sides.\n\n5. **Check for Other Possibilities:**\n   - Other moves, such as placing a stone at C10 or D12, do not immediately capture the White stones and allow White to escape or connect.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The move at D11 is the most effective in capturing the White stones at B11 and C11, as it directly reduces their liberties to zero.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black to capture the White stones is: <<<D11>>>."
