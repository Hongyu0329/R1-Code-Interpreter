    "To solve this Go challenge, we need to analyze the board and identify potential moves for Black (X) that can capture the maximum number of White (O) stones. Let's break down the board and consider the possible moves:\n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: \n   - The White stones are located at the following positions:\n     - D7\n     - I4\n     - G3\n     - I3\n     - J3\n     - A2\n     - I2\n     - J2\n     - I1\n\n2. **Assess Liberties**:\n   - Each group of White stones needs to be assessed for liberties (empty adjacent points). Capturing a group requires occupying all its liberties.\n\n3. **Potential Captures**:\n   - **Group at D7**: This stone has liberties at C7, D6, and E7. It is surrounded by Black stones at E7 and D6, so playing at C7 will capture it.\n   - **Group at I4**: This stone has liberties at H4, I5, and J4. It is surrounded by Black stones at H4 and J4, so playing at I5 will capture it.\n   - **Group at G3, I3, J3**: These stones form a chain with liberties at F3, G2, H3, and I4. Playing at G2 will capture the entire chain.\n   - **Group at A2**: This stone has liberties at A1, B2, and A3. It is not surrounded by Black stones, so it cannot be captured immediately.\n   - **Group at I2, J2**: These stones have liberties at H2, I1, and J1. Playing at H2 will capture them.\n   - **Group at I1**: This stone has liberties at H1 and J1. It is not surrounded by Black stones, so it cannot be captured immediately.\n\n4. **Optimal Move**:\n   - The move that captures the most stones is at G2, which captures the chain at G3, I3, and J3.\n\nBy analyzing the board and considering the liberties of each group, the optimal move for Black to capture the most White stones is:\n\n<<<G2>>>"
