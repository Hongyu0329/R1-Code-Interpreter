    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to find a move for Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Vulnerable White Stones:**\n   - The White stones at D9, E8, F8, F7, and H4 are surrounded by Black stones and are potential targets for capture.\n\n2. **Examine Black's Surrounding Stones:**\n   - Black has stones at F9, G7, and F6, which are already surrounding the White stones at E8 and F8.\n   - The Black stone at G7 is crucial as it is part of the surrounding group.\n\n3. **Potential Moves for Black:**\n   - Black can play at E7 to put more pressure on the White stones at E8 and F8.\n   - Black can also consider playing at G8 to further surround the White stones.\n\n4. **Key Move Analysis:**\n   - Playing at E7 would directly threaten the White stones at E8 and F8, as it would cut off their liberties.\n   - Playing at G8 would also be effective, but E7 seems more direct in capturing the stones.\n\n5. **Liberty Count:**\n   - After playing E7, the White stones at E8 and F8 would have only one liberty left at D8.\n   - Black can then capture these stones by playing at D8 in the subsequent move.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The key move for Black is to play at E7, which will lead to the capture of the White stones at E8 and F8.\n\nThe key move for Black is: <<<E7>>>"
