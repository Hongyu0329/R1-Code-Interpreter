    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to find a move for Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Vulnerable White Stones:**\n   - The White stones at `G11`, `C7`, `F3`, `G3`, `H3`, `F2`, `G2`, and `F1` are surrounded by Black stones or the edge of the board, making them potential targets for capture.\n\n2. **Examine Black's Surrounding Stones:**\n   - Black has stones at `A9`, `C8`, `E8`, `C4`, `G4`, `F2`, `E2`, and `A1`. These stones can be used to surround and capture White stones.\n\n3. **Key Points of Attack:**\n   - The White stones at `F3`, `G3`, and `H3` are in a precarious position, as they are surrounded by Black stones on `E2`, `F2`, and `G4`. Capturing these stones would be advantageous.\n\n4. **Potential Moves:**\n   - Placing a Black stone at `F4` would cut off the escape route for the White stones at `F3`, `G3`, and `H3`, potentially capturing them.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Move:**\n   - By placing a Black stone at `F4`, Black can effectively surround the White stones at `F3`, `G3`, and `H3`, leading to their capture.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The key move for Black is to place a stone at `F4`, which will capture the White stones at `F3`, `G3`, and `H3`.\n\nThe key move for Black is: <<<F4>>>"
