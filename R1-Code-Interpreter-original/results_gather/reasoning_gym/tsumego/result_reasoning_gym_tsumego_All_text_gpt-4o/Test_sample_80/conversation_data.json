    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to find a move for Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Vulnerable White Stones:**\n   - The White stones at D5, C5, and C4 are surrounded by Black stones on three sides. These stones are vulnerable to capture.\n\n2. **Examine Black's Surrounding Stones:**\n   - Black has stones at C6, D6, B5, E5, and D4, which are surrounding the White stones. These stones form a potential net to capture the White stones.\n\n3. **Potential Key Moves:**\n   - Black can play at C5 to directly capture the White stones at D5 and C5.\n   - Black can also consider playing at D4 to strengthen the net around the White stones.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Move at C5:**\n   - Playing at C5 will immediately capture the White stones at D5 and C5 because they will have no liberties left.\n   - This move is effective because it directly reduces White's liberties and captures stones.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Move at D4:**\n   - Playing at D4 does not immediately capture any stones but strengthens the surrounding net.\n   - However, it is not as effective as playing at C5, which results in an immediate capture.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The move at C5 is the most effective because it directly captures the White stones at D5 and C5.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is to play at C5.\n\n**Answer:** <<<C5>>>"
