    "To determine if Black can capture any White stones, we need to analyze the board and identify any groups of White stones that can be surrounded and captured by Black's next move. \n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: \n   - The White stones are located at E10, F10, G10, F9, and C2.\n\n2. **Check Liberties**:\n   - A group of stones is captured when all its liberties (adjacent empty points) are occupied by the opponent.\n   - The group at E10, F10, G10, and F9 is connected and has the following liberties: D10, E9, G9, H10, and F11.\n   - The stone at C2 is isolated and has the following liberties: B2, C3, and D2.\n\n3. **Evaluate Potential Captures**:\n   - The group at E10, F10, G10, and F9 has multiple liberties, so capturing it in one move is not possible.\n   - The stone at C2 has three liberties, so capturing it in one move is also not possible.\n\n4. **Look for Immediate Capture Opportunities**:\n   - Since no group of White stones can be captured in one move due to having multiple liberties, Black cannot capture any White stones with the next move.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - After analyzing the board, there are no White stones that Black can capture with a single move.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that Black cannot capture any White stones with the next move."
