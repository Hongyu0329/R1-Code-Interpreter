    "To solve this Go challenge, we need to analyze the board and identify potential moves for Black (X) that can capture the maximum number of White (O) stones. Let's break down the board and identify the groups of White stones that are vulnerable to capture.\n\n1. **Identify White Groups:**\n   - Group 1: O stones at D8, E7, E8, F7, F6\n   - Group 2: O stones at J11, K10\n   - Group 3: O stone at I2\n\n2. **Analyze Liberties:**\n   - Group 1 (D8, E7, E8, F7, F6) has the following liberties:\n     - D7, E6, F8, G7\n   - Group 2 (J11, K10) has the following liberties:\n     - J10, K11\n   - Group 3 (I2) has the following liberties:\n     - H2, I3, J2\n\n3. **Potential Moves for Black:**\n   - To capture Group 1, Black can play at D7, E6, F8, or G7.\n   - To capture Group 2, Black can play at J10 or K11.\n   - To capture Group 3, Black can play at H2, I3, or J2.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Best Move:**\n   - Capturing Group 1 would result in capturing 5 stones.\n   - Capturing Group 2 would result in capturing 2 stones.\n   - Capturing Group 3 would result in capturing 1 stone.\n\n5. **Determine the Optimal Move:**\n   - The optimal move is to capture the largest group of stones. Therefore, Black should aim to capture Group 1.\n\n6. **Select the Move:**\n   - Among the possible moves to capture Group 1, playing at E6 is a strategic choice as it directly reduces the liberties of the group and is surrounded by Black stones.\n\nTherefore, the move for Black to capture the maximum number of White stones is:\n\n<<<E6>>>"
