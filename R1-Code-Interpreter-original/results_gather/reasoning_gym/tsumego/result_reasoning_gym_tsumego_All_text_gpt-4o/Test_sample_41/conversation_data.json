    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move for Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Vulnerable White Stones:**\n   - The White stones are located at C9, D9, E9, F6, and H7.\n   - The group at C9, D9, and E9 is surrounded by Black stones on B9, C8, and D10.\n   - The White stone at F6 is isolated and surrounded by Black stones on E5 and G6.\n   - The White stone at H7 is isolated and surrounded by Black stones on G8 and I7.\n\n2. **Potential Black Moves:**\n   - Black can play at B9, C8, D10, E5, G6, or I7 to potentially capture White stones.\n\n3. **Evaluate Key Moves:**\n   - **Move at B9:** This move would not capture any stones immediately, as it is already occupied by a Black stone.\n   - **Move at C8:** This move would not capture any stones immediately, as it is already occupied by a Black stone.\n   - **Move at D10:** This move would not capture any stones immediately, as it is already occupied by a Black stone.\n   - **Move at E5:** This move would not capture any stones immediately, as it is already occupied by a Black stone.\n   - **Move at G6:** This move would not capture any stones immediately, as it is already occupied by a Black stone.\n   - **Move at I7:** This move would not capture any stones immediately, as it is already occupied by a Black stone.\n\n4. **Identify the Key Move:**\n   - The key move is to play at F9. This move will capture the White stones at C9, D9, and E9 by removing their last liberty.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The key move for Black to capture White stones is at F9.\n\nThe answer is: <<<F9>>>"
