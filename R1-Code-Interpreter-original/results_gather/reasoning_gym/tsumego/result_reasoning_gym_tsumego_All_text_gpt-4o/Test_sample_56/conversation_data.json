    "To determine if Black can capture any White stones, we need to analyze the board and identify any groups of White stones that are in atari (one liberty left) or can be put into atari with a Black move.\n\n1. **Identify White Groups:**\n   - The White stones are located at:\n     - (C9), (F9), (G9), (I8), (J8), (K8), (I7), (J7), (B2), (B1)\n\n2. **Check Liberties:**\n   - **Group at (C9):** \n     - Liberties: (B9), (C10), (D9)\n     - This group has 3 liberties, so it cannot be captured immediately.\n\n   - **Group at (F9), (G9):**\n     - Liberties: (E9), (F8), (G8), (H9)\n     - This group has 4 liberties, so it cannot be captured immediately.\n\n   - **Group at (I8), (J8), (K8), (I7), (J7):**\n     - Liberties: (H8), (I9), (J9), (K9), (L8), (I6), (J6)\n     - This group has 7 liberties, so it cannot be captured immediately.\n\n   - **Group at (B2), (B1):**\n     - Liberties: (A2), (B3), (C2)\n     - This group has 3 liberties, so it cannot be captured immediately.\n\n3. **Potential Moves to Reduce Liberties:**\n   - For the group at (C9), playing at (B9) or (D9) reduces liberties but does not capture.\n   - For the group at (F9), (G9), playing at (E9) or (H9) reduces liberties but does not capture.\n   - For the group at (I8), (J8), (K8), (I7), (J7), playing at (H8) or (L8) reduces liberties but does not capture.\n   - For the group at (B2), (B1), playing at (A2) or (C2) reduces liberties but does not capture.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - None of the White groups can be captured in a single move by Black. All groups have more than one liberty, and no single move by Black can reduce any group to zero liberties.\n\nTherefore, Black cannot capture any White stones with the next move.\n\nAnswer: No capture possible."
