    "To solve this Go challenge, we need to analyze the board and identify potential moves for Black (X) that can capture the maximum number of White (O) stones. Let's break down the board and consider the strategic points:\n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: \n   - The White stones are located at the following positions: E10, B8, C8, A7, B7, F6, G5, J3.\n   - These stones form several groups that can potentially be captured.\n\n2. **Assess Black's Influence**:\n   - Black stones are positioned at: A10, B9, A8, C8, D7, A6, C6, J6, B5, K5, D4, F2.\n   - Black has a strong presence in the center and the left side of the board.\n\n3. **Potential Capture Opportunities**:\n   - The group of White stones at B8, C8, A7, B7 is surrounded by Black stones at A8, C6, D7, and B9. This group is vulnerable.\n   - The White stone at F6 is isolated and can be captured by surrounding it with Black stones.\n   - The White stone at J3 is isolated and can be captured by surrounding it with Black stones.\n\n4. **Strategic Move**:\n   - To capture the maximum number of White stones, focus on the group at B8, C8, A7, B7. Placing a Black stone at B6 will cut off the liberties of this group, leading to their capture.\n\n5. **Final Move**:\n   - By placing a Black stone at B6, you can capture the group of White stones at B8, C8, A7, B7.\n\nTherefore, the move that captures the most White stones is:\n\n<<<B6>>>"
