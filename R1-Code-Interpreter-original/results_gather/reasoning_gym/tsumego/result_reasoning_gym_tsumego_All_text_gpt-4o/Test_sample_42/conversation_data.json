    "To solve this Go challenge, we need to analyze the board and identify potential moves for Black (X) that can capture the maximum number of White (O) stones. Let's break down the board and consider the strategic points:\n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: \n   - The White stones at `A13` and `I9` are isolated and have liberties, so they are not immediate targets.\n   - The group of White stones at `C2`, `D2`, `E2`, and `D1` is surrounded by Black stones and has limited liberties.\n   - The White stone at `H9` is part of a small group with `I9`, but it has more liberties due to the open space around it.\n\n2. **Evaluate Black's Position**:\n   - Black has a strong presence around the center and the lower part of the board.\n   - The Black stones at `F10`, `H10`, `G9`, `B5`, `C3`, `D3`, `B2`, and `H1` are well-positioned to potentially cut off White's liberties.\n\n3. **Potential Moves**:\n   - Placing a Black stone at `C1` would capture the White stone at `D1` and potentially threaten the group at `C2`, `D2`, and `E2`.\n   - Placing a Black stone at `F2` would cut off the liberties of the White group at `C2`, `D2`, and `E2`, leading to their capture.\n\n4. **Best Move**:\n   - The move at `F2` is strategic because it directly reduces the liberties of the White group at `C2`, `D2`, and `E2`, leading to their capture. This move captures three White stones immediately.\n\nTherefore, the best move for Black to capture the maximum number of White stones is:\n\n<<<F2>>>"
