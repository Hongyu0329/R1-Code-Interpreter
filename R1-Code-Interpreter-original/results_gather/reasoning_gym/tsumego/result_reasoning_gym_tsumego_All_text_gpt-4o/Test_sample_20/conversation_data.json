    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to find a move for Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Vulnerable White Stones:**\n   - The White stones at D9, G6, H5, and I4 are surrounded by Black stones and are potential targets for capture.\n\n2. **Examine Black's Surrounding Stones:**\n   - Black has stones at H6, G5, F6, and G4, which are surrounding the White stones and can be used to capture them.\n\n3. **Look for Key Moves:**\n   - A key move would be one that either directly captures White stones or puts them in atari (one move away from capture).\n\n4. **Consider the Move at H4:**\n   - Placing a Black stone at H4 would put the White stone at G5 in atari, as it would have only one liberty left (at G6).\n\n5. **Evaluate the Result:**\n   - If Black plays at H4, White must respond to save the stone at G5, likely by playing at G6.\n   - However, this response would not save the White stones at H5 and I4, which would then be captured by Black.\n\n6. **Confirm the Move:**\n   - Playing at H4 is a strategic move that threatens multiple White stones and forces White into a difficult position.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is to play at H4.\n\n**Answer:** <<<H4>>>"
