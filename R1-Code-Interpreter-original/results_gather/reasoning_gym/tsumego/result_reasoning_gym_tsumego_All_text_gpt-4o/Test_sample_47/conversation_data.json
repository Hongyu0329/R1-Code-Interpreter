    "To solve this Go challenge, we need to analyze the board and identify potential moves for Black (X) that can capture the maximum number of White (O) stones. Let's break down the board and consider the strategic points:\n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: \n   - The White stones are located at D7, H5, I4, J4, F3, H3, and I3.\n   - The group at D7 is isolated.\n   - The group at H5, I4, J4, F3, H3, and I3 is connected and can be considered as one group.\n\n2. **Liberties**:\n   - The White stone at D7 has liberties at C7, D6, and E7.\n   - The White group starting from H5 has liberties at G5, H6, H4, I5, J5, and J3.\n\n3. **Potential Moves**:\n   - To capture the White stone at D7, Black can play at C7, D6, or E7 to reduce its liberties.\n   - To capture the larger White group, Black needs to play at G5, H6, H4, I5, J5, or J3 to reduce its liberties.\n\n4. **Strategic Move**:\n   - Capturing the larger group will yield more stones. Therefore, focusing on reducing the liberties of the larger group is more beneficial.\n   - Playing at G5 will reduce the liberties of the White group significantly, as it is adjacent to multiple White stones and will help in surrounding them.\n\n5. **Final Decision**:\n   - The move at G5 is strategic because it directly impacts the larger White group, potentially leading to capturing more stones.\n\nTherefore, the best move for Black to capture as many White stones as possible is:\n\n<<<G5>>>"
