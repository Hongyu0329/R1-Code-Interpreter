    "To determine if Black can capture any White stones, we need to analyze the board and identify any White groups that are in atari (one liberty left) or can be put into atari with a Black move.\n\n1. **Identify White Groups and Liberties:**\n   - The White stones at F11 and F10 form a vertical group with liberties at E11, E10, and G11.\n   - The White stones at G7, H7, and I7 form a horizontal group with liberties at F7, J7, and G6.\n   - The White stone at K9 has liberties at J9, L9, and K8.\n   - The White stone at L11 has liberties at K11, L10, and L12.\n   - The White stone at G3 has liberties at F3, G2, and H3.\n\n2. **Check for Immediate Captures:**\n   - None of the White groups are currently in atari, meaning none have only one liberty left.\n\n3. **Potential Moves to Put White in Atari:**\n   - The group at F11 and F10 can be put in atari by playing at E11 or G11.\n   - The group at G7, H7, and I7 can be put in atari by playing at F7 or J7.\n   - The stone at K9 can be put in atari by playing at J9 or L9.\n   - The stone at L11 can be put in atari by playing at K11 or L10.\n   - The stone at G3 can be put in atari by playing at F3 or H3.\n\n4. **Select the Best Move:**\n   - Playing at E11 will put the group at F11 and F10 in atari, giving Black the opportunity to capture them in the next move if White does not respond.\n   - This move is strategic because it targets a group of two stones, which is more valuable than targeting a single stone.\n\nTherefore, the best move for Black to capture White stones is to play at E11.\n\n**Answer:** <<<E11>>>"
