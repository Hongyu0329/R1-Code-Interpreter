    "To solve this Go challenge, we need to analyze the board and identify potential moves for Black (X) that can capture the maximum number of White (O) stones. Let's break down the board and consider the strategic points:\n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: \n   - The group of White stones at D6, E6, and F6 is surrounded by Black stones on C6 and G6.\n   - The group of White stones at B5, C5, and D5 is surrounded by Black stones on A5 and C6.\n   - The group of White stones at B8 and C8 is surrounded by Black stones on A8 and C7.\n   - The group of White stones at A2 and C2 is surrounded by Black stones on B3 and A1.\n\n2. **Liberties**:\n   - The group at D6, E6, and F6 has liberties at D5, E5, and F5.\n   - The group at B5, C5, and D5 has liberties at B4 and D4.\n   - The group at B8 and C8 has liberties at B9 and C9.\n   - The group at A2 and C2 has liberties at B1 and C1.\n\n3. **Strategic Move**:\n   - To capture the group at D6, E6, and F6, Black can play at D5, which will remove the liberties of this group.\n   - To capture the group at B5, C5, and D5, Black can play at B4, which will remove the liberties of this group.\n   - To capture the group at B8 and C8, Black can play at B9, which will remove the liberties of this group.\n   - To capture the group at A2 and C2, Black can play at B1, which will remove the liberties of this group.\n\n4. **Maximizing Captures**:\n   - The move at D5 captures three stones (D6, E6, F6).\n   - The move at B4 captures three stones (B5, C5, D5).\n   - The move at B9 captures two stones (B8, C8).\n   - The move at B1 captures two stones (A2, C2).\n\n5. **Optimal Move**:\n   - The move at D5 captures the most stones (three stones) in one move.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move for Black to capture the maximum number of White stones is at D5.\n\nThe answer is: <<<D5>>>"
