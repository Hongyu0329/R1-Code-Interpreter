    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move by Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Weak Groups**: \n   - The White stones at D6, E5, and F5 form a small group that is surrounded by Black stones on C6, D5, and E4. This group is vulnerable to capture.\n\n2. **Potential Moves**:\n   - Black can play at D4, which would put pressure on the White stones at D5 and E5.\n   - Black can also consider playing at E6 to cut off the White stones at D6 and E5 from connecting to any other White stones.\n\n3. **Evaluate D4**:\n   - If Black plays at D4, White can respond at E4, connecting their stones and potentially escaping capture.\n   - This move does not immediately capture any White stones and allows White to strengthen their position.\n\n4. **Evaluate E6**:\n   - If Black plays at E6, it directly threatens the White stones at D6 and E5.\n   - White cannot easily connect these stones to any other group, making them vulnerable to capture.\n   - This move effectively cuts off the White stones and puts them in atari (one move away from capture).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The move at E6 is the key move for Black. It directly threatens the White stones and puts them in a position where they cannot escape capture.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is:\n\n<<<E6>>>"
