    "To determine if Black can capture any White stones, we need to analyze the board and identify any groups of White stones that are in atari (one liberty left) or can be put into atari with a Black move.\n\n1. **Identify White Groups and Liberties:**\n   - The White stones at D10 and F10 form a group with two liberties at E10 and E9.\n   - The White stones at F5 and G5 form a group with liberties at E5, F4, G4, and H5.\n   - The White stone at L7 has liberties at K7, L6, and M7.\n   - The White stone at M3 has liberties at L3, M2, and M4.\n   - The White stone at D2 has liberties at C2, D1, and E2.\n\n2. **Evaluate Potential Black Moves:**\n   - To capture the group at D10 and F10, Black can play at E10, reducing the liberties to one (E9).\n   - To capture the group at F5 and G5, Black would need to play multiple moves to reduce liberties, which is not possible in one move.\n   - The White stone at L7 is not in immediate danger of capture.\n   - The White stone at M3 is not in immediate danger of capture.\n   - The White stone at D2 is not in immediate danger of capture.\n\n3. **Determine the Best Move:**\n   - The only group that can be put into atari with a single move is the group at D10 and F10. By playing at E10, Black can reduce the liberties of this group to one, threatening capture on the next move.\n\nTherefore, the best move for Black to capture White stones is to play at E10.\n\n**Answer:** <<<E10>>>"
