    "To solve this Go challenge, we need to analyze the board and identify potential moves for Black (X) that can capture the maximum number of White (O) stones. Let's break down the board and analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Groups of White Stones:**\n   - There are several groups of White stones (O) on the board. We need to identify which groups are vulnerable to capture.\n   - Group 1: O stones at D10, E9.\n   - Group 2: O stones at A6, B6, C6.\n   - Group 3: O stones at B5.\n   - Group 4: O stones at E4.\n   - Group 5: O stones at F2, H2.\n   - Group 6: O stone at J5.\n\n2. **Analyze Liberties:**\n   - Liberties are the empty points adjacent to a stone or group of stones. A group is captured when all its liberties are occupied by the opponent.\n   - Group 1 (D10, E9) has liberties at C10, D9, E10, F9.\n   - Group 2 (A6, B6, C6) has liberties at A5, B7, C5, D6.\n   - Group 3 (B5) has liberties at A5, B4, C5.\n   - Group 4 (E4) has liberties at D4, E3, F4.\n   - Group 5 (F2, H2) has liberties at E2, F1, G2, H1, I2.\n   - Group 6 (J5) has liberties at I5, J4, J6.\n\n3. **Evaluate Potential Moves:**\n   - We need to find a move that can reduce the liberties of a group to zero, capturing the stones.\n   - Placing a Black stone at C5 will reduce the liberties of Group 2 (A6, B6, C6) to zero, capturing three stones.\n   - Other potential moves do not capture as many stones immediately.\n\n4. **Determine the Best Move:**\n   - The move at C5 captures the most stones (three stones in Group 2) in one move.\n\nTherefore, the best move for Black to capture the maximum number of White stones is to place a stone at C5.\n\n**Answer:** <<<C5>>>"
