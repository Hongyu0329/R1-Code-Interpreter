    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move by Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Weaknesses:**\n   - The White stones are primarily located in the lower left quadrant of the board.\n   - The White stones at C3, C2, and B2 are surrounded by Black stones on the left and above, making them potential targets for capture.\n\n2. **Examine Black's Surrounding Stones:**\n   - Black has stones at B1, C1, D1, D3, and E2, which are surrounding the White stones.\n   - The Black stones at C1 and D1 are already in place to help capture the White stones.\n\n3. **Potential Moves:**\n   - Black can play at D2 to cut off the White stones at C2 and B2 from connecting to any other White stones.\n   - This move would also threaten the White stone at C3, as it would be surrounded on three sides.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Move:**\n   - Playing at D2 will create a situation where the White stones at C2 and B2 have no liberties left, leading to their capture.\n   - The White stone at C3 will also be in atari (one liberty left), forcing White to respond.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The key move for Black is to play at D2, which will capture the White stones at C2 and B2 and put pressure on C3.\n\nThe key move for Black is: <<<D2>>>"
