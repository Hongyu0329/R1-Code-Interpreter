    "To solve this Go challenge, we need to analyze the board and identify the best move for Black (X) to capture the maximum number of White (O) stones. Let's break down the board and consider the potential moves:\n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: \n   - The White stones are located at D13, B11, K11, M11, C8, J8, M8, F4, H4, I4, J4, I3.\n   - These stones form several groups that can potentially be captured.\n\n2. **Assess Black's Position**:\n   - Black stones are at J11, J6, E5, H5, J5, L5, F4, H4, I4, J4, I3, J2.\n   - Black has a strong presence in the center and lower part of the board.\n\n3. **Potential Capture Opportunities**:\n   - The group of White stones at F4, H4, I4, J4, and I3 is surrounded by Black stones. Capturing this group would require cutting off their liberties.\n   - The White stone at K11 is isolated and can be captured by playing at L11.\n   - The White stone at M11 is also isolated and can be captured by playing at L11 or N11.\n\n4. **Strategic Move**:\n   - Playing at G4 would capture the White stones at F4, H4, I4, J4, and I3, as it would cut off their liberties and connect Black stones around them.\n\n5. **Final Decision**:\n   - The move at G4 is the most strategic as it captures the largest group of White stones in one move.\n\nTherefore, the best move for Black to capture the maximum number of White stones is:\n\n<<<G4>>>"
