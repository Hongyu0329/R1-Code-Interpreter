    "To solve this Go problem, we need to determine if Black can capture any White stones with the next move. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Groups of White Stones:**\n   - The White stones are located at the following coordinates: \n     - (C10, D9, D8)\n     - (I10)\n     - (E8)\n     - (H2)\n     - (I5)\n\n2. **Check Liberties for Each Group:**\n   - **Group at (C10, D9, D8):**\n     - C10 has liberties at B10 and C9.\n     - D9 has liberties at C9, D10, and E9.\n     - D8 has liberties at C8, D7, and E8.\n     - This group has multiple liberties and cannot be captured in one move.\n\n   - **Stone at I10:**\n     - Liberties at H10, I9, and J10.\n     - This stone has multiple liberties and cannot be captured in one move.\n\n   - **Stone at E8:**\n     - Liberties at D8, E7, and F8.\n     - This stone has multiple liberties and cannot be captured in one move.\n\n   - **Stone at H2:**\n     - Liberties at G2, H1, and I2.\n     - This stone has multiple liberties and cannot be captured in one move.\n\n   - **Stone at I5:**\n     - Liberties at H5, I4, and J5.\n     - This stone has multiple liberties and cannot be captured in one move.\n\n3. **Identify Potential Capture:**\n   - The group at (C10, D9, D8) is the most vulnerable, but it still has multiple liberties.\n   - The best move for Black to reduce liberties and potentially set up a future capture is to play at C9, which would reduce the liberties of the group at (C10, D9, D8).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - No White stones can be captured immediately in one move.\n   - The strategic move for Black is to play at C9 to reduce the liberties of the White group at (C10, D9, D8).\n\nThe move for Black is: <<<C9>>>"
