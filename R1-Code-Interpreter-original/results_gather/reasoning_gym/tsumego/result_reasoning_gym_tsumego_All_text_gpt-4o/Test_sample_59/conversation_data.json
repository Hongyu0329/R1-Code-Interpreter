    "To determine if Black can capture any White stones, we need to analyze the board and identify any groups of White stones that are in atari (one liberty left) or can be put into atari with a single move.\n\n1. **Identify White Groups and Liberties:**\n   - **Group 1:** White stones at B2, C2, D2. This group has liberties at A2, E2, and B1.\n   - **Group 2:** White stones at B1, D1. This group has liberties at C1, E1, and C2.\n   - **Group 3:** White stones at H8, G7, G6, G5, G4. This group has liberties at F8, F7, F6, F5, F4, H7, H6, H5, H4, and I8.\n\n2. **Evaluate Potential Black Moves:**\n   - **Move at A2:** Captures the White group at B2, C2, D2 by removing its last liberty.\n   - **Move at C1:** Puts the White group at B1, D1 into atari, but does not capture immediately.\n   - **Move at F8, F7, F6, F5, F4, H7, H6, H5, H4, or I8:** None of these moves capture the White group at H8, G7, G6, G5, G4 immediately, as they have multiple liberties.\n\n3. **Determine the Best Move:**\n   - The move at A2 is the only move that results in an immediate capture of a White group.\n\nTherefore, the best move for Black to capture White stones is at A2.\n\n**Answer:** <<<A2>>>"
