    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move by Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Vulnerable White Stones:**\n   - The White stones are located at D10, H6, J3, J2, K2, K1, and L1.\n   - The White stones at J3, J2, K2, K1, and L1 form a group that is surrounded by Black stones on the left and top sides.\n\n2. **Assess the Liberty of the White Group:**\n   - The White group at the bottom (J3, J2, K2, K1, L1) has limited liberties.\n   - The liberties for this group are at I2, I3, and L2.\n\n3. **Key Move to Capture:**\n   - To capture the White group, Black needs to reduce the liberties of the White stones.\n   - Placing a Black stone at I2 will reduce the liberties of the White group significantly.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Result of the Move:**\n   - If Black plays at I2, the White group will have only two liberties left (I3 and L2).\n   - White cannot save the group with a single move, as Black can follow up by playing at I3 or L2 to capture the group.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The key move for Black is to play at I2, which will lead to the capture of the White stones in the bottom group.\n\nThe key move for Black is: <<<I2>>>"
