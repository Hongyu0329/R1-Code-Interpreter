    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move by Black (X) that will capture some White (O) stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Vulnerable White Stones:**\n   - The White stones at G8, G7, and F7 are surrounded by Black stones on several sides. These stones are part of a small group that is potentially capturable.\n\n2. **Examine Black's Surrounding Stones:**\n   - Black has stones at F8, H8, E6, G6, and H6, which are surrounding the White stones. These stones can be used to cut off liberties and capture the White group.\n\n3. **Determine Liberties of the White Group:**\n   - The White group at G8, G7, and F7 currently has liberties at F6, G9, and H7.\n\n4. **Key Move to Capture:**\n   - To capture the White stones, Black needs to play a move that reduces the liberties of the White group to zero.\n   - Playing at H7 will remove one of the liberties of the White group and create a situation where the White stones at G8, G7, and F7 have no remaining liberties.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - After Black plays at H7, the White stones at G8, G7, and F7 will have no liberties left, as all adjacent points will be occupied by Black stones.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black to capture the White stones is at H7.\n\n**Answer:** <<<H7>>>"
