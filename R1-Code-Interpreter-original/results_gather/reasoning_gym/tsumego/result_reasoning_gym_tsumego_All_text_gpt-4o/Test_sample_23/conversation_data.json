    "To solve this Go challenge, we need to analyze the board and determine the best move for Black (X) to capture the maximum number of White (O) stones. Let's break down the board and identify potential moves:\n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: \n   - The White stones are located at the following positions:\n     - G8, H8\n     - G7\n     - H6\n     - B6, C6\n     - I3\n\n2. **Identify Black Surroundings**:\n   - Black stones are positioned at:\n     - E9, H9, I9\n     - F8, G8\n     - G7\n     - F6, G6\n     - D3, D2\n     - I2\n\n3. **Potential Capture Opportunities**:\n   - The group of White stones at G8, H8, and G7 is surrounded by Black stones on F8, G8, G7, and H9. Placing a Black stone at H7 would capture the White stones at G8, H8, and G7.\n   - The White stone at H6 is surrounded by Black stones at G6 and G7. Placing a Black stone at H7 would also capture the White stone at H6.\n   - The White stones at B6 and C6 are surrounded by Black stones at D6 and D5. Placing a Black stone at A6 would capture the White stones at B6 and C6.\n   - The White stone at I3 is surrounded by Black stones at I2 and H3. Placing a Black stone at I4 would capture the White stone at I3.\n\n4. **Optimal Move**:\n   - The move that captures the most White stones is placing a Black stone at H7. This move captures the White stones at G8, H8, G7, and H6, totaling four stones.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move for Black to capture the most White stones is:\n\n<<<H7>>>"
