    "To determine if Black can capture any White stones, we need to analyze the board and identify any groups of White stones that are surrounded by Black stones or the edge of the board, with no liberties (empty adjacent points).\n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: \n   - The White stones are located at D11, J11, A10, C4, D4, E4, C3, E3, and I2.\n   - We need to check if any of these groups can be surrounded by Black stones with a single move.\n\n2. **Check Liberties**:\n   - **D11**: This stone has liberties at C11, E11, and D12. It cannot be captured with a single move.\n   - **J11**: This stone has liberties at I11, K11, and J12. It cannot be captured with a single move.\n   - **A10**: This stone has liberties at A9 and B10. It cannot be captured with a single move.\n   - **C4, D4, E4**: This group has liberties at C5, D5, E5, and D3. It cannot be captured with a single move.\n   - **C3, E3**: This group has liberties at C2, D3, E2, and F3. It cannot be captured with a single move.\n   - **I2**: This stone has liberties at H2, I1, and J2. It cannot be captured with a single move.\n\n3. **Potential Capture**:\n   - The group at C4, D4, E4 is surrounded on three sides by Black stones (B4, F4, and D3) and the edge of the board. If Black plays at D5, it will remove the last liberty of this group.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - By playing at D5, Black can capture the group of White stones at C4, D4, and E4.\n\nThe move for Black to capture some White stones is: <<<D5>>>"
