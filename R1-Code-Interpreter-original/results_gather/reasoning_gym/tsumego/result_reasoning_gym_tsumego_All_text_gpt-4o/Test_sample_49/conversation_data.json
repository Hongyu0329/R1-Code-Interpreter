    "To solve this Go challenge, we need to analyze the board and identify potential moves for Black (X) that can capture the maximum number of White (O) stones. Let's break down the board and analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: \n   - The White stones are located at D10, D8, G7, F6, C5, D5, E5, F5, G5, E4, and D1.\n   - These stones form several groups that can potentially be captured.\n\n2. **Identify Black Stones and Influence**:\n   - Black stones are located at C11, E7, D6, F5, B4, D4, F4, E3, J1, and L1.\n   - Black has a strong influence around the center and the lower part of the board.\n\n3. **Potential Capture Opportunities**:\n   - The group of White stones at C5, D5, E5, F5, and D4 is surrounded by Black stones and can potentially be captured.\n   - The White stone at D1 is isolated and can be captured by playing at C1 or E1.\n\n4. **Strategic Move Analysis**:\n   - Playing at E6 would cut off the White stones at F6 and G7 from the rest of the board, potentially capturing them.\n   - Playing at E5 would capture the White stones at C5, D5, E5, and F5, as they would have no liberties left.\n\n5. **Optimal Move**:\n   - The move at E5 is optimal because it captures the largest group of White stones in one move.\n\nBy playing at E5, Black can capture the White stones at C5, D5, E5, and F5, which is the maximum capture possible in one move.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<E5>>>"
