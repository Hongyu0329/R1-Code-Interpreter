    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to find a move for Black that captures some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Weaknesses:**\n   - The White stones at D10, E8, F8, and H4 are isolated and potentially vulnerable.\n   - The White stones at B5, C5, and C4 are surrounded by Black stones and are also vulnerable.\n\n2. **Potential Moves:**\n   - Black can consider moves that either directly capture White stones or put them in atari (one move away from being captured).\n\n3. **Key Areas:**\n   - The cluster of White stones at B5, C5, and C4 is surrounded on three sides by Black stones. Capturing these stones would be a significant gain for Black.\n   - The White stone at E8 is isolated and could be targeted.\n\n4. **Strategic Move:**\n   - Placing a Black stone at C6 would put the White stones at B5, C5, and C4 in atari, as they would have only one liberty left at B4.\n   - This move also strengthens Black's position in the center and could potentially lead to further captures.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - After placing a Black stone at C6, White would need to respond to save the stones at B5, C5, and C4. However, there is no immediate move that saves them without losing other stones or liberties.\n\nBy analyzing the board and considering the strategic implications, the key move for Black is to place a stone at C6.\n\nThe answer is: <<<C6>>>"
