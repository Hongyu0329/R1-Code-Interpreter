    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move by Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Weaknesses:**\n   - Look for White groups that are potentially weak or surrounded by Black stones.\n   - The White stones at D9, C8, and D6 are part of a group that seems vulnerable.\n\n2. **Examine Liberties:**\n   - The White group around D9, C8, and D6 has limited liberties.\n   - The stones at D9 and C8 are connected and have liberties at C9, D8, and E8.\n\n3. **Potential Black Moves:**\n   - Black can play at C9 to reduce the liberties of the White group.\n   - Black can also consider playing at D8 to further restrict White's liberties.\n\n4. **Evaluate Key Move:**\n   - Playing at C9 will directly reduce the liberties of the White group to two (D8 and E8).\n   - This move also threatens to capture the White stones if White does not respond appropriately.\n\n5. **Consider White's Response:**\n   - If Black plays at C9, White must respond to avoid capture.\n   - White could play at D8 to maintain liberties, but Black can then play at E8 to capture the group.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The key move for Black is to play at C9. This move effectively reduces the liberties of the White group and sets up a sequence that can lead to capturing the White stones.\n\nThe key move for Black is: <<<C9>>>"
