    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to find a move for Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Group of White Stones**: \n   - The White stones are primarily located around the center of the board, specifically from D9 to F9, and extending downwards to D7 and E8. \n   - The White stones at D9, E9, and F9 are part of a small group that is surrounded by Black stones on the left and right.\n\n2. **Examine Liberties**:\n   - The White stones at D9, E9, and F9 have limited liberties. \n   - D9 is surrounded by Black stones at C9 and D10.\n   - E9 is surrounded by Black stones at D9 and F9.\n   - F9 is surrounded by Black stones at E9 and G9.\n\n3. **Potential Key Move**:\n   - The goal is to reduce the liberties of the White stones to zero, thereby capturing them.\n   - The White stone at E8 is a critical point because it connects to the White stones at D9 and E9. Capturing E8 would reduce the liberties of the White group significantly.\n\n4. **Evaluate Black's Move**:\n   - Placing a Black stone at E8 would directly threaten the White stones at D9 and E9 by reducing their liberties.\n   - After placing a Black stone at E8, the White stones at D9 and E9 would have only one liberty left, which is at F8.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The key move for Black is to play at E8. This move will effectively capture the White stones at D9 and E9 by reducing their liberties to zero.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is: <<<E8>>>."
