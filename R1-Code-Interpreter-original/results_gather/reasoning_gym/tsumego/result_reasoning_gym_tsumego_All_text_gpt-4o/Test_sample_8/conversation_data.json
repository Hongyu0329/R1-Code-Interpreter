    "To determine if Black can capture any White stones, we need to analyze the board and identify any groups of White stones that can be surrounded by Black stones. A group of stones is captured if all its liberties (empty adjacent points) are occupied by the opponent's stones.\n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: \n   - The White stones on the board are located at the following coordinates:\n     - C12, G11, H11, G10, H10, I10, H9, J9, K9, K8, C7, E7, J2, H5.\n   - We need to identify which of these stones form connected groups. Connected stones are those that are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically).\n\n2. **Analyze Liberties**:\n   - For each group of White stones, we need to check the surrounding points to see if they are occupied by Black stones or are empty.\n   - A group is captured if all its liberties are occupied by Black stones.\n\n3. **Potential Captures**:\n   - The group at G11, H11, G10, H10, H9 is surrounded by Black stones at F10, G9, and H8, but it still has liberties at F11 and I11.\n   - The group at J9, K9, K8 is surrounded by Black stones at I9 and J8, but it still has liberties at J10 and L9.\n   - The single stone at J2 is surrounded by Black stones at I2 and J3, but it still has liberties at K2 and H2.\n   - The single stone at C12 is surrounded by empty spaces and cannot be captured.\n   - The single stone at C7 is surrounded by Black stones at B7 and D7, but it still has liberties at C6 and C8.\n   - The single stone at E7 is surrounded by Black stones at D7 and F7, but it still has liberties at E6 and E8.\n\n4. **Determine the Move**:\n   - The group at G11, H11, G10, H10, H9 can be captured if Black plays at F11, removing its last liberty.\n   - Playing at F11 will surround the group completely, capturing the White stones.\n\nTherefore, the move for Black to capture some White stones is: <<<F11>>>."
