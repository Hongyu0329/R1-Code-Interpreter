    "To solve this Go problem, we need to determine if Black can capture any White stones with the next move. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: \n   - The White stones at `C3`, `D2`, `D3`, and `E2` form a group.\n   - The White stone at `F9` is isolated.\n   - The White stone at `K13` is isolated.\n   - The White stone at `J8` is isolated.\n\n2. **Check Liberties**:\n   - The group at `C3`, `D2`, `D3`, and `E2` has the following liberties: `B3`, `C2`, `D1`, `E1`, `E3`, `F2`.\n   - The stone at `F9` has liberties at `E9`, `F8`, `F10`, `G9`.\n   - The stone at `K13` has liberties at `J13`, `K12`, `L13`.\n   - The stone at `J8` has liberties at `I8`, `J7`, `J9`, `K8`.\n\n3. **Potential Capture**:\n   - The group at `C3`, `D2`, `D3`, and `E2` has multiple liberties and cannot be captured in one move.\n   - The stone at `F9` has four liberties and cannot be captured in one move.\n   - The stone at `K13` has three liberties and cannot be captured in one move.\n   - The stone at `J8` has four liberties and cannot be captured in one move.\n\n4. **Strategic Move**:\n   - Since no White stones can be captured immediately, we should look for a move that reduces liberties or sets up a future capture.\n   - Placing a Black stone at `E9` will reduce the liberties of the White stone at `F9` to three, but it won't lead to an immediate capture.\n   - Placing a Black stone at `J13` will reduce the liberties of the White stone at `K13` to two, but it won't lead to an immediate capture.\n   - Placing a Black stone at `I8` will reduce the liberties of the White stone at `J8` to three, but it won't lead to an immediate capture.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - No immediate capture is possible with the next move. However, the best strategic move to reduce liberties and potentially set up a future capture is to play at `E9`.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<E9>>>"
