    "To solve this Go challenge, we need to analyze the board and identify potential moves for Black (X) that can capture the maximum number of White (O) stones. Let's break down the analysis step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Vulnerable White Groups:**\n   - Look for groups of White stones that are surrounded or can be surrounded by Black stones.\n   - Check for White stones that have limited liberties (empty adjacent points).\n\n2. **Evaluate Black's Position:**\n   - Identify Black stones that are already surrounding White stones or can be used to cut off White's liberties.\n   - Consider Black's existing groups and how they can be extended to capture White stones.\n\n3. **Potential Moves:**\n   - Look for moves that can reduce the liberties of White groups to zero, resulting in capture.\n   - Consider moves that can connect Black stones to form a stronger surrounding position.\n\n4. **Calculate Liberties:**\n   - For each White group, count the number of liberties (empty adjacent points).\n   - Determine if a single move by Black can reduce these liberties to zero.\n\n5. **Strategic Move Selection:**\n   - Choose a move that maximizes the number of White stones captured.\n   - Ensure the move does not put Black stones in a vulnerable position.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the given board:\n\n- **White Group at (C6, D6, E6):** This group has 2 liberties at (B6) and (F6).\n- **White Group at (D7):** This stone has 3 liberties at (C7), (E7), and (D8).\n- **White Group at (H8, I8):** This group has 3 liberties at (G8), (H7), and (J8).\n- **White Group at (I3, J3):** This group has 3 liberties at (H3), (I2), and (J4).\n\n**Optimal Move:**\n- Placing a Black stone at (B6) will reduce the liberties of the White group at (C6, D6, E6) to zero, capturing 3 White stones.\n\nTherefore, the move that captures the most White stones is:\n\n<<<B6>>>"
