    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to find a move for Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Groups:**\n   - The White stones are primarily located around the center and the right side of the board.\n   - The Black stones are forming a wall on the left side and extending towards the center.\n\n2. **Potential Targets:**\n   - The White stones at G9, H9, and H8 are surrounded by Black stones and are potential targets for capture.\n   - The White stones at G4, H4, and H3 are also surrounded by Black stones and could be captured.\n\n3. **Key Points to Consider:**\n   - Black needs to play a move that either directly captures White stones or puts them in atari (one move away from capture).\n   - The move should strengthen Black's position and not leave any Black stones vulnerable to capture.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Board:**\n   - The White stones at G9 and H9 are surrounded by Black stones at F9, G8, and H10. Playing at H10 would put these stones in atari.\n   - The White stones at G4, H4, and H3 are surrounded by Black stones at F4, G3, and H2. Playing at G3 would put these stones in atari.\n\n5. **Choosing the Key Move:**\n   - Playing at H10 will put the White stones at G9 and H9 in atari, and they cannot escape capture.\n   - This move also strengthens Black's position by connecting the Black stones at G9 and H10.\n\nAfter considering these points, the key move for Black is to play at H10.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<H10>>>"
