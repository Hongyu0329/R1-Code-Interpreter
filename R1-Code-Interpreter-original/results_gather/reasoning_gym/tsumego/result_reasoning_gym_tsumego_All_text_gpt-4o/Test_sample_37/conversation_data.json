    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to find a move for Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Vulnerable White Stones:**\n   - The White stones at B8, B7, and D5 are surrounded by Black stones and are potential targets for capture.\n\n2. **Examine Black's Surrounding Stones:**\n   - Black has stones at A8, C8, A6, C6, B5, and D4, which are surrounding the White stones at B8, B7, and D5.\n\n3. **Potential Key Moves:**\n   - Black can play at C7 to put pressure on the White stones at B7 and B8.\n   - Black can also consider playing at C5 to cut off the White stone at D5.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Move at C7:**\n   - Playing at C7 will directly threaten the White stones at B7 and B8.\n   - After Black plays at C7, White cannot save both B7 and B8 without losing one of them.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Move at C5:**\n   - Playing at C5 will threaten the White stone at D5.\n   - However, this move does not immediately capture any stones and may not be as effective as C7.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The move at C7 is more effective because it directly threatens to capture the White stones at B7 and B8, creating an immediate capture threat.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is to play at C7.\n\nThe answer is: <<<C7>>>"
