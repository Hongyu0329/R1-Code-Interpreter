    "To solve this Go problem, we need to determine if Black can capture any White stones with the next move. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify White Stones and Their Liberties:**\n   - White stones are located at the following coordinates: D11, H13, B7, C7, A6, B6, H6, B5, C5.\n   - We need to check the liberties (empty adjacent points) of these stones to see if they can be captured.\n\n2. **Check Liberties for Each Group:**\n   - **Group 1:** D11\n     - Liberties: C11, D12, E11\n   - **Group 2:** H13\n     - Liberties: G13, H12, I13\n   - **Group 3:** B7, C7\n     - Liberties: A7, B8, C6, D7\n   - **Group 4:** A6, B6\n     - Liberties: A5, B5, C6\n   - **Group 5:** H6\n     - Liberties: G6, H5, I6\n   - **Group 6:** B5, C5\n     - Liberties: A5, B4, C4, D5\n\n3. **Identify Vulnerable Groups:**\n   - A group is vulnerable if it has only one liberty left. We need to find such groups and see if Black can play on that liberty to capture the group.\n\n4. **Analyze Each Group:**\n   - **Group 1 (D11):** Has 3 liberties, not vulnerable.\n   - **Group 2 (H13):** Has 3 liberties, not vulnerable.\n   - **Group 3 (B7, C7):** Has 4 liberties, not vulnerable.\n   - **Group 4 (A6, B6):** Has 3 liberties, not vulnerable.\n   - **Group 5 (H6):** Has 3 liberties, not vulnerable.\n   - **Group 6 (B5, C5):** Has 4 liberties, not vulnerable.\n\n5. **Check for Potential Captures:**\n   - None of the groups have only one liberty, so no immediate capture is possible with a single move.\n\n6. **Consider Strategic Moves:**\n   - Since no immediate capture is possible, Black should consider a strategic move to reduce the liberties of a group, potentially setting up a capture in future moves.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - After analyzing the board, there are no White stones that can be captured with a single move by Black. Therefore, Black should focus on strategic positioning for future captures.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nNo White stones can be captured with the next move."
