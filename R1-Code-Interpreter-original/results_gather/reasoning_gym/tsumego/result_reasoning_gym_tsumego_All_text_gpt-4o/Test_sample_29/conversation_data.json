    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to find a move for Black (X) that will capture some White (O) stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Vulnerable White Stones:**\n   - The White stones at G9, H9, and H8 are surrounded by Black stones on the right and bottom sides. These stones are vulnerable to capture.\n\n2. **Examine Black's Surrounding Stones:**\n   - Black has a strong presence on the right side with stones at I10, J10, K10, and L10.\n   - Black also has stones at G7, H7, and G6, which are close to the vulnerable White stones.\n\n3. **Potential Key Moves:**\n   - A move at G8 would place a Black stone directly adjacent to the White stones at G9 and H8, potentially capturing them.\n   - A move at H7 would also be adjacent to the White stones at H8 and H9, but it is already occupied by a Black stone.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Move at G8:**\n   - Placing a Black stone at G8 would create a direct threat to the White stones at G9 and H8.\n   - This move would cut off the White stones' liberties, as they would be surrounded by Black stones on all sides.\n\n5. **Confirm the Capture:**\n   - After placing a Black stone at G8, the White stones at G9 and H8 would have no liberties left, leading to their capture.\n\nBased on this analysis, the key move for Black to capture the White stones is at G8.\n\n**Answer:** <<<G8>>>"
