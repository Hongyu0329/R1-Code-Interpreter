    "To solve this Go challenge, we need to analyze the board and identify potential moves for Black (X) that can capture the maximum number of White (O) stones. Let's break down the board and consider the strategic points:\n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: \n   - The White stones are located at D9, F9, G9, E8, F8, and J12.\n   - The group at D9, F9, G9, E8, and F8 is connected and can potentially be captured together.\n   - The stone at J12 is isolated and not part of any group.\n\n2. **Liberties**:\n   - The group at D9, F9, G9, E8, and F8 has the following liberties:\n     - D8, E9, F7, G8, and H9.\n   - The stone at J12 has the following liberties:\n     - I12, J11, and K12.\n\n3. **Strategic Move**:\n   - To capture the largest group of White stones, we should focus on the group at D9, F9, G9, E8, and F8.\n   - The move that reduces the liberties of this group most effectively is placing a Black stone at G8. This move will reduce the liberties of the group to D8, E9, and F7, putting significant pressure on the group.\n\n4. **Outcome**:\n   - By playing at G8, Black will be able to capture the group of five White stones if White cannot secure additional liberties in subsequent moves.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move for Black to capture the most White stones is:\n\n<<<G8>>>"
