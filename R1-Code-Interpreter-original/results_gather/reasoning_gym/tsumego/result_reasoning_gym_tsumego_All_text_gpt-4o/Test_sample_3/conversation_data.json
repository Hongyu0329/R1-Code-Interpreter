    "To determine if Black can capture any White stones, we need to analyze the board and identify any groups of White stones that can be surrounded and captured by Black's next move. \n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: \n   - The group of White stones at D11, E11, and D10 is surrounded by Black stones at C11, F11, and C10. This group is vulnerable.\n   - The White stone at A13 is isolated and not immediately capturable.\n   - The White stone at M5 is isolated and not immediately capturable.\n   - The White stone at L1 is isolated and not immediately capturable.\n   - The White stone at F6 is isolated and not immediately capturable.\n\n2. **Check Liberties**:\n   - The group at D11, E11, and D10 has the following liberties: D12, E12, and D9.\n   - The liberty at D12 is occupied by a White stone, so it cannot be used to capture the group.\n   - The liberty at E12 is occupied by a Black stone, so it cannot be used to capture the group.\n   - The liberty at D9 is unoccupied and can be used to capture the group.\n\n3. **Determine the Move**:\n   - By placing a Black stone at D9, Black can remove the last liberty of the White group at D11, E11, and D10, capturing these stones.\n\nTherefore, the move for Black to capture the White stones is at D9.\n\nThe answer is: <<<D9>>>"
