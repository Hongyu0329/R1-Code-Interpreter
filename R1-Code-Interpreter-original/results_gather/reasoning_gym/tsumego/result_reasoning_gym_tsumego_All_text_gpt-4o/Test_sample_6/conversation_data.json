    "To determine if Black can capture any White stones, we need to analyze the board and identify any groups of White stones that are in atari (one liberty left) or can be put into atari with a Black move.\n\n1. **Identify White Groups and Liberties:**\n   - We need to look for White stones that are close to Black stones or the edge of the board, as these are more likely to be in danger of being captured.\n   - Check the liberties (empty adjacent points) of each White group.\n\n2. **Examine the Board:**\n   - The White stone at `C3` is surrounded by Black stones at `B3` and `D3`, and has a liberty at `C2`.\n   - The White stone at `E1` is surrounded by Black stones at `D1` and `F1`, and has a liberty at `E2`.\n   - The White stone at `H8` is surrounded by Black stones at `G8` and `I8`, and has a liberty at `H7`.\n   - The White stone at `J1` is surrounded by Black stones at `I1` and `K1`, and has a liberty at `J2`.\n\n3. **Potential Capture Moves:**\n   - Placing a Black stone at `C2` would capture the White stone at `C3`.\n   - Placing a Black stone at `E2` would capture the White stone at `E1`.\n   - Placing a Black stone at `H7` would capture the White stone at `H8`.\n   - Placing a Black stone at `J2` would capture the White stone at `J1`.\n\n4. **Choose the Move:**\n   - Any of the above moves will result in capturing a White stone. For this analysis, we will choose one move.\n\nThe move that Black can make to capture a White stone is: <<<C2>>>."
