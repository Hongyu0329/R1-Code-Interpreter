    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move for Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Weaknesses in White's Formation:**\n   - The White stones are primarily located around the center and the left side of the board.\n   - The group of White stones at D9, C8, and C7 is surrounded by Black stones on B9, D7, and C6, making it a potential target for capture.\n\n2. **Examine Black's Surrounding Stones:**\n   - Black has stones at C10, B9, D9, C7, and C6, which are surrounding the White stones at C8 and D9.\n   - The Black stone at B8 is missing, which could be a key point to complete the surrounding of the White stones.\n\n3. **Consider Key Moves:**\n   - Placing a Black stone at B8 would effectively cut off the escape routes for the White stones at C8 and D9, potentially capturing them.\n   - This move would also strengthen the Black position by connecting the stones at B9 and C7.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Result of the Move:**\n   - By playing at B8, Black would create a solid wall on the left side, making it difficult for White to escape or connect to other groups.\n   - The White stones at C8 and D9 would be surrounded on all sides, leading to their capture.\n\n5. **Final Decision:**\n   - The move at B8 is strategic as it captures the White stones and strengthens Black's position.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black to play and capture some stones is: <<<B8>>>."
