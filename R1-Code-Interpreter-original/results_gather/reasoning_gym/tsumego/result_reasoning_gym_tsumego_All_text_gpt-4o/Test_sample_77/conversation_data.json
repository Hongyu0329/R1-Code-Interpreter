    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to find a move for Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Weak Groups**: \n   - The White stones at D6, E5, and D4 form a group that is surrounded by Black stones on the left and right. This group is a potential target for capture.\n   - The White stone at G7 is isolated and could be a target if Black can surround it.\n\n2. **Examine Black's Surrounding Stones**:\n   - Black has stones at C6, C5, and C4, which are already surrounding the White group on the left.\n   - Black also has stones at F6 and H4, which are surrounding the White group on the right.\n\n3. **Potential Moves**:\n   - Black can play at E6 to cut off the White stones at D6 and E5 from connecting to any other White stones.\n   - Black can also consider playing at F5 to further surround the White group.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Move at E6**:\n   - Playing at E6 will directly cut off the White stones at D6 and E5, making it difficult for them to connect to any other White stones.\n   - This move will also threaten the White stone at D4, as it will be surrounded on three sides.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Move at F5**:\n   - Playing at F5 will help surround the White group, but it does not immediately cut off the White stones as effectively as E6.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The move at E6 is the key move because it directly cuts off the White stones at D6 and E5, making them capturable in subsequent moves.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is to play at E6.\n\n**Answer**: <<<E6>>>"
