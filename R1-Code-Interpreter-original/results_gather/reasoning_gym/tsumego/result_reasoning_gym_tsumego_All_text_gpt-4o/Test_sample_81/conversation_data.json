    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move by Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Weaknesses in White's Formation:**\n   - The White stones are primarily located in the lower right quadrant of the board.\n   - The group of White stones at D3, E3, E2, and F2 is surrounded by Black stones at D2, F3, and G2, making it a potential target for capture.\n\n2. **Examine Black's Potential Moves:**\n   - Black has stones at D4, F4, and G2, which are in close proximity to the White group.\n   - A move that can cut off the liberties of the White group at D3, E3, E2, and F2 would be ideal.\n\n3. **Evaluate Key Points for Black:**\n   - The White group has liberties at D2, E1, and F1.\n   - Placing a Black stone at E1 would reduce the liberties of the White group significantly.\n\n4. **Consider the Impact of the Move:**\n   - If Black plays at E1, the White group will have only two liberties left at D2 and F1.\n   - This move also strengthens Black's position by connecting the stones at D2 and F2, making it harder for White to escape or counterattack.\n\n5. **Verify the Move:**\n   - After Black plays at E1, White cannot easily add more liberties to the group without losing stones elsewhere.\n   - The move at E1 is strategic as it directly threatens the capture of the White group.\n\nBased on this analysis, the key move for Black is to play at E1. This move effectively reduces the liberties of the White group and sets up a capture.\n\nThe key move is: <<<E1>>>"
