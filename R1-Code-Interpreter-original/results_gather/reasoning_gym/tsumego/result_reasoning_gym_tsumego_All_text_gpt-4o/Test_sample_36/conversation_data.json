    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to find a move for Black that will capture some White stones. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Vulnerable White Stones:**\n   - The White stones at G9, H9, I9, and J9 are surrounded by Black stones on the left and right, making them potential targets for capture.\n   - The White stone at K10 is also surrounded by Black stones on the left and right.\n\n2. **Examine Black's Surrounding Stones:**\n   - Black has stones at F9, G8, H8, and J8, which are in a position to potentially cut off the escape routes for the White stones on the 9th row.\n   - Black also has stones at J10 and L10, which are in a position to cut off the escape routes for the White stone at K10.\n\n3. **Consider Key Moves:**\n   - A move at H10 would place a Black stone directly between the White stones at G9, H9, I9, and J9, and the White stone at K10, potentially capturing the group of White stones on the 9th row.\n   - A move at J9 would also be effective, as it would directly cut off the White stones at G9, H9, and I9 from connecting to the White stone at K10.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Best Move:**\n   - Placing a Black stone at H10 would effectively cut off the White stones on the 9th row from connecting to the White stone at K10, leading to their capture.\n   - This move also strengthens Black's position by connecting Black stones on the 8th and 10th rows.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The key move for Black is to play at H10, which will capture the White stones on the 9th row.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<H10>>>"
