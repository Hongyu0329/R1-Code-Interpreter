    "To determine if Black can capture any White stones, we need to analyze the board and identify any groups of White stones that are surrounded by Black stones or the edge of the board, leaving them with no liberties (empty adjacent points).\n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: \n   - The White stones are located at D11, E9, I8, H7, I7, J7, D6, I6, J6, L6, C2.\n   - We need to check if any of these groups can be surrounded by Black stones with a single move.\n\n2. **Check Liberties**:\n   - A White stone or group of stones is captured if all its liberties (adjacent empty points) are occupied by Black stones.\n   - We will check each group of White stones to see if they can be surrounded.\n\n3. **Analyze Each Group**:\n   - **Group at D11**: This stone has liberties at C11, D12, E11, and D10. It cannot be captured with a single move.\n   - **Group at E9**: This stone has liberties at D9, E10, F9, and E8. It cannot be captured with a single move.\n   - **Group at I8**: This stone has liberties at H8, I9, J8, and I7. It cannot be captured with a single move.\n   - **Group at H7, I7, J7**: These stones form a group with liberties at G7, H8, I8, J8, and K7. It cannot be captured with a single move.\n   - **Group at D6**: This stone has liberties at C6, D7, E6, and D5. It cannot be captured with a single move.\n   - **Group at I6, J6, L6**: These stones form a group with liberties at H6, I7, J7, K6, and L7. It cannot be captured with a single move.\n   - **Stone at C2**: This stone has liberties at B2, C3, D2, and C1. It cannot be captured with a single move.\n\n4. **Identify Potential Capture**:\n   - The group at I6, J6, L6 is surrounded on three sides by Black stones and the edge of the board. The only liberty is at K6.\n   - If Black plays at K6, the group at I6, J6, L6 will have no liberties and will be captured.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Black can capture the group of White stones at I6, J6, L6 by playing at K6.\n\nThe move for Black to capture some White stones is: <<<K6>>>"
