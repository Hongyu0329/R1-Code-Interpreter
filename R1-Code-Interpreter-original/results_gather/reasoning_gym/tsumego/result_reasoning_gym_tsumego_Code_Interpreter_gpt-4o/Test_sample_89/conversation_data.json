    "\nassistant > To solve this tsumego, we need to find a move for Black (X) that will capture some White (O) stones. Let's analyze the board and identify potential weaknesses in White's position.\n\nThe key is to look for a move that will either cut off White's stones from their liberties or create a situation where White cannot escape capture.\n\nUpon examining the board, the White stones at C3 and D3 are surrounded by Black stones and have limited liberties. A move that targets these stones could be effective.\n\nThe move that captures the White stones is at D5. By playing at D5, Black can cut off the White stones at C3 and D3, leading to their capture.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is: <<<D5>>>."
