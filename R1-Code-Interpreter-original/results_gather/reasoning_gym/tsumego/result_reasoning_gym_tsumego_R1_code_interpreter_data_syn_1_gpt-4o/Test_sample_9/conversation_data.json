    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move for Black that will capture some White stones. The board is a 12x12 grid, and we need to analyze the positions of the stones to find a strategic move.\n\nLet's break down the board:\n\n- Black stones (X) are positioned at various points, and we need to find a move that will either capture White stones (O) or put them in atari (a situation where they have only one liberty left).\n- The key to solving tsumego problems is to look for weaknesses in the opponent's groups, such as cutting points or groups with few liberties.\n\nAnalyzing the board, we notice:\n\n- The White stones at B11, C11, and D11 form a small group that is somewhat surrounded by Black stones.\n- The White stone at C12 is also part of this group.\n- The Black stones at A12, B12, and C10 are in a position to potentially cut off the White stones' liberties.\n\nA strategic move for Black would be to play at D12. This move would:\n\n- Directly threaten the White stone at C12 by reducing its liberties.\n- Put pressure on the White group at B11, C11, and D11, potentially leading to a capture if White cannot respond effectively.\n\nLet's confirm this move by visualizing the board after playing D12:\n\n```\n   A B C D E F G H I J K L\n12 . X O X X . . O . . . .\n11 X O O . O . . . . . . .\n10 . X O X . . . . . . . X\n 9 . . X . . . . . . . O .\n 8 . . . . . . . . X . O X\n 7 . . . O . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . . . . .

X . .\n```\n\nBy playing at D12, Black effectively reduces the liberties of the White group and sets up a potential capture.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is:\n\n<<<D12>>>"
