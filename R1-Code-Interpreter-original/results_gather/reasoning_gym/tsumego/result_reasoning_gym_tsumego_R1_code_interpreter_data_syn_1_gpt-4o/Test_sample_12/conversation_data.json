    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move by Black that will capture some White stones. The key to solving tsumego problems is to look for weaknesses in the opponent's group, such as cutting points, shortage of liberties, or potential for a snapback.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n```\n   A B C D E F G H I J K L\n12 . . . . . . . . . . . .\n11 . .

This move also threatens the White stones at C4 and D4.\n\nLet's verify this move by considering the liberties and potential responses from White. If Black plays at C4, the White stones at D5 and E5 will have reduced liberties, and Black can follow up with moves to capture them.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is at C4.\n\n<<<C4>>>"
