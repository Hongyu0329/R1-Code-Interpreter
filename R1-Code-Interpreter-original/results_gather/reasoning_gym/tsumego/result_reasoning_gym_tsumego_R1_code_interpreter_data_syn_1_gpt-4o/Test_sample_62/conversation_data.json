    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move for Black that will capture some White stones. The key to solving tsumego problems is to look for weaknesses in the opponent's groups, such as cutting points, shortage of liberties, or potential for a snapback.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n1. The White stones at G9 and H9 are surrounded by Black stones at F9 and I9. This group of White stones has limited liberties.\n2. The White stones at F6, G6, and H6 are also surrounded by Black stones at E5, F5, and H5. This group is connected to the stones at G9 and H9.\n3. The White stone at M8 is isolated and surrounded by Black stones at L7 and M7.\n\nThe goal is to find a move that will reduce the liberties of one or more of these groups, leading to a capture.\n\nLet's consider potential moves:\n\n- Playing at G8 could reduce the liberties of the White stones at G9 and H9.\n- Playing at H8 could also reduce the liberties of the White stones at G9 and H9.\n- Playing at M9 could capture the isolated White stone at M8.\n\nTo determine the best move, we need to evaluate the impact of these moves on the liberties of the White stones.\n\nLet's write a Python script to evaluate the liberties of the White stones after each potential move and determine which move results in a capture.\n\n```python\ndef count_liberties(board, x, y):\n    \"\"\"Count the liberties of a stone at position (x, y).\"\"\"\n    visited = set()\n    stack = [(x, y)]\n    liberties = 0\n    color = board[y][x]\n\n    while stack:\n        cx, cy = stack.pop()\n        if (cx, cy) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add((cx, cy))\n\n        for nx, ny in [(cx-1, cy), (cx+1, cy), (cx, cy-1), (cx, cy+1)]:\n            if 0 <= nx < len(board[0]) and 0 <= ny < len(board):\n                if board[ny][nx] == '.':\n                    liberties += 1\n                elif board[ny][nx] == color and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                    stack.append((nx, ny))\n\n    return liberties\n\ndef simulate_move(board, move, color):\n    \"\"\"Simulate a move and return the new board state.\"\"\"\n    x, y = move\n    new_board = [list(row) for row in board]\n    new_board[y][x] = color\n    return new_board\n\ndef find_best_move(board):\n    \"\"\"Find the best move for Black to capture White stones.\"\"\"\n    moves = [(6, 8), (7, 8), (12, 9)]  # G8, H8, M9\n    best_move = None\n    max_captured = 0\n\n    for move in moves:\n        new_board = simulate_move(board, move, 'X')\n        captured = 0\n\n        # Check the group at G9, H9\n        if count_liberties(new_board, 6, 9) == 0:\n            captured += 2\n\n        # Check the group at F6, G6, H6\n        if count_liberties(new_board, 5, 6) == 0:\n            captured += 3\n\n        # Check the isolated stone at M8\n        if count_liberties(new_board, 12, 8) == 0:\n            captured += 1\n\n        if captured > max_captured:\n            max_captured = captured\n            best_move = move\n\n    return best_move\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    \"...........X.\",\n    \".............\",\n    \".O...........\",\n    \".............\",\n    \".OX....OOX...\",\n    \"...........O.\",\n    \"...........XX\",\n    \".....O....OOO\",\n    \"..........XO.\",\n    \"..........X..\",\n    \".............\",\n    \".............\"\n]\n\nbest_move = find_best_move(board)\ncolumns = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLM\"\nresult = f\"<<<{columns[best_move[0]]}{13 - best_move[1]}>>>\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe code will evaluate the potential moves and determine which one results in the most captures. Let's execute the code to find the best move.",
