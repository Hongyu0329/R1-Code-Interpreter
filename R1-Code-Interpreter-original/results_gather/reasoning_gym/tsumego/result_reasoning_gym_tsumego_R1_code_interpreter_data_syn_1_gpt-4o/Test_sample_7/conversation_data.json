    "To solve this Go problem, we need to determine if Black (X) can capture any White (O) stones with the next move. Capturing in Go involves surrounding a group of opponent's stones completely with your stones, leaving no liberties (empty adjacent points) for the opponent's stones.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n```\n   A B C D E F G H I J\n10 . . . O O . . . . .\n 9 . . . . . X O . . .\n 8 X . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . O . . .\n 6 . . . . O . X . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . X\n 4 . . . . . X . . . .\n 3 . . . . . . X X X .\n 2 . . . . . X X O O X\n 1 . . . . . . X O . .\n```\n\nWe need to identify any groups of White stones that are almost surrounded by Black stones, with only one liberty left. \n\n1. **Group at F10 and G10**: This group has liberties at E10 and H10. It cannot be captured in one move.\n2. **Group at G9**: This stone has liberties at F9 and H9. It cannot be captured in one move.\n3. **Group at G7**: This stone has liberties at F7 and H7. It cannot be captured in one move.\n4. **Group at G2 and H2**: This group has liberties at F2 and I2. It cannot be captured in one move.\n5. **Group at H1**: This stone has liberties at G1 and I1. It cannot be captured in one move.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the group at H2 and G2 is surrounded on three sides by Black stones, with only two liberties at F2 and I2. If Black plays at F2, the group will still have a liberty at I2. However, if Black plays at I2, the group will be completely surrounded and captured.\n\nLet's confirm this by checking the liberties of the group at G2 and H2:\n\n- Current liberties: F2, I2\n- If Black plays at I2, the group will have no liberties left.\n\nTherefore, the move that captures the White stones is at I2.\n\n<<<I2>>>"
