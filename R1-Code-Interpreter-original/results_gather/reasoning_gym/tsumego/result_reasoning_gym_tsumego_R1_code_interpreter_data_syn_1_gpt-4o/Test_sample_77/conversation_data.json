    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move for Black that will capture some White stones. The board is represented in a grid with columns labeled A to K and rows numbered 1 to 11. Black stones are represented by 'X' and White stones by 'O'.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n1. **Identify Weak Groups**: Look for White groups that are surrounded or have limited liberties. The group at D4, D5, E5, and F5 seems vulnerable as it is surrounded by Black stones on several sides.\n\n2. **Check Liberties**: The White group at D4, D5, E5, and F5 has limited liberties. We need to find a move that reduces these liberties further, potentially capturing the group.\n\n3. **Potential Key Moves**: \n   - Placing a Black stone at E4 could be a key move. This move would reduce the liberties of the White group significantly, potentially leading to a capture.\n\nLet's verify this by considering the liberties of the White group after placing a Black stone at E4:\n\n- Current liberties of the White group (D4, D5, E5, F5) are at E6, D3, and F4.\n- Placing a Black stone at E4 would remove the liberty at E4, leaving the group with only two liberties (E6 and D3).\n\nThis move seems promising as it significantly reduces the liberties of the White group, potentially leading to a capture in subsequent moves.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is to place a stone at E4.\n\n<<<E4>>>"
