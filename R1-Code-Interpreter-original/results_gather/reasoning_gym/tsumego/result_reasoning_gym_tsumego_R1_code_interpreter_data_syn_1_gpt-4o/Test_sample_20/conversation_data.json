    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move by Black that will capture some White stones. The board is a Go board, and the goal is to find a strategic move that will lead to capturing White stones.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n- The White stones are located at C9, C5, D4, H6, I5, I4, and J4.\n- The Black stones are surrounding the White stones, especially around the group at the bottom right.\n\nThe key to capturing stones in Go is to reduce the liberties (empty adjacent points) of the opponent's stones to zero. We need to find a move that will effectively reduce the liberties of a group of White stones, leading to their capture.\n\nLooking at the board, the White stones at I5, I4, and J4 are surrounded by Black stones at H6, G6, and J6. The White stones at I5 and I4 have limited liberties, and a strategic move by Black can capture them.\n\nLet's consider the move at H5. This move will reduce the liberties of the White stones at I5 and I4, potentially leading to their capture.\n\nNow, let's confirm this move by checking the liberties of the White stones after the move:\n\n- Before the move, the White stones at I5 and I4 have liberties at H5, I6, and J5.\n- After playing H5, the liberties are reduced, and the White stones at I5 and I4 will be captured.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is at H5.\n\n<<<H5>>>"
