    "To solve this Go problem, we need to determine if Black can capture any White stones with the next move. Capturing in Go involves surrounding a group of opponent's stones completely with your stones, leaving no liberties (empty adjacent points) for the opponent's stones.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n1. Identify groups of White stones that are potentially capturable.\n2. Check if any of these groups can be surrounded by placing a single Black stone.\n\nFrom the board, we can see a group of White stones at coordinates (J10, I9, J9, I8, J8). This group is surrounded on most sides by Black stones, but it has liberties at H9 and H8. If Black places a stone at H9, it will remove the last liberty of this group, capturing the White stones.\n\nLet's confirm this by checking the liberties of the White group:\n\n- The White group at (J10, I9, J9, I8, J8) has liberties at H9 and H8.\n- Placing a Black stone at H9 will remove the last liberty of this group.\n\nTherefore, the move for Black to capture the White stones is at H9.\n\n<<<H9>>>"
