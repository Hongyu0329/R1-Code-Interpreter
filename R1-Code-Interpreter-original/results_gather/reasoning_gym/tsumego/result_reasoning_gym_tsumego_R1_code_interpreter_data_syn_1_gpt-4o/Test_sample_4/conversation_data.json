    "To solve this Go problem, we need to determine if Black can capture any White stones with the next move. Capturing in Go involves surrounding a group of opponent's stones completely with your stones, leaving no liberties (empty adjacent points) for the opponent's stones.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n```\n   A B C D E F G H I J K\n11 O . . . . . . . . . .\n10 . . . . . . . . . . .\n 9 . . . . . . . O . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . X . . . . . . X . .\n 6 . . . . . . O . X . .\n 5 . . X . . . . O O X .\n 4 . . . O . . X O O . X\n 3 . . . . . . . X O X .\n 2 . . . . . . . . X . .\n 1 . . X . . . X . . . .\n```\n\nWe need to identify any groups of White stones that are almost surrounded by Black stones, with only one liberty left. By placing a Black stone on that liberty, we can capture the White stones.\n\nLet's focus on the group of White stones at D4, E4, F5, and G5. This group is almost surrounded by Black stones, with a potential liberty at F4. If Black places a stone at F4, the White stones at D4, E4, F5, and G5 will be captured.\n\nLet's verify this by checking the liberties of the White group:\n\n- D4 has liberties at C4 and E4.\n- E4 has liberties at D4, F4, and E5.\n- F5 has liberties at E5, F4, and G5.\n- G5 has liberties at F5 and H5.\n\nThe critical point here is F4. Placing a Black stone at F4 will remove the last liberty of the White group, leading to their capture.\n\nTherefore, the move for Black to capture the White stones is at F4.\n\n<<<F4>>>"
