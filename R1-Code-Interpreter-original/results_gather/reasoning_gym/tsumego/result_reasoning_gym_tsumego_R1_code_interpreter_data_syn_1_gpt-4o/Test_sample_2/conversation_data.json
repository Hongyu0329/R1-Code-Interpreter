    "To solve this Go problem, we need to determine if Black can capture any White stones with the next move. Capturing in Go involves surrounding a group of opponent's stones so that they have no liberties (empty adjacent points).\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n1. **Identify White Groups**: We need to identify groups of White stones that are potentially capturable. A group is a set of connected stones of the same color.\n\n2. **Check Liberties**: For each group, check if it has any liberties. A liberty is an empty point adjacent to a stone.\n\n3. **Determine Capture**: If a group has only one liberty, Black can play on that liberty to capture the group.\n\nLet's start by identifying the groups of White stones and their liberties.\n\n### Analysis\n\n- **Group 1**: The White stones at D4, E4, F4, and D3 form a group. Their liberties are C4, D5, E5, F5, and G4.\n- **Group 2**: The White stone at I2 is isolated with liberties at H2, I1, and J2.\n- **Group 3**: The White stone at K11 is isolated with liberties at J11, K10, and L11.\n- **Group 4**: The White stone at M11 is isolated with liberties at L11, M10, and M12.\n\n### Potential Capture\n\n- **Group 1**: The group at D4, E4, F4, and D3 has multiple liberties, so it cannot be captured in one move.\n- **Group 2**: The stone at I2 has multiple liberties, so it cannot be captured in one move.\n- **Group 3**: The stone at K11 has multiple liberties, so it cannot be captured in one move.\n- **Group 4**: The stone at M11 has multiple liberties, so it cannot be captured in one move.\n\nUpon reviewing the board, it seems that no White stones can be captured in a single move by Black. However, let's double-check the liberties of the group at D4, E4, F4, and D3 to ensure no oversight.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing the board, it appears that no White stones can be captured in a single move. However, the move that maximizes Black's potential for future captures is to play at C4, which reduces the liberties of the White group at D4, E4, F4, and D3.\n\n<<<C4>>>"
