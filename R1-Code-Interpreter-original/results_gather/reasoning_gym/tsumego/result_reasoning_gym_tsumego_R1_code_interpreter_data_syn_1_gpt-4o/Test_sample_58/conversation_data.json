    "To solve this Go challenge, we need to analyze the board and determine the best move for Black (X) to capture the maximum number of White (O) stones. The goal is to find a move that will either capture a group of White stones or put them in a position where they can be captured in subsequent moves.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Identify Vulnerable White Groups**: \n   - The group of White stones at D9, C9, and B9 is surrounded on three sides by Black stones. Placing a Black stone at E9 could potentially capture this group.\n   - The group of White stones at B8, B7, C7, and D7 is also surrounded on three sides. Placing a Black stone at B6 could capture this group.\n\n2. **Evaluate Liberties**:\n   - The group at D9, C9, and B9 has only one liberty at E9.\n   - The group at B8, B7, C7, and D7 has only one liberty at B6.\n\n3. **Determine the Best Move**:\n   - Placing a Black stone at E9 will capture the group at D9, C9, and B9.\n   - Placing a Black stone at B6 will capture the group at B8, B7, C7, and D7.\n\nBoth moves capture three stones, but placing a stone at B6 also threatens the White stone at A8, potentially leading to more captures in future moves.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best move for Black is to place a stone at B6, capturing the group of White stones and setting up for potential future captures.\n\n<<<B6>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
