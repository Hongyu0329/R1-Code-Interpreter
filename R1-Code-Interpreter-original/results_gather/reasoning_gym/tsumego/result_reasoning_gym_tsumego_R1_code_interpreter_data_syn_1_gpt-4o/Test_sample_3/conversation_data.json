    "To solve this Go problem, we need to analyze the board and determine if there is a move for Black (X) that can capture any White (O) stones. Capturing in Go involves surrounding a group of opponent's stones so that they have no liberties (empty adjacent points).\n\nLet's examine the board:\n\n```\n   A B C D E F G H I J K L M\n13 . . . O . . . . . . . . .\n12 . . O X X . . . . . . . .\n11 . . X O O X . . . . . . .\n10 . . X O . . . . . . . . .\n 9 . . . X . . . . . X . . .\n 8 . . X . . . . . . . X . X\n 7 . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . O . . . . . . .\n 5 X . . . . . . . . . . . O\n 4 . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n 3 . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n 2 . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n 1 . X . . O . . . . . . O .\n```\n\nKey observations:\n- The group of White stones at D13, C12, D11, and E11 is surrounded on three sides by Black stones.\n- The White stone at E1 is isolated and has liberties, so it cannot be captured immediately.\n- The White stone at M5 is isolated and has liberties, so it cannot be captured immediately.\n- The White stone at F6 is isolated and has liberties, so it cannot be captured immediately.\n\nThe most promising group to target is the one around D11. If Black plays at D10, it will surround the White stones at D11 and E11, capturing them.\n\nLet's confirm this by checking the liberties of the White stones at D11 and E11:\n\n- D11 has liberties at C11, D10, and E11.\n- E11 has liberties at D11, E10, and F11.\n\nBy playing at D10, Black removes the liberty at D10 for the White stone at D11, and since E11 is also connected to D11, both will be captured.\n\nTherefore, the move for Black is at D10.\n\n<<<D10>>>"
