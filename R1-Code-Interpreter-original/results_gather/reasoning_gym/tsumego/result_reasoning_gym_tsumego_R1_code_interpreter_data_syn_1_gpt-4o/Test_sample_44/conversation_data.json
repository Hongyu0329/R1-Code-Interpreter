    "To solve this Go challenge, we need to analyze the board and determine the best move for Black (X) to capture the maximum number of White (O) stones. The goal is to find a move that will either directly capture White stones or set up a future capture.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n```\n   A B C D E F G H I J K\n11 . . . . . O . . . . .\n10 . . . . X . X . . . .\n 9 . . . X O O O X . . .\n 8 . . . . X O X . . . O\n 7 X . . . . X . . . . .\n 6 . . . . X . . . . . .\n 5 . . . X . . . . . O .\n 4 X . . . . . X X . . .\n 3 X . . . . . . . . . .\n 2 . . . . . . . . . . .\n 1 . . . . . . X . . . .\n```\n\nKey observations:\n- The group of White stones at D9, E9, F9, and F8 is surrounded by Black stones on C9, G9, and E8.\n- The White stone at F11 is isolated and can be captured if surrounded.\n- The White stone at K8 is isolated and can be captured if surrounded.\n\nTo capture the group at D9, E9, F9, and F8, we need to play at D8 or G8 to complete the surrounding. However, playing at D8 will not capture any stones immediately, as it will only surround the group.\n\nTo capture the isolated White stone at F11, we can play at F10, which will immediately capture it.\n\nTo capture the isolated White stone at K8, we can play at J8, which will immediately capture it.\n\nLet's evaluate these options:\n- Playing at F10 captures 1 stone immediately.\n- Playing at J8 captures 1 stone immediately.\n- Playing at D8 or G8 sets up a future capture but does not capture immediately.\n\nGiven the options, playing at F10 or J8 will result in an immediate capture of 1 stone. Since both moves capture the same number of stones, either move is optimal for immediate capture.\n\nLet's choose the move at F10 for this solution.\n\n<<<F10>>>"
