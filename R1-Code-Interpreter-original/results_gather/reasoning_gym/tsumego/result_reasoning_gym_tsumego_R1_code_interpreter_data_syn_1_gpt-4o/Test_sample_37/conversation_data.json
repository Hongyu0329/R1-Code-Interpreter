    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move by Black that will capture some White stones. The board is a 9x9 grid, and the goal is to find a strategic move that will lead to capturing White stones.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n1. **Identify Weaknesses in White's Formation**: \n   - The White stones are located at B8, B7, D5, F4, H4, and H3.\n   - The White stones at B8 and B7 are surrounded by Black stones at A8, C8, A7, and C7. This group seems vulnerable.\n\n2. **Potential Moves for Black**:\n   - Black can play at C7 to put pressure on the White stones at B8 and B7.\n   - Another potential move is at C6, which could also help in capturing the White stones.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Impact of Each Move**:\n   - Playing at C7 would directly threaten the White stones at B8 and B7, potentially capturing them if White cannot respond effectively.\n   - Playing at C6 might not be as effective immediately, as it doesn't directly threaten a capture.\n\nGiven this analysis, the key move for Black is likely at C7, as it directly threatens the White stones at B8 and B7, potentially leading to their capture.\n\nLet's confirm this by considering the liberties and potential responses from White. If Black plays at C7, White will have limited options to save the stones at B8 and B7, making it a strong move for Black.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is:\n\n<<<C7>>>"
