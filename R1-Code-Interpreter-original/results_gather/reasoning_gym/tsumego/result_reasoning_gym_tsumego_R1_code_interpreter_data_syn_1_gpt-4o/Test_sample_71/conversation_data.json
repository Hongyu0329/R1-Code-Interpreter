    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move by Black that will capture some White stones. The board is represented with coordinates where columns are labeled A to L and rows are numbered 1 to 12. Black stones are represented by 'X' and White stones by 'O'.\n\nThe goal is to find a move that will either directly capture White stones or set up a situation where White stones can be captured in subsequent moves. \n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n- The White stones are located at:\n  - D10\n  - H6\n  - K3, J2, J1, K2, K1, L1\n\n- The Black stones are located at:\n  - A12, L11, L9, J4, J3, H2, I2, I1, J1\n\nThe most vulnerable group of White stones seems to be the ones at the bottom right (K3, J2, J1, K2, K1, L1). These stones are surrounded by Black stones on the left and top sides. \n\nA key move for Black would be to play at a point that reduces the liberties of these White stones, potentially capturing them. \n\nLet's consider the liberties of the White stones in the bottom right:\n\n- The White stone at K3 has liberties at J3, K4, and L3.\n- The White stones at J2, J1, K2, K1, L1 have liberties at I2, J3, K3, L2, and L3.\n\nA move at J3 by Black would reduce the liberties of the White stones at K3 and the group at J2, J1, K2, K1, L1, potentially leading to a capture.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is at J3.\n\n<<<J3>>>"
