    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move for Black that will capture some White stones. The key to solving tsumego problems is to look for moves that either directly capture stones or create a situation where the opponent's stones cannot escape capture.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n```\n   A B C D E F G H I J K\n11 . . . X . . O . O . .\n10 . . . . . . . . . . .\n 9 . . . . O . . . O . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . X . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . X . . . . . . .\n 5 O . . . . . . O . . O\n 4 . . . . . . O X X . .\n 3 . . . . . . X O O X .\n 2 . . . . . . X O . . .\n 1 . . . . . . . X . . .\n```\n\n- The group of White stones at F9, H9, H4, G3, and H3 are surrounded by Black stones.\n- The Black stones at D11, D7, D6, G4, G3, and G2 form a wall that limits the escape routes for the White stones.\n\nThe goal is to find a move that will either directly capture these stones or put them in atari (one move away from capture).\n\nLet's consider potential moves:\n\n1. **G9**: This move would place a Black stone at G9, which is adjacent to the White stones at F9 and H9. This move would put the White stones in atari, as they would have only one liberty left.\n\n2. **H8**: This move would place a Black stone at H8, which is adjacent to the White stones at H9 and G9. This move would also put the White stones in atari.\n\n3. **F8**: This move would place a Black stone at F8, which is adjacent to the White stone at F9. This move would not immediately put the White stones in atari, as they would still have liberties.\n\nThe most promising move seems to be **G9**, as it directly threatens the White stones at F9 and H9.\n\nLet's confirm this by visualizing the board after the move:\n\n```\n   A B C D E F G H I J K\n11 . . . X . . O . O . .\n10 . . . . . . . . . . .\n 9 . . . . O X . O . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . X . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . X . . . . . . .\n 5 O . . . . . . O . . O\n 4 . . . . . . O X X . .\n 3 . . . . . . X O O X .\n 2 . . . . . . X O . . .\n 1 . . . . . . . X . . .\n```\n\nAfter placing a Black stone at G9, the White stones at F9 and H9 are in atari, with only one liberty left at H8. This move effectively captures the White stones.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is:\n\n<<<G9>>>"
