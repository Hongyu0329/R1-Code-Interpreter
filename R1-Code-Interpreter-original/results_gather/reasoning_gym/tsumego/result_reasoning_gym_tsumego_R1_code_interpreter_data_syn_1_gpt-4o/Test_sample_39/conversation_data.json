    "To solve this tsumego problem, we need to identify a move by Black (X) that will capture some White (O) stones. The board is represented with coordinates where columns are labeled A to K and rows are numbered 1 to 11.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n1. **Identify Weaknesses in White's Formation**: \n   - The White stones at C3, F3, G3, and H3 are surrounded by Black stones on the sides. \n   - The White stone at G5 is also surrounded by Black stones on the sides.\n\n2. **Potential Capture Points**:\n   - The White stones at C3 and F3 are part of a group that can potentially be captured if Black can cut off their liberties.\n   - The White stone at G5 is isolated and can be captured if Black plays at F5 or H5.\n\n3. **Key Move**:\n   - Playing at F5 would cut off the liberties of the White stone at G5, potentially capturing it.\n   - Playing at H5 would also cut off the liberties of the White stone at G5, potentially capturing it.\n\nLet's evaluate the move at F5:\n\n- If Black plays at F5, the White stone at G5 will have no liberties and will be captured.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the move at H5:\n\n- If Black plays at H5, the White stone at G5 will have no liberties and will be captured.\n\nBoth F5 and H5 seem to be valid moves for capturing the White stone at G5. However, F5 is more central and might provide better strategic positioning for Black.\n\nTherefore, the key move for Black is at F5.\n\n<<<F5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Tsumego time.
