    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 11, 50, 92, and 85 exactly once in an arithmetic expression that results in 977. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Target**: We need to reach the number 977 using the given numbers and operations.\n\n2. **Exploring Operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Since 977 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be a key operation to reach it.\n\n3. **Considering Multiplication**: \n   - Multiplying two of the larger numbers might get us close to 977. \n   - Let's try multiplying 11 and 85: \\(11 \\times 85 = 935\\).\n   - This is close to 977, and we need an additional 42 to reach 977.\n\n4. **Using Remaining Numbers**: \n   - We have 50 and 92 left. \n   - We need to find a way to use these numbers to make up the difference of 42.\n   - Notice that \\(92 - 50 = 42\\).\n\n5. **Combining the Results**:\n   - We can combine these results to form the expression: \\(11 \\times 85 + (92 - 50)\\).\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - Calculate \\(11 \\times 85 = 935\\).\n   - Calculate \\(92 - 50 = 42\\).\n   - Add them together: \\(935 + 42 = 977\\).\n\nThe expression that uses each number exactly once and results in 977 is:\n\n<<<11*85+(92-50)>>>"
