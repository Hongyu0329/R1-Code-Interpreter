    "To solve the problem of making 104 using the numbers 40, 61, 37, and 2, each used exactly once, we need to carefully consider the arithmetic operations that can be applied: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n1. **Identify the target number and constraints**: We need to reach 104 using the numbers 40, 61, 37, and 2, each used exactly once.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Since 104 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be a useful operation to consider.\n\n3. **Explore combinations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication, as it can quickly increase the value.\n   - Check if any two numbers can be multiplied to get close to 104.\n   - Consider using division to adjust the result if multiplication overshoots the target.\n\n4. **Trial and error**:\n   - Try multiplying 2 and 37: \\(2 \\times 37 = 74\\).\n   - Add 40 to 74: \\(74 + 40 = 114\\).\n   - Subtract 10 (which can be obtained by subtracting 61 from 71) from 114: \\(114 - 10 = 104\\).\n\n5. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Ensure all numbers are used exactly once.\n   - Ensure the operations lead to the target number 104.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, the correct arithmetic expression that uses each number exactly once and results in 104 is:\n\n<<<(2 * 37) + 40 - (61 - 71)>>>"
