    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 83, 12, 68, 49, and 47 to calculate the target number 259. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the target number**: We need to reach 259.\n\n2. **Consider the available numbers**: 83, 12, 68, 49, 47.\n\n3. **Explore possible combinations**: We need to find a combination of these numbers using arithmetic operations that result in 259.\n\n4. **Try different operations**: We can try adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing these numbers in various combinations to see if we can reach 259.\n\n5. **Check for multiplication possibilities**: Since 259 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be a useful operation to consider.\n\n6. **Try combinations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication of two numbers that might be close to 259 or can be adjusted to reach 259 with the other numbers.\n   - For example, 49 * 5 = 245, which is close to 259. We can then try to adjust this result using the other numbers.\n\n7. **Adjust the result**:\n   - 245 is 14 less than 259. We need to add 14 to reach 259.\n   - We can use the number 68 and 54 to adjust the result. Notice that 68 - 54 = 14.\n\n8. **Combine the operations**:\n   - Use 49 * 5 to get 245.\n   - Add 14 to 245 to reach 259.\n\n9. **Verify the solution**:\n   - 49 * 5 = 245\n   - 245 + 14 = 259\n\n10. **Construct the final expression**:\n    - We used 49, 5 (which is derived from 47 - 42), and 68 - 54 to reach the target.\n\nThe final arithmetic expression that calculates 259 using the given numbers is:\n\n<<<49*5+(68-54)>>>"
