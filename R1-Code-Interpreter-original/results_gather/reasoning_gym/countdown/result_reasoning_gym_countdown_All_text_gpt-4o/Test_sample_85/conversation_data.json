    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 30, 44, 15, and 23 exactly once to form an arithmetic expression that equals 112. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the target number**: We need to reach 112.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n3. **Try combinations**: We need to try different combinations of these numbers and operations to see if we can reach 112.\n\n4. **Check feasibility**: Ensure that each number is used exactly once and that the operations lead to the target number.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- **Multiplication and addition**: \n  - If we multiply two numbers and then add or subtract the others, we might reach 112.\n  - For example, 30 * 4 = 120, which is close to 112. However, 4 is not one of our numbers, so this doesn't work.\n\n- **Division and addition**:\n  - If we divide two numbers and then add or subtract the others, we might reach 112.\n  - For example, 44 / 2 = 22, but 2 is not one of our numbers.\n\n- **Combination of operations**:\n  - Let's try using a combination of operations:\n  - 44 + 23 = 67\n  - 67 + 15 = 82\n  - 82 + 30 = 112\n\nThis combination uses all the numbers exactly once and reaches the target number 112.\n\nTherefore, the arithmetic expression that uses all the numbers exactly once to make 112 is:\n\n<<<44 + 23 + 15 + 30>>>"
