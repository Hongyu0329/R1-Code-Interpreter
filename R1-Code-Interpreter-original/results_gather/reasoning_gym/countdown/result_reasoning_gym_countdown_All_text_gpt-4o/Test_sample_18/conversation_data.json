    "To solve the problem of making 391 using the numbers 57, 90, 14, 56, and 26, where each number can only be used once, we need to carefully analyze the possible arithmetic operations that can be performed with these numbers. The goal is to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 391.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: We need to reach exactly 391 using the given numbers and basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).\n\n2. **Consider the Operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number can only be used once, so we need to be strategic about how we combine them.\n\n3. **Initial Observations**: \n   - The number 391 is relatively large, so multiplication might be necessary to reach it.\n   - The numbers 57, 90, 14, 56, and 26 are all smaller than 391, so direct addition won't work without multiplication.\n\n4. **Try Combinations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication of larger numbers to get close to 391.\n   - Check if any combination of multiplication and addition/subtraction can yield 391.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Multiply 56 and 7 to get 392, which is very close to 391.\n   - Notice that 392 is just 1 more than 391, so we need to adjust by subtracting 1.\n   - Use the remaining numbers to achieve this adjustment.\n\n6. **Solution**:\n   - Multiply 56 by 7 (which is 14/2) to get 392.\n   - Subtract 1 from 392 to get 391.\n   - Use the remaining numbers to achieve this subtraction.\n\n7. **Final Expression**:\n   - Use 56 and 7 (from 14/2) to get 392.\n   - Subtract 1 using the remaining numbers.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, the correct arithmetic expression is:\n\n<<<56*(14/2)-90/90>>>"
