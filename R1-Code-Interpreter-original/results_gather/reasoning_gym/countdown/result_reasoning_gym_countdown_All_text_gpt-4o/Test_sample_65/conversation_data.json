    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 74, 55, 48, and 7 exactly once to create an arithmetic expression that equals 184. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Target**: We need to reach the number 184 using the given numbers and operations.\n\n2. **Exploring Combinations**: We should try different combinations of operations and numbers to see if we can reach the target.\n\n3. **Initial Attempts**: \n   - Start by considering the largest number, 74, and see how it can be combined with others.\n   - Consider using multiplication or addition as they can quickly increase the value.\n\n4. **Testing Multiplication**:\n   - If we multiply two numbers, we should check if the result can be combined with the others to reach 184.\n   - For example, 74 * 2 = 148, which is close to 184. We can try to reach 36 with the remaining numbers (55, 48, 7).\n\n5. **Testing Addition**:\n   - Try adding numbers to see if they can be combined to reach 184.\n   - For example, 74 + 55 = 129, then see if 48 and 7 can be used to reach the remaining 55.\n\n6. **Combining Operations**:\n   - Consider using a combination of addition and multiplication.\n   - For example, 74 + (55 + 48) - 7 = 184.\n\n7. **Verification**:\n   - Verify each step to ensure the operations are correct and the numbers are used only once.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, we find that the following expression works:\n\n74 + 55 + 48 + 7\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and results in 184.\n\nFinal answer: <<<74 + 55 + 48 + 7>>>"
