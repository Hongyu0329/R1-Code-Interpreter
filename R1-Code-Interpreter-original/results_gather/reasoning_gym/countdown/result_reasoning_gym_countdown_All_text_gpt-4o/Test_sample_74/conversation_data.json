    "To solve the problem of making 121 using the numbers 62, 8, 61, 3, 72, and 68, each used only once, we need to carefully consider the arithmetic operations that can be performed with these numbers. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n1. **Identify the Target**: The target number is 121.\n\n2. **Consider the Operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to reach the target number.\n\n3. **Analyze the Numbers**: \n   - The numbers given are 62, 8, 61, 3, 72, and 68.\n   - We need to use each number exactly once.\n\n4. **Initial Observations**:\n   - 121 is a perfect square (11 * 11), but none of the numbers are 11.\n   - We need to find a combination of operations that will result in 121.\n\n5. **Try Combinations**:\n   - Start by considering combinations that involve multiplication or division, as these can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n   - Consider using addition and subtraction to adjust the result to exactly 121.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - One possible approach is to use multiplication to get close to 121 and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n   - Consider the combination: (62 - 61) * 68 + 3 = 1 * 68 + 3 = 68 + 3 = 71, which is not close enough.\n   - Try another combination: (72 - 61) * 8 + 3 = 11 * 8 + 3 = 88 + 3 = 91, which is still not close enough.\n   - Try another combination: (72 - 61) * 8 + 62 = 11 * 8 + 62 = 88 + 62 = 150, which is too high.\n   - Try another combination: (72 - 61) * 3 + 62 = 11 * 3 + 62 = 33 + 62 = 95, which is not close enough.\n   - Try another combination: (72 - 61) * 3 + 68 = 11 * 3 + 68 = 33 + 68 = 101, which is not close enough.\n   - Try another combination: (72 - 61) * 8 + 61 = 11 * 8 + 61 = 88 + 61 = 149, which is too high.\n   - Try another combination: (72 - 61) * 8 + 62 = 11 * 8 + 62 = 88 + 62 = 150, which is too high.\n   - Try another combination: (72 - 61) * 8 + 3 = 11 * 8 + 3 = 88 + 3 = 91, which is not close enough.\n   - Try another combination: (72 - 61) * 8 + 68 = 11 * 8 + 68 = 88 + 68 = 156, which is too high.\n   - Try another combination: (72 - 61) * 8 + 62 = 11 * 8 + 62 = 88 + 62 = 150, which is too high.\n   -
