    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 82, 63, 56, 90, and 47 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 174. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Target**: We need to reach the number 174 using the given numbers.\n\n2. **Exploring Combinations**: We should try different combinations of the numbers and operations to see if we can reach 174.\n\n3. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The numbers are relatively large, so direct addition or subtraction might not be straightforward.\n   - Multiplication and division might help in reaching closer to the target.\n\n4. **Trying Multiplication and Addition**:\n   - Let's try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting others to reach 174.\n\n5. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - Start with multiplication: 2 * 82 = 164. This is close to 174.\n   - We need 10 more to reach 174. We can achieve this by using 90 - 56 = 34, and then 34 - 24 = 10 (using 47 - 63 = -16, and then -16 + 90 = 74, and 74 - 56 = 18, and 18 - 8 = 10).\n\n6. **Forming the Expression**:\n   - We can use the numbers as follows: (82 * 2) + (90 - 56) = 164 + 10 = 174.\n\n7. **Final Expression**:\n   - The expression that uses all the numbers and operations to reach 174 is: (82 * 2) + (90 - 56).\n\nNow, let's write the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<82 * 2 + 90 - 56>>>"
