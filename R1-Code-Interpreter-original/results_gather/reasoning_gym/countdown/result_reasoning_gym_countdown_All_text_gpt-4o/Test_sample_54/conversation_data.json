    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 13, 23, 2, and 95 exactly once to create an arithmetic expression that equals 129. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: We need to reach the number 129 using the given numbers.\n\n2. **Consider Operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We need to consider how these operations can combine the numbers to reach 129.\n\n3. **Initial Thoughts**: \n   - Multiplication and division can significantly change the magnitude of numbers, so they might be useful in reaching 129.\n   - Addition and subtraction can adjust the total to reach the exact target.\n\n4. **Try Combinations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division to see if they can bring us close to 129.\n   - For example, multiplying two numbers can give a larger number, which can then be adjusted with addition or subtraction.\n\n5. **Experiment with Multiplication**:\n   - Try multiplying 13 and 23: \\(13 \\times 23 = 299\\). This is too large.\n   - Try multiplying 13 and 2: \\(13 \\times 2 = 26\\).\n   - Try multiplying 23 and 2: \\(23 \\times 2 = 46\\).\n   - Try multiplying 95 and 2: \\(95 \\times 2 = 190\\). This is too large.\n\n6. **Experiment with Division**:\n   - Try dividing 95 by 2: \\(95 / 2 = 47.5\\). This is not useful as it results in a non-integer.\n   - Try dividing 95 by 23: \\(95 / 23 \\approx 4.13\\). This is not useful as it results in a non-integer.\n   - Try dividing 95 by 13: \\(95 / 13 \\approx 7.31\\). This is not useful as it results in a non-integer.\n\n7. **Combine Operations**:\n   - Consider using multiplication to get a base number and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n   - Try \\(13 \\times 2 = 26\\), then add 95: \\(26 + 95 = 121\\). This is close but not 129.\n   - Try \\(23 \\times 2 = 46\\), then add 95: \\(46 + 95 = 141\\). This is too large.\n\n8. **Refine the Approach**:\n   - Consider using subtraction to adjust the total.\n   - Try \\(95 - 23 = 72\\), then add \\(13 \\times 2 = 26\\): \\(72 + 26 = 98\\). This is not correct.\n\n9. **Successful Combination**:\n   - Try \\(95 + 23 = 118\\), then add \\(13 - 2 = 11\\): \\(118 + 11 = 129\\).\n\nAfter testing various combinations, the successful expression is:\n\n<<<95 + 23 + 13 - 2>>>"
