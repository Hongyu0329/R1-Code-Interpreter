    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 85, 80, 79, and 7 exactly once to create an arithmetic expression that equals 510. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: We need to reach the number 510 using the given numbers.\n\n2. **Consider Operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Since 510 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be a key operation to consider.\n\n3. **Analyze the Numbers**: \n   - 85 and 80 are relatively large numbers.\n   - 79 is slightly smaller but still significant.\n   - 7 is the smallest number.\n\n4. **Initial Thoughts**: \n   - Multiplying two large numbers might get us close to 510.\n   - Consider using multiplication with 85 and 7, as 85 * 7 = 595, which is close to 510.\n   - We need to adjust this result to reach exactly 510.\n\n5. **Adjusting the Result**:\n   - If we use 85 * 7 = 595, we need to subtract 85 to reach 510.\n   - This suggests using 80 and 79 in a way that results in subtracting 85.\n\n6. **Formulate the Expression**:\n   - We can use 80 - 79 = 1.\n   - Then, multiply this result by 85 to get 85.\n   - Subtract this from 595 to reach 510.\n\n7. **Construct the Final Expression**:\n   - Start with 85 * 7 = 595.\n   - Subtract (80 - 79) * 85 from 595 to reach 510.\n\nBy following these steps, we can construct the expression:\n\n<<<85 * 7 - (80 - 79) * 85>>>"
