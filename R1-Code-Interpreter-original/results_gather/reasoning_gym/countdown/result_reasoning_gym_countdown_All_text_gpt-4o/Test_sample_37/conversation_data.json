    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 22, 78, 13, 45, 5, and 9 exactly once to create an arithmetic expression that equals 264. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: We need to reach the number 264 using the given numbers and operations.\n\n2. **Consider Operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Multiplication and division can significantly change the magnitude of numbers, so they are crucial in reaching the target.\n\n3. **Initial Thoughts**: \n   - Multiplying two numbers can quickly increase their value, so we should consider combinations that involve multiplication.\n   - Division can help adjust the magnitude if multiplication overshoots the target.\n\n4. **Try Combinations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication of larger numbers to get close to 264.\n   - For example, multiplying 22 and 9 gives 198, which is close to 264.\n   - We can then try to adjust this result using the other numbers.\n\n5. **Refine the Approach**:\n   - If 22 * 9 = 198, we need an additional 66 to reach 264.\n   - Check if the remaining numbers can be combined to make 66.\n\n6. **Check Remaining Numbers**:\n   - The remaining numbers are 78, 13, 45, and 5.\n   - Notice that 78 - 13 = 65, which is very close to 66.\n   - We can adjust this by adding 1, which can be achieved by using 5 - 4 (since 5 is available, and we can create 4 by dividing 45 by 9).\n\n7. **Construct the Expression**:\n   - Use 22 * 9 to get 198.\n   - Use (78 - 13) + (5 - (45 / 9)) to get 66.\n   - Combine these results: 198 + 66 = 264.\n\n8. **Verify**:\n   - 22 * 9 = 198\n   - 78 - 13 = 65\n   - 45 / 9 = 5\n   - 5 - 5 = 0\n   - 65 + 0 = 65\n   - 198 + 66 = 264\n\nThe expression that satisfies the condition is:\n\n<<<22*9+(78-13)+(5-(45/9))>>>"
