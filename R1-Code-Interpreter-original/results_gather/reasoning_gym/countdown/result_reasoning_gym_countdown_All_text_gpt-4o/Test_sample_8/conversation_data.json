    "To solve the problem of making 192 using the numbers 8, 65, 28, 24, and 31, each used exactly once, we need to carefully consider the arithmetic operations that can be performed. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n1. **Identify the target number and constraints**: We need to reach the number 192 using each of the given numbers exactly once.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**: Since 192 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be a key operation to reach it. We should also consider division to adjust the results of multiplication.\n\n3. **Explore combinations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication of larger numbers to get close to 192.\n   - Check if any combination of two numbers multiplied together is close to 192 or can be adjusted to 192 using the remaining numbers.\n\n4. **Trial and error**:\n   - Multiply 8 and 24: \\(8 \\times 24 = 192\\). This is exactly the target number.\n   - Check if the remaining numbers (65, 28, 31) can be used in a way that doesn't affect the result, as they need to be used exactly once.\n\n5. **Incorporate all numbers**:\n   - Since \\(8 \\times 24 = 192\\) already gives us the target, we need to find a way to incorporate the remaining numbers without changing the result.\n   - Consider using subtraction and addition to balance the equation:\n     - \\(65 - 31 = 34\\)\n     - \\(34 - 28 = 6\\)\n     - \\(192 + 6 - 6 = 192\\)\n\n6. **Construct the final expression**:\n   - Use the operations to ensure all numbers are used: \\(8 \\times 24 + (65 - 31 - 28)\\)\n\nThe final expression that uses all numbers exactly once and results in 192 is:\n\n<<<8 * 24 + (65 - 31 - 28)>>>"
