    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 41, 38, 81, and 14 exactly once to create an arithmetic expression that equals 450. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: We need to reach the number 450 using the given numbers.\n\n2. **Consider Multiplication and Division**: Since 450 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be necessary to reach it. We should consider combinations of numbers that multiply to a number close to 450.\n\n3. **Explore Combinations**:\n   - Start by considering pairs of numbers that multiply to a number close to 450.\n   - Check if any of the numbers can be used to adjust the result through addition or subtraction.\n\n4. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Try different combinations of multiplication and division to see if they can be adjusted to reach 450.\n   - Use addition or subtraction to fine-tune the result.\n\n5. **Check All Numbers Are Used**: Ensure that each number is used exactly once in the expression.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Multiply 5 and 81 to get 405.\n- Add 41 to 405 to get 446.\n- Add 14 to 446 to get 460.\n- Subtract 38 from 460 to get 422.\n- Finally, add 28 to 422 to reach 450.\n\nHowever, this approach doesn't use all numbers correctly. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 5 and 81 to get 405.\n- Add 41 to 405 to get 446.\n- Add 14 to 446 to get 460.\n- Subtract 38 from 460 to get 422.\n- Finally, add 28 to 422 to reach 450.\n\nThis approach also doesn't work.
