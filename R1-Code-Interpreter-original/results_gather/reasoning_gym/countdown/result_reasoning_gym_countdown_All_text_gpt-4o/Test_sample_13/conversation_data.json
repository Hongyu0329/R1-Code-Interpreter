    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 95, 98, 92, 28, and 20 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 237. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Target**: We need to reach the number 237.\n\n2. **Consider the Numbers**: We have 95, 98, 92, 28, and 20 available.\n\n3. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The numbers are relatively large, so direct addition or subtraction might not be straightforward.\n   - Multiplication or division might help in reaching closer to the target.\n\n4. **Try Combinations**:\n   - Start by considering combinations of two numbers that might be close to 237.\n   - For example, 95 + 98 = 193, which is less than 237.\n   - 95 + 92 = 187, which is also less than 237.\n   - 98 + 92 = 190, still less than 237.\n\n5. **Consider Multiplication**:\n   - Multiplying two numbers might get us closer to 237.\n   - 95 * 2 = 190, which is less than 237.\n   - 98 * 2 = 196, which is less than 237.\n   - 92 * 2 = 184, which is less than 237.\n\n6. **Explore Further Combinations**:\n   - Try using three numbers: 95 + 98 + 28 = 221, which is close to 237.\n   - Adding 20 to 221 gives 241, which is slightly more than 237.\n\n7. **Refine the Approach**:\n   - Consider using subtraction to adjust the total.\n   - 95 + 98 + 28 = 221, and 221 + 20 = 241.\n   - Subtract 4 to reach 237: 241 - 4 = 237.\n\n8. **Final Expression**:\n   - We can achieve 237 by using: 95 + 98 + 28 + 20 - 4.\n\nNow, let's write the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<95 + 98 + 28 + 20 - 4>>>"
