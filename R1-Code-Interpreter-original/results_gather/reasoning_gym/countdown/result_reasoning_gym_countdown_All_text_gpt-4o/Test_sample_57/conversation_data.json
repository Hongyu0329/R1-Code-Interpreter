    "To solve the problem of calculating 684 using the numbers 18, 39, 75, and 40, each used at most once, we need to carefully analyze how these numbers can be combined using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number.\n\n1. **Understanding the Target**: The target number is 684. We need to find a combination of the given numbers and operations that result in this number.\n\n2. **Exploring Multiplication**: Since 684 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be a useful operation to reach it. Let's consider the largest numbers first:\n   - 75 and 40 are the largest numbers. Multiplying them gives 75 * 40 = 3000, which is too large.\n   - 39 and 18 are smaller. Multiplying them gives 39 * 18 = 702, which is close to 684.\n\n3. **Adjusting the Result**: Since 702 is close to 684, we need to adjust it by subtracting a small number:\n   - The difference between 702 and 684 is 702 - 684 = 18.\n\n4. **Using the Remaining Numbers**: We have used 39 and 18 in the multiplication. We need to use 75 and 40 to adjust the result:\n   - We can use 75 - 40 = 35, but this doesn't help directly.\n   - Instead, we can use 18 directly to adjust the result: 702 - 18 = 684.\n\n5. **Final Expression**: The expression that uses each number at most once and results in 684 is:\n   - (39 * 18) - 18\n\nTherefore, the final arithmetic expression that calculates 684 using the numbers 18, 39, 75, and 40 is:\n\n<<<39 * 18 - 18>>>"
