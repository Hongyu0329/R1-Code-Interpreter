    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 94, 90, 80, 81, 81, and 72 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 147. Each number can be used at most once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Target**: We need to reach the number 147.\n\n2. **Consider Operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n3. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The numbers are relatively large compared to 147, so direct addition or multiplication might not be straightforward.\n   - Division might be useful to reduce the size of numbers.\n\n4. **Try Combinations**:\n   - Start by considering combinations of numbers that can be added or subtracted to get close to 147.\n   - Consider using multiplication or division to adjust the scale of the numbers.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Try different combinations of numbers and operations to see if they can be combined to form 147.\n\n6. **Solution**:\n   - After testing various combinations, one possible solution is to use division and addition:\n     - Divide 81 by 81 to get 1.\n     - Add 90 and 80 to get 170.\n     - Subtract 94 from 170 to get 76.\n     - Add 72 to 76 to get 148.\n     - Subtract 1 from 148 to get 147.\n\n7. **Formulate the Expression**:\n   - The expression that achieves this is: (90 + 80 - 94 + 72) - (81 / 81).\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final expression.\n\n<<<(90 + 80 - 94 + 72) - (81 / 81)>>>"
