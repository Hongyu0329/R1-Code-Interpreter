    "To solve this problem, we need to use each of the numbers 50, 60, 99, 12, 87, and 96 exactly once in an arithmetic expression that equals 112. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Target**: We need to reach the number 112.\n\n2. **Consider Operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n3. **Use Each Number Once**: We must use each of the numbers 50, 60, 99, 12, 87, and 96 exactly once.\n\n4. **Trial and Error**: We will try different combinations of these numbers and operations to reach the target number.\n\nLet's try to construct an expression:\n\n- Start by considering combinations that might simplify the problem. For example, using division to reduce larger numbers or multiplication to increase smaller numbers.\n\n- Consider using subtraction to adjust the total to 112.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use division to simplify: \\( 99 / 99 = 1 \\).\n\n- Use multiplication to adjust the scale: \\( 12 \\times 1 = 12 \\).\n\n- Use addition to build up to 112: \\( 50 + 60 + 12 = 122 \\).\n\n- Use subtraction to reach the target: \\( 122 - 87 = 35 \\).\n\n- Finally, adjust with multiplication: \\( 35 \\times 3.2 = 112 \\).\n\nHowever, this approach doesn't use all numbers correctly. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division to simplify: \\( 96 / 12 = 8 \\).\n\n- Use multiplication to adjust the scale: \\( 8 \\times 12 = 96 \\).\n\n- Use addition to build up to 112: \\( 96 + 60 = 156 \\).\n\n- Use subtraction to reach the target: \\( 156 - 50 = 106 \\).\n\n- Finally, adjust with addition: \\( 106 + 6 = 112 \\).\n\nThis approach also doesn't use all numbers correctly. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division to simplify: \\( 96 / 12 = 8 \\).\n\n- Use multiplication to adjust the scale: \\( 8 \\times 12 = 96 \\).\n\n- Use addition to build up to 112: \\( 96 + 60 = 156 \\).\n\n- Use subtraction to reach the target: \\( 156 - 50 = 106 \\).\n\n- Finally, adjust with addition: \\( 106 + 6 = 112 \\).\n\nThis approach also doesn't use all numbers correctly.
