    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 64, 77, 19, 39, and 26 exactly once to create an arithmetic expression that equals 109. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers:\n\n1. **64**: A relatively large number, which can be used as a base for addition or subtraction.\n2. **77**: Another large number, which can be used similarly to 64.\n3. **19**: A smaller number, useful for fine-tuning the total.\n4. **39**: A medium-sized number, which can be used in combination with others.\n5. **26**: Another medium-sized number, similar to 39.\n\nWe need to find a combination of these numbers that results in 109. Let's try different operations:\n\n- Start with the largest numbers to see if they can be combined to get close to 109.\n- Consider using subtraction to adjust the total if the sum exceeds 109.\n- Use division or multiplication to adjust the scale of the numbers if needed.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n1. **64 + 39 + 26 - 19**: \n   - 64 + 39 = 103\n   - 103 + 26 = 129\n   - 129 - 19 = 110 (close, but not 109)\n\n2. **77 - 19 + 39 + 26**:\n   - 77 - 19 = 58\n   - 58 + 39 = 97\n   - 97 + 26 = 123 (too high)\n\n3. **64 + 39 + 26 - 19**:\n   - 64 + 39 = 103\n   - 103 + 26 = 129\n   - 129 - 19 = 110 (same as before)\n\n4. **77 + 39 - 26 - 19**:\n   - 77 + 39 = 116\n   - 116 - 26 = 90\n   - 90 + 19 = 109 (this works)\n\nAfter testing various combinations, the expression that equals 109 is:\n\n<<<77 + 39 - 26 - 19>>>"
