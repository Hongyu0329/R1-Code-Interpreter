    "To solve the problem of calculating 455 using the numbers 94, 100, 51, and 6, each used at most once, we need to carefully consider how these numbers can be combined using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number.\n\n1. **Understanding the Target**: The target number is 455. We need to find a combination of the given numbers that results in this exact value.\n\n2. **Available Numbers**: The numbers available for use are 94, 100, 51, and 6. Each can be used at most once.\n\n3. **Operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n4. **Initial Observations**:\n   - 455 is a relatively large number, so multiplication might be necessary.\n   - The numbers 94 and 51 are relatively large and could be useful in multiplication.\n   - The number 100 is also large and close to 455, which might be useful in addition or multiplication.\n   - The number 6 is small and might be useful in addition or multiplication to adjust the total.\n\n5. **Exploring Multiplication**:\n   - Consider multiplying two numbers to get close to 455.\n   - 94 * 6 = 564, which is too large.\n   - 51 * 6 = 306, which is too small.\n   - 100 * 6 = 600, which is too large.\n   - 94 * 51 = 4794, which is far too large.\n\n6. **Exploring Division**:\n   - Consider dividing to reduce large products.\n   - 94 / 6 = 15.6667, not useful as it’s not an integer.\n   - 100 / 6 = 16.6667, not useful as it’s not an integer.\n   - 51 / 6 = 8.5, not useful as it’s not an integer.\n\n7. **Exploring Addition and Subtraction**:\n   - Consider combinations of addition and subtraction.\n   - 94 + 51 = 145, which is far from 455.\n   - 100 + 51 = 151, which is far from 455.\n   - 94 + 100 = 194, which is far from 455.\n   - 94 + 100 + 51 = 245, which is still far from 455.\n\n8. **Combining Operations**:\n   - Consider combining operations to reach 455.\n   - 94 * 6 = 564, then subtract 100 to get 464, which is still too large.\n   - 100 * 6 = 600, then subtract 145 (94 + 51) to get 455.\n\n9. **Verification**:\n   - 100 * 6 = 600\n   - 94 + 51 = 145\n   - 600 - 145 = 455\n\nThis combination uses each number at most once and achieves the target number exactly.\n\nFinal answer: <<<100*6-(94+51)>>>"
