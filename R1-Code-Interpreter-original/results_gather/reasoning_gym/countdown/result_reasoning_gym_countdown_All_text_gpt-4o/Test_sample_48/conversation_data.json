    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 48, 4, 41, 75, and 4 to calculate the target number 863. Each number can be used at most once. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the target number**: The target number is 863.\n\n2. **List available numbers**: We have 48, 4, 41, 75, and 4.\n\n3. **Consider operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n4. **Strategy**: Since 863 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be a key operation to reach it. We should look for combinations that can be multiplied to get close to 863.\n\n5. **Try combinations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication of larger numbers: 75 and 41.\n   - Calculate 75 * 11 = 825, which is close to 863.\n   - We need to add 38 to reach 863.\n\n6. **Use remaining numbers**:\n   - We have 48, 4, and 4 left.\n   - Notice that 48 - 4 - 4 = 40, which is close to 38.\n   - Adjust the calculation: 48 - 4 - 4 = 40, then subtract 2 to get 38.\n\n7. **Combine operations**:\n   - Use 75 * 11 = 825.\n   - Add 38 to 825 to reach 863.\n\n8. **Final expression**:\n   - Combine the steps into a single expression.\n\nAfter analyzing and combining the steps, the final arithmetic expression is:\n\n<<<75*11+48-4-4-2>>>"
