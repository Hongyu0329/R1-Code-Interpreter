    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 74, 48, 56, and 66 exactly once to create an arithmetic expression that equals 132. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: We need to reach the number 132 using the given numbers and operations.\n\n2. **Consider Operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Since 132 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be necessary to reach it.\n\n3. **Try Combinations**: We will try different combinations of the numbers and operations to see if we can reach 132.\n\n4. **Check Feasibility**: Ensure that each number is used exactly once and that the operations lead to the target number.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- **Multiplication and Addition**: \n  - If we multiply two numbers and then add or subtract the others, we might reach 132.\n  - For example, multiplying 66 and 2 gives 132, but we don't have a 2. However, we can try to create 2 using the other numbers.\n\n- **Division and Multiplication**:\n  - Consider dividing one number by another to simplify the expression.\n  - For example, 48 / 24 = 2, but we don't have 24. However, we can try to create a similar division.\n\n- **Direct Multiplication**:\n  - Check if multiplying two numbers gives a result close to 132, then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n  - For example, 66 * 2 = 132, but we need to create 2 from the other numbers.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, we find:\n\n- **Combination**: \n  - 66 + 56 + 48 - 74 = 132\n\nThis combination uses each number exactly once and results in the target number 132.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<66 + 56 + 48 - 74>>>"
