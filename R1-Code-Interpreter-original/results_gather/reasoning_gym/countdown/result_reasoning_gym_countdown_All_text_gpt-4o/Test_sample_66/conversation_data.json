    "To solve the problem of making 608 using the numbers 54, 46, 6, 8, and 74, each used exactly once, we need to carefully consider the arithmetic operations that can be performed with these numbers. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n1. **Identify the target number and available numbers:**\n   - Target: 608\n   - Available numbers: 54, 46, 6, 8, 74\n\n2. **Consider possible operations:**\n   - We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n   - Each number must be used exactly once.\n\n3. **Estimate the potential for multiplication:**\n   - Multiplying two numbers can quickly increase their value, which is useful for reaching 608.\n   - Consider the largest numbers for multiplication: 54, 46, and 74.\n\n4. **Try combinations:**\n   - Start by multiplying the largest numbers to see if they can get close to 608.\n   - 54 * 8 = 432\n   - 46 * 8 = 368\n   - 74 * 8 = 592\n\n5. **Adjust with addition or subtraction:**\n   - 592 is close to 608, so consider how to adjust it using the remaining numbers.\n   - 608 - 592 = 16\n\n6. **Use the remaining numbers to make 16:**\n   - Remaining numbers after using 74 and 8: 54, 46, 6\n   - 54 - 46 = 8\n   - 8 + 8 = 16\n\n7. **Combine the operations:**\n   - Use the operations to form the expression: (74 * 8) + ((54 - 46) + 8)\n\n8. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Calculate: 74 * 8 = 592\n   - Calculate: 54 - 46 = 8\n   - Calculate: 8 + 8 = 16\n   - Add: 592 + 16 = 608\n\nThe arithmetic expression that uses each number exactly once and results in 608 is:\n\n<<<74 * 8 + 54 - 46 + 8>>>"
