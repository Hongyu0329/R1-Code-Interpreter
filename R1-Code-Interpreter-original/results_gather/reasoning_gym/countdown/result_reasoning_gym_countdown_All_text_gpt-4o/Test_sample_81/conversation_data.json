    "To solve the problem, we need to use the numbers 23, 58, 5, and 5 exactly once to create an arithmetic expression that equals 262. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: We need to reach the number 262 using the given numbers and operations.\n\n2. **Consider the Operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Multiplication and addition are likely to be more useful for reaching a larger number like 262.\n\n3. **Use the Numbers**: We have 23, 58, 5, and 5. We need to use each number exactly once.\n\n4. **Initial Thoughts**: \n   - Multiplying two numbers can give us a large result, which can then be adjusted using the other numbers.\n   - Consider multiplying 58 by 5, as this will give a large number: 58 * 5 = 290.\n   - We need to adjust 290 to reach 262. The difference is 290 - 262 = 28.\n\n5. **Adjusting the Result**:\n   - We need to subtract 28 from 290 to reach 262.\n   - We can use the remaining numbers 23 and 5 to create 28.\n   - Notice that 23 + 5 = 28.\n\n6. **Construct the Expression**:\n   - Start with the multiplication: 58 * 5 = 290.\n   - Subtract the sum of the remaining numbers: 290 - (23 + 5).\n\n7. **Final Expression**:\n   - The expression that uses all numbers once and equals 262 is: 58 * 5 - (23 + 5).\n\nNow, let's write the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<58 * 5 - (23 + 5)>>>"
