    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 23, 94, 61, and 3 exactly once to form an arithmetic expression that equals 254. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: We need to reach the number 254 using the given numbers.\n\n2. **Consider Operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Since 254 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be necessary to reach it.\n\n3. **Try Multiplication**: \n   - Multiplying two numbers can quickly increase their value. Let's consider multiplying the largest numbers first.\n   - 94 and 3 are the largest and smallest numbers, respectively. Multiplying them gives 94 * 3 = 282, which is too large.\n   - 61 and 3 gives 61 * 3 = 183, which is closer to 254.\n\n4. **Use Remaining Numbers**: \n   - After using 61 and 3, we have 23 and 94 left.\n   - We need to adjust 183 to reach 254. The difference is 254 - 183 = 71.\n\n5. **Find a Combination for 71**:\n   - We have 23 and 94 left. We can try to form 71 using these numbers.\n   - 94 - 23 = 71, which is exactly what we need.\n\n6. **Combine the Steps**:\n   - We can use the multiplication and subtraction operations to reach the target.\n   - First, multiply 61 and 3 to get 183.\n   - Then, subtract 23 from 94 to get 71.\n   - Finally, add 183 and 71 to reach 254.\n\nBy following these steps, we can construct the expression:\n\n<<<61 * 3 + (94 - 23)>>>"
