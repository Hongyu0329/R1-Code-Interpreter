    "To solve the problem of making 563 using the numbers 75, 83, 8, and 26, each used exactly once, we need to carefully consider the arithmetic operations that can be performed: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n1. **Understanding the Target**: The target number is 563. We need to use the given numbers to reach this exact value.\n\n2. **Available Numbers**: The numbers available are 75, 83, 8, and 26. Each number can only be used once.\n\n3. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The numbers are relatively large, so multiplication might be a useful operation.\n   - The target number 563 is close to 560, which is 7 times 80. This suggests that multiplication might be involved.\n\n4. **Exploring Multiplication**:\n   - Consider multiplying two numbers to get close to 563. \n   - 75 and 8 are two numbers that, when multiplied, give 600, which is close to 563.\n   - However, 600 is too large, so we need to adjust.\n\n5. **Exploring Division**:\n   - Consider dividing to adjust the result.\n   - Dividing 600 by 8 gives 75, which is not useful here.\n\n6. **Exploring Addition and Subtraction**:\n   - Consider using addition or subtraction to adjust the result.\n   - If we multiply 83 by 8, we get 664, which is too large.\n   - If we multiply 83 by 7, we get 581, which is close to 563.\n\n7. **Combining Operations**:\n   - Let's try to use subtraction to adjust from 581 to 563.\n   - 581 - 18 = 563.\n\n8. **Using the Remaining Numbers**:\n   - We have used 83 and 8 to get 581.\n   - We need to use 75 and 26 to get 18.\n   - 26 - 8 = 18.\n\n9. **Final Expression**:\n   - Combine the operations: (83 * 7) - (26 - 8).\n\nBy carefully considering the operations and the numbers, we can construct the expression to reach the target number 563.\n\n<<<83*7-(26-8)>>>"
