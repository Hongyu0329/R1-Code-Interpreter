    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 22, 43, 52, 9, and 60 exactly once to create an arithmetic expression that equals 549. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: We need to reach the number 549 using the given numbers.\n\n2. **Consider Operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Multiplication and division can significantly change the magnitude of numbers, so they are crucial for reaching a specific target like 549.\n\n3. **Initial Thoughts**: \n   - Multiplying two numbers can quickly increase their value. \n   - Division can help adjust the result to a specific target.\n   - Addition and subtraction can fine-tune the result.\n\n4. **Try Combinations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication of larger numbers to get close to 549.\n   - 52 and 9 are relatively large and small, respectively, and their product is 468.\n   - 60 is another large number that can be used effectively in multiplication or addition.\n\n5. **Refine the Approach**:\n   - Consider using 60 in a way that complements the product of 52 and 9.\n   - 52 * 9 = 468. We need to add 81 to reach 549.\n   - 81 can be obtained by using the remaining numbers 22 and 43.\n\n6. **Check Feasibility**:\n   - 43 - 22 = 21.\n   - 60 / 21 = 2.857, which is not an integer, so this approach doesn't work directly.\n\n7. **Re-evaluate**:\n   - Try using 60 in multiplication with another number.\n   - 60 * 9 = 540. We need to add 9 to reach 549.\n   - 9 can be obtained by using the remaining numbers 22 and 43.\n\n8. **Final Calculation**:\n   - 60 * 9 = 540.\n   - 43 - 22 = 21.\n   - 540 + 9 = 549.\n\nThus, the expression that equals 549 using each number once is:\n\n<<<60*9+43-22>>>"
