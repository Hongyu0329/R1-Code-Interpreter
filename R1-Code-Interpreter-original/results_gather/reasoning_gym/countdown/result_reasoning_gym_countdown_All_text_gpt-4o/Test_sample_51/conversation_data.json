    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 91, 81, 22, 58, and 30 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 238. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Target**: We need to reach the number 238 using the given numbers.\n\n2. **Exploring Combinations**: We should try different combinations of the numbers using the allowed operations to see if we can reach 238.\n\n3. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The numbers are relatively large, so addition and subtraction might be more useful than multiplication and division.\n   - We should consider combinations that are close to 238 and adjust with smaller numbers.\n\n4. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Start by adding the largest numbers to see if we can get close to 238.\n   - 91 + 81 = 172. This is not close enough.\n   - 91 + 81 + 58 = 230. This is very close to 238.\n   - We need 8 more to reach 238. We have 22 and 30 left.\n   - 230 + 22 = 252, which is too high.\n   - 230 + 30 = 260, which is also too high.\n   - Consider using subtraction: 230 + 22 - 30 = 222, which is not correct.\n\n5. **Re-evaluate**:\n   - Try a different combination: 91 + 81 + 30 = 202.\n   - 202 + 58 = 260, which is too high.\n   - 202 + 22 = 224, which is not correct.\n\n6. **Successful Combination**:\n   - Try using subtraction to adjust: 91 + 81 + 58 = 230.\n   - 230 + 30 = 260.\n   - 260 - 22 = 238.\n\nThis combination works, and we have used each number at most once.\n\nThe final arithmetic expression that equals 238 is:\n\n<<<91 + 81 + 58 + 30 - 22>>>"
