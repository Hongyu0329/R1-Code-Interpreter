    "To solve the problem of making 157 using the numbers 62, 37, 46, 53, 30, and 41, each used only once, we need to carefully consider the arithmetic operations that can be performed with these numbers. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n1. **Identify the Target**: We need to reach the number 157.\n\n2. **Consider the Numbers**: We have the numbers 62, 37, 46, 53, 30, and 41.\n\n3. **Explore Combinations**: We need to explore combinations of these numbers using the allowed operations to reach 157.\n\n4. **Start with Addition**: Since 157 is a relatively large number, starting with addition might be a good approach.\n\n5. **Try Different Combinations**: \n   - Start by adding the largest numbers to see if we can get close to 157.\n   - Consider using subtraction to adjust the total if we exceed 157.\n   - Use multiplication or division if they help in reaching the target.\n\n6. **Check Each Step**: Ensure that each number is used only once and that the operations are valid.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Add 62 and 53 to get 115.\n- Add 41 to 115 to get 156.\n- Add 1 (by using 37 - 36) to 156 to reach 157.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n\n62 + 53 + 41 + (37 - 36)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<62 + 53 + 41 + (37 - 36)>>>"
