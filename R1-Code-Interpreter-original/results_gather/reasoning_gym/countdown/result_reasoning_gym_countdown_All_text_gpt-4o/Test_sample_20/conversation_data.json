    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 43, 76, 88, 73, and 27 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 253. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Target**: We need to reach the number 253 using the given numbers.\n\n2. **Exploring Combinations**: We should try different combinations of the numbers using basic arithmetic operations to see if we can reach 253.\n\n3. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The numbers are relatively large, so addition and subtraction might be more effective than multiplication or division.\n   - We should consider combinations that are close to 253.\n\n4. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Start by trying to add numbers to get close to 253.\n   - Consider using subtraction if the sum exceeds 253.\n   - Multiplication might be useful if we can find a factor of 253.\n\n5. **Finding a Solution**:\n   - Let's try adding 76 and 88 first: 76 + 88 = 164.\n   - Now, add 73: 164 + 73 = 237.\n   - We are close to 253, so let's add 27: 237 + 27 = 264.\n   - We have exceeded 253, so let's adjust by subtracting 11 (264 - 11 = 253).\n   - We can achieve this by subtracting 43 and adding 32 (since 43 - 32 = 11).\n\n6. **Constructing the Expression**:\n   - We can use the numbers 76, 88, 73, 27, and 43 to form the expression: (76 + 88 + 73 + 27) - 43.\n\n7. **Verification**:\n   - Calculate the expression: (76 + 88 + 73 + 27) - 43 = 264 - 43 = 253.\n\nThe arithmetic expression that equals 253 using the given numbers is:\n\n<<<76 + 88 + 73 + 27 - 43>>>"
