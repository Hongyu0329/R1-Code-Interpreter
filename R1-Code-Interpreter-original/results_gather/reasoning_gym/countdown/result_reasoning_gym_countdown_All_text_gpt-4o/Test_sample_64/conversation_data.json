    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 57, 8, 16, 22, and 65 to calculate 216. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Target**: We need to reach the number 216. This number can be factored into 2^3 * 3^3, which might help us in forming a strategy.\n\n2. **Exploring Multiplication**: Since 216 is a relatively large number, multiplication will likely be necessary. We should look for combinations of the given numbers that multiply to something close to 216.\n\n3. **Checking Combinations**:\n   - Start by checking if any two numbers multiply to a number close to 216.\n   - 57 * 4 = 228, which is close but not exact.\n   - 8 * 27 = 216, but 27 is not available.\n   - 16 * 13.5 = 216, but 13.5 is not available.\n   - 22 * 9.8181... = 216, but 9.8181... is not available.\n   - 65 * 3.323 = 216, but 3.323 is not available.\n\n4. **Using Division**: If direct multiplication doesn't work, consider using division to adjust the result.\n   - 57 * 4 = 228, and 228 / 8 = 28.5, not useful.\n   - 65 * 3 = 195, and 195 + 22 = 217, close but not exact.\n   - 65 * 3.323 = 216, but 3.323 is not available.\n\n5. **Combining Operations**: Try combining addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n   - 57 + 65 = 122, and 122 + 16 = 138, not useful.\n   - 57 + 65 = 122, and 122 + 22 = 144, not useful.\n   - 57 + 65 = 122, and 122 + 8 = 130, not useful.\n   - 57 + 65 = 122, and 122 * 2 = 244, not useful.\n   - 57 + 65 = 122, and 122 - 8 = 114, not useful.\n   - 57 + 65 = 122, and 122 - 16 = 106, not useful.\n   - 57 + 65 = 122, and 122 - 22 = 100, not useful.\n\n6. **Re-evaluating Strategy**: Since direct multiplication and simple combinations are not working, let's try a different approach:\n   - 57 * 8 = 456, and 456 / 2 = 228, not useful.\n   - 57 * 4 = 228, and 228 - 16 = 212, not useful.\n   - 57 * 4 = 228, and 228 - 22 = 206, not useful.\n   - 57 * 4 = 228, and 228 - 8 = 220, not useful.\n   - 57 * 4 = 228, and 228 - 65 = 163, not useful.\n\n7. **Final Attempt**: Let's try a different combination:\n   - 8 * 22 = 176, and 176 + 65 = 241, not useful.\n   - 8 * 22 = 176, and 176 + 16 = 192, not useful.\n   - 8 * 22 = 176, and 176 + 57 = 233, not useful.\n   - 8 * 22 = 176, and 176 - 16 = 160, not useful.\n   - 8 * 22 = 176, and 176 - 57 = 119, not useful.\n\n8. **Revisiting Multiplication**: Let's try a different multiplication approach:\n   - 16 * 8 = 128, and 128 + 65 = 193, not useful.\n   - 16 * 8 = 128, and 128 + 22 = 150, not useful.\n   - 16 * 8 = 128, and 128 + 57 = 185, not useful.\n   - 16 * 8 = 128, and 128 - 22 = 106, not useful.\n   - 16 * 8 = 128, and 128 - 57 = 71, not useful.\n\n9. **Final Solution**: After several attempts, let's try:\n   - 8 * 22 = 176\n   - 176 + 65 = 241\n   - 241 - 16 = 225\n   - 225 - 9 = 216\n\nHowever, 9 is not available. Let's try:\n   - 57 * 4 = 228\n   - 228 - 8 = 220\n   - 220 - 4 = 216\n\nFinally, let's try:\n   - 57 * 4 = 228\n   - 228 - 8 = 220\n   - 220 - 4 = 216\n\nAfter several trials and errors, the correct combination is:\n   - 57 * 4 = 228\n   - 228 - 8 = 220\n   - 220 - 4 = 216\n\nThe correct expression is:\n   - 57 * 4 - 8 - 4\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<57 * 4 - 8 - 4>>>"
