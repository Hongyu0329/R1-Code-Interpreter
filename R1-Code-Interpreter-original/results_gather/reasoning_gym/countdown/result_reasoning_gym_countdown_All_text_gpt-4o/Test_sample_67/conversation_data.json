    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 96, 65, 77, 23, and 57 exactly once to create an arithmetic expression that equals 204. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to form the expression.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: We need to reach the number 204 using the given numbers.\n\n2. **Consider Operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We need to think about how these operations can combine the numbers to reach 204.\n\n3. **Initial Thoughts**: \n   - Multiplication and division can quickly increase or decrease the value, so they might be useful for reaching 204.\n   - Addition and subtraction can fine-tune the result.\n\n4. **Try Combinations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication or division to get close to 204.\n   - Use addition or subtraction to adjust the result to exactly 204.\n\n5. **Experiment with Multiplication**:\n   - Consider multiplying two numbers to get a product close to 204.\n   - For example, 96 * 2 = 192, which is close to 204.\n\n6. **Adjust with Addition**:\n   - After getting a product close to 204, use addition to reach exactly 204.\n   - From 192, we need 12 more to reach 204.\n\n7. **Use Remaining Numbers**:\n   - We have 65, 77, 23, and 57 left.\n   - Notice that 23 - 11 = 12, which can be used to adjust the result.\n\n8. **Formulate the Expression**:\n   - Use 96 * 2 to get 192.\n   - Use 23 - 11 to get 12.\n   - Add these results: 192 + 12 = 204.\n\n9. **Verify**:\n   - Ensure all numbers are used once.\n   - Ensure the operations are correct and lead to 204.\n\nBy following these steps, we can construct the expression:\n\n<<<96*2 + 23 - 65/5>>>"
