    "To solve the problem of calculating 116 using the numbers 89, 94, 31, and 90, each used at most once, we need to carefully consider the arithmetic operations that can be performed with these numbers. The operations available are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n1. **Identify the target number and available numbers:**\n   - Target number: 116\n   - Available numbers: 89, 94, 31, 90\n\n2. **Consider possible operations:**\n   - We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to reach the target number.\n\n3. **Explore combinations:**\n   - Start by considering combinations of two numbers and then see if the remaining numbers can be used to reach the target.\n\n4. **Try different operations:**\n   - Check if any two numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided to get close to 116, and then use the remaining numbers to adjust the result.\n\n5. **Calculate using combinations:**\n   - One possible approach is to use subtraction and addition:\n     - Subtract 31 from 94: 94 - 31 = 63\n     - Add 63 to 90: 63 + 90 = 153\n     - Subtract 89 from 153: 153 - 89 = 64\n     - This does not reach 116, so try another approach.\n\n6. **Re-evaluate and adjust:**\n   - Try using division and multiplication:\n     - Divide 90 by 31: 90 / 31 â‰ˆ 2.903 (not useful)\n     - Multiply 31 by 3: 31 * 3 = 93 (close to 94)\n     - Add 89 to 31: 89 + 31 = 120\n     - Subtract 94 from 120: 120 - 94 = 26\n     - Add 90 to 26: 26 + 90 = 116\n\n7. **Verify the solution:**\n   - The operations used are valid and each number is used at most once.\n\nThe final arithmetic expression that calculates 116 using the numbers 89, 94, 31, and 90 is:\n\n<<<89 + 31 - 94 + 90>>>"
