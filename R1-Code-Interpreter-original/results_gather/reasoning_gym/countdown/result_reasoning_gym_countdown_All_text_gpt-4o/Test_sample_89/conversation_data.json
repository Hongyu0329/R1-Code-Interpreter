    "To solve the problem of calculating 153 using the numbers 95, 59, 47, and 48, each used at most once, we need to carefully analyze the possible arithmetic operations that can be performed with these numbers. The goal is to find a combination of operations that results in the target number, 153.\n\n1. **Identify the target number and available numbers:**\n   - Target number: 153\n   - Available numbers: 95, 59, 47, 48\n\n2. **Consider possible operations:**\n   - Addition (+)\n   - Subtraction (-)\n   - Multiplication (*)\n   - Division (/)\n\n3. **Explore combinations:**\n   - Since 153 is relatively large, consider starting with multiplication or addition to reach a higher number.\n   - Check if any two numbers can be multiplied to get close to 153.\n\n4. **Try multiplication:**\n   - 95 * 1 = 95 (too low)\n   - 59 * 1 = 59 (too low)\n   - 47 * 1 = 47 (too low)\n   - 48 * 1 = 48 (too low)\n   - 95 * 2 = 190 (too high)\n   - 59 * 2 = 118 (too low)\n   - 47 * 2 = 94 (too low)\n   - 48 * 2 = 96 (too low)\n   - 95 * 3 = 285 (too high)\n   - 59 * 3 = 177 (too high)\n   - 47 * 3 = 141 (close)\n   - 48 * 3 = 144 (close)\n   - 47 * 4 = 188 (too high)\n   - 48 * 4 = 192 (too high)\n\n5. **Try addition and subtraction:**\n   - 95 + 59 = 154 (close)\n   - 95 + 47 = 142 (close)\n   - 95 + 48 = 143 (close)\n   - 59 + 47 = 106 (too low)\n   - 59 + 48 = 107 (too low)\n   - 47 + 48 = 95 (too low)\n\n6. **Combine operations:**\n   - From the above, 95 + 59 = 154 is very close to 153.\n   - We can adjust this by subtracting 1.\n\n7. **Use subtraction:**\n   - 154 - 1 = 153\n\n8. **Find a way to express 1 using the remaining numbers:**\n   - We have used 95 and 59, leaving 47 and 48.\n   - 48 - 47 = 1\n\n9. **Combine all steps:**\n   - (95 + 59) - (48 - 47) = 153\n\nThus, the arithmetic expression that uses each number at most once to calculate 153 is:\n\n<<<95 + 59 - (48 - 47)>>>"
