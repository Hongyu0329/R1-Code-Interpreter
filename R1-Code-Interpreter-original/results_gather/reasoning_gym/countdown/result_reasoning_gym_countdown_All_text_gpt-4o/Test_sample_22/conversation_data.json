    "To solve the problem of making 176 using the numbers 55, 75, 12, and 34, each used exactly once, we need to consider various arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: We need to reach exactly 176.\n\n2. **Consider the Numbers**: We have 55, 75, 12, and 34. Each can be used only once.\n\n3. **Explore Combinations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n   - Check if any two numbers can be multiplied to get close to 176.\n\n4. **Try Multiplication**:\n   - 55 * 3 = 165 (close to 176, but not exact)\n   - 75 * 2 = 150 (not close enough)\n   - 12 * 14 = 168 (close, but not exact)\n   - 34 * 5 = 170 (close, but not exact)\n\n5. **Try Division**:\n   - 176 / 55 ≈ 3.2 (not an integer)\n   - 176 / 75 ≈ 2.35 (not an integer)\n   - 176 / 12 ≈ 14.67 (not an integer)\n   - 176 / 34 ≈ 5.18 (not an integer)\n\n6. **Combine Operations**:\n   - Consider combinations of addition and subtraction with multiplication or division.\n   - 55 + 75 = 130, 130 + 34 = 164, 164 + 12 = 176 (this works!)\n\n7. **Verify**:\n   - Ensure each number is used once: 55, 75, 12, and 34 are all used.\n   - The operations add up to 176.\n\nThe arithmetic expression that uses each number once and results in 176 is:\n\n<<<55 + 75 + 34 + 12>>>"
