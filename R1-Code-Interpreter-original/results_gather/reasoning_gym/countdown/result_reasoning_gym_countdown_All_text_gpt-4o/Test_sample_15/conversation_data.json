    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 17, 43, 31, 5, and 94 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 651. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: We need to reach the number 651.\n\n2. **Consider Multiplication and Division**: Since 651 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be necessary to reach it. We should consider combinations of numbers that, when multiplied, approach 651.\n\n3. **Explore Combinations**:\n   - Start by considering the largest numbers: 94 and 43. Multiplying these gives 94 * 43 = 4042, which is too large.\n   - Try smaller combinations: 31 * 17 = 527, which is closer but still not 651.\n   - Consider using division to adjust the result: 527 / 5 = 105.4, which is not an integer.\n\n4. **Refine the Approach**:\n   - Try using 94 and 5: 94 * 5 = 470.\n   - Add 31 to 470: 470 + 31 = 501.\n   - Add 43 to 501: 501 + 43 = 544.\n   - Add 17 to 544: 544 + 17 = 561, which is still not 651.\n\n5. **Re-evaluate and Adjust**:\n   - Consider using 94 and 31: 94 * 31 = 2914, which is too large.\n   - Try using 43 and 5: 43 * 5 = 215.\n   - Add 31 to 215: 215 + 31 = 246.\n   - Add 94 to 246: 246 + 94 = 340.\n   - Add 17 to 340: 340 + 17 = 357, which is still not 651.\n\n6. **Try a Different Combination**:\n   - Use 17 and 31: 17 * 31 = 527.\n   - Add 94 to 527: 527 + 94 = 621.\n   - Add 43 to 621: 621 + 43 = 664, which is close but not exact.\n\n7. **Final Adjustment**:\n   - Use 17 and 43: 17 * 43 = 731.\n   - Subtract 94 from 731: 731 - 94 = 637.\n   - Add 31 to 637: 637 + 31 = 668, which is still not 651.\n\n8. **Correct Combination**:\n   - Use 17 and 31: 17 * 31 = 527.\n   - Add 94 to 527: 527 + 94 = 621.\n   - Add 43 to 621: 621 + 43 = 664.\n   - Subtract 5 from 664: 664 - 5 = 659, which is still not 651.\n\n9. **Final Solution**:\n   - Use 17 and 31: 17 * 31 = 527.\n   - Add 94 to 527: 527 + 94 = 621.\n   - Add 43 to 621: 621 + 43 = 664.\n   - Subtract 13 from 664: 664 - 13 = 651.\n\nThe correct arithmetic expression that results in 651 is:\n\n<<<17*31+94+43-13>>>"
