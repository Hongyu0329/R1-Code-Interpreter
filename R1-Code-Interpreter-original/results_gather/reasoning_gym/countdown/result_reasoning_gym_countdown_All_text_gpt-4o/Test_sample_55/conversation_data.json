    "To solve the problem of making 364 using the numbers 16, 2, 2, and 91, we need to carefully consider how these numbers can be combined using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number. Each number can only be used once.\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: The target number is 364. We need to find a combination of operations that will result in this number using the given numbers.\n\n2. **Consider Multiplication**: Since 364 is a relatively large number, multiplication is likely to be involved. We should consider multiplying the larger numbers first.\n\n3. **Examine the Numbers**: The numbers given are 16, 2, 2, and 91. Notice that 91 is a large number, and multiplying it with another number could quickly approach 364.\n\n4. **Try Multiplying 91**: Start by multiplying 91 by one of the other numbers. If we multiply 91 by 4 (which is 2 * 2), we get:\n   - 91 * 4 = 364\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: \n   - We used 91, 2, and 2 to make 4 (2 * 2 = 4).\n   - Then, we multiplied 91 by 4 to get 364.\n   - The number 16 is not used in this solution, but since the problem does not require using all numbers, this is acceptable.\n\n6. **Final Expression**: The arithmetic expression that achieves the target number is:\n   - 91 * (2 * 2)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<91 * 2 * 2>>>"
