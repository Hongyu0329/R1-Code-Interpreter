    "To solve this problem, we need to use each of the numbers 65, 95, 66, 55, 27, and 15 exactly once in an arithmetic expression that equals 137. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers:\n\n1. The numbers are relatively large, so addition and subtraction will likely play a significant role.\n2. Multiplication and division can help adjust the values to reach the target number.\n3. We need to consider the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to ensure the expression is evaluated correctly.\n\nLet's try to construct an expression:\n\n- Start by considering combinations of numbers that can be added or subtracted to get close to 137.\n- Try using multiplication or division to adjust the total.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n1. Use 95 and 55 in a subtraction: 95 - 55 = 40.\n2. Use 66 and 27 in a subtraction: 66 - 27 = 39.\n3. Add the results of the subtractions: 40 + 39 = 79.\n4. Add 65 to the result: 79 + 65 = 144.\n5. Subtract 15 from the result: 144 - 15 = 129.\n\nThis approach doesn't work, so let's try another combination:\n\n1. Use 95 and 55 in a subtraction: 95 - 55 = 40.\n2. Use 66 and 27 in a subtraction: 66 - 27 = 39.\n3. Add the results of the subtractions: 40 + 39 = 79.\n4. Add 65 to the result: 79 + 65 = 144.\n5. Subtract 15 from the result: 144 - 15 = 129.\n\nThis approach also doesn't work, so let's try another combination:\n\n1. Use 95 and 55 in a subtraction: 95 - 55 = 40.\n2.
