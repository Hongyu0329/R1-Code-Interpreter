    "To solve the problem of making 987 using the numbers 52, 26, 15, 23, 75, and 37, we need to carefully consider how these numbers can be combined using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number. Each number can only be used once.\n\n1. **Understanding the Target**: The target number is 987. We need to find a combination of the given numbers that can be manipulated to equal this target.\n\n2. **Exploring Combinations**: We will explore different combinations of the numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. Since the target is relatively large, multiplication might play a key role in reaching the target.\n\n3. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The numbers 52, 26, 15, 23, 75, and 37 are relatively small compared to 987, so multiplication will likely be necessary.\n   - We should consider multiplying larger numbers together first to see if we can get close to 987.\n\n4. **Testing Multiplications**:\n   - Multiplying the largest numbers: 75 * 15 = 1125, which is too large.\n   - Trying other combinations: 52 * 15 = 780, which is closer to 987 but still not there.\n\n5. **Adjusting with Addition or Subtraction**:\n   - If we use 52 * 15 = 780, we need an additional 207 to reach 987.\n   - Check if 207 can be made with the remaining numbers: 26, 23, 75, 37.\n\n6. **Finding 207**:\n   - 207 can be made by adding 75 + 37 + 23 + 26 = 161, which is not 207.\n   - Try another approach: 75 + 37 = 112, and 112 + 23 = 135, and 135 + 26 = 161, still not 207.\n\n7. **Re-evaluating Multiplication**:\n   - Try another multiplication: 37 * 23 = 851.\n   - 851 is closer to 987, needing an additional 136.\n\n8. **Finding 136**:\n   - 136 can be made by adding 75 + 52 + 15 = 142, which is not 136.\n   - Try another approach: 75 + 52 = 127, and 127 + 15 = 142, still not 136.\n\n9. **Re-evaluating Strategy**:\n   - Try another multiplication: 75 * 13 = 975.\n   - 975 is very close to 987, needing an additional 12.\n\n10. **Finding 12**:\n    - 12 can be made by subtracting 15 - 3 = 12, but 3 is not available.\n    - Try another approach: 26 - 15 = 11, which is close to 12.\n\n11. **Final Combination**:\n    - After several trials, the combination that works is:\n      - 75 * 15 = 1125\n      - 1125 - 52 = 1073\n      - 1073 - 26 = 1047\n      - 1047 - 37 = 1010\n      - 1010 - 23 = 987\n\n12. **Final Answer**:\n    - The correct combination that results in 987 is:\n\n<<<75 * 15 - 52 - 26 - 37 - 23>>>"
