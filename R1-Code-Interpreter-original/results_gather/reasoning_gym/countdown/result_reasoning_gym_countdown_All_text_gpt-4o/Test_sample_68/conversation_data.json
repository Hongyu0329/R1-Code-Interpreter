    "To solve the problem of calculating 624 using the numbers 52, 98, 8, and 13, each used at most once, we need to carefully consider how these numbers can be combined using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Target**: The target number is 624. We need to find a way to combine the given numbers to reach this exact value.\n\n2. **Exploring Multiplication**: Since 624 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be a useful operation to reach it. We should consider multiplying the larger numbers first.\n\n3. **Checking Divisibility**: 624 is divisible by 8, which might be useful. Let's check if dividing 624 by 8 gives us a number that can be formed using the other numbers.\n\n4. **Calculating 624 / 8**: \n   - 624 divided by 8 equals 78.\n\n5. **Forming 78**: Now, we need to form 78 using the remaining numbers: 52, 98, and 13.\n\n6. **Exploring Addition and Subtraction**: \n   - 78 can be formed by adding 52 and 26.\n   - 26 can be formed by subtracting 13 from 39.\n\n7. **Using the Remaining Numbers**: \n   - We have 52 and 13 available. \n   - 39 can be formed by subtracting 13 from 52.\n\n8. **Combining the Steps**:\n   - First, calculate 52 - 13 = 39.\n   - Then, 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - Finally, 78 * 8 = 624.\n\nBy following these steps, we can form the target number 624 using the given numbers.\n\nFinal arithmetic expression:\n<<<(52-13+39)*8>>>"
