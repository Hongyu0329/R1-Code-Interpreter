    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 78, 54, 85, 11, and 8 exactly once to form an arithmetic expression that equals 667. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the target**: We need to reach 667 using the given numbers.\n\n2. **Consider operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\n3. **Initial thoughts**: \n   - Multiplication and division can significantly change the magnitude of numbers, so they might be useful for reaching a larger number like 667.\n   - Addition and subtraction can fine-tune the result.\n\n4. **Try combinations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication of larger numbers to get close to 667.\n   - 78 and 8 are relatively large numbers, and multiplying them gives 624, which is close to 667.\n   - We need to add 43 to 624 to reach 667.\n\n5. **Use remaining numbers**:\n   - We have 54, 85, and 11 left.\n   - Notice that 54 - 11 = 43, which is exactly what we need to add to 624.\n\n6. **Formulate the expression**:\n   - Multiply 78 and 8 to get 624.\n   - Subtract 11 from 54 to get 43.\n   - Add the result of the subtraction to the product.\n\nBy following these steps, we can construct the expression:\n\n<<<78*8 + (54-11)>>>"
