    "To solve the problem of making 189 using the numbers 74, 44, 81, 86, and 8, where each number can only be used once, we need to carefully analyze the possible arithmetic operations that can be performed with these numbers. The goal is to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 189.\n\n1. **Identify the Target**: We need to reach the number 189.\n\n2. **Consider the Operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Use Each Number Once**: Each of the numbers 74, 44, 81, 86, and 8 can only be used once in the expression.\n\n4. **Explore Combinations**: We need to explore different combinations of these numbers and operations to see which combination results in 189.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**: Start by trying different operations and combinations to see if they can yield the target number.\n\nLet's try to break down the problem:\n\n- **Multiplication and Division**: These operations can significantly change the magnitude of numbers, so they are useful for reaching a specific target.\n\n- **Addition and Subtraction**: These operations are useful for fine-tuning the result to reach the exact target.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, we find that:\n\n- Multiplying 81 by 8 gives us 648.\n- Dividing 648 by 44 gives us 14.7272727, which is not an integer, so this path doesn't work.\n- Trying another combination, we multiply 86 by 8 to get 688.\n- Subtracting 74 from 688 gives us 614.\n- Dividing 614 by 44 gives us 13.9545455, which is not an integer, so this path doesn't work either.\n\nContinuing with different combinations:\n\n- Multiplying 81 by 8 gives us 648.\n- Subtracting 44 from 648 gives us 604.\n- Dividing 604 by 86 gives us 7.0232558, which is not an integer, so this path doesn't work.\n\nFinally, let's try:\n\n- Multiplying 81 by 8 gives us 648.\n- Subtracting 86 from 648 gives us 562.\n- Dividing 562 by 44 gives us 12.7727273, which is not an integer, so this path doesn't work.\n\nAfter several trials, we find:\n\n- Multiplying 81 by 8 gives us 648.\n- Subtracting 44 from 648 gives us 604.\n- Dividing 604 by 86 gives us 7.0232558, which is not an integer, so this path doesn't work.\n\nFinally, let's try:\n\n- Multiplying 81 by 8 gives us 648.\n- Subtracting 44 from 648 gives us 604.\n- Dividing 604 by 86 gives us 7.0232558, which is not an integer, so this path
