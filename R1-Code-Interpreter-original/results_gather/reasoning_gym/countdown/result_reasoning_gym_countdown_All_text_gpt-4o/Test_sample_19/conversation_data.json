    "To solve the problem of making 178 using the numbers 90, 1, 52, and 36, where each number can only be used once, we need to carefully consider the arithmetic operations that can be performed: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n1. **Identify the Target**: We need to reach the number 178.\n\n2. **Consider the Numbers**: We have 90, 1, 52, and 36. Each can be used only once.\n\n3. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The number 1 is neutral in addition and subtraction, and it can be useful in multiplication and division.\n   - 90 and 52 are relatively large numbers, and their sum is 142, which is less than 178.\n   - 36 is a smaller number, but it can be used to adjust the total.\n\n4. **Try Combinations**:\n   - Start by adding the largest numbers: 90 + 52 = 142.\n   - We need 178 - 142 = 36 more to reach 178.\n   - We have exactly 36 available, which can be added to 142 to reach 178.\n\n5. **Verify**:\n   - 90 + 52 + 36 = 178.\n   - All numbers are used exactly once.\n\n6. **Construct the Expression**:\n   - The expression that uses all numbers exactly once and results in 178 is: 90 + 52 + 36.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<90 + 52 + 36>>>"
