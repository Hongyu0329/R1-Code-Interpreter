    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 75, 90, 80, 39, and 86 to calculate 751. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Target**: We need to reach 751 using the given numbers. The target is close to 750, which is a multiple of 75. This suggests that using 75 as a base might be helpful.\n\n2. **Exploring Multiplication**: \n   - If we multiply 75 by 10, we get 750, which is very close to 751. \n   - However, we don't have a 10, but we can try to form it using the other numbers.\n\n3. **Forming 10**:\n   - We can form 10 by dividing 90 by 9. However, we don't have a 9 directly, but we can try to approximate or adjust using the available numbers.\n\n4. **Using the Numbers**:\n   - Let's try to use the numbers in a way that gets us close to 751.\n   - We can start by multiplying 75 by a number close to 10.\n\n5. **Calculating**:\n   - If we multiply 75 by 10, we get 750. We need 1 more to reach 751.\n   - We can use the number 1 by dividing 39 by 39, which gives us 1.\n\n6. **Constructing the Expression**:\n   - Multiply 75 by 10 (using 90/9 approximation).\n   - Add 1 to the result.\n\n7. **Final Expression**:\n   - 75 * (90/9) + (39/39)\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n<<<75 * (90/9) + (39/39)>>>"
