    "To solve the problem of calculating 134 using the numbers 56, 78, 1, and 1, each used at most once, we need to carefully consider how these numbers can be combined using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number.\n\n1. **Identify the target number and available numbers:**\n   - Target number: 134\n   - Available numbers: 56, 78, 1, 1\n\n2. **Consider possible operations:**\n   - We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n3. **Explore combinations:**\n   - Since 134 is larger than any of the individual numbers, we should consider addition or multiplication as primary operations.\n   - Multiplying 56 and 78 gives a very large number, so multiplication might not be the best first step.\n   - Consider adding 56 and 78: 56 + 78 = 134.\n\n4. **Verify the solution:**\n   - The sum of 56 and 78 is exactly 134, which matches the target number.\n   - The numbers 1 and 1 are not needed in this case, but they are allowed to be unused.\n\n5. **Formulate the final expression:**\n   - Since we have found that 56 + 78 equals the target number, we can express this as our final answer.\n\nThe final arithmetic expression that calculates 134 using the given numbers is:\n\n<<<56 + 78>>>"
