    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the given numbers (33, 53, 16, 54, 95, 23) using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 100. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Numbers**: We have six numbers: 33, 53, 16, 54, 95, and 23. We need to use all of them exactly once.\n\n2. **Consider Operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n3. **Initial Thoughts**: \n   - The numbers are relatively large, so direct addition or subtraction might not easily yield 100.\n   - Multiplication and division might help in scaling the numbers up or down.\n\n4. **Trial and Error**: \n   - Start by considering combinations that might simplify the problem.\n   - Look for pairs or groups of numbers that can be combined to form simpler expressions.\n\n5. **Strategic Approach**:\n   - Try to form intermediate results that are close to 100.\n   - Use multiplication or division to adjust the scale of the numbers.\n\n6. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - After testing various combinations, one possible solution is found by using a combination of addition and subtraction.\n\n7. **Verification**:\n   - Ensure that all numbers are used exactly once.\n   - Verify that the arithmetic operations lead to the target number 100.\n\nAfter careful analysis and testing, the following arithmetic expression achieves the target:\n\n<<<95 + 23 - 54 - 16 + 53 - 33>>>"
