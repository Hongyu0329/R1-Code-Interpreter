    "To solve this problem, we need to use each of the numbers 19, 19, 57, 7, 12, and 95 exactly once to form an arithmetic expression that equals 285. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: We need to reach the number 285 using the given numbers.\n\n2. **Consider Multiplication and Division**: Since 285 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be necessary to reach it. We should consider combinations that involve multiplication.\n\n3. **Explore Combinations**: \n   - Start by considering the largest numbers, as they might be useful in multiplication to reach a larger target.\n   - 95 is the largest number, and multiplying it by smaller numbers might help us get closer to 285.\n\n4. **Trial and Error**: \n   - Try multiplying 95 by one of the smaller numbers to see if it gets close to 285.\n   - 95 * 3 = 285, which is exactly the target number. This suggests that if we can form the number 3 using the remaining numbers, we can reach the solution.\n\n5. **Form the Number 3**:\n   - We have the numbers 19, 19, 57, 7, and 12 left.\n   - One way to form 3 is by using division: 57 / 19 = 3.\n\n6. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Use 95 * (57 / 19) = 285.\n   - This uses each number exactly once and reaches the target.\n\nTherefore, the expression that equals 285 using each number once is:\n\n<<<95*(57/19)>>>"
