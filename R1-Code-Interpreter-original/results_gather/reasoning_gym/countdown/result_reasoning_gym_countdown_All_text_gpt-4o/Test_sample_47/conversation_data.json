    "To solve the problem of making 809 using the numbers 5, 23, 35, and 9, each used exactly once, we need to consider various arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: We need to reach the number 809.\n\n2. **Available Numbers**: 5, 23, 35, 9.\n\n3. **Operations**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n4. **Constraints**: Each number can only be used once.\n\n5. **Initial Thoughts**: \n   - Multiplication and division can significantly change the magnitude of numbers, so they might be useful in reaching a larger number like 809.\n   - Consider combinations that might multiply to a number close to 809.\n\n6. **Exploration**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication of two numbers to get close to 809.\n   - 23 * 35 = 805, which is very close to 809.\n   - We need to add 4 to 805 to reach 809.\n\n7. **Using Remaining Numbers**:\n   - We have 5 and 9 left.\n   - 9 - 5 = 4, which is exactly what we need to add to 805 to reach 809.\n\n8. **Construct the Expression**:\n   - Use the multiplication and addition found: (23 * 35) + (9 - 5).\n\n9. **Verify**:\n   - Calculate 23 * 35 = 805.\n   - Calculate 9 - 5 = 4.\n   - Add them: 805 + 4 = 809.\n\nThe arithmetic expression that uses each number exactly once and results in 809 is:\n\n<<<23 * 35 + 9 - 5>>>"
