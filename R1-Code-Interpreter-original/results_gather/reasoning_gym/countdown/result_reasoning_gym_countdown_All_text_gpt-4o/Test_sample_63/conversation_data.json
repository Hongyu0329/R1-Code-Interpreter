    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 92, 15, 100, 24, 5, and 83 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 601. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Target**: We need to reach the number 601.\n\n2. **Consider Large Numbers**: The numbers 100 and 83 are relatively large and could be useful in getting close to 601.\n\n3. **Explore Multiplication**: Multiplying two numbers can quickly increase their value. Consider combinations like 100 * 5 = 500, which is close to 601.\n\n4. **Use Addition/Subtraction**: After getting close to 601 with multiplication, use addition or subtraction to adjust the total.\n\n5. **Try Different Combinations**: Experiment with different combinations of numbers and operations to see which gets closest to 601.\n\nLet's try a combination:\n\n- Start with 100 * 5 = 500.\n- Add 92 to 500: 500 + 92 = 592.\n- Add 15 to 592: 592 + 15 = 607.\n- Subtract 24 from 607: 607 - 24 = 583.\n- Finally, add 83 to 583: 583 + 83 = 666.\n\nThis approach overshoots the target. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Start with 100 * 5 = 500.\n- Add 92 to 500: 500 + 92 = 592.\n- Add 24 to 592: 592 + 24 = 616.\n- Subtract 15 from 616: 616 - 15 = 601.\n\nThis approach successfully reaches the target of 601.\n\nThe arithmetic expression that achieves this is:\n\n<<<100*5+92+24-15>>>"
