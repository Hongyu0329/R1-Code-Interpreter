    "To solve this problem, we need to use each of the numbers 10, 43, 99, 100, 36, and 10 exactly once in an arithmetic expression that equals 190. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's analyze the numbers:\n\n1. We have two 10s, which can be useful for operations like addition or multiplication.\n2. The number 43 is relatively prime and can be used in addition or subtraction.\n3. The number 99 is close to 100, which might suggest a subtraction or addition operation.\n4. The number 100 is a round number, often used in multiplication or division.\n5. The number 36 is a perfect square and can be used in various operations.\n\nNow, let's try to construct an expression:\n\n- Start by considering the largest numbers: 100 and 99. Their sum is 199, which is close to 190. We can use subtraction to adjust this.\n- Consider using 43 in subtraction: 199 - 43 = 156.\n- We still need to reach 190, so we need to add 34 more.\n- We have two 10s and 36 left. Notice that 36 - 10 = 26.\n- We can add the remaining 10 to 26 to get 36.\n- Now, we have 156 + 36 = 192, which is close to 190.\n- We need to adjust by subtracting 2, which can be done by using the remaining 10 and 10: 10 - 10 = 0, which doesn't help directly.\n- Instead, let's try another approach: 100 + 36 = 136.\n- Add 43 to 136: 136 + 43 = 179.\n- Now, add 10 to 179: 179 + 10 = 189.\n- Finally, add the remaining 1 from the second 10: 189 + 1 = 190.\n\nThus, the expression that equals 190 is:\n\n<<<100 + 36 + 43 + 10 + 1>>>"
