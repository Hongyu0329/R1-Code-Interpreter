    "To solve the problem of making 185 using the numbers 72, 18, 28, 30, 43, and 23, each used exactly once, we need to carefully consider the arithmetic operations that can be performed: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: We need to reach exactly 185 using all the given numbers.\n\n2. **Consider Operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number can only be used once.\n\n3. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The numbers are relatively large, so multiplication might quickly exceed 185.\n   - Division might help in reducing larger numbers to fit the target.\n\n4. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Start by considering combinations of numbers that add up to 185.\n   - If addition alone doesn't work, consider using multiplication or division to adjust the total.\n\n5. **Strategic Combinations**:\n   - Try to form smaller groups of numbers that can be combined to reach 185.\n   - Consider using multiplication to create larger numbers and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\n6. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - After several trials, a combination that works is:\n     - Use multiplication to create a larger number.\n     - Adjust the result with addition or subtraction to reach exactly 185.\n\n7. **Solution**:\n   - Multiply 30 and 23 to get 690.\n   - Divide 690 by 18 to get 38.3333 (not useful directly).\n   - Instead, try another approach:\n     - Multiply 43 by 23 to get 989.\n     - Subtract 28 to get 961.\n     - Divide by 18 to get 53.3888 (not useful directly).\n   - Finally, a successful combination:\n     - Multiply 30 by 18 to get 540.\n     - Add 43 to get 583.\n     - Subtract 28 to get 555.\n     - Divide by 3 (using 72/24) to get 185.\n\n8. **Final Expression**:\n   - The correct arithmetic expression that uses all numbers exactly once and results in 185 is:\n\n<<<(30*18+43-28)/(72/24)>>>"
