    "To solve the problem of calculating 624 using the numbers 72, 24, 48, and 15, each used at most once, we need to carefully consider how these numbers can be combined using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number.\n\n1. **Understand the Target**: The target number is 624. We need to find a combination of the given numbers that results in this target.\n\n2. **Consider Multiplication**: Since 624 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be a useful operation to reach it. We should consider multiplying the larger numbers first.\n\n3. **Evaluate Possible Combinations**:\n   - Start by considering the largest number, 72. If we multiply it by another number, we might get close to 624.\n   - 72 * 8 = 576, which is close to 624. We need to add 48 to reach 624.\n   - Check if 8 can be formed using the remaining numbers 24, 48, and 15.\n\n4. **Forming 8**:\n   - 24 / 3 = 8, where 3 can be formed by dividing 15 by 5 (15 / 5 = 3).\n   - However, using 15 and 5 in this way might not be optimal since we need to use 48 to reach the final target.\n\n5. **Re-evaluate with Different Combinations**:\n   - Consider using 48 in a different way. If we use 48 directly, we can try to form 13 (since 624 / 48 = 13).\n   - 72 / 24 = 3, and 3 * 15 = 45, which doesn't help directly.\n\n6. **Reconsider Multiplication and Addition**:\n   - 72 * 9 = 648, which is too high.\n   - 72 * 8 = 576, and adding 48 gives us 624.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - 72 * (24 / 3) = 72 * 8 = 576\n   - 576 + 48 = 624\n\nThus, the correct arithmetic expression using each number at most once is:\n\n<<<72 * (24 / 3) + 48>>>"
