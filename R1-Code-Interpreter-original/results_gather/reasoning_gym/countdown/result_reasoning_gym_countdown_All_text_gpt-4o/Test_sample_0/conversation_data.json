    "To solve the problem of making 138 using the numbers 11, 26, 43, and 58, each used exactly once, we need to consider various arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let's analyze step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to use each of the numbers 11, 26, 43, and 58 exactly once to form the number 138 using basic arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The target number 138 is relatively large compared to the given numbers, suggesting that multiplication might be necessary.\n   - The numbers are relatively close to each other, so simple addition or subtraction is unlikely to reach 138.\n\n3. **Exploring Multiplication**:\n   - Consider multiplying two numbers to get a larger number, then use the remaining numbers to adjust the result to 138.\n   - For example, multiplying 26 and 58 gives 1508, which is too large, so this approach might not work directly.\n\n4. **Exploring Division**:\n   - Division can help reduce large numbers. For instance, dividing a product by another number might bring us closer to 138.\n\n5. **Combining Operations**:\n   - Try combinations of multiplication and addition/subtraction to reach 138.\n   - For example, if we multiply two numbers and then add or subtract the others, we might reach the target.\n\n6. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Let's try multiplying 11 and 26: 11 * 26 = 286.\n   - This is too large, so let's try another combination.\n   - Try multiplying 11 and 43: 11 * 43 = 473.\n   - Again, too large, so let's try another combination.\n   - Try multiplying 11 and 58: 11 * 58 = 638.\n   - Still too large, so let's try another combination.\n   - Try multiplying 26 and 43: 26 * 43 = 1118.\n   - Again, too large, so let's try another combination.\n   - Try multiplying 26 and 58: 26 * 58 = 1508.\n   - Again, too large, so let's try another combination.\n   - Try multiplying 43 and 58: 43 * 58 = 2494.\n   - Again, too large, so let's try another combination.\n\n7. **Revisiting Division**:\n   - Consider dividing a product by one of the numbers to reduce the result.\n   - For example, (43 * 58) / 11 = 2494 / 11 = 226.72, not an integer.\n   - Try (43 * 58) / 26 = 2494 / 26 = 95.92, not an integer.\n   - Try (26 * 58) / 43 = 1508 / 43 = 35.07, not an integer.\n   - Try (26 * 43) / 58 = 1118 / 58 = 19.27, not an integer.\n   - Try (11 * 58) / 43 = 638 / 43 = 14.84, not an integer.\n   - Try (11 * 43) / 26 = 473 / 26 = 18.19, not an integer.\n   - Try (11 * 26) / 58 = 286 / 58 = 4.93, not an integer.\n\n8. **Revisiting Addition and Subtraction**:\n   - Consider adding or subtracting results from multiplication.\n   - For example, 11 + 26 + 43 + 58 = 138, which is the target number.\n\nAfter analyzing various combinations, the solution is found by simply adding all the numbers together:\n\n<<<11 + 26 + 43 + 58>>>"
