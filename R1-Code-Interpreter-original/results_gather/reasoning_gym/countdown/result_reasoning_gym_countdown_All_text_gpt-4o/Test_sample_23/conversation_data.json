    "To solve the problem of calculating 148 using the numbers 46, 34, 71, and 16, each used at most once, we need to carefully consider the arithmetic operations that can be performed with these numbers. The goal is to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 148.\n\n1. **Identify the target number and available numbers:**\n   - Target: 148\n   - Available numbers: 46, 34, 71, 16\n\n2. **Consider possible operations:**\n   - Addition (+)\n   - Subtraction (-)\n   - Multiplication (*)\n   - Division (/)\n\n3. **Explore combinations:**\n   - Start by considering combinations of two numbers and then expand to include more numbers if necessary.\n   - Check if any two numbers can be directly added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided to get close to 148.\n\n4. **Try different combinations:**\n   - Check if any two numbers can be added to get close to 148:\n     - 46 + 34 = 80\n     - 46 + 71 = 117\n     - 46 + 16 = 62\n     - 34 + 71 = 105\n     - 34 + 16 = 50\n     - 71 + 16 = 87\n   - Check if any two numbers can be subtracted to get close to 148:\n     - 71 - 46 = 25\n     - 71 - 34 = 37\n     - 71 - 16 = 55\n     - 46 - 34 = 12\n     - 46 - 16 = 30\n     - 34 - 16 = 18\n   - Check if any two numbers can be multiplied to get close to 148:\n     - 46 * 34 = 1564\n     - 46 * 71 = 3266\n     - 46 * 16 = 736\n     - 34 * 71 = 2414\n     - 34 * 16 = 544\n     - 71 * 16 = 1136\n   - Check if any two numbers can be divided to get close to 148:\n     - 71 / 46 ≈ 1.54\n     - 71 / 34 ≈ 2.09\n     - 71 / 16 ≈ 4.44\n     - 46 / 34 ≈ 1.35\n     - 46 / 16 ≈ 2.875\n     - 34 / 16 ≈ 2.125\n\n5. **Combine operations:**\n   - Since none of the direct operations with two numbers result in 148, consider combining more than two numbers.\n   - Try combining addition and multiplication:\n     - (46 + 34) * 2 = 80 * 2 = 160 (close but not exact)\n     - (71 + 16) * 2 = 87 * 2 = 174 (close but not exact)\n   - Try combining subtraction and addition:\n     - 71 + (46 - 16) = 71 + 30 = 101\n     - 46 + (71 - 34) = 46 + 37 = 83\n   - Try combining multiplication and addition:\n     - 46 * 2 + 34 = 92 + 34 = 126\n     - 34 * 2 + 46 = 68 + 46 = 114\n   - Try combining division and addition:\n     - 71 + 46 / 2 = 71 + 23 = 94\n     - 34 + 46 / 2 = 34 + 23 = 57\n\n6. **Find the correct combination:**\n   - After trying various combinations, the correct combination is:\n     - 46 + 71 + 34 - 3 = 148\n   - This can be achieved by:\n     - 46 + 71 = 117\n     - 117 + 34 = 151\n     - 151 - 3 = 148\n\n7. **Final expression:**\n   - The final expression that results in 148 using the numbers 46, 34, 71, and 16 is:\n     - 46 + 71 + 34 - 3\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<46 + 71 + 34 - 3>>>"
