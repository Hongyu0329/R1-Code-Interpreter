    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 75, 23, 29, 32, 93, and 75 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 281. Each number can be used at most once. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to achieve this.\n\nLet's start by considering the largest numbers and see if we can form 281 by combining them with the others. We can try different combinations and operations to see if we can reach the target number.\n\nFirst, let's try to find a combination of numbers that sum up to 281 or can be adjusted to 281 using basic arithmetic operations.\n\nWe can start by considering the largest number, 93, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 281.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n1. 93 + 75 + 75 = 243\n2. 93 + 75 + 32 = 200\n3. 93 + 75 + 23 = 191\n4. 93 + 75 + 29 = 197\n\nNone of these combinations directly give us 281. Let's try using multiplication or division to adjust the results.\n\nLet's try using multiplication:\n\n1. 93 * 3 = 279 (close to 281)\n2. 75 * 3 = 225\n3. 32 * 3 = 96\n4. 29 * 3 = 87\n5. 23 * 3 = 69\n\nWe can see that 93 * 3 is close to 281. Let's see if we can adjust it by adding or subtracting the remaining numbers.\n\n93 * 3 = 279\n279 + 2 = 281\n\nWe need to find a way to make 2 using the remaining numbers: 75, 23, 29, 32, 75.\n\nLet's try using division:\n\n1. 75 / 32 = 2.34375 (not exactly 2)\n2. 29 / 23 = 1.26087 (not exactly 2)\n3. 75 / 29 = 2.5862 (not exactly 2)\n\nIt seems challenging to make exactly 2 with the remaining numbers. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's try using subtraction:\n\n1. 93 + 75 + 75 + 32 + 23 - 29 = 269 (not 281)\n2. 93 + 75 + 75 + 29 + 23 - 32 = 263 (not 281)\n\nLet's try using a combination of addition and subtraction:\n\n1. 93 + 75 + 75 + 32 + 23 - 29 = 269\n2. 93 + 75 + 75 + 29 + 23 - 32 = 263\n\nLet's try using multiplication and addition:\n\n1. 93 * 3 + 23 - 29 = 281\n\nThis seems to work. Let's verify this calculation:\n\n93 * 3 = 279\n279 + 23 = 302\n302 - 29 = 273\n\nIt seems I made a mistake in the calculation.
