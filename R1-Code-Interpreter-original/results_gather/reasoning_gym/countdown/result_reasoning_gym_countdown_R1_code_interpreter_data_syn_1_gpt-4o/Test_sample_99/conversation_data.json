    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 56, 83, 20, 12, and 34 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 380. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible combinations and operations that could lead to 380. We can try different arithmetic operations and see if we can reach the target number.\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and addition, as they are likely to give us larger numbers.\n2. We can also consider using division to adjust the results if needed.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n- We can also try adding several numbers and then multiplying or dividing.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations and see if we can find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [56, 83, 20, 12, 34]\ntarget = 380\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {nums[i]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]}\"\n            for i in range(1, len(num_perm)):\n                expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {num_perm[i]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers with all possible combinations of operations and check if any of them evaluate to 380. Let's see if it finds a solution."

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate 380 using all of these numbers: 56, 83, 20, 12, 34.\nEach number may be used at most once.\n\nFinal answer format instructions:\n1.
