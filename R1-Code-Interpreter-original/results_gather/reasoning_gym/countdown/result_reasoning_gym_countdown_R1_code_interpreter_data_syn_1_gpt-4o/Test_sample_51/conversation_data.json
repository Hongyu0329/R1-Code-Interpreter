    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 91, 81, 22, 58, and 30 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 238. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible combinations and operations that could lead to the target number 238. We can try different combinations and see if they add up to 238.\n\n1. We can start by trying to add some of the numbers together to see if they get close to 238.\n2. We can also try multiplying some numbers to see if they get close to 238.\n3. We can use subtraction to adjust the total if it exceeds 238.\n4. Division might be useful if we need to reduce a number to fit into the total.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n- Adding the largest numbers: 91 + 81 = 172. This is less than 238, so we need more.\n- Adding another number: 172 + 58 = 230. This is close, but not quite 238.\n- Adding 22 to 230 gives us 252, which is too much.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n- Start with 91 + 81 = 172.\n- Add 30 to 172: 172 + 30 = 202.\n- Add 22 to 202: 202 + 22 = 224.\n- Finally, add 58 to 224: 224 + 58 = 282, which is too much.\n\nLet's try using multiplication:\n\n- 91 * 2 = 182, which is less than 238.\n- 81 * 2 = 162, which is less than 238.\n- 22 * 2 = 44, which is less than 238.\n- 58 * 2 = 116, which is less than 238.\n- 30 * 2 = 60, which is less than 238.\n\nLet's try a combination of multiplication and addition:\n\n- 91 + 81 = 172.\n- 172 + 58 = 230.\n- 230 + 22 = 252, which is too much.\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n\n- 91 + 81 = 172.\n- 172 + 30 = 202.\n- 202 + 22 = 224.\n- 224 + 58 = 282, which is too much.\n\nLet's try using subtraction:\n\n- 91 + 81 = 172.\n- 172 + 58 = 230.\n- 230 + 30 = 260.\n- 260 - 22 = 238.\n\nThis combination works. Let's verify it with a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Verify the arithmetic expression\nresult = 91 + 81 + 58 + 30 - 22\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The arithmetic expression that results in 238 using the numbers 91, 81, 22, 58, and 30 is:\n\n<<<91 + 81 + 58 + 30 - 22>>>"
