    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 84, 10, 52, and 65 to create an arithmetic expression that equals 672. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the target number, 672. We can factor 672 to see if any of the given numbers can be used as factors:\n\n672 = 2^5 * 3 * 7\n\nNow, let's try to find a combination of the given numbers that can be used to reach 672. We can start by considering multiplication, as it is likely to get us closer to the target number quickly.\n\n1. Check if any two numbers multiply to a factor of 672.\n2. Consider using division to adjust the result if necessary.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n- 84 * 10 = 840 (too high)\n- 84 * 52 = 4368 (too high)\n- 84 * 65 = 5460 (too high)\n- 10 * 52 = 520 (too low)\n- 10 * 65 = 650 (close)\n- 52 * 65 = 3380 (too high)\n\nThe combination 10 * 65 = 650 is close to 672. We can try to adjust this by adding or multiplying with the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try:\n\n- 650 + 84 = 734 (too high)\n- 650 + 52 = 702 (too high)\n- 650 - 84 = 566 (too low)\n- 650 - 52 = 598 (too low)\n\nSince addition and subtraction are not working, let's try using division:\n\n- 650 / 10 = 65 (not useful)\n- 650 / 52 = 12.5 (not useful)\n- 650 / 84 = 7.738 (not useful)\n- 650 / 65 = 10 (not useful)\n\nLet's try another approach by using multiplication and division in a different order:\n\n- 84 * 10 = 840\n- 840 / 65 = 12.923 (not useful)\n- 840 / 52 = 16.153 (not useful)\n\nLet's try using division first:\n\n- 84 / 10 = 8.4 (not useful)\n- 84 / 52 = 1.615 (not useful)\n- 84 / 65 = 1.292 (not useful)\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n- 52 * 10 = 520\n- 520 + 84 = 604 (too low)\n- 520 + 65 = 585 (too low)\n\nLet's try using division with 52:\n\n- 52 / 10 = 5.2 (not useful)\n- 52 / 65 = 0.8 (not useful)\n\nLet's try using division with 65:\n\n- 65 / 10 = 6.5 (not useful)\n- 65 / 52 = 1.25 (not useful)\n\nLet's try using multiplication with 84 and 52:\n\n- 84 * 52 = 4368 (too high)\n\nLet's try using division with 84 and 52:\n\n- 84 / 52 = 1.615 (not useful)\n\nLet's try using multiplication with 84 and 65:\n\n- 84 * 65 = 5460 (too high)\n\nLet's try using division with 84 and 65:\n\n- 84 / 65 = 1.292 (not useful)\n\nLet's try using multiplication with 10 and 65:\n\n- 10 * 65 = 650\n\nNow, let's try to adjust 650 to reach 672:\n\n- 650 + 22 = 672\n\nWe can achieve this by using the remaining numbers:\n\n- 84 -
