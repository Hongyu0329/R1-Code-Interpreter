    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 6, 86, 83, and 23 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 561. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the numbers:\n\n- 561 is a relatively large number, so multiplication might be necessary.\n- The numbers 86 and 83 are close to each other and relatively large, which might be useful for multiplication.\n- The number 6 is small, which might be useful for addition or multiplication.\n- The number 23 is moderate and could be used in various ways.\n\nA potential approach is to try multiplying two of the larger numbers and then adjust the result using the smaller numbers. Let's explore this by calculating some products and see if we can reach 561.\n\nFirst, let's try multiplying 86 and 6, as they are the largest and smallest numbers:\n\n\\[ 86 \\times 6 = 516 \\]\n\nThis is close to 561, but not quite there. We need to add 45 to reach 561. Let's see if we can use the remaining numbers to achieve this.\n\nNow, let's try multiplying 83 and 6:\n\n\\[ 83 \\times 6 = 498 \\]\n\nThis is also close, but we need to add 63 to reach 561. Let's see if we can use the remaining numbers to achieve this.\n\nFinally, let's try multiplying 83 and 23:\n\n\\[ 83 \\times 23 = 1909 \\]\n\nThis is too large, so let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's try multiplying 86 and 23:\n\n\\[ 86 \\times 23 = 1978 \\]\n\nThis is also too large. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's try multiplying 83 and 6, and then add 23:\n\n\\[ 83 \\times 6 + 23 = 498 + 23 = 521 \\]\n\nThis is still not 561. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's try multiplying 86 and 6, and then add 23:\n\n\\[ 86 \\times 6 + 23 = 516 + 23 = 539 \\]\n\nThis is still not 561. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's try multiplying 86 and 6, and then add 83:\n\n\\[ 86 \\times 6 + 83 = 516 + 83 = 599 \\]\n\nThis is still not 561. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's try multiplying 83 and 6, and then add 86:\n\n\\[ 83 \\times 6 + 86 = 498 + 86 = 584 \\]\n\nThis is still not 561. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's try multiplying 86 and 6, and then subtract 23:\n\n\\[ 86 \\times 6 - 23 = 516 - 23 = 493 \\]\n\nThis is still not 561. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's try multiplying 83 and 6, and then subtract 23:\n\n\\[ 83 \\times 6 - 23 = 498 - 23 = 475 \\]\n\nThis is still not 561. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's try multiplying 86 and 6, and then subtract 83:\n\n\\[ 86 \\times 6 - 83 = 516 - 83 = 433 \\]\n\nThis is still not 561.

Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's try multiplying 83 and 23, and then subtract 86:\n\n\\[ 83 \\times 23 - 86 = 1909 - 86 = 1823 \\]\n\nThis is still not 561.
