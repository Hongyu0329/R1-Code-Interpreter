    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 69, 48, 24, 34, 69, and 21 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that results in the number 127. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different combinations and operations to see if we can reach the target number.\n\n1. We have two 69s, which might be useful since they are the largest numbers.\n2. We can try adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing these numbers in various ways.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations and see if we can find a valid expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [69, 48, 24, 34, 69, 21]\ntarget = 127\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(len(ops)):\n        expression += f\" {ops[i]} {nums[i+1]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=5):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]}\"\n            for i in range(len(ops)):\n                expression += f\" {ops[i]} {num_perm[i+1]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that equals 127. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides multiple expressions that evaluate to 127 using the given numbers. We need to select one of these expressions and format it according to the instructions.\n\nLet's choose the first valid expression from the output:\n\n- 69 + 48 + 24 + 34 - 69 + 21\n\nNow, let's format it as required:\n\n<<<69 + 48 + 24 + 34 - 69 + 21>>>"
