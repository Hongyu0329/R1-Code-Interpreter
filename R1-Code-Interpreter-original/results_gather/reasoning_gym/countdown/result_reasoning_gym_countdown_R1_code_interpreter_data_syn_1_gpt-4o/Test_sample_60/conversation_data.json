    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the given numbers (74, 44, 81, 86, 8) using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to reach the target number 189. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try adding and subtracting the numbers to see if we can reach 189.\n2. We can also consider multiplication and division, but since 189 is not a very large number, addition and subtraction might be more straightforward.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations and operations:\n\n- Start by considering the largest number, 86, and see if we can build up to 189.\n- We can try adding 81 to 86, which gives us 167. Then, we can add 44 to 167, which exceeds 189, so this path doesn't work.\n- Let's try another approach: subtract 44 from 86, which gives us 42. Then, add 81 to 42, which gives us 123. Adding 74 to 123 gives us 197, which is too high.\n- Let's try using multiplication or division to adjust the numbers.\n\nTo efficiently explore these combinations, let's write a Python script to test different arithmetic expressions using the given numbers.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [74, 44, 81, 86, 8]\ntarget = 189\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {nums[i]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]}\"\n            for i in range(1, len(num_perm)):\n                expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {num_perm[i]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 189. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides multiple arithmetic expressions that evaluate to 189 using the numbers 74, 44, 81, 86, and 8. Each expression uses each number exactly once. Let's choose one of these expressions to provide as the final answer.\n\nOne of the valid expressions is:\n\n74 + 81 + 86 - 44 - 8\n\nThis expression uses all the numbers exactly once and evaluates to 189.\n\n<<<74 + 81 + 86 - 44 - 8>>>"
