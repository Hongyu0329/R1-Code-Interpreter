    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 100, 35, 1, 98, 1, and 1 that results in 163. Each number can only be used once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the largest numbers and see if we can combine them to get close to 163. The largest numbers are 100 and 98. Adding them gives us 198, which is too large. Subtracting 98 from 100 gives us 2, which is too small. \n\nNext, let's try using 35. Adding 35 to 100 gives us 135, which is still less than 163. Adding 98 to 35 gives us 133, which is also less than 163. \n\nLet's try using multiplication. Multiplying 35 by 1 gives us 35, which doesn't help. Multiplying 98 by 1 gives us 98, which also doesn't help. \n\nLet's try using division. Dividing 100 by 1 gives us 100, which doesn't help. Dividing 98 by 1 gives us 98, which also doesn't help. \n\nLet's try using subtraction. Subtracting 35 from 100 gives us 65, which is still less than 163. Subtracting 98 from 100 gives us 2, which is too small. \n\nLet's try using addition again. Adding 100, 35, and 1 gives us 136, which is still less than 163. Adding 98, 35, and 1 gives us 134, which is also less than 163. \n\nLet's try using multiplication again. Multiplying 35 by 1 gives us 35, which doesn't help. Multiplying 98 by 1 gives us 98, which also doesn't help. \n\nLet's try using division again. Dividing 100 by 1 gives us 100, which doesn't help.
