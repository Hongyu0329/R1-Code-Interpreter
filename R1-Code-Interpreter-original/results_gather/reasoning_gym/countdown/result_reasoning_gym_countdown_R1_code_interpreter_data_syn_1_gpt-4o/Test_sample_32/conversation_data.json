    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 52, 79, 69, 16, and 81 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that results in the number 867. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different permutations and combinations of these numbers with the operations to see if we can reach the target number.\n\nTo efficiently explore the possibilities, we can write a Python script that tries different combinations and checks if any of them equal 867.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [52, 79, 69, 16, 81]\ntarget = 867\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(len(ops)):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and combinations of operations\nfor num_perm in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=4):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]} {ops[3]} {num_perm[4]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of the operations to find an expression that equals 867. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output indicates that there are multiple expressions that evaluate to 867 using the given numbers. However, the expressions provided in the output are not formatted correctly according to the final answer format instructions. We need to ensure that the expression is a single arithmetic expression without any '=' sign and using the correct operators.\n\nLet's analyze the output and select the correct expression that matches the target value of 867. We will choose one of the expressions and format it correctly.\n\nThe expression `81 - 79 + 16 * 52 - 69` evaluates to 867. Let's format it according to the instructions:\n\n<<<81 - 79 + 16 * 52 - 69>>>"
