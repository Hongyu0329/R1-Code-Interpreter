    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 51, 46, 36, 38, and 21 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 537. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible combinations and operations that could lead us to the target number 537. We can try different combinations and see if they can be combined to reach the target.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility of using multiplication to get close to 537, as it is a relatively large number. We can then adjust the result using addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try to find a combination of numbers that, when multiplied, gets us close to 537. We can then use the remaining numbers to adjust the result.\n\n```python\n# Let's try different combinations of numbers and operations to reach 537\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [51, 46, 36, 38, 21]\ntarget = 537\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    result = nums[0]\n    for i in range(len(ops)):\n        if ops[i] == '+':\n            result += nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '/':\n            result /= nums[i + 1]\n    return result\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product('+-*/', repeat=4):\n        try:\n            if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n                expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]} {ops[3]} {num_perm[4]}\"\n                print(expression)\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\n            continue\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid expression.",
    "Based on the code output, we have found several arithmetic expressions that evaluate to 537 using the numbers 51, 46, 36, 38, and 21. Each number is used at most once, and the operations include addition, subtraction, and multiplication.\n\nThe valid expressions are:\n\n1. \\(36 - 46 + 38 \\times 21 - 51\\)\n2. \\(36 + 38 - 46 \\times 21 - 51\\)\n3. \\(38 - 46 + 36 \\times 21 - 51\\)\n4. \\(38 + 36 - 46 \\times 21 - 51\\)\n\nThese expressions are equivalent in terms of the operations and numbers used, and they all evaluate to 537.\n\nLet's choose one of these expressions as the final answer.\n\n<<<36 - 46 + 38 * 21 - 51>>>"
