    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 75, 83, 8, and 26 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 563. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try to combine the numbers using addition and subtraction to get close to 563.\n2. We can also consider multiplication and division to adjust the values.\n\nLet's explore these possibilities using a systematic approach. We can write a Python script to try different combinations and see if we can reach the target number.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [75, 83, 8, 26]\ntarget = 563\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    result = nums[0]\n    for i in range(len(ops)):\n        if ops[i] == '+':\n            result += nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '/':\n            if nums[i + 1] == 0:\n                return None\n            result /= nums[i + 1]\n    return result\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 563. Let's execute the code to see if we can find a solution.",
    "The code has successfully found expressions that evaluate to 563 using the numbers 75, 83, 8, and 26. The expressions are:\n\n1. 83 * 8 - 75 - 26\n2. 83 * 8 - 26 - 75\n3. 8 * 83 - 75 - 26\n4. 8 * 83 - 26 - 75\n\nAll these expressions are valid and use each number exactly once. Let's choose one of these expressions as the final answer.\n\n<<<8 * 83 - 75 - 26>>>"
