    "To solve this problem, we need to find a way to combine the numbers 16, 2, 2, and 91 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 364. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the operations that can be performed with these numbers. Since 364 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be a key operation to reach it. We can try different combinations of multiplication and division to see if we can reach 364.\n\nFirst, let's consider the largest number, 91, and see if multiplying it by any combination of the other numbers can get us close to 364.\n\n1. Try multiplying 91 by 4 (since 2 * 2 = 4):\n   - 91 * 4 = 364\n\nThis combination works perfectly, as it uses all the numbers exactly once and reaches the target number 364.\n\nNow, let's express this solution as an arithmetic expression using the given numbers.\n\nThe expression is:\n- 91 * (2 * 2)\n\nThis uses all the numbers exactly once and reaches the target number 364.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<91 * 2 * 2>>>"
