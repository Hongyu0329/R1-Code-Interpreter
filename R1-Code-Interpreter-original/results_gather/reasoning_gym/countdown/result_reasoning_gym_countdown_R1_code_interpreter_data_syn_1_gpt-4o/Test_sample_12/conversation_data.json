    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 5, 41, 38, 81, and 14 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that results in the number 450. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the target number 450. We can break it down into its factors to see if any combination of the given numbers can be used to reach it. The factors of 450 include 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 15, 18, 25, 30, 45, 50, 75, 90, 150, 225, and 450.\n\nGiven the numbers, we can try to form 450 by considering multiplication and addition first, as they are more likely to reach a larger number like 450.\n\nLet's try to find a combination using multiplication and addition:\n\n1. Check if any two numbers can be multiplied to get close to 450.\n2. Use the remaining numbers to adjust the result to exactly 450.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations of these numbers with multiplication and addition to see if we can reach 450.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnumbers = [5, 41, 38, 81, 14]\n\n# Try all permutations of the numbers\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    # Try different combinations of operations\n    # (a * b) + (c * d) + e\n    if perm[0] * perm[1] + perm[2] * perm[3] + perm[4] == 450:\n        print(f\"{perm[0]} * {perm[1]} + {perm[2]} * {perm[3]} + {perm[4]}\")\n    # (a * b) + (c * d) - e\n    if perm[0] * perm[1] + perm[2] * perm[3] - perm[4] == 450:\n        print(f\"{perm[0]} * {perm[1]} + {perm[2]} * {perm[3]} - {perm[4]}\")\n    # (a * b) - (c * d) + e\n    if perm[0] * perm[1] - perm[2] * perm[3] + perm[4] == 450:\n        print(f\"{perm[0]} * {perm[1]} - {perm[2]} * {perm[3]} + {perm[4]}\")\n    # (a * b) - (c * d) - e\n    if perm[0] * perm[1] - perm[2] * perm[3] - perm[4] == 450:\n        print(f\"{perm[0]} * {perm[1]} - {perm[2]} * {perm[3]} - {perm[4]}\")\n    # (a + b) * (c + d) + e\n    if (perm[0] + perm[1]) * (perm[2] + perm[3]) + perm[4] == 450:\n        print(f\"({perm[0]} + {perm[1]}) * ({perm[2]} + {perm[3]}) + {perm[4]}\")\n    # (a + b) * (c + d) - e\n    if (perm[0] + perm[1]) * (perm[2] + perm[3]) - perm[4] == 450:\n        print(f\"({perm[0]} + {perm[1]}) * ({perm[2]} + {perm[3]}) - {perm[4]}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct expression."
