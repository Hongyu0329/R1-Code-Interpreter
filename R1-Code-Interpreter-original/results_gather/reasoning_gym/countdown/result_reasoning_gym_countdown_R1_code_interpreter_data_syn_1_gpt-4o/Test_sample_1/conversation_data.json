    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations using the numbers 16, 36, 41, 8, 53, and 1 that results in the value 558. Each number can only be used once, and we can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the operations and how they might combine to reach 558. We can try different combinations and check if they result in the target number.\n\nOne approach is to consider multiplication first, as it can quickly increase the value. We can then adjust with addition or subtraction. Let's try to find a combination that works.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [16, 36, 41, 8, 53, 1]\ntarget = 558\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {nums[i]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]}\"\n            for i in range(1, len(num_perm)):\n                expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {num_perm[i]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 558. Let's execute it to see if we can find a solution.",
    "The code output shows multiple expressions that evaluate to 558. Let's choose one of these expressions to provide as the final answer. \n\nThe expression `16 * 41 - 36 - 8 - 53 - 1` is a valid solution. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<16 * 41 - 36 - 8 - 53 - 1>>>"
