    "To solve this problem, we need to find a way to combine the numbers 3, 3, 61, 36, and 75 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 654. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the operations and combinations that might help us reach 654. We can try different combinations and operations to see if we can reach the target.\n\n1. We can try multiplying some of the numbers together to see if we can get close to 654.\n2. We can also try adding or subtracting numbers after multiplication to adjust the total.\n3. Division might be useful if we overshoot the target and need to reduce the total.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n- Multiplying the largest numbers first might be a good strategy.\n- We can try multiplying 75 by 3, and then see if we can adjust the result with the other numbers.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n```python\n# Trying different combinations to reach 654\ndef find_combination():\n    numbers = [3, 3, 61, 36, 75]\n    \n    # Try multiplying 75 by 3\n    result1 = 75 * 3\n    \n    # Check if we can reach 654 by adding or subtracting the other numbers\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num != 75 and num != 3:\n            result2 = result1 * num\n            if result2 == 654:\n                return f\"75 * 3 * {num}\"\n    \n    # Try other combinations\n    result3 = 75 * 36\n    if result3 == 654:\n        return \"75 * 36\"\n    \n    result4 = 75 * 3 * 3\n    if result4 == 654:\n        return \"75 * 3 * 3\"\n    \n    # Try adding or subtracting\n    result5 = 75 * 3 + 36\n    if result5 == 654:\n        return \"75 * 3 + 36\"\n    \n    result6 = 75 * 3 + 61\n    if result6 == 654:\n        return \"75 * 3 + 61\"\n    \n    return \"No combination found\"\n\nprint(find_combination())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see if we can find a valid combination.",
    "The initial approach did not yield a solution, so let's try a different strategy. We need to explore more combinations and operations to find a way to reach 654 using the numbers 3, 3, 61, 36, and 75.\n\nLet's consider the following:\n\n1. We can try multiplying different pairs of numbers and then adding or subtracting the remaining numbers.\n2. We can also try using division if it helps to adjust the total.\n\nLet's try a more systematic approach by iterating through possible combinations:\n\n```python\n# Trying different combinations to reach 654\ndef find_combination():\n    numbers = [3, 3, 61, 36, 75]\n    \n    # Try multiplying different pairs and adding/subtracting the rest\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        for j in range(len(numbers)):\n            if i != j:\n                # Multiply two numbers\n                product = numbers[i] * numbers[j]\n                \n                # Try adding the remaining numbers\n                remaining = [numbers[k] for k in range(len(numbers)) if k != i and k != j]\n                \n                # Check all combinations of adding/subtracting remaining numbers\n                for a in remaining:\n                    for b in remaining:\n                        if a != b:\n                            if product + a + b == 654:\n                                return f\"{numbers[i]} * {numbers[j]} + {a} + {b}\"\n                            if product + a - b == 654:\n                                return f\"{numbers[i]} * {numbers[j]} + {a} - {b}\"\n                            if product - a + b == 654:\n                                return f\"{numbers[i]} * {numbers[j]} - {a} + {b}\"\n                            if product - a - b == 654:\n                                return f\"{numbers[i]} * {numbers[j]} - {a} - {b}\"\n    \n    return \"No combination found\"\n\nprint(find_combination())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see if we can find a valid combination.",
    "It seems that the previous attempts did not yield a solution. Let's try a more exhaustive approach by considering all possible combinations of operations and numbers. We will use a brute-force method to try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to see if we can reach the target number 654.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\ndef find_combination():\n    numbers = [3, 3, 61, 36, 75]\n    target = 654\n    operations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    \n    # Try all permutations of numbers\n    for num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n        # Try all combinations of operations\n        for ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n            # Construct the expression\n            expr = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]} {ops[3]} {num_perm[4]}\"\n            try:\n                # Evaluate the expression\n                if eval(expr) == target:\n                    return expr\n            except ZeroDivisionError:\n                continue\n    \n    return \"No combination found\"\n\nprint(find_combination())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see if we can find a valid combination.",
    "The code has successfully found a combination of numbers and operations that result in the target number 654. The expression is:\n\n<<<61 / 3 * 36 - 3 - 75>>>"
