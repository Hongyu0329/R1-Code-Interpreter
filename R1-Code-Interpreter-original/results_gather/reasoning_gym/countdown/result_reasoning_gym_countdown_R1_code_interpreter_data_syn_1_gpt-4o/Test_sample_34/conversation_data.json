    "To solve this problem, we need to find a way to combine the numbers 40, 61, 37, and 2 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 104. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering different combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try adding two numbers and then see if the remaining numbers can be used to reach 104.\n2. We can try multiplying two numbers and then see if the remaining numbers can be used to reach 104.\n3. We can try using subtraction and division as well.\n\nLet's explore these possibilities:\n\n- If we add 40 and 61, we get 101. We need 3 more to reach 104, but we have 37 and 2 left, which cannot be combined to make 3.\n- If we add 40 and 37, we get 77. We need 27 more to reach 104, but 61 and 2 cannot be combined to make 27.\n- If we add 61 and 37, we get 98. We need 6 more to reach 104, but 40 and 2 cannot be combined to make 6.\n- If we multiply 2 and 37, we get 74. We need 30 more to reach 104, but 40 and 61 cannot be combined to make 30.\n\nLet's try a different approach by using multiplication and addition:\n\n- If we multiply 2 and 40, we get 80. We need 24 more to reach 104. We can add 61 and 37 to get 98, which is not useful.\n\nLet's try using division:\n\n- If we divide 40 by 2, we get 20. We need 84 more to reach 104. We can add 61 and 37 to get 98, which is not useful.\n\nLet's try another approach by using subtraction:\n\n- If we subtract 37 from 61, we get 24. We need 80 more to reach 104. We can multiply 40 and 2 to get 80, which works.\n\nThis approach seems promising. Let's verify it with a code script to ensure correctness.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [40, 61, 37, 2]\n\n# Check the combination\nresult = (61 - 37) + (40 * 2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the arithmetic expression correctly evaluates to 104. Therefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n<<<(61 - 37) + (40 * 2)>>>"
