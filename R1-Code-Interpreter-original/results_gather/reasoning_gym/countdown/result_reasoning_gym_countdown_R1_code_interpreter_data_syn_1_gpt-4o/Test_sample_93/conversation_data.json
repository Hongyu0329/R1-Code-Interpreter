    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 78, 40, 79, and 81 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 116. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try to add or subtract numbers to get close to 116.\n2. We can also consider multiplication and division to adjust the values.\n\nLet's explore some combinations:\n\n- Start with the largest number, 81, and see if we can add or subtract the others to reach 116.\n- Try using 78 and 40, as their sum is 118, which is close to 116.\n- Consider using division to adjust the values.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations and see if we can find a valid expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [78, 40, 79, 81]\ntarget = 116\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    result = nums[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        if ops[i-1] == '+':\n            result += nums[i]\n        elif ops[i-1] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i]\n        elif ops[i-1] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i]\n        elif ops[i-1] == '/':\n            if nums[i] == 0:\n                return None\n            result /= nums[i]\n    return result\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid expression.",
    "The code output provides several arithmetic expressions that evaluate to 116 using the numbers 78, 40, 79, and 81. However, the last expression, \"81 - 79 * 78 - 40,\" is incorrect because it does not evaluate to 116. Let's focus on the correct expressions.\n\nFrom the output, we can see that there are multiple valid expressions. Let's choose one of them to provide as the final answer.\n\nThe expression \"78 + 40 - 81 + 79\" is a valid solution.\n\n<<<78 + 40 - 81 + 79>>>"
