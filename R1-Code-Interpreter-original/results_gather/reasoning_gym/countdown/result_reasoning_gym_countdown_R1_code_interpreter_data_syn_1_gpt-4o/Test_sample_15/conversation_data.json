    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 17, 43, 31, 5, and 94 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 651. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the target number 651 and how it might be formed using these numbers. One approach is to consider multiplication first, as it can quickly increase the value of the expression. \n\nWe can try different combinations of multiplication and addition/subtraction to see if we can reach 651. Let's explore this by writing a Python script to test various combinations.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnumbers = [17, 43, 31, 5, 94]\ntarget = 651\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    result = nums[0]\n    for i in range(len(ops)):\n        if ops[i] == '+':\n            result += nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '/':\n            if nums[i + 1] == 0:\n                return None\n            result /= nums[i + 1]\n    return result\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in permutations(['+', '-', '*', '/'], 4):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]}\"\n            for i in range(4):\n                expression += f\" {ops[i]} {num_perm[i + 1]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and operations to find an expression that evaluates to 651. Let's execute the code to see if it finds a solution."
