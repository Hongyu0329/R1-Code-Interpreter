    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 70, 74, 67, 86, 80, and 19 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 358. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the numbers and the target:\n\n- The target number is 358.\n- The numbers available are 70, 74, 67, 86, 80, and 19.\n\nWe need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that will result in 358. A good approach is to try different combinations and see if they can be adjusted to reach the target.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations and operations:\n\n1. Start with a large number and see if we can add or subtract to reach the target.\n2. Consider multiplication and division to adjust the scale of the numbers.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually and see if we can find a solution:\n\n- 70 + 74 + 67 + 86 + 80 + 19 = 396 (too high)\n- 70 + 74 + 67 + 86 = 297 (close, but not quite)\n- 80 + 86 + 74 + 19 = 259 (still not there)\n\nNow, let's try using multiplication and division to adjust the numbers:\n\n- 70 * 5 = 350 (close, but we need 358)\n- 86 * 4 = 344 (not quite)\n\nLet's try a combination of operations:\n\n- 70 + 86 + 80 + 67 + 19 = 322 (still not there)\n\nLet's try using multiplication and addition:\n\n- 70 * 5 + 19 = 350 + 19 = 369 (too high)\n\nLet's try a different approach using code to systematically test combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [70, 74, 67, 86, 80, 19]\ntarget = 358\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = str(nums[0])\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        expression += ops[i-1] + str(nums[i])\n    try:\n        if eval(expression) == target:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if result:\n            print(result)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid expression.",
    "The code output shows multiple arithmetic expressions that evaluate to 358 using the numbers 70, 74, 67, 86, 80, and 19. Each expression uses each number at most once and involves only addition and subtraction.\n\nLet's select one of these valid expressions to provide as the final answer.\n\nOne of the valid expressions is:\n\n70 + 74 + 67 + 86 + 80 - 19\n\nThis expression uses all the numbers and evaluates to 358.\n\n<<<70 + 74 + 67 + 86 + 80 - 19>>>"
