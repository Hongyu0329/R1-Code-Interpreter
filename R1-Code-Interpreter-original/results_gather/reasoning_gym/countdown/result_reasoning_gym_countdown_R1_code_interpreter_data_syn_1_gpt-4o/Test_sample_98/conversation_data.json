    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 50, 60, 99, 12, 87, and 96 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that results in the number 112. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different operations and see if we can reach the target number 112.\n\n1. We can try to add or subtract numbers to get closer to 112.\n2. We can use multiplication or division to adjust the values.\n\nLet's try to find a combination using a systematic approach. We can use Python to help us explore different combinations and operations.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [50, 60, 99, 12, 87, 96]\ntarget = 112\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {nums[i]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]}\"\n            for i in range(1, len(num_perm)):\n                expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {num_perm[i]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 112. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 112 using the numbers 50, 60, 99, 12, 87, and 96. Each expression uses each number exactly once and applies basic arithmetic operations.\n\nFrom the output, we can select one of the valid expressions. Let's choose the first one for simplicity:\n\n60 - 50 + 99 + 12 + 87 - 96\n\nThis expression uses all the numbers exactly once and evaluates to 112.\n\n<<<60 - 50 + 99 + 12 + 87 - 96>>>"
