    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 65, 95, 66, 55, 27, and 15 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that results in the number 137. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different combinations and operations to see if we can reach the target number.\n\nOne approach is to try combinations of addition and subtraction first, as they are straightforward. If that doesn't work, we can introduce multiplication and division to see if they help achieve the target.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate the search for a valid expression.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnumbers = [65, 95, 66, 55, 27, 15]\ntarget = 137\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {nums[i]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\ndef find_expression(numbers, target):\n    for nums in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n            if evaluate_expression(nums, ops) == target:\n                return f\"{nums[0]} {ops[0]} {nums[1]} {ops[1]} {nums[2]} {ops[2]} {nums[3]} {ops[3]} {nums[4]} {ops[4]} {nums[5]}\"\n    return None\n\nexpression = find_expression(numbers, target)\nprint(expression)\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 137. Let's execute the code to see if it finds a solution.",
    "The code has successfully found an expression that evaluates to 137 using the given numbers. The expression is:\n\n<<<65 + 95 - 66 + 55 - 27 + 15>>>"
