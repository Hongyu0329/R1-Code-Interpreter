    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the given numbers (86, 40, 60, 23, 9, 31) using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to reach the target number 162. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different combinations and operations to see if we can reach the target number.\n\nFirst, let's try some combinations manually:\n\n1. Check if any two numbers can be added to get close to 162.\n2. Check if any two numbers can be multiplied to get close to 162.\n3. Consider combinations of three numbers with different operations.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and find a valid expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [86, 40, 60, 23, 9, 31]\ntarget = 162\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(len(ops)):\n        expression += f\" {ops[i]} {nums[i+1]}\"\n    try:\n        if eval(expression) == target:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\nfor nums in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n        result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n        if result:\n            print(result)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 162. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 162 using the given numbers. Let's select one of these valid expressions to present as the final answer.\n\nOne of the expressions is:\n\n86 - 40 - 60 + 23 * 9 - 31\n\nThis expression uses all the numbers exactly once and evaluates to 162.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<86 - 40 - 60 + 23 * 9 - 31>>>"
