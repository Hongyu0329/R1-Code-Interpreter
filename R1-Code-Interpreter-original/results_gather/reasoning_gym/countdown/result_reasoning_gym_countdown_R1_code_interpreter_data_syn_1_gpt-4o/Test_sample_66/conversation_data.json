    "To solve this problem, we need to find a way to combine the numbers 54, 46, 6, 8, and 74 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 608. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the operations that could potentially lead to 608. Since 608 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be a key operation. We can try different combinations of multiplication and addition to see if we can reach 608.\n\nFirst, let's consider the largest number, 74, and see if multiplying it by another number gets us close to 608. We can then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n1. Multiply 74 by 8:\n   - 74 * 8 = 592\n   - 608 - 592 = 16\n\n2. We need to make 16 using the remaining numbers: 54, 46, and 6.\n\nLet's try to find a combination of these numbers that results in 16.\n\n```python\n# Let's try different combinations to make 16 using 54, 46, and 6\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnumbers = [54, 46, 6]\ntarget = 16\n\n# Try all permutations of the numbers with different operations\ndef evaluate_expression(a, b, c):\n    # Try different operations to see if we can reach the target\n    if a + b - c == target:\n        return f\"{a} + {b} - {c}\"\n    if a - b + c == target:\n        return f\"{a} - {b} + {c}\"\n    if a * b - c == target:\n        return f\"{a} * {b} - {c}\"\n    if a - b * c == target:\n        return f\"{a} - {b} * {c}\"\n    if a + b + c == target:\n        return f\"{a} + {b} + {c}\"\n    if a * b + c == target:\n        return f\"{a} * {b} + {c}\"\n    if a + b * c == target:\n        return f\"{a} + {b} * {c}\"\n    if a * b * c == target:\n        return f\"{a} * {b} * {c}\"\n    return None\n\n# Check all permutations\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    result = evaluate_expression(*perm)\n    if result:\n        print(result)\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a combination that results in 16."
