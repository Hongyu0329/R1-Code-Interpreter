    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 22, 43, 52, 9, and 60 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that results in the number 549. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the target number 549 and the numbers we have. We can try different combinations and operations to see if we can reach the target.\n\nOne approach is to consider multiplication first, as it can quickly increase the value. We can then adjust with addition or subtraction. Let's try to find a combination that works.\n\nWe will use Python to try different combinations and see if we can find a valid expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [22, 43, 52, 9, 60]\ntarget = 549\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(4):\n        expression += f\" {ops[i]} {nums[i+1]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]}\"\n            for i in range(4):\n                expression += f\" {ops[i]} {num_perm[i+1]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that equals 549. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides multiple valid expressions that equal 549 using the numbers 22, 43, 52, 9, and 60. Each expression uses each number exactly once and applies basic arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's choose one of these expressions to provide as the final answer. Here is one of the valid expressions:\n\n<<<60 + 52 * 9 + 43 - 22>>>"
