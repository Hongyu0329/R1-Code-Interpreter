    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 23, 58, 5, and 5 exactly once to create an arithmetic expression that equals 262. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the target number 262 and how we might reach it using the given numbers. One approach is to consider multiplication and addition, as these operations can quickly increase the value of an expression.\n\n1. We have two 5s, which can be used in multiplication to create a larger number.\n2. The number 58 is relatively large, so it might be useful in multiplication or addition.\n3. The number 23 is also significant and can be used in combination with other numbers.\n\nLet's try to form an expression by considering these points:\n\n- We can multiply 58 by 5 to get a large number: \\(58 \\times 5 = 290\\).\n- We can then subtract 23 from 290 to see if it gets us closer to 262: \\(290 - 23 = 267\\).\n- We are left with another 5, which we can subtract from 267 to reach 262: \\(267 - 5 = 262\\).\n\nThis approach seems promising. Let's verify this with a Python script to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [23, 58, 5, 5]\n\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (58 * 5) - 23 - 5\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the expression correctly evaluates to 262. Therefore, the arithmetic expression using the numbers 23, 58, 5, and 5 is:\n\n<<<58 * 5 - 23 - 5>>>"
