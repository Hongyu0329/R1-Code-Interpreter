    "To solve this problem, we need to find a way to combine the numbers 59, 74, 35, and 58 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 583. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try adding the numbers in different combinations.\n2. We can try subtracting one number from another.\n3. We can try multiplying two numbers.\n4. We can try dividing one number by another, but this is less likely to be useful given the numbers we have.\n\nGiven the target number 583, it seems likely that multiplication might be involved, as the numbers are relatively small compared to 583. Let's explore possible combinations using multiplication and addition/subtraction.\n\nFirst, let's try to find a combination that might work by using a systematic approach. We can write a Python script to try different combinations and see if any of them result in 583.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [59, 74, 35, 58]\ntarget = 583\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        # Construct the expression\n        expr1 = f\"({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]}) {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n        expr2 = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} ({num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]}) {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n        expr3 = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} ({num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]})\"\n        expr4 = f\"({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]}) {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n        expr5 = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} ({num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]})\"\n        \n        for expr in [expr1, expr2, expr3, expr4, expr5]:\n            try:\n                if eval(expr) == target:\n                    print(expr)\n            except ZeroDivisionError:\n                continue\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations, evaluating each expression to see if it equals 583. If it finds a valid expression, it will print it. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several valid arithmetic expressions that result in the target number 583. Each expression uses all the numbers 59, 74, 35, and 58 exactly once, and they all evaluate to 583.\n\nHere is one of the valid expressions:\n\n<<<58 + 35 * (74 - 59)>>>"
