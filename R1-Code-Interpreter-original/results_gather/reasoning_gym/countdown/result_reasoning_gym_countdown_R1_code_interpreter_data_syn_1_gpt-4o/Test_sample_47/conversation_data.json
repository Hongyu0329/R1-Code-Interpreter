    "To solve this problem, we need to find a way to combine the numbers 5, 23, 35, and 9 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 809. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try multiplying some of the numbers together to get close to 809, then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n2. We can also consider division if it helps to reach the target.\n\nLet's explore these possibilities with a Python script to automate the search for a valid expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [5, 23, 35, 9]\ntarget = 809\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(len(ops)):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 809. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several valid arithmetic expressions that evaluate to 809 using the numbers 5, 23, 35, and 9. Each expression uses each number exactly once and combines them with basic arithmetic operations.\n\nThe expressions found are:\n1. \\(23 \\times 35 - 5 + 9\\)\n2. \\(23 \\times 35 + 9 - 5\\)\n3. \\(35 \\times 23 - 5 + 9\\)\n4. \\(35 \\times 23 + 9 - 5\\)\n\nAll these expressions are valid solutions to the problem. Let's choose one of these expressions as the final answer.\n\n<<<35 * 23 + 9 - 5>>>"
