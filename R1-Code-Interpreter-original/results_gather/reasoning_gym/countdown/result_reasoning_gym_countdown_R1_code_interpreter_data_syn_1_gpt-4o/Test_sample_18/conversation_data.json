    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 57, 90, 14, 56, and 26 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 391. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different combinations and operations to see if we can reach the target number.\n\nFirst, let's try some initial calculations manually:\n\n1. Check if any combination of addition or subtraction can directly give us 391.\n2. Consider multiplication and division to see if they can help us reach the target.\n\nIf manual calculations don't yield a result, we can write a Python script to try different combinations and operations systematically.\n\nLet's proceed with a Python script to explore possible combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [57, 90, 14, 56, 26]\ntarget = 391\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {nums[i]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]}\"\n            for i in range(1, len(num_perm)):\n                expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {num_perm[i]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 391. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several arithmetic expressions that evaluate to 391 using the numbers 57, 90, 14, 56, and 26. Each expression uses each number exactly once and applies basic arithmetic operations.\n\nFrom the output, we can select one of the valid expressions. Let's choose the first one for simplicity:\n\n<<<57 + 90 / 14 * 56 - 26>>>"
