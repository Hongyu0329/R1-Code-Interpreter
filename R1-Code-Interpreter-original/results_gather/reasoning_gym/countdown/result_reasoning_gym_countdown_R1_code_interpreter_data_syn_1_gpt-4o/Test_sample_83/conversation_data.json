    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that will use each of the numbers 78, 54, 85, 11, and 8 exactly once to reach the target number 667.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different permutations and operations to see if we can reach the target number. Since this is a complex problem with many possibilities, it might be efficient to use a programmatic approach to explore the combinations.\n\nWe'll write a Python script to try different combinations of these numbers with the four basic arithmetic operations to see if we can reach the target number 667.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [78, 54, 85, 11, 8]\ntarget = 667\n\n# Define the operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(4):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=4):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]} {ops[3]} {num_perm[4]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 667. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides multiple expressions that evaluate to the target number 667. Each expression uses all the given numbers exactly once. Here is one of the valid expressions:\n\n<<<85 * 8 + 54 + 11 - 78>>>"
