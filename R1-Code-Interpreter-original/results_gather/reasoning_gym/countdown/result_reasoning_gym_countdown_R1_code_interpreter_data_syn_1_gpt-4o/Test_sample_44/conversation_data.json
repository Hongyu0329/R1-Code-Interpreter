    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 7, 60, 39, 50, and 26 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that results in the number 161. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different permutations and combinations of these numbers to see if we can reach the target number.\n\nOne approach is to try to combine the numbers in pairs or groups and see if we can reach the target by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing them. We can also consider the order of operations (parentheses) to change the precedence of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a solution using a systematic approach:\n\n1. Start with the largest number and see if we can reach the target by adding or subtracting the other numbers.\n2. Consider multiplication and division to see if they can help reach the target.\n3. Use parentheses to change the order of operations if necessary.\n\nLet's try to find a solution using Python to automate the search for a valid expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [7, 60, 39, 50, 26]\ntarget = 161\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"({nums[0]} {ops[0]} {nums[1]}) {ops[1]} ({nums[2]} {ops[2]} ({nums[3]} {ops[3]} {nums[4]}))\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]}) {ops[1]} ({num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} ({num_perm[3]} {ops[3]} {num_perm[4]}))\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of the operations to find an expression that evaluates to 161. Let's see if it finds a solution."
