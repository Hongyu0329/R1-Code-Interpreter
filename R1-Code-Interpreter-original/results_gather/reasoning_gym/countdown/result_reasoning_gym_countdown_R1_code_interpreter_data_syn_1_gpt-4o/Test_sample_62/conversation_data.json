    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 39, 3, 56, 24, 3, and 36 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 277. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering possible combinations and operations that could lead to the target number 277. We can try different operations and see if we can reach the target.\n\n1. We can start by considering multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n2. We can also consider division to reduce the value if needed.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can try multiplying some numbers to get close to 277 and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n- We can also try adding or subtracting numbers to see if we can reach 277.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations and see if we can find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [39, 3, 56, 24, 3, 36]\ntarget = 277\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = str(nums[0])\n    for i in range(len(ops)):\n        expression += ops[i] + str(nums[i+1])\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = str(num_perm[0])\n            for i in range(len(ops)):\n                expression += ops[i] + str(num_perm[i+1])\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 277. Let's execute the code to find the solution."
