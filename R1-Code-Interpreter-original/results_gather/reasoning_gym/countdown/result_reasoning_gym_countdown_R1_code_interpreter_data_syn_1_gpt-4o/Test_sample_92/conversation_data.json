    "To solve this problem, we need to find a way to combine the numbers 95, 82, 82, 82, and 46 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 132. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different combinations of these numbers and operations to see if we can reach 132.\n\n1. We can try adding and subtracting the numbers in different orders.\n2. We can also try multiplying and dividing the numbers to see if we can reach the target.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate the process of checking different combinations and operations to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [95, 82, 82, 82, 46]\ntarget = 132\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = str(nums[0])\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        expression += ops[i-1] + str(nums[i])\n    try:\n        if eval(expression) == target:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if result:\n            print(result)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 132. Let's execute the code to see if it finds a solution.",
    "The code output shows multiple expressions that evaluate to 132, but it seems there are repetitions and some errors in the output. Let's analyze the results to find a valid expression that uses each number exactly once and evaluates to 132.\n\nFrom the output, one of the valid expressions that evaluates to 132 is:\n\n- `95 + 82 - 46 + 82 / 82`\n\nThis expression uses all the numbers exactly once and evaluates to 132.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<95 + 82 - 46 + 82 / 82>>>"
