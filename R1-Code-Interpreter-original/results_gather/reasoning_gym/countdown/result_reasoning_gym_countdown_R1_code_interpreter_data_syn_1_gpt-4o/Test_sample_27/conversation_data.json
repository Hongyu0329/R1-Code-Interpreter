    "To solve this problem, we need to find a way to combine the numbers 39, 12, 33, and 86 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 778. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n2. We can also try dividing one number by another and then using the result in further operations.\n3. We need to ensure that the operations result in an integer at each step since we are dealing with whole numbers.\n\nLet's explore these possibilities using a systematic approach. We will use Python to help us find a valid combination.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [39, 12, 33, 86]\ntarget = 778\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef apply_operation(a, b, op):\n    if op == '+':\n        return a + b\n    elif op == '-':\n        return a - b\n    elif op == '*':\n        return a * b\n    elif op == '/':\n        if b != 0 and a % b == 0:  # Ensure division results in an integer\n            return a // b\n    return None\n\ndef find_expression():\n    for num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n            # Try different parenthesizations\n            # (a op1 b) op2 (c op3 d)\n            result1 = apply_operation(num_perm[0], num_perm[1], ops[0])\n            if result1 is not None:\n                result2 = apply_operation(num_perm[2], num_perm[3], ops[2])\n                if result2 is not None:\n                    final_result = apply_operation(result1, result2, ops[1])\n                    if final_result == target:\n                        return f\"({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]}) {ops[1]} ({num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]})\"\n            \n            # ((a op1 b) op2 c) op3 d\n            result1 = apply_operation(num_perm[0], num_perm[1], ops[0])\n            if result1 is not None:\n                result2 = apply_operation(result1, num_perm[2], ops[1])\n                if result2 is not None:\n                    final_result = apply_operation(result2, num_perm[3], ops[2])\n                    if final_result == target:\n                        return f\"(({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]}) {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]}) {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            \n            # (a op1 (b op2 c)) op3 d\n            result1 = apply_operation(num_perm[1], num_perm[2], ops[1])\n            if result1 is not None:\n                result2 = apply_operation(num_perm[0], result1, ops[0])\n                if result2 is not None:\n                    final_result = apply_operation(result2, num_perm[3], ops[2])\n                    if final_result == target:\n                        return f\"({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} ({num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]})) {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            \n            # a op1 ((b op2 c) op3 d)\n            result1 = apply_operation(num_perm[1], num_perm[2], ops[1])\n            if result1 is not None:\n                result2 = apply_operation(result1, num_perm[3], ops[2])\n                if result2 is not None:\n                    final_result = apply_operation(num_perm[0], result2, ops[0])\n                    if final_result == target:\n                        return f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} (({num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]}) {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]})\"\n            \n            # a op1 (b op2 (c op3 d))\n            result1 = apply_operation(num_perm[2], num_perm[3], ops[2])\n            if result1 is not None:\n                result2 = apply_operation(num_perm[1], result1, ops[1])\n                if result2 is not None:\n                    final_result = apply_operation(num_perm[0], result2, ops[0])\n                    if final_result == target:\n                        return f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} ({num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} ({num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}))\"\n    return \"No solution found\"\n\nprint(find_expression())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution.",
