    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 89, 94, 31, and 90 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 116. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations of these numbers. We need to find a way to combine them to reach the target number, 116.\n\n1. We can try simple addition and subtraction combinations first.\n2. If that doesn't work, we can consider multiplication and division.\n3. We need to ensure that the operations are valid and result in an integer.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- Start by checking if any two numbers can be added or subtracted to get close to 116.\n- Then, see if the remaining numbers can adjust the result to exactly 116.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations and see if we can find a valid expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [89, 94, 31, 90]\ntarget = 116\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    result = nums[0]\n    for i in range(3):\n        if ops[i] == '+':\n            result += nums[i+1]\n        elif ops[i] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i+1]\n        elif ops[i] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i+1]\n        elif ops[i] == '/':\n            if nums[i+1] == 0 or result % nums[i+1] != 0:\n                return None\n            result //= nums[i+1]\n    return result\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct arithmetic expression.",
    "The code output provides several arithmetic expressions that evaluate to 116 using the numbers 89, 94, 31, and 90. Each expression uses each number at most once and involves basic arithmetic operations.\n\nFrom the output, we can select any of the valid expressions. Here is one of them:\n\n<<<89 + 31 + 90 - 94>>>"
