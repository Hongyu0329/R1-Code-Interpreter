    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that will use each of the numbers 74, 48, 56, and 66 exactly once to result in the number 132.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different operations and see if they yield the desired result. Since this can be complex to do manually, we can use a brute-force approach with Python to test all possible combinations and operations.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Generate all permutations of the numbers.\n2. For each permutation, try all possible combinations of operations.\n3. Check if any combination results in 132.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [74, 48, 56, 66]\ntarget = 132\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will output the first valid expression it finds that equals 132 using the given numbers and operations. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides multiple valid expressions that equal 132 using the numbers 74, 48, 56, and 66. Let's choose one of these expressions to provide as the final answer.\n\nOne of the valid expressions is:\n\n74 + 48 + 66 - 56\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and results in 132.\n\n<<<74 + 48 + 66 - 56>>>"
