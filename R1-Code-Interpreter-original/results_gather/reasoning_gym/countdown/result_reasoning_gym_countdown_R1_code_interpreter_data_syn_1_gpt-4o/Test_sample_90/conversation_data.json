    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 10, 43, 99, 100, 36, and 10 exactly once to create an arithmetic expression that equals 190. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the target number, 190, and how we might reach it using these numbers. We can try different combinations and operations to see if we can achieve the target.\n\nOne approach is to consider the largest number, 100, and see if we can build around it. We can try to add or subtract the other numbers to reach 190.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n1. Start with 100 and add 99, which gives us 199. We can then subtract 9 to reach 190. We have two 10s, so we can use one of them to subtract 10 and then add 1 from the remaining numbers.\n\n2. Alternatively, we can try using multiplication or division to adjust the numbers. For example, we can multiply or divide some numbers to get closer to 190.\n\nLet's try to find a combination using code to automate the process:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [10, 43, 99, 100, 36, 10]\ntarget = 190\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {nums[i]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=5):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]}\"\n            for i in range(1, len(num_perm)):\n                expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {num_perm[i]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that equals 190. Let's execute it to find the solution."
