    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 64, 77, 19, 39, and 26 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that results in the number 109. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different combinations and see if they result in 109. \n\nOne approach is to try to combine the numbers in pairs or groups and see if we can reach the target number. We can also consider the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to ensure the correct calculation.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n1. Start with the largest number, 77, and see if we can add or subtract the others to reach 109.\n2. Consider using multiplication or division to adjust the values.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- 77 + 39 = 116, which is too high.\n- 77 + 26 = 103, which is close.\n- 77 + 26 + 6 = 109, but we don't have 6.\n- 64 + 39 = 103, which is close.\n- 64 + 39 + 6 = 109, but we don't have 6.\n\nLet's try using multiplication or division:\n\n- 64 + 39 + 26 = 129, which is too high.\n- 64 + 39 - 19 = 84, which is too low.\n- 64 + 26 = 90, and 90 + 19 = 109, which is a potential solution.\n\nLet's verify this solution using code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Verify the solution\nnumbers = [64, 77, 19, 39, 26]\n\n# Check if 64 + 26 + 19 equals 109\nresult = 64 + 26 + 19\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the expression is correct. Therefore, the arithmetic expression that uses each number once and equals 109 is:\n\n<<<64 + 26 + 19>>>"
