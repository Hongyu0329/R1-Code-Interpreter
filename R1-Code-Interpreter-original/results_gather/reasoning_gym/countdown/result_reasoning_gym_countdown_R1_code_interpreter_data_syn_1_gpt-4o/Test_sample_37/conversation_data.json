    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 22, 78, 13, 45, 5, and 9 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that results in the number 264. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the operations and how they might combine to reach 264. We can try different combinations and operations to see if we can reach the target number.\n\nOne approach is to consider multiplication first, as it can quickly increase the value of the expression. We can then adjust with addition or subtraction. Let's try to find a combination that works.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [22, 78, 13, 45, 5, 9]\ntarget = 264\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(len(ops)):\n        expression += f\" {ops[i]} {nums[i+1]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=5):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]}\"\n            for i in range(len(ops)):\n                expression += f\" {ops[i]} {num_perm[i+1]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid expression."
