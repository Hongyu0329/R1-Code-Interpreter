    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 83, 12, 68, 49, and 47 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 259. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible combinations and operations that could lead to the target number 259. We can try different arithmetic operations and see if we can reach the target.\n\nFirst, let's try to find a combination of numbers that, when added or subtracted, gets us close to 259. Then, we can adjust using multiplication or division if necessary.\n\n1. Start with the largest number, 83, and see how we can build up to 259.\n2. Consider combinations of addition and subtraction with the other numbers.\n3. If addition and subtraction don't work, consider multiplication or division.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n- 83 + 68 = 151\n- 83 + 68 + 49 = 200\n- 83 + 68 + 49 + 47 = 247\n- 83 + 68 + 49 + 47 + 12 = 259\n\nIt seems like adding all the numbers together gives us the target number 259. Let's verify this with a simple calculation.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sum of all numbers\nnumbers = [83, 12, 68, 49, 47]\nresult = sum(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code output confirms that the sum of all the numbers 83, 12, 68, 49, and 47 equals 259. Therefore, the arithmetic expression that uses each number at most once and results in 259 is:\n\n<<<83 + 12 + 68 + 49 + 47>>>"
