    "To solve this problem, we need to find a way to combine the numbers 7, 83, 85, and 2 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 498. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the operations and combinations that might get us close to 498. We can try different combinations and operations to see if we can reach the target.\n\n1. We can try multiplying the numbers together to see if we can get close to 498.\n2. We can also try adding or subtracting numbers after multiplication to adjust the total.\n\nLet's explore these possibilities using a systematic approach with Python code to check different combinations and operations.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [7, 83, 85, 2]\ntarget = 498\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    result = nums[0]\n    for i in range(3):\n        if ops[i] == '+':\n            result += nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '/':\n            if nums[i + 1] == 0:\n                return None\n            result /= nums[i + 1]\n    return result\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 498. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 498 using the numbers 7, 83, 85, and 2. Each expression uses each number exactly once and applies basic arithmetic operations.\n\nFrom the output, we can choose any of the valid expressions. Let's select the first one for simplicity.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n7 * 83 - 85 + 2\n\nThis expression uses all the numbers exactly once and evaluates to 498.\n\n<<<7 * 83 - 85 + 2>>>"
