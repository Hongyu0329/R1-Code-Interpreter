    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 11, 26, 43, and 58 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 138. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try adding the numbers together in different combinations.\n2. We can try multiplying some numbers and then adding or subtracting others.\n3. We can try using division if it seems like it might help reach the target.\n\nLet's explore these possibilities with a systematic approach using Python to check different combinations and operations.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [11, 26, 43, 58]\ntarget = 138\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    result = nums[0]\n    for i in range(3):\n        if ops[i] == '+':\n            result += nums[i+1]\n        elif ops[i] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i+1]\n        elif ops[i] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i+1]\n        elif ops[i] == '/':\n            if nums[i+1] == 0:\n                return None\n            result /= nums[i+1]\n    return result\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 138. Let's execute it to see if we can find a solution.",
    "The code output shows that the sum of all the numbers 11, 26, 43, and 58 equals 138. Therefore, the arithmetic expression that makes 138 using all the given numbers is:\n\n<<<11 + 26 + 43 + 58>>>"
