    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 19, 19, 57, 7, 12, and 95 exactly once to form an arithmetic expression that equals 285. We can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the target number 285 and how it can be formed using these numbers. We can try different combinations and operations to see if we can reach the target.\n\nOne approach is to consider the largest number, 95, and see if it can be used effectively in multiplication or addition to reach closer to 285. We can also consider using multiplication to reach a number close to 285 and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's try to find a combination using Python code to automate the search for a valid expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [19, 19, 57, 7, 12, 95]\ntarget = 285\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {nums[i]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]}\"\n            for i in range(1, len(num_perm)):\n                expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {num_perm[i]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 285. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 285 using the numbers 19, 19, 57, 7, 12, and 95. We need to select one of these expressions to present as the final answer.\n\nLet's choose one of the expressions that correctly uses each number exactly once and evaluates to 285:\n\n19 + 57 * 7 + 95 - 12 * 19\n\nThis expression uses all the numbers exactly once and evaluates to 285.\n\n<<<19 + 57 * 7 + 95 - 12 * 19>>>"
