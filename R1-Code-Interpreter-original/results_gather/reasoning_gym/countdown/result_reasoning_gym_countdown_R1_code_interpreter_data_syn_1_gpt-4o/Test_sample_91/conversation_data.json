    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using the numbers 35, 12, 99, and 53 to reach the target number 572. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try multiplying some of the numbers to get close to 572, then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n2. We can also try dividing some numbers if multiplication results in a number too large.\n\nLet's explore these possibilities with a Python script to automate the search for a valid expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [35, 12, 99, 53]\ntarget = 572\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    result = nums[0]\n    for i in range(3):\n        if ops[i] == '+':\n            result += nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '/':\n            if nums[i + 1] == 0 or result % nums[i + 1] != 0:\n                return None\n            result //= nums[i + 1]\n    return result\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 572. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several valid arithmetic expressions that evaluate to 572 using the numbers 35, 12, 99, and 53, each used exactly once. Here is one of the valid expressions:\n\n<<<53 * 12 + 35 - 99>>>"
