    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 95, 59, 47, and 48 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 153. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations of these numbers. We need to find a way to combine these numbers to reach the target of 153.\n\n1. We can try different combinations of addition and subtraction first, as they are the simplest operations.\n2. If addition and subtraction alone do not work, we can try incorporating multiplication and division.\n3. We need to ensure that the operations are valid and result in an integer value.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works by testing different arithmetic expressions.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [95, 59, 47, 48]\ntarget = 153\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]} {ops[0]} {nums[1]} {ops[1]} {nums[2]} {ops[2]} {nums[3]}\"\n    try:\n        if eval(expression) == target:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if result:\n            print(result)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid arithmetic expression.",
    "The code output provides several valid arithmetic expressions that result in the target number 153 using the numbers 95, 59, 47, and 48. Each expression uses each number at most once and combines them using addition and subtraction.\n\nOne of the valid expressions is:\n\n<<<95 + 59 + 47 - 48>>>"
