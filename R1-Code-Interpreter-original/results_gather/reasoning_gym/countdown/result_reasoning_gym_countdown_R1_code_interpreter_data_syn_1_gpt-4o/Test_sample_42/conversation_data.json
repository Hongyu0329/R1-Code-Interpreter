    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 94, 90, 80, 81, 81, and 72 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 147. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering combinations of these numbers and operations to reach the target number 147. We can try different approaches, such as:\n\n1. Adding two numbers and then adjusting with others.\n2. Multiplying two numbers and then adjusting with others.\n3. Using division to reduce larger numbers.\n\nWe will try to find a combination that works. Let's start by checking if any two numbers can be added or subtracted to get close to 147, and then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\nFirst, let's try some combinations manually:\n\n- 94 + 81 = 175 (too high)\n- 90 + 81 = 171 (too high)\n- 80 + 81 = 161 (too high)\n- 94 + 72 = 166 (too high)\n- 90 + 72 = 162 (too high)\n- 80 + 72 = 152 (close, but still high)\n\nNow, let's try using multiplication and division:\n\n- 94 - 81 = 13\n- 90 - 81 = 9\n- 80 - 72 = 8\n\nWe can try to use these results to form 147. Let's try a combination of operations:\n\n```python\n# Let's try to find a combination of operations to reach 147\nnumbers = [94, 90, 80, 81, 81, 72]\n\n# Try different combinations\nfor a in numbers:\n    for b in numbers:\n        if a != b:\n            for c in numbers:\n                if c != a and c != b:\n                    for d in numbers:\n                        if d != a and d != b and d != c:\n                            for e in numbers:\n                                if e != a and e != b and e != c and e != d:\n                                    for f in numbers:\n                                        if f != a and f != b and f != c and f != d and f != e:\n                                            # Check if any combination of operations results in 147\n                                            if a + b - c + d - e + f == 147:\n                                                print(f\"{a} + {b} - {c} + {d} - {e} + {f}\")\n                                            elif a * b - c + d - e + f == 147:\n                                                print(f\"{a} * {b} - {c} + {d} - {e} + {f}\")\n                                            elif a + b * c - d + e - f == 147:\n                                                print(f\"{a} + {b} * {c} - {d} + {e} - {f}\")\n                                            elif a + b - c * d + e - f == 147:\n                                                print(f\"{a} + {b} - {c} * {d} + {e} - {f}\")\n                                            elif a + b - c + d * e - f == 147:\n                                                print(f\"{a} + {b} - {c} + {d} * {e} - {f}\")\n                                            elif a + b - c + d - e * f == 147:\n                                                print(f\"{a} + {b} - {c} + {d} - {e} * {f}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid expression."
