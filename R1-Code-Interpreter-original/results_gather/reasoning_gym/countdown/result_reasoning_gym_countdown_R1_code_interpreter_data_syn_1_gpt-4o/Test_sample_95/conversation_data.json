    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 23, 94, 61, and 3 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 254. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing these numbers in different orders.\n2. We need to ensure that the operations result in the target number 254.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations and operations:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n- Check if any combination of multiplication and addition can reach 254.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and find a valid expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [23, 94, 61, 3]\ntarget = 254\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(3):\n        expression += f\" {ops[i]} {nums[i+1]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 254. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several valid arithmetic expressions that evaluate to 254 using the numbers 23, 94, 61, and 3. Each expression uses each number exactly once and applies basic arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's choose one of these expressions as the final answer. \n\nThe first expression in the output is:\n\n94 - 23 + 61 * 3\n\nThis expression evaluates to 254, and it uses each number exactly once.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<94 - 23 + 61 * 3>>>"
