    "To solve this problem, we need to find an arithmetic expression using the numbers 42, 41, 65, and 36 that equals 869. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the operations that can be performed with these numbers. Since 869 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be a key operation to reach it. We can try different combinations of multiplication and addition/subtraction to see if we can reach the target.\n\nFirst, let's try multiplying two numbers and then see if we can add or subtract the others to reach 869.\n\n1. Try multiplying the largest numbers: 65 * 36 = 2340. This is too large, so let's try a different combination.\n2. Try 42 * 36 = 1512. This is also too large.\n3. Try 41 * 36 = 1476. Still too large.\n4. Try 65 * 41 = 2665. This is much larger than 869.\n\nSince direct multiplication of two numbers results in a number larger than 869, let's try a combination of multiplication and addition/subtraction.\n\nLet's try a different approach by using multiplication and then adjusting with addition or subtraction:\n\n- We can try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations of these numbers with multiplication and addition/subtraction to see if we can reach 869.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnumbers = [42, 41, 65, 36]\ntarget = 869\n\n# Try all permutations of the numbers\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    a, b, c, d = perm\n    # Check different combinations of operations\n    if a * b + c + d == target:\n        print(f\"{a} * {b} + {c} + {d}\")\n    elif a * b + c - d == target:\n        print(f\"{a} * {b} + {c} - {d}\")\n    elif a * b - c + d == target:\n        print(f\"{a} * {b} - {c} + {d}\")\n    elif a * b - c - d == target:\n        print(f\"{a} * {b} - {c} - {d}\")\n    elif a * b * c + d == target:\n        print(f\"{a} * {b} * {c} + {d}\")\n    elif a * b * c - d == target:\n        print(f\"{a} * {b} * {c} - {d}\")\n    elif a * b + c * d == target:\n        print(f\"{a} * {b} + {c} * {d}\")\n    elif a * b - c * d == target:\n        print(f\"{a} * {b} - {c} * {d}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct expression."
