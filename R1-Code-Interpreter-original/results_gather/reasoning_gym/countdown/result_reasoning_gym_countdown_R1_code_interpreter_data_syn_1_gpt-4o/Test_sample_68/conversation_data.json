    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 52, 98, 8, and 13 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 624. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the target number 624 and see if we can break it down using the given numbers. \n\n1. **Multiplication Approach**: Since 624 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be a good starting point. We can try to find two numbers whose product is close to 624.\n\n2. **Division Approach**: We can also consider dividing 624 by one of the numbers to see if it results in a number that can be formed using the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try to find a combination using these approaches:\n\n- If we consider multiplication, we can try to find two numbers whose product is close to 624. \n- If we consider division, we can divide 624 by one of the numbers and see if the result can be formed using the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try some calculations:\n\n- 624 divided by 8 is 78. \n- 78 can be formed by multiplying 13 and 6, but 6 is not one of our numbers.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 624 divided by 13 is 48.\n- 48 can be formed by multiplying 8 and 6, but again, 6 is not one of our numbers.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 624 divided by 52 is 12.\n- 12 can be formed by multiplying 8 and 1.5, but 1.5 is not one of our numbers.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 624 divided by 98 is approximately 6.367, which is not useful.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 52 * 13 = 676, which is too large.\n- 52 * 8 = 416, which is too small.\n- 98 * 8 = 784, which is too large.\n- 98 * 13 = 1274, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 52 + 98 = 150\n- 150 * 8 = 1200, which is too large.\n- 150 / 13 = approximately 11.54, which is not useful.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 98 + 52 = 150\n- 150 * 8 = 1200, which is too large.\n- 150 / 13 = approximately 11.54, which is not useful.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 98 - 52 = 46\n- 46 * 13 = 598, which is too small.\n- 46 * 8 = 368, which is too small.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 98 + 8 = 106\n- 106 * 13 = 1378, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 98 - 8 = 90\n- 90 * 13 = 1170, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 98 + 13 = 111\n- 111 * 8 = 888, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 98 - 13 = 85\n- 85 * 8 = 680, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 52 + 13 = 65\n- 65 * 8 = 520, which is too small.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 52 - 13 = 39\n- 39 * 8 = 312, which is too small.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 52 + 8 = 60\n- 60 * 13 = 780, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 52 - 8 = 44\n- 44 * 13 = 572, which is too small.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 13 + 8 = 21\n- 21 * 52 = 1092, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 13 - 8 = 5\n- 5 * 52 = 260, which is too small.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 8 + 13 = 21\n- 21 * 52 = 1092, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 8 - 13 = -5\n- -5 * 52 = -260, which is not useful.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 98 + 52 = 150\n- 150 - 13 = 137\n- 137 * 8 = 1096, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 98 + 52 = 150\n- 150 - 8 = 142\n- 142 * 13 = 1846, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 98 + 52 = 150\n- 150 -
