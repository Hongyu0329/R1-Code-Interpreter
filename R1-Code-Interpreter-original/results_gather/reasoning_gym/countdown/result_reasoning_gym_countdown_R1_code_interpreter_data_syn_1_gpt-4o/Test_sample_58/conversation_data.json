    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 24, 99, 68, and 70 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that results in the number 261. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different operations and see if they lead to the desired result. \n\nOne approach is to try to form a large number close to 261 using multiplication or addition, and then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n1. We can start by multiplying two numbers to get a large base number.\n2. Then, we can add or subtract the remaining numbers to reach 261.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n- 24 * 70 = 1680, which is too large.\n- 99 * 68 = 6732, which is too large.\n- 70 * 68 = 4760, which is too large.\n- 24 * 99 = 2376, which is too large.\n\nSince multiplication results in numbers that are too large, let's try using addition and subtraction:\n\n- 99 + 70 = 169\n- 169 + 68 = 237\n- 237 + 24 = 261\n\nThis combination seems to work. Let's verify it with a simple calculation:\n\n```python\n# Verify the calculation\nresult = 99 + 70 + 68 + 24\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The calculation is correct, and the expression that equals 261 using the numbers 24, 99, 68, and 70 is:\n\n<<<99 + 70 + 68 + 24>>>"
