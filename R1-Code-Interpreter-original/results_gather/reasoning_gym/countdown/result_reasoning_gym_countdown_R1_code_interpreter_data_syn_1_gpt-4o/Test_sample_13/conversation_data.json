    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 95, 98, 92, 28, and 20 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 237. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible combinations and operations that could lead to the target number 237. We can try different combinations and see if they can be combined to reach the target.\n\nFirst, let's consider the largest numbers and see if they can be combined to get close to 237. We can then adjust with the smaller numbers.\n\n1. Start with the largest numbers: 98 and 95. Their sum is 193, which is less than 237.\n2. Add the next largest number, 92, to 193. This gives us 285, which is more than 237.\n3. Try subtracting 28 from 285. This gives us 257, which is still more than 237.\n4. Try subtracting 20 from 257. This gives us 237, which is exactly the target number.\n\nThus, the expression that equals 237 using the given numbers is:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = 98 + 95 + 92 - 28 - 20\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the arithmetic expression correctly evaluates to 237. Therefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n<<<98 + 95 + 92 - 28 - 20>>>"
