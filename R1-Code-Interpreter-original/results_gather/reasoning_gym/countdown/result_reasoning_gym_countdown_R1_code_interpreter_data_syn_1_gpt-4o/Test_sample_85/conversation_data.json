    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 30, 44, 15, and 23 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that results in 112. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering different combinations and operations:\n\n1. We can try addition and subtraction first, as they are straightforward.\n2. If addition and subtraction don't work, we can try multiplication and division.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once.\n\nLet's explore some possibilities:\n\n- Adding all numbers: 30 + 44 + 15 + 23 = 112 (This is a potential solution)\n\nLet's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [30, 44, 15, 23]\n\n# Calculate the sum\nresult = sum(numbers)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we can confirm if this combination gives us the desired result of 112.",
    "The code output confirms that the sum of the numbers 30, 44, 15, and 23 is indeed 112. Therefore, the arithmetic expression that uses all the numbers exactly once to make 112 is:\n\n<<<30 + 44 + 15 + 23>>>"
