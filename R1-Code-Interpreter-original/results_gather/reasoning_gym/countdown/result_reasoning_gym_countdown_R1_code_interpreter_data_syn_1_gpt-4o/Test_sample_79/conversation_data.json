    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 28, 59, 44, and 13 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 541. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations of these numbers. We need to find a way to combine these numbers to reach exactly 541.\n\n1. We can try different combinations of addition and multiplication, as these are the most straightforward operations to reach a larger number like 541.\n2. We can also consider using subtraction and division if needed to adjust the total.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- Start by considering the largest number, 59, and see if we can multiply it with another number to get close to 541.\n- We can also try adding or subtracting the other numbers to adjust the total.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations and see if we can find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [28, 59, 44, 13]\ntarget = 541\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    result = nums[0]\n    for i in range(3):\n        if ops[i] == '+':\n            result += nums[i+1]\n        elif ops[i] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i+1]\n        elif ops[i] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i+1]\n        elif ops[i] == '/':\n            if nums[i+1] == 0:\n                return None\n            result /= nums[i+1]\n    return result\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of the operations to find an expression that evaluates to 541. Let's see if it finds a solution.",
    "The code has successfully found multiple expressions that evaluate to 541 using the numbers 28, 59, 44, and 13. Each expression uses each number at most once and combines them with arithmetic operations.\n\nThe expressions found are:\n1. \\( 44 \\times 13 + 28 - 59 \\)\n2. \\( 44 \\times 13 - 59 + 28 \\)\n3. \\( 13 \\times 44 + 28 - 59 \\)\n4. \\( 13 \\times 44 - 59 + 28 \\)\n\nAll these expressions are valid and evaluate to 541. Let's choose one of these expressions as the final answer.\n\n<<<44 * 13 + 28 - 59>>>"
