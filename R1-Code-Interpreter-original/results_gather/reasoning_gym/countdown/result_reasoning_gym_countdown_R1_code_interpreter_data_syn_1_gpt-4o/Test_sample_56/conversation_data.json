    "To solve this problem, we need to find a way to combine the numbers 2, 2, 24, 43, and 25 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 814. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the operations and combinations that could potentially lead to 814. We can try different combinations and see if they yield the desired result.\n\n1. We can try multiplying some of the larger numbers together to see if we can get close to 814.\n2. We can then use addition or subtraction to adjust the result to exactly 814.\n3. We can also consider using division if it helps in reaching the target.\n\nLet's try a few combinations and see if we can find a solution.\n\nFirst, let's try multiplying the largest numbers:\n\n- 43 * 25 = 1075\n\n1075 is greater than 814, so we need to reduce it. Let's try subtracting or dividing by one of the smaller numbers:\n\n- 1075 - 24 = 1051\n- 1075 - 2 = 1073\n- 1075 / 2 = 537.5\n\nNone of these results in 814. Let's try a different approach.\n\nWe can try using multiplication and addition in a different order:\n\n- 43 * 24 = 1032\n\n1032 is greater than 814, so we need to reduce it:\n\n- 1032 - 25 = 1007\n- 1032 - 2 = 1030\n- 1032 / 2 = 516\n\nAgain, none of these results in 814. Let's try another combination.\n\nLet's try using multiplication and addition in a different order:\n\n- 24 * 25 = 600\n\n600 is less than 814, so we need to increase it:\n\n- 600 + 43 = 643\n- 600 + 2 = 602\n\nStill not reaching 814. Let's try another combination.\n\nLet's try using multiplication and addition in a different order:\n\n- 43 * 2 = 86\n\n86 is less than 814, so we need to increase it:\n\n- 86 * 2 = 172\n- 172 + 24 = 196\n- 196 + 25 = 221\n\nStill not reaching 814. Let's try another combination.\n\nLet's try using multiplication and addition in a different order:\n\n- 25 * 2 = 50\n\n50 is less than 814, so we need to increase it:\n\n- 50 * 24 = 1200\n\n1200 is greater than 814, so we need to reduce it:\n\n- 1200 - 43 = 1157\n- 1157 - 2 = 1155\n\nStill not reaching 814. Let's try another combination.\n\nLet's try using multiplication and addition in a different order:\n\n- 24 * 2 = 48\n\n48 is less than 814, so we need to increase it:\n\n- 48 * 25 = 1200\n\n1200 is greater than 814, so we need to reduce it:\n\n- 1200 - 43 = 1157\n- 1157 - 2 = 1155\n\nStill not reaching 814.
