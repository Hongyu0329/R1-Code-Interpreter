    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 89, 32, 15, and 39 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 642. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations of these numbers. We need to find a way to combine these numbers to reach exactly 642.\n\n1. We can try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n2. We can also try dividing one number by another and then using the result in further operations.\n\nLet's explore these possibilities with a Python script to find a valid expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [89, 32, 15, 39]\ntarget = 642\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    result = nums[0]\n    for i in range(3):\n        if ops[i] == '+':\n            result += nums[i+1]\n        elif ops[i] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i+1]\n        elif ops[i] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i+1]\n        elif ops[i] == '/':\n            if nums[i+1] == 0 or result % nums[i+1] != 0:\n                return None\n            result //= nums[i+1]\n    return result\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct arithmetic expression.",
    "The code output provides several valid arithmetic expressions that evaluate to 642 using the numbers 89, 32, 15, and 39. Each expression uses each number at most once and correctly applies the arithmetic operations.\n\nThe expressions found are:\n1. \\(15 \\times 39 + 89 - 32\\)\n2. \\(15 \\times 39 - 32 + 89\\)\n3. \\(39 \\times 15 + 89 - 32\\)\n4. \\(39 \\times 15 - 32 + 89\\)\n\nAll these expressions are equivalent due to the commutative property of addition.\n\nLet's choose one of these expressions as the final answer.\n\n<<<15 * 39 + 89 - 32>>>"
