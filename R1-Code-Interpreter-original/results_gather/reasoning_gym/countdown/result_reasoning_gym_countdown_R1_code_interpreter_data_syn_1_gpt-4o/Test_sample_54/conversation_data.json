    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 13, 23, 2, and 95 to create an arithmetic expression that equals 129. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering different combinations of these numbers and operations to reach the target number 129.\n\n1. We can try adding and subtracting combinations of these numbers.\n2. We can also consider multiplication and division to see if they can help us reach the target.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n- If we try adding all the numbers: 13 + 23 + 2 + 95 = 133, which is too high.\n- If we try subtracting the smallest number from the sum of the others: 13 + 23 + 95 - 2 = 129, which matches our target.\n\nThis combination seems to work. Let's verify this with a simple calculation:\n\n```python\n# Verify the expression\nresult = 13 + 23 + 95 - 2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we can confirm if this expression equals 129.",
    "The expression 13 + 23 + 95 - 2 equals 129, which matches the target number.\n\nTherefore, the arithmetic expression that uses each number once and equals 129 is:\n\n<<<13 + 23 + 95 - 2>>>"
