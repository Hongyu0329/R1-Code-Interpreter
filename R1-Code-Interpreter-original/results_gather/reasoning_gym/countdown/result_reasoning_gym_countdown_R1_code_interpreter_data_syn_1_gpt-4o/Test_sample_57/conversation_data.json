    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 18, 39, 75, and 40 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 684. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the target number 684 and the numbers we have. We can try to form 684 by considering possible combinations of these numbers with the four basic arithmetic operations.\n\nFirst, let's consider multiplication, as it can quickly increase the value of the numbers:\n\n1. Check if any two numbers multiply to a value close to 684.\n2. If not, consider combinations of three numbers with multiplication and addition/subtraction.\n\nLet's try to find a combination using multiplication and addition/subtraction:\n\n- 18 * 39 = 702, which is close to 684.\n- 75 * 9 = 675, which is also close to 684.\n\nNow, let's try to adjust these products to reach exactly 684:\n\n- 702 - 18 = 684\n- 675 + 9 = 684\n\nWe can see that 702 - 18 = 684 is a valid expression using the numbers 18, 39, and 40. However, we need to use all four numbers.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 18 * 39 = 702\n- 75 - 40 = 35\n\nNow, let's see if we can use these results to form 684:\n\n- 702 - 18 = 684\n\nThis approach doesn't use all four numbers. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 18 * 39 = 702\n- 75 - 40 = 35\n\nNow, let's see if we can use these results to form 684:\n\n- 702 - 18 = 684\n\nThis approach doesn't use all four numbers. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 18 * 39 = 702\n- 75 - 40 = 35\n\nNow, let's see if we can use these results to form 684:\n\n- 702 - 18 = 684\n\nThis approach doesn't use all four numbers.
