    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the given numbers (72, 18, 28, 30, 43, 23) using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to reach the target number 185. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different combinations and operations to see if we can reach the target number.\n\n1. Start by considering addition and subtraction, as they are the most straightforward operations.\n2. If addition and subtraction alone do not work, consider using multiplication and division to adjust the values.\n3. Check if any combination of these operations can yield the target number.\n\nLet's try to find a solution using a systematic approach, possibly involving some code to automate the search for a valid expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [72, 18, 28, 30, 43, 23]\ntarget = 185\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = str(nums[0])\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        expression += ops[i-1] + str(nums[i])\n    try:\n        if eval(expression) == target:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if result:\n            print(result)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 185. Let's execute it to see if we can find a solution."

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find a way to make 185 using all of these numbers: 72, 18, 28, 30, 43, 23.\nEach number can only be used once.\n\nFinal answer format instructions:\n1.
