    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using the numbers 16, 5, 75, 80, and 21 to reach the target number 635. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the operations and how they might combine to reach 635. We can try different combinations and use Python to help us find a solution efficiently.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible operations and combinations. We can try to form an expression that might be close to 635 and then adjust it. We can use a brute-force approach to try different combinations and see if any of them result in 635.\n\nHere's a Python script to try different combinations of these numbers with basic arithmetic operations:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnumbers = [16, 5, 75, 80, 21]\ntarget = 635\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"({nums[0]} {ops[0]} {nums[1]}) {ops[1]} ({nums[2]} {ops[2]} {nums[3]}) {ops[3]} {nums[4]}\"\n    try:\n        if eval(expression) == target:\n            return expression\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        pass\n    return None\n\nfor num_perm in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=4):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if result:\n            print(result)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 635. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 635 using the numbers 16, 5, 75, 80, and 21. Each expression uses each number exactly once and combines them with arithmetic operations.\n\nFrom the output, we can select one of the valid expressions. Let's choose one of these expressions to provide as the final answer.\n\nThe expression `(16 + 21) * (75 / 5) + 80` is a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(16 + 21) * (75 / 5) + 80>>>"
