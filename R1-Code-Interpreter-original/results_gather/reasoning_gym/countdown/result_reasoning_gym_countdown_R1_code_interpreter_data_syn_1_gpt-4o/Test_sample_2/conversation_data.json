    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the given numbers (52, 26, 15, 23, 75, 37) using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to reach the target number 987. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different combinations and operations to see if we can reach the target number.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility of using multiplication and addition, as these operations can quickly increase the value towards the target.\n\nWe can start by trying to multiply some of the larger numbers together and then adjust with addition or subtraction. Let's try a few combinations:\n\n1. Multiply two numbers and then add or subtract the others.\n2. Use division if necessary to adjust the result.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations and see if we can find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [52, 26, 15, 23, 75, 37]\ntarget = 987\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {nums[i]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if result == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]}\"\n            for i in range(1, len(num_perm)):\n                expression += f\" {ops[i-1]} {num_perm[i]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers with all possible combinations of operations and check if any of them result in the target number 987. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output shows multiple valid expressions that evaluate to 987 using the given numbers. The expressions are equivalent due to the commutative property of addition and subtraction. Let's choose one of these expressions to provide as the final answer.\n\nThe expression `15 * 75 - 52 - 26 - 23 - 37` is a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<15 * 75 - 52 - 26 - 23 - 37>>>"
