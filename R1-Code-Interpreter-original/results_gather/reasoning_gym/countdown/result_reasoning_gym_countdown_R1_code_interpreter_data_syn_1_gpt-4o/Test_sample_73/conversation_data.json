    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 32, 47, 10, 73, and 90 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 164. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering possible combinations and operations that could lead to the target number. We can try different combinations and see if they can be combined to reach 164.\n\n1. We can start by trying to combine numbers through addition and subtraction to get close to 164.\n2. We can also consider multiplication and division to adjust the values.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- We can try adding and subtracting numbers to see if we can reach 164.\n- We can also try multiplying or dividing numbers to adjust the total.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations and see if we can find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [4, 32, 47, 10, 73, 90]\ntarget = 164\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = str(nums[0])\n    for i in range(len(ops)):\n        expression += ops[i] + str(nums[i+1])\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = str(num_perm[0])\n            for i in range(len(ops)):\n                expression += ops[i] + str(num_perm[i+1])\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 164. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several arithmetic expressions that evaluate to 164 using the numbers 4, 32, 47, 10, 73, and 90. Each number is used at most once in each expression. \n\nLet's select one of these expressions as the final answer. \n\nOne of the valid expressions is:\n\n```\n32*90/10-73-47-4\n```\n\nThis expression uses all the numbers and evaluates to 164. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<32*90/10-73-47-4>>>"
