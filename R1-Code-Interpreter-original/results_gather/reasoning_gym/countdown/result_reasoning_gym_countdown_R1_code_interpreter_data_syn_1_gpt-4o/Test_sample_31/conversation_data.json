    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 82, 63, 56, 90, and 47 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 174. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering combinations of these numbers and operations that might result in 174. We can try different arithmetic operations and see if we can reach the target number.\n\nFirst, let's try some combinations manually:\n\n1. Check if any two numbers can be added to get close to 174.\n2. Consider using subtraction to adjust the sum.\n3. Use multiplication or division to scale the numbers appropriately.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- 82 + 90 = 172 (close to 174)\n- 63 + 90 = 153\n- 56 + 90 = 146\n- 47 + 90 = 137\n\nSince 82 + 90 = 172 is close to 174, we can try to adjust this sum by adding or subtracting the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try adding 47 to 82 and then subtracting 56:\n\n- 82 + 47 = 129\n- 129 + 56 = 185\n- 185 - 90 = 95\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try another approach.\n\nLet's try using multiplication:\n\n- 82 + 63 = 145\n- 145 + 47 = 192\n- 192 - 56 = 136\n- 136 + 90 = 226\n\nThis also doesn't work. Let's try a different combination:\n\n- 82 + 56 = 138\n- 138 + 47 = 185\n- 185 - 90 = 95\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try using division:\n\n- 90 / 47 ≈ 1.91\n- 82 + 63 = 145\n- 145 + 56 = 201\n- 201 - 90 = 111\n\nThis doesn't work. Let's try another approach:\n\n- 82 + 90 = 172\n- 172 + 47 = 219\n- 219 - 56 = 163\n\nThis doesn't work.
