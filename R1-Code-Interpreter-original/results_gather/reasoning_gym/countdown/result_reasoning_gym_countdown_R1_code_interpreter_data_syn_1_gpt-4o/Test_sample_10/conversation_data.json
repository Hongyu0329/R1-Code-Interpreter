    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the given numbers (36, 29, 95, 32, 4, 15) using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to reach the target number 139. Each number can be used at most once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try to add or subtract numbers to get close to 139.\n2. We can use multiplication or division to adjust the results.\n3. We need to ensure that the operations are valid (e.g., no division by zero).\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- Start with the largest number, 95, and see if we can add or subtract other numbers to reach 139.\n- Consider using multiplication or division to adjust the total.\n\nLet's try some calculations:\n\n- 95 + 36 = 131 (close, but not 139)\n- 95 + 36 + 4 = 135 (still not 139)\n- 95 + 36 + 4 + 15 = 150 (too high)\n- 95 + 36 - 4 = 127 (not enough)\n- 95 + 36 + 4 = 135 (close, but not 139)\n- 95 + 36 + 4 + 15 = 150 (too high)\n- 95 + 36 - 4 + 15 = 142 (close, but not 139)\n- 95 + 36 - 4 - 15 = 112 (not enough)\n- 95 + 36 + 4 - 15 = 120 (not enough)\n- 95 + 36 - 4 + 15 = 142 (close, but not 139)\n- 95 + 36 - 4 - 15 = 112 (not enough)\n- 95 + 36 + 4 - 15 = 120 (not enough)\n\nLet's try using multiplication or division:\n\n- 95 + 36 = 131\n- 131 + 4 = 135\n- 135 + 15 = 150 (too high)\n- 135 - 15 = 120 (not enough)\n- 135 + 4 = 139 (this works!)\n\nThe combination that works is:\n\n95 + 36 + 4 + 4 = 139\n\nLet's verify this with a Python script to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the target number using the given numbers\nnumbers = [36, 29, 95, 32, 4, 15]\n\n# Try to find a combination that results in 139\nresult = 95 + 36 + 4 + 4\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code output confirms that the calculation is correct. The combination of numbers that results in 139 is:\n\n<<<95 + 36 + 4 + 4>>>"
