    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 39, 13, 86, and 94 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 327. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations of these numbers. We need to find a way to combine these numbers to reach the target of 327.\n\n1. We can try to find a combination of numbers that, when multiplied or added, get us close to 327.\n2. We can also consider using division to adjust the result if needed.\n\nLet's explore some possibilities:\n\n- Multiplying two numbers to get close to 327.\n- Adding or subtracting numbers to adjust the result.\n- Using division to fine-tune the result.\n\nLet's try some combinations and see if we can find a solution.\n\nFirst, let's try multiplying two numbers and see if we can get close to 327:\n\n- 39 * 13 = 507\n- 86 * 3 = 258\n- 94 * 3 = 282\n\nNone of these are close to 327, so let's try another approach.\n\nWe can try using a combination of addition and multiplication:\n\n- 39 + 86 = 125\n- 94 + 13 = 107\n\nNow, let's try multiplying these results:\n\n- 125 * 3 = 375\n- 107 * 3 = 321\n\n321 is close to 327, so let's see if we can adjust it using the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try using division to adjust the result:\n\n- 321 + 6 = 327\n\nNow, let's see if we can use the numbers 39, 13, 86, and 94 to form this expression.\n\nLet's try using Python to find a valid expression:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [39, 13, 86, 94]\ntarget = 327\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    result = nums[0]\n    for i in range(3):\n        if ops[i] == '+':\n            result += nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '/':\n            if nums[i + 1] == 0:\n                return None\n            result /= nums[i + 1]\n    return result\n\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid expression.",
    "The code output provides us with several valid expressions that evaluate to 327 using the numbers 39, 13, 86, and 94. Each expression uses each number at most once and involves basic arithmetic operations.\n\nThe expressions found are:\n\n1. 39 * 13 - 86 - 94\n2. 39 * 13 - 94 - 86\n3. 13 * 39 - 86 - 94\n4. 13 * 39 - 94 - 86\n\nAll these expressions are equivalent due to the commutative property of multiplication and the order of subtraction.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<39 * 13 - 86 - 94>>>"
