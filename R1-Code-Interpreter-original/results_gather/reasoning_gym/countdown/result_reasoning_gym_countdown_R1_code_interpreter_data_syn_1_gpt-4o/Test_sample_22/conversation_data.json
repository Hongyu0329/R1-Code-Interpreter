    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 55, 75, 12, and 34 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 176. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try adding two numbers and then see if the remaining numbers can be used to reach 176.\n2. We can try multiplying two numbers and then see if the remaining numbers can be used to reach 176.\n3. We can try subtracting or dividing two numbers and then see if the remaining numbers can be used to reach 176.\n\nLet's explore these possibilities using a systematic approach. We will use Python to help us find a valid combination.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [55, 75, 12, 34]\ntarget = 176\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i+1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i+1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i+1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i+1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            print(expression)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 176. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output shows that there are multiple ways to reach the target number 176 by simply adding all the numbers together. The expression that satisfies the condition is:\n\n55 + 75 + 12 + 34\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and sums up to 176. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<55 + 75 + 12 + 34>>>"
