    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 74, 55, 48, and 7 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that results in the number 184. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different operations and see if they lead to the desired result. \n\nOne approach is to try combining the numbers in pairs and then combining the results. We can also consider the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to ensure the correct calculation.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n1. Start with addition and multiplication:\n   - 74 + 55 = 129\n   - 48 + 7 = 55\n   - 129 + 55 = 184\n\nThis combination seems to work. Let's verify it with a simple Python script to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\n```python\n# Verify the calculation\nresult = 74 + 55 + 48 + 7\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The calculation is correct, and the expression that equals 184 using the numbers 74, 55, 48, and 7 is:\n\n<<<74 + 55 + 48 + 7>>>"
