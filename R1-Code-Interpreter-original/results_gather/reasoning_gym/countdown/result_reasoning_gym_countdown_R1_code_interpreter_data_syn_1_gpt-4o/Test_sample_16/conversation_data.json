    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the given numbers (89, 75, 84, 56, 94, 73) using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to reach the target number 133. Each number can be used at most once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different combinations and operations to see if we can reach the target number.\n\n1. We can start by checking if any two numbers can be added or subtracted to get close to 133.\n2. We can also consider multiplication and division to see if they can help us reach the target.\n3. We need to ensure that the operations are valid and result in an integer.\n\nLet's try to find a solution using a systematic approach. We will use Python to help us explore the combinations efficiently.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\nnumbers = [89, 75, 84, 56, 94, 73]\ntarget = 133\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    result = nums[0]\n    for i in range(len(ops)):\n        if ops[i] == '+':\n            result += nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '/':\n            if nums[i + 1] == 0 or result % nums[i + 1] != 0:\n                return None\n            result //= nums[i + 1]\n    return result\n\ndef find_expression(numbers, target):\n    for num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n        for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers) - 1):\n            if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n                expression = f\"{num_perm[0]}\"\n                for i in range(len(ops)):\n                    expression += f\" {ops[i]} {num_perm[i + 1]}\"\n                return expression\n    return None\n\nexpression = find_expression(numbers, target)\nprint(expression)\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of operations to find an expression that evaluates to 133. Let's execute the code to see if it finds a solution.",
