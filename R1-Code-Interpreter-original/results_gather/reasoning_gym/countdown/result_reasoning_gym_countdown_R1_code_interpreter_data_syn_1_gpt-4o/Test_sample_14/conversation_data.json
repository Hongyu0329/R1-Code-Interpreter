    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 72, 24, 48, and 15 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 624. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the numbers:\n\n- 72\n- 24\n- 48\n- 15\n\nThe target number is 624. One possible approach is to consider multiplication first, as it can quickly increase the value of the expression. We can try to find two numbers whose product is close to 624, and then adjust with addition or subtraction if necessary.\n\nLet's try multiplying some of these numbers:\n\n- 72 * 15 = 1080\n- 48 * 15 = 720\n- 72 * 24 = 1728\n- 48 * 24 = 1152\n\nNone of these products are exactly 624, but 48 * 15 = 720 is relatively close. We can try to adjust this product by using division or subtraction.\n\nLet's see if we can adjust 720 to 624 by using the remaining numbers:\n\n- 720 - 72 = 648\n- 720 - 48 = 672\n- 720 - 24 = 696\n\nNone of these results in 624. Let's try using division:\n\n- 720 / 24 = 30\n- 720 / 48 = 15\n- 720 / 72 = 10\n\nNone of these results in 624 either. Let's try a different approach by considering division first:\n\n- 72 / 24 = 3\n- 48 / 24 = 2\n- 72 / 48 = 1.5\n- 48 / 15 = 3.2\n\nNone of these results in a useful number to multiply with the others to get 624. Let's try a different combination:\n\n- 72 * 8 = 576\n- 48 * 13 = 624\n\nThe product 48 * 13 = 624 is exactly what we need. However, 13 is not one of the numbers we have. Let's try to find a way to use the numbers we have to reach 624.\n\nLet's try using a combination of multiplication and addition:\n\n- 72 * 8 + 48 = 624\n\nThis expression uses 72, 48, and 8. However, 8 is not one of the numbers we have. Let's try another approach:\n\n- 72 * 9 - 24 = 624\n\nThis expression uses 72, 9, and 24. However, 9 is not one of the numbers we have. Let's try another approach:\n\n- 72 * 6 + 48 = 480\n\nThis expression uses 72, 6, and 48. However, 6 is not one of the numbers we have.
