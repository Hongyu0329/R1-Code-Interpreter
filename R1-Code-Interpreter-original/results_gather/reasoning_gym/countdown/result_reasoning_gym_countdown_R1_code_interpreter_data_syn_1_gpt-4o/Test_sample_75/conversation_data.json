    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 94, 100, 51, and 6 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 455. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by considering the target number, 455. We can break it down into factors or sums that might be achievable with the given numbers. \n\n1. **Multiplication and Division**: \n   - 455 is not easily divisible by any of the given numbers, so direct division might not be helpful.\n   - We can try to form 455 by multiplying two numbers and then adjusting with addition or subtraction.\n\n2. **Addition and Subtraction**:\n   - We can try to form 455 by adding or subtracting combinations of the given numbers.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- If we consider 94 and 6, we can multiply them: 94 * 6 = 564.\n- We can then subtract 100 to get closer to 455: 564 - 100 = 464.\n- Finally, we can subtract 51 to reach 455: 464 - 51 = 413.\n\nThis approach doesn't work, so let's try another combination.\n\n- Consider using 100 and 51: 100 + 51 = 151.\n- Multiply by 6: 151 * 6 = 906.\n- Subtract 94: 906 - 94 = 812.\n\nThis approach also doesn't work, so let's try another combination.\n\n- Consider using 100 and 6: 100 * 6 = 600.\n- Subtract 94: 600 - 94 = 506.\n- Subtract 51: 506 - 51 = 455.\n\nThis approach works. Let's verify this with a Python script to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = 100 * 6 - 94 - 51\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The calculation is correct, and the expression successfully evaluates to 455 using the numbers 94, 100, 51, and 6. Therefore, the arithmetic expression that achieves the target number is:\n\n<<<100 * 6 - 94 - 51>>>"
