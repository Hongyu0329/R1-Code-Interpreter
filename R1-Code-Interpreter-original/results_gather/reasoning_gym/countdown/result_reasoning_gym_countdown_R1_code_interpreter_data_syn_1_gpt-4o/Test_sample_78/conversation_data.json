    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 63, 26, 52, 60, and 28 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that results in the number 889. Each number can only be used once.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and combinations. We can try different permutations and combinations of these numbers to see if we can reach the target number.\n\nGiven the complexity of manually trying all combinations, we can write a Python script to automate this process. The script will try all possible combinations of the numbers with the four basic arithmetic operations to find an expression that equals 889.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the numbers and the target\nnumbers = [63, 26, 52, 60, 28]\ntarget = 889\n\n# Define the operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=4):\n        # Create the expression\n        expr = f\"(({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]}) {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]}) {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]} {ops[3]} {num_perm[4]}\"\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all permutations of the numbers and all combinations of the operations to find an expression that evaluates to 889. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions, but we need to ensure that the expression uses all the numbers exactly once and evaluates to 889. Let's analyze the results:\n\n1. `((26 - 52) + 60) * 28 - 63`\n2. `((26 + 60) - 52) * 28 - 63`\n3. `((60 + 26) - 52) * 28 - 63`\n4. `((60 - 52) + 26) * 28 - 63`\n\nNone of these expressions use all five numbers exactly once. Let's refine our approach to ensure that all numbers are used exactly once in the expression.\n\nI will adjust the code to ensure that all numbers are used and the expression evaluates to 889. Let's try again:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the numbers and the target\nnumbers = [63, 26, 52, 60, 28]\ntarget = 889\n\n# Define the operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in itertools.permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in itertools.product(operations, repeat=4):\n        # Create the expression\n        expr = f\"(({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]}) {ops[1]} ({num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]})) {ops[3]} {num_perm[4]}\"\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this refined code to find the correct expression."
