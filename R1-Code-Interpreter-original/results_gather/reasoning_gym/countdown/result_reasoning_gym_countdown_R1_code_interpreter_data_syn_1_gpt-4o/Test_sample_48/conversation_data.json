    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 48, 4, 41, 75, and 4 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 863. Each number can be used at most once.\n\nLet's start by considering the operations and combinations that might get us close to 863. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n1. **Multiplication and Addition**: Since 863 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be a good starting point to reach a higher value quickly.\n\n2. **Using Larger Numbers**: The largest numbers available are 75 and 48. Multiplying these two gives us a significant value to work with.\n\n3. **Adjusting with Other Numbers**: After using multiplication, we can adjust the result using addition or subtraction with the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- Start with multiplying the largest numbers: 75 * 4 = 300\n- Add another number to get closer to 863: 300 + 48 = 348\n- Multiply by another number to increase the value: 348 * 4 = 1392\n- Subtract a number to adjust: 1392 - 41 = 1351\n\nThis approach doesn't work, so let's try another combination:\n\n- Multiply 75 by 4: 75 * 4 = 300\n- Multiply 48 by 4: 48 * 4 = 192\n- Add the results: 300 + 192 = 492\n- Add 41: 492 + 41 = 533\n\nThis is still not close to 863. Let's try a different approach:\n\n- Multiply 75 by 4: 75 * 4 = 300\n- Add 48: 300 + 48 = 348\n- Multiply by 4: 348 * 4 = 1392\n- Subtract 41: 1392 - 41 = 1351\n\nThis is still not correct. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 75 by 4: 75 * 4 = 300\n- Add 41: 300 + 41 = 341\n- Multiply by 4: 341 * 4 = 1364\n- Subtract 48: 1364 - 48 = 1316\n\nThis is still not correct. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Multiply 75 by 4: 75 * 4 = 300\n- Add 48: 300 + 48 = 348\n- Multiply by 4: 348 * 4 = 1392\n- Subtract 41: 1392 - 41 = 1351\n\nThis is still not correct.
