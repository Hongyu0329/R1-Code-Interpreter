    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to find a combination of the numbers 19, 19, 57, 7, 12, and 95 that equals 285 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's try to find such a combination.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility of using multiplication and addition, as these operations can quickly increase the total. We can also consider subtraction and division if needed.\n\nLet's try to find a solution.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [19, 19, 57, 7, 12, 95]\ntarget = 285\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"({nums[0]} {ops[0]} {nums[1]})\"\n    for i in range(1, len(ops)):\n        expression = f\"({expression} {ops[i]} {nums[i+1]})\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            # Construct the expression\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]})\"\n            for i in range(1, len(ops)):\n                expression = f\"({expression} {ops[i]} {num_perm[i+1]})\"\n            expression = expression.replace(' ', '')\n            break\n    else:\n        continue\n    break\n\nexpression\nassistant > <<<(((((19/19)-57)+95)*7)+12)>>>"
