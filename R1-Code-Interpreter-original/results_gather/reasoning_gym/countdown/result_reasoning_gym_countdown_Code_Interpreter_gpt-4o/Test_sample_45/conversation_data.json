    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the numbers 61, 27, 29, 69, and 25 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the target number 103. Each number can be used at most once.\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n\n- Start by considering combinations of addition and subtraction, as they are the most straightforward operations to reach a specific target.\n- We can also consider multiplication and division if they help in reaching the target.\n\nLet's try to find a solution through trial and error.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [61, 27, 29, 69, 25]\ntarget = 103\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(len(ops)):\n        expression += f\"{ops[i]}{nums[i+1]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}{ops[1]}{num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}{ops[3]}{num_perm[4]}\"\n            break\n\nexpression\nassistant > <<<69-25-29+27+61>>>"
