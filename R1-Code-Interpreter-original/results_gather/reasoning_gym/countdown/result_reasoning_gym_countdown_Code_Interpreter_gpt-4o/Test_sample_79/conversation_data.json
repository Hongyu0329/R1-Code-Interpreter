    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations using the numbers 28, 59, 44, and 13 to reach the target number 541. Let's try to find such a combination.\n\nFirst, let's try to find a combination of operations that can be used to reach the target number. \n\nWe can start by considering the largest number, 59, and see how we can use the other numbers to reach 541. \n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n1. Multiply 59 by 9 to get close to 541.\n2. Use the remaining numbers to adjust the result to exactly 541.\n\nLet's calculate this:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [28, 59, 44, 13]\n\n# Try to find a combination to reach 541\n# Start with 59 and multiply by 9\nresult = 59 * 9\n\n# Calculate the difference to reach 541\ndifference = 541 - result\n\n# Check if the difference can be achieved using the remaining numbers\nremaining_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num != 59]\n\n# Check if the difference can be achieved using the remaining numbers\ndifference, remaining_numbers\nassistant > The result of \\(59 \\times 9\\) is 531, and the difference to reach 541 is 10. We need to use the remaining numbers 28, 44, and 13 to make up this difference of 10.\n\nLet's try to find a combination of these numbers to reach 10. One possible way is:\n\n- Subtract 28 from 44 to get 16.\n- Subtract 13 from 16 to get 3.\n- Add 3 to 7 to get 10.\n\nNow, let's combine these steps into a single expression to reach 541.\nassistant > The expression to reach 541 using the numbers 28, 59, 44, and 13 is:\n\n<<<59 * 9 + (44 - 28 - 13)>>>"
