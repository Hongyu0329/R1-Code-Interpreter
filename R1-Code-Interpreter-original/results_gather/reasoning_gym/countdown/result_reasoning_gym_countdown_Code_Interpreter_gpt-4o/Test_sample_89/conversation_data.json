    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations using the numbers 95, 59, 47, and 48 to reach the target number 153. Let's try to find such a combination.\n\nOne possible solution is:\n\n\\[\n95 + 59 - 48 - 47 = 153\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n<<<95 + 59 - 48 - 47>>>"
