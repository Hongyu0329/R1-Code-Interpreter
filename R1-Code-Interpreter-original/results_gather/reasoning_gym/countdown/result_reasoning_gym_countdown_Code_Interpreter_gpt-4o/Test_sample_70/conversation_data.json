    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations using the numbers 47, 76, 10, and 27 to reach the target number 124. Let's try to find such a combination.\n\nOne possible solution is:\n\n\\[\n76 + 47 - 27 - 10 = 124\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n<<<76 + 47 - 27 - 10>>>"
