    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations using the numbers 89, 32, 15, and 39 to reach the target number 642. Let's try to find such a combination.\n\nFirst, let's try to find a combination of operations that might work:\n\n1. Start with the largest number, 89, and see if we can multiply it by another number to get close to 642.\n2. Consider using multiplication and addition/subtraction to reach the target.\n\nLet's try some calculations:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [89, 32, 15, 39]\ntarget = 642\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    result = nums[0]\n    for i in range(len(ops)):\n        if ops[i] == '+':\n            result += nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '-':\n            result -= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '*':\n            result *= nums[i + 1]\n        elif ops[i] == '/':\n            if nums[i + 1] == 0:\n                return None\n            result /= nums[i + 1]\n    return result\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]}\"\n            break\n\nexpression\nassistant > <<<39 * 15 - 32 + 89>>>"
