    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to find a combination of the numbers 74, 48, 56, and 66 using basic arithmetic operations that results in 132. Let's try to find such an expression.\n\nOne possible approach is to try different combinations of operations and numbers to see if we can reach the target number.
