    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to find a combination of the given numbers and arithmetic operations that result in 601. Let's try to find such a combination.\n\nFirst, let's consider the numbers and see if we can find a way to combine them to reach 601. \n\nWe can start by trying to get close to 601 using multiplication or addition, and then adjust using the other operations. \n\nLet's try:\n\n1.
