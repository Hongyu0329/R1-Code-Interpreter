    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations using the numbers 5, 41, 38, 81, and 14 that results in 450. Let's try to find such an expression.\n\nFirst, let's consider the target number 450 and think about possible operations that could lead to it.
