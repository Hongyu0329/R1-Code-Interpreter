    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 89, 94, 31, and 90 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 116. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n1. Start by considering the largest number, 94, and see if we can add or subtract the others to reach 116.\n2. Try different combinations of operations to see if we can reach the target.\n\nLet's calculate:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [89, 94, 31, 90]\ntarget = 116\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"({nums[0]} {ops[0]} {nums[1]}) {ops[1]} ({nums[2]} {ops[2]} {nums[3]})\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]}) {ops[1]} ({num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]})\"\n            break\n\nexpression\nassistant > <<<(90 + 31) - (94 - 89)>>>"
