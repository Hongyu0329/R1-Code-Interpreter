    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 39, 13, 86, and 94 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 327. Each number can be used at most once, and we can use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n1. Start by considering multiplication and division to reach a number close to 327.\n2. Use addition or subtraction to adjust the result to exactly 327.\n\nLet's try a few combinations to see if we can find a solution.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [39, 13, 86, 94]\ntarget = 327\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"({nums[0]} {ops[0]} {nums[1]}) {ops[1]} ({nums[2]} {ops[2]} {nums[3]})\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        result = evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops)\n        if result == target:\n            expression = f\"({num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]}) {ops[1]} ({num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]})\"\n            break\n\nexpression\nassistant > <<<(13 * 39) - (94 + 86)>>>"
