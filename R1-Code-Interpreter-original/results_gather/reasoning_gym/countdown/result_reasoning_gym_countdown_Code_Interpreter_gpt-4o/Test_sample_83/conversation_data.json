Let me try a different approach to find the solution manually.\n\nWe need to use the numbers 78, 54, 85, 11, and 8 to reach 667. Let's try to find a combination of operations that will work:\n\n1. Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n2. Try to use division and subtraction to adjust the result to exactly 667.\n\nLet's attempt to manually find a solution.# Manually try to find a solution by testing different combinations\n# Since the previous code execution failed, let's try a more direct approach\n\n# Try a specific combination\ndef test_combination():\n    # Try a specific combination of operations\n    result = 78 * 8 + 85 - 54 / 11\n    return result\n\ntest_combination()\nassistant > The combination I tried did not yield the correct result. Let's try another approach:\n\n1. Consider using multiplication to get close to the target.\n2. Use addition or subtraction to adjust the result.\n3. Use division if necessary to fine-tune the result.\n\nLet's try another combination.# Try another specific combination\ndef test_combination_2():\n    # Try a specific combination of operations\n    result = 85 * 8 - 54 + 11\n    return result\n\ntest_combination_2()\nassistant > The combination \\(85 \\times 8 - 54 + 11\\) results in 637, which is still not the target 667. Let's try another approach:\n\n1. Use multiplication to get a large number.\n2. Adjust using addition or subtraction.\n3. Use division if necessary.\n\nLet's try another combination.# Try another specific combination\ndef test_combination_3():\n    # Try a specific combination of operations\n    result = 85 * 8 + 54 - 11\n    return result\n\ntest_combination_3()\nassistant > The combination \\(85 \\times 8 + 54 - 11\\) results in 723, which is still not the target 667. Let's try another approach:\n\n1. Use multiplication to get a large number.\n2. Adjust using addition or subtraction.\n3. Use division if necessary.\n\nLet's try another combination.# Try another specific combination\ndef test_combination_4():\n    # Try a specific combination of operations\n    result = 78 * 8 + 54 - 11\n    return result\n\ntest_combination_4()\nassistant > I found a combination that works:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n78 \\times 8 + 54 - 11\n\\]\n\nThis evaluates to 667. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<78*8+54-11>>>"
