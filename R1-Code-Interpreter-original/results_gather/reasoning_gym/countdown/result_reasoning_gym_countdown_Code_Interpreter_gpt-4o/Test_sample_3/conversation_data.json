    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of the given numbers and arithmetic operations that result in 281. Let's try to find such a combination.\n\nGiven numbers: 75, 23, 29, 32, 93, 75\n\nLet's try to find a solution: \n\n281 = 75 + 75 + 93 + 32 + 6\n\nWe can get 6 by using (29 - 23).\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n75 + 75 + 93 + 32 + (29 - 23)\n\nLet's verify this calculation.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Verify the calculation\nresult = 75 + 75 + 93 + 32 + (29 - 23)\nresult\nassistant > The calculation is correct. The arithmetic expression that results in 281 is:\n\n<<<75 + 75 + 93 + 32 + (29 - 23)>>>"
