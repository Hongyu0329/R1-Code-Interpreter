    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations using the numbers 57, 8, 16, 22, and 65 to reach the target number 216. Let's try to find such a combination.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible operations and combinations that could lead to 216. We can try different operations and see if we can reach the target.\n\nLet's start by trying to multiply some of the numbers together, as 216 is a relatively large number. We can also consider addition, subtraction, and division as needed.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [57, 8, 16, 22, 65]\ntarget = 216\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expression = f\"{nums[0]}\"\n    for i in range(len(ops)):\n        expression += f\" {ops[i]} {nums[i+1]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and combinations of operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]} {ops[3]} {num_perm[4]}\"\n            break\n\nexpression\nassistant > It seems there was an error in the code execution. Let me correct it and try again.# Try all permutations of numbers and combinations of operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]} {ops[0]} {num_perm[1]} {ops[1]} {num_perm[2]} {ops[2]} {num_perm[3]} {ops[3]} {num_perm[4]}\"\n            break\n    else:\n        continue\n    break\n\nexpression\nassistant > It seems there was another issue with the code.

Let's try a more manual approach to find a combination that works.\n\nWe can try to find a combination of operations that will yield 216. Let's consider the following:\n\n1. Start by multiplying two numbers to get a larger number.\n2. Use addition or subtraction to adjust the result.\n3. Use division if necessary to reach the target.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:# Manually try combinations to reach the target\n# Let's try multiplying some numbers and adjusting with others\n\n# Try a combination\nresult = 57 * 8 - 16 + 22 - 65\nresult\nassistant > The manual attempt did not yield the correct result either. Let's try another approach by considering different combinations and operations. \n\nLet's try a different combination:# Try another combination\nresult = (65 - 57) * 22 + 16\nresult\nassistant > The previous attempt also did not yield the correct result. Let's try another combination:# Try another combination\nresult = 65 * 8 - 57 - 22 - 16\nresult\nassistant > The previous attempt did not yield the correct result either. Let's try another combination:# Try another combination\nresult = 57 * 8 - 65 - 22 + 16\nresult\nassistant > The previous attempt did not yield the correct result either. Let's try another combination:# Try another combination\nresult = 65 * 8 - 57 + 16 - 22\nresult\nassistant > The previous attempt did not yield the correct result either. Let's try another combination:# Try another combination\nresult = 57 + 65 + 22 + 16 + 8\nresult\nassistant > The previous attempt did not yield the correct result either.
