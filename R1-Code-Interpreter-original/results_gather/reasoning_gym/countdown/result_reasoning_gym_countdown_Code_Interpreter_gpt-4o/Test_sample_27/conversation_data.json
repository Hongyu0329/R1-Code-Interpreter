    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations using the numbers 39, 12, 33, and 86 to reach the target number 778. Let's try different combinations and operations to achieve this. \n\nLet's start by considering multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach a larger number like 778. \n\nWe can try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others to see if we can reach 778. \n\nLet's calculate: \n\n- Multiply 86 by 12\n- Add 33\n- Subtract 39\n\nLet's see if this works.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the expression (86 * 12) + 33 - 39\nresult = (86 * 12) + 33 - 39\nresult\nassistant > The calculation \\((86 \\times 12) + 33 - 39\\) results in 1026, which is not equal to 778.
