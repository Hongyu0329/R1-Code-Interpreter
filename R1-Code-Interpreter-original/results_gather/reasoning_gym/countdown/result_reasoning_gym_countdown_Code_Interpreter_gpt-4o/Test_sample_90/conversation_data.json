    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to find a combination of the numbers 10, 43, 99, 100, 36, and 10 that results in 190. Let's try to construct an expression that satisfies these conditions.\n\nOne possible approach is to try different combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let's explore this:\n\n- Start with the largest number, 100, and see if we can build around it.\n- Consider using addition and subtraction to reach the target.\n\nLet's try:\n\n100 + 99 - 43 + 36 - 10 - 10\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and should equal 190. Let's verify this calculation.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Verify the expression\nresult = 100 + 99 - 43 + 36 - 10 - 10\nresult\nassistant > The expression \\(100 + 99 - 43 + 36 - 10 - 10\\) equals 172, not 190.
