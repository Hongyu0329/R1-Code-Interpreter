    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations using the numbers 46, 34, 71, and 16 to reach the target number 148. Let's try to find such a combination.\n\nOne possible solution is:\n\n\\[\n(71 + 16) + (46 + 34) = 148\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n\\[\n71 + 16 + 46 + 34\n\\]\n\nLet's format the final answer as requested.\nassistant > <<<71 + 16 + 46 + 34>>>"
