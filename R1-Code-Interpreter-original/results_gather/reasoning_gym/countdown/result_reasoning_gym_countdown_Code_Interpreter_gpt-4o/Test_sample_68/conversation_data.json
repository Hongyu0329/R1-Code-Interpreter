    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to use the numbers 52, 98, 8, and 13 to form an arithmetic expression that equals 624. Let's try to find a combination that works:\n\nOne possible approach is to consider multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value. Let's try:\n\n- Multiply 52 by 13 to get a larger number.\n- Then, divide by 8 to adjust the value.\n- Finally, add or subtract the remaining number to reach 624.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = (52 * 13) + (98 // 8)\nresult\nassistant > The calculation above did not yield the correct result.
