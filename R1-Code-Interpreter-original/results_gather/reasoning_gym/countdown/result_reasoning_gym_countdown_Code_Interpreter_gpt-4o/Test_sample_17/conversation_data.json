    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations that use each of the numbers 85, 80, 79, and 7 exactly once to result in 510. Let's try to find such a combination.\n\nOne possible approach is to consider multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach a larger number like 510. Let's try:\n\n- Multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n- Dividing one number by another and then using the result in further operations.\n\nLet's explore these possibilities.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import permutations, product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [85, 80, 79, 7]\ntarget = 510\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        result = nums[0]\n        for i in range(3):\n            if ops[i] == '+':\n                result += nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '-':\n                result -= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '*':\n                result *= nums[i + 1]\n            elif ops[i] == '/':\n                result /= nums[i + 1]\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all permutations of numbers and operations\nfor num_perm in permutations(numbers):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        if evaluate_expression(num_perm, ops) == target:\n            expression = f\"{num_perm[0]}{ops[0]}{num_perm[1]}{ops[1]}{num_perm[2]}{ops[2]}{num_perm[3]}\"\n            break\n\nexpression\nassistant > <<<7+79-80*85>>>"
