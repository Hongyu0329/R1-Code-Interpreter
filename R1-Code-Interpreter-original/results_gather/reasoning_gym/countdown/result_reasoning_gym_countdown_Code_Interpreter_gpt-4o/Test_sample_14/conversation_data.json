    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations using the numbers 72, 24, 48, and 15 to reach the target number 624. Let's try to find such a combination.\n\nFirst, let's consider the factors of 624 to see if we can use multiplication or division effectively. The prime factorization of 624 is \\(2^4 \\times 3 \\times 13\\).\n\nLet's try to find a combination:\n\n1. Start with 72 and 24:\n   - \\(72 \\times 24 = 1728\\)\n\n2. Try dividing 1728 by 48:\n   - \\(1728 / 48 = 36\\)\n\n3. Multiply 36 by 15:\n   - \\(36 \\times 15 = 540\\)\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try another approach:\n\n1. Multiply 24 and 15:\n   - \\(24 \\times 15 = 360\\)\n\n2. Add 48 to 360:\n   - \\(360 + 48 = 408\\)\n\n3. Try multiplying 408 by 72:\n   - \\(408 \\times 72\\) is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. Multiply 72 and 15:\n   - \\(72 \\times 15 = 1080\\)\n\n2. Subtract 48 from 1080:\n   - \\(1080 - 48 = 1032\\)\n\n3. Divide 1032 by 24:\n   - \\(1032 / 24 = 43\\)\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n1. Multiply 24 and 15:\n   - \\(24 \\times 15 = 360\\)\n\n2. Multiply 360 by 2 (using 48/24):\n   - \\(360 \\times 2 = 720\\)\n\n3. Subtract 96 (using 72 - 24):\n   - \\(720 - 96 = 624\\)\n\nThis approach seems promising. Let's verify and format the solution.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Verify the solution\nresult = (24 * 15) * (48 / 24) - (72 - 24)\nresult\nassistant > It seems there was a mistake in my calculation. Let's try another approach to find the correct expression.\n\n1. Multiply 72 and 15:\n   - \\(72 \\times 15 = 1080\\)\n\n2. Subtract 24 from 1080:\n   - \\(1080 - 24 = 1056\\)\n\n3. Divide 1056 by 48:\n   - \\(1056 / 48 = 22\\)\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n1. Multiply 24 and 15:\n   - \\(24 \\times 15 = 360\\)\n\n2.
