    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations using the numbers 16, 5, 75, 80, and 21 that results in 635. Let's try to find such an expression.\n\nOne possible approach is to try different combinations of operations and see if they yield the desired result.
