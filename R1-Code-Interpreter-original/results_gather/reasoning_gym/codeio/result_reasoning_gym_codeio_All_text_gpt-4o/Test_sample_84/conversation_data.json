    "To solve the problem, we need to simulate the process of turning pages in a book and placing a bookmark on the current page. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Book**: \n   - We start with a book that has a title, an author, and a specified number of pages. The current page is initialized to 1.\n\n2. **Process Page Turns**:\n   - We have a list of page turns, where each element is an integer. A positive integer means turning pages forward, and a negative integer means turning pages backward.\n   - We iterate through the list of page turns and update the current page accordingly.\n   - After each page turn, we ensure that the current page does not go below 1 or exceed the total number of pages (`nbr_pages`). If it does, we adjust it to the nearest valid page number (1 or `nbr_pages`).\n\n3. **Place a Bookmark**:\n   - After processing all the page turns, we place a bookmark on the current page.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - We need to return a dictionary with two keys: `current_page` and `bookmarked_page`, both of which should have the same value as the current page after all page turns.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given input:\n\n- **Input Details**:\n  - `book_title`: 'Book_70'\n  - `author`: 'Author_93'\n  - `nbr_pages`: 39\n  - `page_turns`: [10]\n\n- **Initial State**:\n  - Current page is 1.\n\n- **Process Page Turns**:\n  - Turn 10 pages forward: Current page becomes 1 + 10 = 11.\n  - Since 11 is within the valid range (1 to 39), no adjustment is needed.\n\n- **Place a Bookmark**:\n  - The bookmark is placed on the current page, which is 11.\n\n- **Output**:\n  - The current page is 11.\n  - The bookmarked page is also 11.\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n\n```json\n<<<{\"current_page\": 11, \"bookmarked_page\": 11}>>>\n```"
