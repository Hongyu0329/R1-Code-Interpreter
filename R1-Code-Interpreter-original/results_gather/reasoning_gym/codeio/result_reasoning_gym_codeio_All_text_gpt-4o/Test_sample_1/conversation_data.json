    "To solve this problem, we need to determine a sequence of operations that would result in the given output `[36, 'empty :()', 'empty :()', 'empty :()']` when performed on a queue implemented using two stacks. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Output:**\n   - The output consists of four results from dequeue operations.\n   - The first result is `36`, indicating that the first dequeue operation successfully removed the element `36` from the queue.\n   - The next three results are `'empty :()'`, indicating that the subsequent dequeue operations were attempted on an empty queue.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Queue Operations:**\n   - The queue is initially empty.\n   - To get `36` as the result of the first dequeue, `36` must be enqueued before the first dequeue operation.\n   - After dequeuing `36`, the queue becomes empty again.\n   - The next three dequeue operations return `'empty :()'`, which means no elements were enqueued between these dequeue operations.\n\n3. **Constructing the Input:**\n   - We need at least one `enqueue` operation with the value `36` before the first `dequeue`.\n   - After the first `dequeue`, there should be no `enqueue` operations before the next three `dequeue` operations.\n\n4. **Formulating the Input Sequence:**\n   - Start with an `enqueue` operation to add `36` to the queue.\n   - Follow it with a `dequeue` operation to remove `36`.\n   - Add three more `dequeue` operations to match the output of `'empty :()'`.\n\n5. **Final Input:**\n   - The sequence of operations that matches the given output is:\n     - `('enqueue', 36)`\n     - `('dequeue', None)`\n     - `('dequeue', None)`\n     - `('dequeue', None)`\n     - `('dequeue', None)`\n\nThis sequence will produce the desired output when processed by the queue implemented with stacks.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format is:\n\n```json\n<<<\n{\n  \"operations\": [\n    (\"enqueue\", 36),\n    (\"dequeue\", None),\n    (\"dequeue\", None),\n    (\"dequeue\", None),\n    (\"dequeue\", None)\n  ]\n}\n>>>\n```"
