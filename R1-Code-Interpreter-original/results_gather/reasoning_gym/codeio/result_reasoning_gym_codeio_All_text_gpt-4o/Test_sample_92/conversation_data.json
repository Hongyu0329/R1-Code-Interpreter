    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the simplest pattern of letters and numbers that can generate at least the given number of unique license plates, which is 574,888 in this case. We also need to find patterns that generate the closest number of plates less than and more than the population.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Pattern:**\n   - Each 'N' in the pattern represents a digit (0-9), giving 10 possibilities.\n   - Each 'L' in the pattern represents a letter (A-Z), giving 26 possibilities.\n   - The total number of plates a pattern can generate is the product of the possibilities for each character in the pattern.\n\n2. **Determine the Simplest Pattern:**\n   - Start with the smallest possible pattern and calculate the total plates it can generate.\n   - Increase the pattern length by adding 'N' or 'L' until the total plates meet or exceed the population.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Plates:**\n   - For each pattern, calculate the total plates using the formula: `total_plates = 10^n * 26^l`, where `n` is the number of 'N's and `l` is the number of 'L's.\n\n4. **Find the Pattern with Least Excess Plates:**\n   - Once a pattern is found that meets or exceeds the population, calculate the excess plates as `total_plates - population`.\n   - Keep track of the previous pattern (closest less than) and the next pattern (closest more than).\n\n5. **Iterate Over Possible Patterns:**\n   - Start with simple patterns like 'N', 'L', 'NN', 'NL', etc., and calculate the total plates for each.\n   - Continue until a pattern is found that meets the requirement.\n\n6. **Identify the Required Patterns:**\n   - The pattern that generates the least excess plates is the simplest pattern that meets the requirement.\n   - The previous pattern is the one that generates the closest number of plates less than the population.\n   - The next pattern is the one that generates the closest number of plates more than the population.\n\n### Calculation:\n\n- For a population of 574,888, we need to find the simplest pattern that generates at least this many plates.\n- By iterating through possible patterns, we find:\n  - 'NNNNL' generates 676,000 plates (10^4 * 26^1).\n  - 'NNNN' generates 10,000 plates (10^4).\n  - 'NNNNLL' generates 17,576,000 plates (10^4 * 26^2).\n\n- The simplest pattern that meets the requirement is 'NNNNL', generating 676,000 plates.\n- The previous pattern is 'NNNN', generating 10,000 plates.\n- The next pattern is 'NNNNLL', generating 17,576,000 plates.\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"pattern\": \"NNNNL\",\n  \"total_plates\": 676000,\n  \"excess_plates\": 101112,\n  \"previous_pattern\": \"NNNN\",\n  \"next_pattern\": \"NNNNLL\"\n}\n```"
