    "To determine if every crop in the field is hydrated, we need to analyze the given 2D list and check the proximity of each crop to a water source. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Input Understanding**: The input is a 2D list where each element is either `\"w\"` (water source) or `\"c\"` (crop). The task is to check if every crop is within the hydration range of at least one water source.\n\n2. **Hydration Range**: Each water source hydrates the 8 surrounding tiles, which include the tiles directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) and the diagonal tiles (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).\n\n3. **Iterate Over the Field**: We need to iterate over each element in the 2D list to identify the positions of water sources.\n\n4. **Mark Hydrated Crops**: For each water source found, mark the 8 surrounding tiles as hydrated. This can be done by changing the crop (`\"c\"`) to a temporary marker (e.g., `\"#\"`) to indicate hydration.\n\n5. **Check for Unhydrated Crops**: After processing all water sources, check if there are any crops (`\"c\"`) left in the field. If there are, it means not all crops are hydrated.\n\n6. **Return Result**: If no crops are left unhydrated, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.\n\nNow, let's apply this logic to the given input:\n\n- **Field Analysis**:\n  ```\n  [['c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c'],\n   ['c', 'c', 'w', 'c', 'c', 'c'],\n   ['c', 'c', 'c', 'w', 'c', 'c'],\n   ['c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c'],\n   ['c', 'w', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'w']]\n  ```\n\n- **Water Sources and Hydration**:\n  - The water source at position (1, 2) hydrates the surrounding crops.\n  - The water source at position (2, 3) hydrates the surrounding crops.\n  - The water source at position (4, 1) hydrates the surrounding crops.\n  - The water source at position (4, 5) hydrates the surrounding crops.\n\n- **Check for Unhydrated Crops**:\n  - After marking the hydrated crops, we check for any remaining `\"c\"` in the field.\n  - In this case, all crops are within the hydration range of at least one water source.\n\nTherefore, the final result is that all crops are hydrated.\n\nThe output in JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"return\": true}\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<{\"return\": true}>>>"
