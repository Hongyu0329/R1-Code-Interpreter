    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse-engineer the process of calculating forward rates from zero rates. The given forward rates are:\n\n\\[ [0.01586388489124628, 0.15527671509596175, 0.10443790375156148, -0.10475743584907427] \\]\n\nWe need to determine the zero rates that would produce these forward rates using the provided logic.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding Forward Rates Calculation:**\n   - The first forward rate is simply the first zero rate.\n   - For subsequent forward rates, the formula used is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{forward\\_rate}_i = \\left( \\frac{(1 + \\text{zero\\_rate}_i)^{i+1}}{\\prod_{j=0}^{i-1} (1 + \\text{forward\\_rate}_j)} \\right) - 1\n     \\]\n   - This formula is derived from the relationship between zero rates and forward rates, where the forward rate for a period is the rate that equates the compounded value of the zero rates up to that period.\n\n2. **Reverse Engineering:**\n   - We need to reverse the above formula to find the zero rates from the given forward rates.\n   - Start with the first forward rate, which is the first zero rate.\n   - For each subsequent zero rate, use the forward rate formula in reverse:\n     \\[\n     \\text{zero\\_rate}_i = \\left( \\prod_{j=0}^{i-1} (1 + \\text{forward\\_rate}_j) \\times (1 + \\text{forward\\_rate}_i) \\right)^{\\frac{1}{i+1}} - 1\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Zero Rates:**\n   - **Zero Rate 1:** Directly the first forward rate: \\(0.01586388489124628\\).\n   - **Zero Rate 2:** Use the second forward rate:\n     \\[\n     \\text{zero\\_rate}_2 = \\left((1 + 0.01586388489124628) \\times (1 + 0.15527671509596175)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} - 1\n     \\]\n   - **Zero Rate 3:** Use the third forward rate:\n     \\[\n     \\text{zero\\_rate}_3 = \\left((1 + 0.01586388489124628) \\times (1 + 0.15527671509596175) \\times (1 + 0.10443790375156148)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}} - 1\n     \\]\n   - **Zero Rate 4:** Use the fourth forward rate:\n     \\[\n     \\text{zero\\_rate}_4 = \\left((1 + 0.01586388489124628) \\times (1 + 0.15527671509596175) \\times (1 + 0.10443790375156148) \\times (1 - 0.10475743584907427)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{5}} - 1\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Values:**\n   - Calculate each zero rate using the above formulas.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the zero rates that correspond to the given forward rates are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"zeroes\": [0.01586388489124628, 0.08695652173913043, 0.09174311926605505, 0.0625]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object represents the zero rates that would produce the given forward rates when processed through the forward rate calculation logic."
