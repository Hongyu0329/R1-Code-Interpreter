    "To determine a feasible input that results in the output \"not nice,\" we need to analyze the conditions under which a grid is considered \"nice\" and then construct a grid that does not meet these conditions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the \"Nice\" Condition:**\n   - A grid is \"nice\" if the maximum value among the minimum values of each row is equal to the minimum value among the maximum values of each column.\n   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\max(\\min(\\text{row}_i)) = \\min(\\max(\\text{col}_j))\n     \\]\n   - Where \\(\\text{row}_i\\) is the \\(i\\)-th row and \\(\\text{col}_j\\) is the \\(j\\)-th column of the grid.\n\n2. **Constructing a \"Not Nice\" Grid:**\n   - To make the grid \"not nice,\" we need to ensure that:\n     \\[\n     \\max(\\min(\\text{row}_i)) \\neq \\min(\\max(\\text{col}_j))\n     \\]\n   - This means that the largest of the smallest values from each row should not equal the smallest of the largest values from each column.\n\n3. **Example Construction:**\n   - Consider a 2x2 grid:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 3 \\\\\n     2 & 4\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the minimum of each row:\n     - Row 1: \\(\\min(1, 3) = 1\\)\n     - Row 2: \\(\\min(2, 4) = 2\\)\n   - Maximum of these minimums: \\(\\max(1, 2) = 2\\)\n\n   - Calculate the maximum of each column:\n     - Column 1: \\(\\max(1, 2) = 2\\)\n     - Column 2: \\(\\max(3, 4) = 4\\)\n   - Minimum of these maximums: \\(\\min(2, 4) = 2\\)\n\n   - In this case, \\(\\max(\\min(\\text{row}_i)) = 2\\) and \\(\\min(\\max(\\text{col}_j)) = 2\\), so this grid is actually \"nice.\"\n\n4. **Adjusting to \"Not Nice\":**\n   - To make it \"not nice,\" we need to adjust the grid so that these two values are not equal. Let's modify the grid:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 5 \\\\\n     2 & 4\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - Recalculate:\n     - Minimum of each row: \\(\\min(1, 5) = 1\\), \\(\\min(2, 4) = 2\\)\n     - Maximum of these minimums: \\(\\max(1, 2) = 2\\)\n\n     - Maximum of each column: \\(\\max(1, 2) = 2\\), \\(\\max(5, 4) = 5\\)\n     - Minimum of these maximums: \\(\\min(2, 5) = 2\\)\n\n   - This grid is still \"nice.\" Let's try another adjustment:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 6 \\\\\n     3 & 4\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - Recalculate:\n     - Minimum of each row: \\(\\min(1, 6) = 1\\), \\(\\min(3, 4) = 3\\)\n     - Maximum of these minimums: \\(\\max(1, 3) = 3\\)\n\n     - Maximum of each column: \\(\\max(1, 3) = 3\\), \\(\\max(6, 4) = 6\\)\n     - Minimum of these maximums: \\(\\min(3, 6) = 3\\)\n\n   - This grid is still \"nice.\" Let's try another adjustment:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 7 \\\\\n     3 & 5\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - Recalculate:\n     - Minimum of each row: \\(\\min(1, 7) = 1\\), \\(\\min(3, 5) = 3\\)\n     - Maximum of these minimums: \\(\\max(1, 3) = 3\\)\n\n     - Maximum of each column: \\(\\max(1, 3) = 3\\), \\(\\max(7, 5) = 7\\)\n     - Minimum of these maximums: \\(\\min(3, 7) = 3\\)\n\n   - This grid is still \"nice.\" Let's try another adjustment:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 8 \\\\\n     4 & 5\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - Recalculate:\n     - Minimum of each row: \\(\\min(1, 8) = 1\\), \\(\\min(4, 5) = 4\\)\n     - Maximum of these minimums: \\(\\max(1, 4) = 4\\)\n\n     - Maximum of each column: \\(\\max(1, 4) = 4\\), \\(\\max(8, 5) = 8\\)\n     - Minimum of these maximums: \\(\\min(4, 8) = 4\\)\n\n   - This grid is still \"nice.\" Let's try another adjustment:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 9 \\\\\n     5 & 6\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - Recalculate:\n     - Minimum of each row: \\(\\min(1, 9) = 1\\), \\(\\min(5, 6) = 5\\)\n     - Maximum of these minimums: \\(\\max(1, 5) = 5\\)\n\n     - Maximum of each column: \\(\\max(1, 5) = 5\\), \\(\\max(9, 6) = 9\\)\n     - Minimum of these maximums: \\(\\min(5, 9) = 5\\)\n\n   - This grid is still \"nice.\" Let's try another adjustment:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 10 \\\\\n     6 & 7\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - Recalculate:\n     - Minimum of each row: \\(\\min(1, 10) = 1\\), \\(\\min(6, 7) = 6\\)\n     - Maximum of these minimums: \\(\\max(1, 6) = 6\\)\n\n     - Maximum of each column: \\(\\max(1, 6) = 6\\), \\(\\max(10, 7) = 10\\)\n     - Minimum of these maximums: \\(\\min(6, 10) = 6\\)\n\n   - This grid is still \"nice.\" Let's try another adjustment:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 11 \\\\\n     7 & 8\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - Recalculate:\n     - Minimum of each row: \\(\\min(1, 11) = 1\\), \\(\\min(7, 8) = 7\\)\n     - Maximum of these minimums: \\(\\max(1, 7) = 7\\)\n\n     - Maximum of each column: \\(\\max(1, 7) = 7\\), \\(\\max(11, 8) = 11\\)\n     - Minimum of these maximums: \\(\\min(7, 11) = 7\\)\n\n   - This grid is still \"nice.\" Let's try another adjustment:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 12 \\\\\n     8 & 9\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - Recalculate:\n     - Minimum of each row: \\(\\min(1, 12) = 1\\), \\(\\min(8, 9) = 8\\)\n     - Maximum of these minimums: \\(\\max(1, 8) = 8\\)\n\n     - Maximum of each column: \\(\\max(1, 8) = 8\\), \\(\\max(12, 9) = 12\\)\n     - Minimum of these maximums: \\(\\min(8, 12) = 8\\)\n\n   - This grid is still \"nice.\" Let's try another adjustment:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 13 \\\\\n     9 & 10\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - Recalculate:\n     - Minimum of each row: \\(\\min(1, 13) = 1\\), \\(\\min(9, 10) = 9\\)\n     - Maximum of these minimums: \\(\\max(1, 9) = 9\\)\n\n     - Maximum of each column: \\(\\max(1, "
