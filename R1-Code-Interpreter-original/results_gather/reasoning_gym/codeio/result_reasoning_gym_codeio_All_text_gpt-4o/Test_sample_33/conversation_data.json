    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the values of `n` and `k` that would result in the given output for the keyspaces. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Keyspaces:**\n   - `keyspacenomin`: This is the keyspace when there are no restrictions on the number of cyphertext symbols per English letter. It is calculated as \\( n^k \\), where `n` is the number of distinct English letters and `k` is the number of cyphertext symbols.\n   - `keyspaceonemin`: This is the keyspace when there must be at least one cyphertext symbol per English letter. It is calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, which involves a summation over combinations.\n\n2. **Given Output:**\n   - `keyspacenomin` is 100,000.\n   - `keyspaceonemin` is 0.\n\n3. **Analyzing `keyspacenomin`:**\n   - We need to find integers `n` and `k` such that \\( n^k = 100,000 \\).\n   - Possible pairs (n, k) that satisfy this equation include:\n     - \\( 10^5 = 100,000 \\) (n=10, k=5)\n     - \\( 100^3 = 1,000,000 \\) (n=100, k=3) is not valid as it exceeds 100,000.\n     - Other combinations can be checked, but the most straightforward is \\( n=10, k=5 \\).\n\n4. **Analyzing `keyspaceonemin`:**\n   - The fact that `keyspaceonemin` is 0 suggests that the inclusion-exclusion principle results in a cancellation of terms, leading to zero.\n   - This typically happens when `k` is less than `n`, meaning there aren't enough cyphertext symbols to assign at least one to each letter.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The pair (n=10, k=5) satisfies both conditions:\n     - \\( 10^5 = 100,000 \\) for `keyspacenomin`.\n     - `keyspaceonemin` is 0 because with 5 cyphertext symbols, it's impossible to assign at least one to each of the 10 letters.\n\nTherefore, the feasible input is:\n\n```json\n<<<{\"n\": 10, \"k\": 5}>>>\n```"
