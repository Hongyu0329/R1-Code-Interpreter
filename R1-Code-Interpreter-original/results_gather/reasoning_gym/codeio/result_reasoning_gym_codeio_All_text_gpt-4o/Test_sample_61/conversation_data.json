    "To predict a feasible input for the given output, we need to reverse-engineer the process described in the code snippet. The output is a list of merged intervals, which are derived from the `pos`, `cigar`, and `md` inputs. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Output**: The output is a list of merged intervals: `[[943, 952], [954, 959], [961, 970], [972, 981]]`. This means that the original intervals, before merging, must have been overlapping or contiguous in such a way that they resulted in these merged intervals.\n\n2. **Mapping Intervals from CIGAR and MD**:\n   - The `pos` variable indicates the starting position of the alignment. Since the output intervals start at 943, `pos` should be set to \"943\".\n   - The `cigar` string describes the alignment operations. The operations 'M' (match/mismatch) and 'D' (deletion) affect the reference sequence positions. We need to construct a `cigar` string that results in intervals that, when merged, match the output.\n   - The `md` tag provides information about mismatches and deletions. It can be used to adjust the intervals derived from the `cigar` string.\n\n3. **Constructing the CIGAR String**:\n   - The intervals suggest a series of matches and possible deletions. For example, the first interval [943, 952] suggests a match of 10 bases starting at position 943.\n   - The gap between 952 and 954 suggests a deletion or a skipped region in the reference.\n   - Similarly, the other intervals can be constructed by alternating matches and deletions.\n\n4. **Constructing the MD Tag**:\n   - The `md` tag should reflect the mismatches and deletions. For simplicity, if we assume no mismatches, the `md` tag can be constructed to reflect the deletions.\n\n5. **Feasible Input Construction**:\n   - `pos`: \"943\" (since the first interval starts at 943).\n   - `cigar`: A string that reflects the matches and deletions. For example, \"10M1D5M1D10M1D10M\" could be a feasible `cigar` string, where 'M' represents matches and 'D' represents deletions.\n   - `md`: A string that reflects the matches and deletions. For example, \"10^A5^C10^G10\" could be a feasible `md` string, where '^' indicates a deletion.\n\nBy constructing the `cigar` and `md` strings in this manner, we can ensure that the intervals derived from them, when merged, match the given output.\n\nHere is the predicted feasible input:\n\n```json\n<<<\n{\n  \"pos\": \"943\",\n  \"cigar\": \"10M1D5M1D10M1D10M\",\n  \"md\": \"10^A5^C10^G10\"\n}\n>>>\n```"
