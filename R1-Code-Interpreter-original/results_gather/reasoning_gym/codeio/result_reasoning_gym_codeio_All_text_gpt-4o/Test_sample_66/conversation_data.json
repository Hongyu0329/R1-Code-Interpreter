    "To determine a feasible input for the given output, we need to analyze the OEIS A000037 series and the conditions provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding OEIS A000037 Series**:\n   - The OEIS A000037 series consists of numbers that are not perfect squares. For example, the sequence starts as 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, etc.\n\n2. **Output Analysis**:\n   - The output provided is:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"series\": [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 82, 83],\n       \"has_square\": False\n     }\n     ```\n   - The `series` list contains 74 numbers.\n   - The `has_square` is `False`, indicating none of these numbers are perfect squares.\n\n3. **Determining the Input `n`**:\n   - Since the series contains 74 numbers, the input `n` should be 74 to generate the first 74 terms of the OEIS A000037 series.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - We need to ensure that none of the numbers in the series are perfect squares. The numbers in the series are indeed non-squares, as verified by the absence of perfect squares in the list.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The input `n` that would produce the given output is 74.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe feasible input for the given output is:\n\n```json\n<<<{\"n\": 74}>>>\n```"
