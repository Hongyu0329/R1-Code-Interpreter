    "To solve the problem of scheduling feeding times in the zoo, we need to ensure that no animal is fed on the same day as its predator. This can be modeled as a graph coloring problem, where each class of animals is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if they share any animals. The goal is to determine the minimum number of colors (days) required to color the graph such that no two adjacent nodes (classes with common animals) share the same color.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: Convert the JSON serialized strings into sets of animals for each class. This will allow us to easily check for intersections between classes.\n\n2. **Graph Construction**: Create a graph where each node represents a class of animals. An edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding classes have any animals in common.\n\n3. **Graph Coloring**: Use a backtracking algorithm to attempt to color the graph with `k` colors, where `k` ranges from 1 to 5. The algorithm checks if it's possible to assign colors to the nodes such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.\n\n4. **Colorability Check**: For each node, check if it can be colored with a given color by ensuring none of its adjacent nodes have the same color.\n\n5. **Backtracking**: If a node can be colored, proceed to the next node. If not, backtrack and try a different color.\n\n6. **Determine Minimum Days**: Start with `k = 1` and increase `k` until a valid coloring is found or `k` exceeds 5. If a valid coloring is found within 5 colors, return the number of colors used. If not, return `-1`.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given input:\n\n- **Classes**:\n  - Class 1: `[\"zebra\", \"penguin\", \"monkey\", \"giraffe\", \"tiger\", \"elephant\", \"snake\", \"bear\"]`\n  - Class 2: `[\"bear\", \"kangaroo\", \"penguin\", \"monkey\"]`\n  - Class 3: `[\"giraffe\", \"penguin\", \"zebra\", \"monkey\", \"elephant\", \"bear\", \"kangaroo\"]`\n  - Class 4: `[\"elephant\"]`\n  - Class 5: `[\"snake\", \"kangaroo\", \"penguin\", \"lion\"]`\n  - Class 6: `[\"monkey\", \"tiger\", \"giraffe\", \"lion\", \"bear\", \"zebra\", \"snake\"]`\n\n- **Graph Construction**: Determine edges based on shared animals.\n\n- **Coloring**: Attempt to color the graph with 1 to 5 colors.\n\nAfter analyzing the graph, we find that it is possible to color it with 3 colors. Therefore, the minimum number of days required to schedule the feeding without conflicts is 3.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n3\n```"
