    "To solve the problem of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of integers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: Ensure that all elements in the input list are positive integers. If any element is not a positive integer, an exception should be raised.\n\n2. **Understanding GCD**: The GCD of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without leaving a remainder.\n\n3. **Factorization Approach**: The provided code snippet uses a factorization approach to find the GCD. It involves:\n   - Breaking down each number into its prime factors.\n   - Using a `Counter` to keep track of the prime factors and their powers.\n   - Finding the common factors across all numbers by intersecting their factorization results.\n   - Calculating the GCD by multiplying the common factors raised to their minimum powers.\n\n4. **Example Analysis**: Given the input `{'numbers': [13, 22]}`:\n   - **Prime Factorization**:\n     - 13 is a prime number, so its factors are {13: 1}.\n     - 22 can be factored into {2: 1, 11: 1}.\n   - **Common Factors**: There are no common prime factors between 13 and 22.\n   - **GCD Calculation**: Since there are no common factors, the GCD is 1.\n\n5. **Output Format**: The result should be returned as a dictionary with the key \"gcd\" and the value being the calculated GCD.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the output for the given input is:\n\n```json\n{\"gcd\": 1}\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<{\"gcd\": 1}>>>"
