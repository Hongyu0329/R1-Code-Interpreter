    "To solve this problem, we need to construct the Lauchli matrix and its corresponding left null vector based on the given inputs. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Lauchli Matrix Construction:**\n   - The Lauchli matrix is an `m x n` matrix where `m = n + 1`.\n   - The first row of the matrix is filled with ones.\n   - The subsequent rows have a specific pattern: the `i-th` row (where `i` ranges from 1 to `m-1`) has the scalar `alpha` at the `i-th` column and zeros elsewhere.\n\n2. **Construct the Lauchli Matrix:**\n   - Given `m = 6` and `n = 5`, the matrix will have 6 rows and 5 columns.\n   - The first row will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.\n   - The second row will have `alpha` in the first column: `[6.573232678990204, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n   - The third row will have `alpha` in the second column: `[0, 6.573232678990204, 0, 0, 0]`.\n   - The fourth row will have `alpha` in the third column: `[0, 0, 6.573232678990204, 0, 0]`.\n   - The fifth row will have `alpha` in the fourth column: `[0, 0, 0, 6.573232678990204, 0]`.\n   - The sixth row will have `alpha` in the fifth column: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6.573232678990204]`.\n\n3. **Understand the Left Null Vector Construction:**\n   - The left null vector is a vector of length `m` (6 in this case).\n   - The first element is `-alpha`.\n   - All other elements are `1`.\n\n4. **Construct the Left Null Vector:**\n   - The vector will be `[-6.573232678990204, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   - The output should be a dictionary with keys `\"matrix\"` and `\"null_vector\"`.\n   - The matrix should be a list of lists, and the null vector should be a list of floats.\n\nNow, let's put this all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"matrix\": [\n    [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0],\n    [6.573232678990204, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n    [0.0, 6.573232678990204, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n    [0.0, 0.0, 6.573232678990204, 0.0, 0.0],\n    [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 6.573232678990204, 0.0],\n    [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 6.573232678990204]\n  ],\n  \"null_vector\": [-6.573232678990204, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]\n}\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n{\n  \"matrix\": [\n    [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0],\n    [6.573232678990204, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n    [0.0, 6.573232678990204, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n    [0.0, 0.0, 6.573232678990204, 0.0, 0.0],\n    [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 6.573232678990204, 0.0],\n    [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 6.573232678990204]\n  ],\n  \"null_vector\": [-6.573232678990204, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]\n}\n>>>"
