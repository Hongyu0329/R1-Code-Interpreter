    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given wave equation and the specific query type provided in the input. The wave equation is given as:\n\n\\[ y(x, t) = A \\sin(wt + kx + \\pi/d) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amplitude,\n- \\( w \\) is the angular frequency,\n- \\( k \\) is the wave number,\n- \\( \\pi/d \\) is the initial phase.\n\nThe input provided is:\n- `amp`: 92.72325896582053 cm\n- `w`: 15.319861665440387 rad/s\n- `k`: 7.013704281390573 cm^-1\n- `div`: 4\n- `types`: 4\n\nWe need to determine the output based on the query type, which is 4 in this case. Let's analyze the requirements for each query type:\n\n1. **Query Type 1**: Determine if the wave is travelling or stationary, and if travelling, find its speed and direction of propagation.\n2. **Query Type 2**: Find the amplitude of the wave in meters.\n3. **Query Type 3**: Find the frequency of the wave in hertz.\n4. **Query Type 4**: Find the initial phase at the origin.\n5. **Query Type 5**: Find the least distance between two successive crests or troughs in the wave in meters.\n\nSince the query type is 4, we need to find the initial phase at the origin. The initial phase is given by the term \\(\\pi/d\\) in the wave equation. Given that `div` is 4, the initial phase is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Initial Phase} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\]\n\nThis is a straightforward calculation, and the initial phase is expressed in terms of \\(\\pi\\).\n\nTherefore, the output should be a dictionary with the type of answer, the value of the initial phase, and no unit is needed for this type of query.\n\nThe final output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"initial phase\",\n  \"value\": \"π/4\"\n}\n```"
