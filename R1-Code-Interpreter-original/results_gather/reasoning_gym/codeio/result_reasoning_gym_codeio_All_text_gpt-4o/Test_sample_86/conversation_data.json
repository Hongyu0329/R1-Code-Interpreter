    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the input lists `capacitors_parallel` and `capacitors_series` that would result in the given output for equivalent capacitance values in parallel and series configurations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Parallel Capacitance:**\n   - The equivalent capacitance for capacitors in parallel is simply the sum of all capacitance values.\n   - Given: `equivalent_parallel = 132.5630677469462`\n   - This means the sum of all values in `capacitors_parallel` should equal 132.5630677469462.\n\n2. **Understanding Series Capacitance:**\n   - The equivalent capacitance for capacitors in series is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{equivalent}}} = \\sum \\frac{1}{C_i}\n     \\]\n   - Given: `equivalent_series = 31.072169392295184`\n   - This means:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{31.072169392295184} = \\sum \\frac{1}{C_i}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the sum of reciprocals:\n     \\[\n     \\sum \\frac{1}{C_i} = \\frac{1}{31.072169392295184} \\approx 0.032176\n     \\]\n\n3. **Feasible Inputs:**\n   - For `capacitors_parallel`, we need a list of non-negative floats that sum to 132.5630677469462. A simple choice could be a list with one element equal to 132.5630677469462.\n   - For `capacitors_series`, we need a list of positive floats whose reciprocals sum to approximately 0.032176. A simple choice could be a list with one element equal to 31.072169392295184, as its reciprocal would exactly match the required sum.\n\n4. **Constructing the Input:**\n   - `capacitors_parallel = [132.5630677469462]`\n   - `capacitors_series = [31.072169392295184]`\n\nThese choices satisfy the conditions for both parallel and series configurations, leading to the given output.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n<<<\n{\n    \"capacitors_parallel\": [132.5630677469462],\n    \"capacitors_series\": [31.072169392295184]\n}\n>>>\n```"
