    "To predict a feasible input that results in the output [1991, 1991], we need to analyze the problem and the provided code snippet step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine the period during which the maximum number of authors were active simultaneously. If there are multiple periods with the same number of active authors, we choose the earliest period.\n\n2. **Code Analysis**:\n   - The function `most_active` calculates the number of active authors for each year by iterating over the range from the start year to the end year (inclusive) for each author.\n   - It uses a dictionary `active_counts` to keep track of the number of authors active in each year.\n   - It finds the maximum count of active authors and identifies all years with this maximum count.\n   - It then determines the earliest and latest years from these years with the maximum count.\n\n3. **Output Analysis**: The output [1991, 1991] indicates that the year 1991 had the highest number of authors active simultaneously, and no other year had the same number of active authors.\n\n4. **Constructing the Input**:\n   - To achieve the output [1991, 1991], we need to ensure that 1991 is the year with the highest number of active authors.\n   - We can construct a list of authors such that the year 1991 falls within their active periods.\n   - We must ensure that no other year has more authors active than in 1991.\n\n5. **Feasible Input Construction**:\n   - Let's assume we have three authors active in 1991, and no other year has more than three authors active.\n   - We can construct the input as follows:\n     - Author A: Active from 1990 to 1991\n     - Author B: Active from 1991 to 1992\n     - Author C: Active from 1991 to 1991\n\nThis setup ensures that 1991 is the year with the maximum number of active authors, which is three, and no other year has more than three authors active.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing the feasible input:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bio_data\": [\n    [\"Author A\", 1990, 1991],\n    [\"Author B\", 1991, 1992],\n    [\"Author C\", 1991, 1991]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThus, the feasible input is:\n\n<<<\n{\n  \"bio_data\": [\n    [\"Author A\", 1990, 1991],\n    [\"Author B\", 1991, 1992],\n    [\"Author C\", 1991, 1991]\n  ]\n}\n>>>"
