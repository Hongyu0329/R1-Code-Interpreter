    "To predict a feasible input that results in the given output, we need to reverse-engineer the process described in the problem statement and the reference code snippet. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Output**: The output is a list of integers that represents a linked list after reversing nodes in groups of a specified size. The given output is:\n   ```\n   {'reversed_linked_list': [8, 61, 68, 72, 3, 47, 64, 25, 9, 34, 37, 84, 95, 58, 56, 36, 60, 96, 29, 89]}\n   ```\n\n2. **Identifying the Group Size**: The task involves reversing nodes in groups of a certain size. We need to determine this `group_size` by examining the pattern in the output list. The list appears to be divided into groups of 4 elements each:\n   - [8, 61, 68, 72]\n   - [3, 47, 64, 25]\n   - [9, 34, 37, 84]\n   - [95, 58, 56, 36]\n   - [60, 96, 29, 89]\n\n   Each of these groups is reversed in the output, suggesting a `group_size` of 4.\n\n3. **Reversing the Process**: To find the original list of integers (`ints`), we need to reverse the process for each group:\n   - Reverse [8, 61, 68, 72] to get [72, 68, 61, 8]\n   - Reverse [3, 47, 64, 25] to get [25, 64, 47, 3]\n   - Reverse [9, 34, 37, 84] to get [84, 37, 34, 9]\n   - Reverse [95, 58, 56, 36] to get [36, 56, 58, 95]\n   - Reverse [60, 96, 29, 89] to get [89, 29, 96, 60]\n\n4. **Constructing the Original List**: Concatenate these reversed groups to form the original list:\n   ```\n   [72, 68, 61, 8, 25, 64, 47, 3, 84, 37, 34, 9, 36, 56, 58, 95, 89, 29, 96, 60]\n   ```\n\n5. **Formulating the Input**: The input should be a JSON object with the keys `ints` and `group_size`. Based on our analysis, the `ints` list is the one we constructed, and the `group_size` is 4.\n\nThe feasible input that would produce the given output is:\n\n```json\n<<<\n{\n    \"ints\": [72, 68, 61, 8, 25, 64, 47, 3, 84, 37, 34, 9, 36, 56, 58, 95, 89, 29, 96, 60],\n    \"group_size\": 4\n}\n>>>\n```"
