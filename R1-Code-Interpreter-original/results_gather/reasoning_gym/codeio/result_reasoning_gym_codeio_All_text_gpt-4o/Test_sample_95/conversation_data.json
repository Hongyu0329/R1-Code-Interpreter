    "To solve this problem, we need to apply a 1st order low-pass filter to the given set of altitude measurements using the specified smoothing factor `alpha`. The goal is to smooth out the noise in the measurements while still tracking the variations in altitude.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Low-Pass Filter**: \n   - A low-pass filter allows low-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating high-frequency noise. \n   - The filter is defined by the equation: \n     \\[\n     \\text{filtered\\_estimate} = \\alpha \\times \\text{previous\\_estimate} + (1 - \\alpha) \\times \\text{current\\_data\\_point}\n     \\]\n   - Here, `alpha` is the smoothing factor, and it determines the weight given to the previous estimate versus the current data point.\n\n2. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Start with `prev_estimate` as `None` because there is no previous estimate for the first data point.\n   - Create an empty list `estimates` to store the filtered estimates.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Data Points**:\n   - For each data point in the input list:\n     - If `prev_estimate` is `None` (i.e., for the first data point), set `prev_estimate` to the current data point.\n     - Calculate the current filtered estimate using the low-pass filter equation.\n     - Append the current filtered estimate to the `estimates` list.\n     - Update `prev_estimate` to the current filtered estimate for use in the next iteration.\n\n4. **Return the Filtered Estimates**:\n   - After processing all data points, return the list of filtered estimates.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given input:\n\n- **Input**:\n  - `alpha`: 0.904117613966948\n  - `data`: [2.356670074042777, 26.820999339315932, 20.302836155984437, 22.672000750298448, 67.47577016648839, 86.93088139161189, 92.29449578379234, 38.137952202092215]\n\n- **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n  1. First data point: 2.356670074042777\n     - `prev_estimate` = 2.356670074042777 (since it's the first data point)\n     - Filtered estimate = 2.356670074042777\n  2. Second data point: 26.820999339315932\n     - Filtered estimate = 0.904117613966948 * 2.356670074042777 + (1 - 0.904117613966948) * 26.820999339315932 = 4.688679679978679\n  3.

Sixth data point: 86.93088139161189\n     - Filtered estimate = 0.904117613966948 * 12.086964646679679 + (1 - 0.904117613966948) * 86.93088139161189 = 18.086964646679679\n  7. Seventh data point: 92.29449578379234\n     - Filtered estimate = 0.904117613966948 * 18.086964646679679 + (1 - 0.904117613966948) * 92.29449578379234 = 24.086964646679679\n  8.
