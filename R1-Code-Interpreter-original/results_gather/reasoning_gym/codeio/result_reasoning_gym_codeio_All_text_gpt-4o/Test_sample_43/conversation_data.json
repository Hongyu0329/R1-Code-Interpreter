    "To solve the problem of generating the sequence of Demlo numbers for a given number of rows `n`, we need to understand the pattern of Demlo numbers and how they are calculated.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding Demlo Numbers:**\n   - Demlo numbers are a sequence of numbers that can be generated using a specific formula.\n   - For a given integer `i`, the Demlo number is calculated as \\(((10^i) // 9)^2\\).\n\n2. **Input Constraints:**\n   - The input `n` is an integer between 1 and 9, inclusive. This means we will generate Demlo numbers for rows 1 through `n`.\n\n3. **Output Requirements:**\n   - The output should be a list of integers, where each integer is the Demlo number for the corresponding row from 1 to `n`.\n\n4. **Calculation of Demlo Numbers:**\n   - For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, calculate the Demlo number using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Demlo number} = \\left(\\frac{10^i}{9}\\right)^2\n     \\]\n   - This formula works because \\(\\frac{10^i}{9}\\) generates a number consisting of `i` repeated digits of 1. Squaring this number gives the Demlo number.\n\n5. **Example Calculation:**\n   - For `n = 7`, calculate the Demlo numbers for each row from 1 to 7:\n     - Row 1: \\(((10^1) // 9)^2 = 1^2 = 1\\)\n     - Row 2: \\(((10^2) // 9)^2 = 11^2 = 121\\)\n     - Row 3: \\(((10^3) // 9)^2 = 111^2 = 12321\\)\n     - Row 4: \\(((10^4) // 9)^2 = 1111^2 = 1234321\\)\n     - Row 5: \\(((10^5) // 9)^2 = 11111^2 = 123454321\\)\n     - Row 6: \\(((10^6) // 9)^2 = 111111^2 = 12345654321\\)\n     - Row 7: \\(((10^7) // 9)^2 = 1111111^2 = 1234567654321\\)\n\n6. **Final Output:**\n   - The output should be a list of these calculated Demlo numbers.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the output for the input `{'n': 7}` is:\n\n```json\n<<<{\"return\": [1, 121, 12321, 1234321, 123454321, 12345654321, 1234567654321]}>>>\n```"
