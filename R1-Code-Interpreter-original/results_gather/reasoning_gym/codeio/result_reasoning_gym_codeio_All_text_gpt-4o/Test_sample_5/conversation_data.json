    "To solve this problem, we need to apply a greedy knapsack algorithm to maximize the profit without exceeding the maximum weight capacity. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Validation**:\n   - Check if `max_weight` is less than or equal to zero. If so, raise a `ValueError`.\n   - Check if the lengths of `profit` and `weight` lists are unequal. If so, raise an `IndexError`.\n   - Check if there are any negative values in the `profit` list. If so, raise a `ValueError`.\n   - Check if there are any negative values in the `weight` list. If so, raise a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Greedy Knapsack Algorithm**:\n   - Pair each item's profit with its weight using the `zip` function, creating a list of tuples.\n   - Sort these tuples based on the profit-to-weight ratio in descending order. This ensures that we consider items with the highest profit per unit weight first.\n   - Initialize `total_profit` to 0 and `remaining_weight` to `max_weight`.\n   - Iterate over the sorted list of items:\n     - If the `remaining_weight` is greater than or equal to the item's weight, add the full profit of the item to `total_profit` and subtract the item's weight from `remaining_weight`.\n     - If the `remaining_weight` is less than the item's weight, add the fractional profit corresponding to the `remaining_weight` and break the loop.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - Return the `total_profit` as a dictionary with the key `\"total_profit\"`.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given input:\n\n- **Input**: `profit = [12, 80, 86, 96, 82, 66, 5, 81, 48]`, `weight = [57, 68, 14, 88, 59, 77, 37, 49, 95]`, `max_weight = 158`.\n\n- **Validation**: All inputs are valid as per the conditions mentioned.\n\n- **Sorting by Profit-to-Weight Ratio**:\n  - Calculate the profit-to-weight ratio for each item:\n    - Item 1: 12/57 ≈ 0.2105\n    - Item 2: 80/68 ≈ 1.1765\n    - Item 3: 86/14 ≈ 6.1429\n    - Item 4: 96/88 ≈ 1.0909\n    - Item 5: 82/59 ≈ 1.3898\n    - Item 6: 66/77 ≈ 0.8571\n    - Item 7: 5/37 ≈ 0.1351\n    - Item 8: 81/49 ≈ 1.6531\n    - Item 9: 48/95 ≈ 0.5053\n  - Sorted order based on ratio: Item 3, Item 8, Item 5, Item 2, Item 4, Item 6, Item 9, Item 1, Item 7.\n\n- **Greedy Selection**:\n  - Start with `total_profit = 0` and `remaining_weight = 158`.\n  - Select Item 3: Add full profit 86, remaining weight = 158 - 14 = 144.\n  - Select Item 8: Add full profit 81, remaining weight = 144 - 49 = 95.\n  - Select Item 5: Add full profit 82, remaining weight = 95 - 59 = 36.\n  - Select Item 2: Add partial profit (80/68) * 36 ≈ 42.3529, remaining weight = 0.\n\n- **Total Profit Calculation**:\n  - Total profit = 86 + 81 + 82 + 42.3529 = 291.3529.\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n\n```json\n{\"total_profit\": 291.3529}\n```\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n<<<{\"total_profit\": 291.3529}>>>"
