    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of calculating the `max_n`-th convergent of the continued fraction for the mathematical constant `e` and then find the sum of the digits in the numerator of that convergent.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding Continued Fractions for `e`:**\n   - The continued fraction for `e` is represented as [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, ...].\n   - The pattern is: 2, 1, 2k, 1, 1, 2k, 1, 1, 2k, ..., where k starts from 1.\n\n2. **Convergent Calculation:**\n   - The `n`-th convergent of a continued fraction is a fraction that approximates the value of the continued fraction up to the `n`-th term.\n   - The numerators of these convergents can be calculated iteratively using the formula:\n     - `cur_numerator = e_cont * pre_numerator + temp`\n   - Here, `e_cont` is the current term in the continued fraction sequence, `pre_numerator` is the numerator of the previous convergent, and `temp` is a temporary variable to hold the previous numerator value.\n\n3. **Iterative Calculation:**\n   - Start with `pre_numerator = 1` and `cur_numerator = 2` (the first convergent for `e`).\n   - For each `i` from 2 to `max_n`, calculate the next numerator using the formula above.\n   - Determine `e_cont` based on the position `i` in the sequence:\n     - If `i % 3 == 0`, then `e_cont = 2 * (i // 3)`.\n     - Otherwise, `e_cont = 1`.\n\n4. **Digit Sum Calculation:**\n   - Once the numerator for the `max_n`-th convergent is calculated, compute the sum of its digits.\n   - This involves repeatedly taking the last digit of the number (using modulus 10), adding it to a sum, and then removing the last digit (using integer division by 10).\n\n5. **Output:**\n   - The result is a dictionary with the key `\"digit_sum\"` and the value being the sum of the digits of the numerator.\n\n### Predicting the Input:\n\nGiven the output `{'digit_sum': 346}`, we need to determine the `max_n` that results in this digit sum. The reference code snippet suggests that the default `max_n` is 100, which is a strong indication that this is the input used to produce the given output.\n\nTherefore, the feasible input that results in the output `{'digit_sum': 346}` is:\n\n```json\n<<<{\"max_n\": 100}>>>\n```"
