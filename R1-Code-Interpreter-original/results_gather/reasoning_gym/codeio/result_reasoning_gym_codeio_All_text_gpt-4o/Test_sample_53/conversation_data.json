    "To determine a feasible input for the given output, we need to reverse-engineer the process of prime factorization. The output provided is a list of tuples representing prime factors and their respective exponents: `[('2', 4), ('3', 2), ('5', 1)]`. This means the number is composed of the prime factors 2, 3, and 5 raised to the powers of 4, 2, and 1, respectively.\n\nLet's break down the steps to find the input number:\n\n1. **Understand the Output Format**: The output is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a prime factor as a string and its exponent as an integer. For example, `('2', 4)` means the prime factor 2 is raised to the power of 4.\n\n2. **Reconstruct the Number**: To find the original number, we need to multiply the prime factors raised to their respective exponents:\n   - \\(2^4 = 16\\)\n   - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n   - \\(5^1 = 5\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the Product**: Multiply these results together to get the original number:\n   - \\(16 \\times 9 = 144\\)\n   - \\(144 \\times 5 = 720\\)\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**: Ensure that the calculated number, 720, when factorized, results in the given output:\n   - Prime factorization of 720 is \\(2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\\), which matches the output.\n\n5. **Format the Input**: The input should be a JSON object with the key `number` and the value as the integer we calculated.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine that the feasible input for the given output is the number 720.\n\nThe final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n<<<{\"number\": 720}>>>\n```"
