    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the fractional Stokes Q/I and the Electric Vector Position Angle (EVPA) using the GKK method for the given angles in radians. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Understanding**:\n   - We have `theta` as a list of angles: `[1.5110653204394262, 5.168270952748489]`.\n   - The `units` are specified as 'radians'.\n\n2. **Conversion**:\n   - Since the angles are already in radians, no conversion is needed.\n\n3. **GKK Method Calculation**:\n   - The GKK method involves calculating two values: `gkk_fracq` and `gkk_evpa`.\n   - A constant `at2` is calculated as `atan(1.0 / sqrt(2.0))`.\n\n4. **Piecewise Calculation**:\n   - For each angle in `theta`, we determine if it is less than or equal to `at2` or greater than `at2`.\n   - If `theta <= at2`, `gkk_fracq` is set to `-1.0`.\n   - If `theta > at2`, `gkk_fracq` is calculated using the formula: \n     \\[\n     gkk\\_fracq = \\frac{3.0 \\times (\\sin(\\theta))^2 - 2.0}{3.0 \\times (\\sin(\\theta))^2}\n     \\]\n   - `gkk_evpa` is calculated as `0.5 * atan2(0.0, gkk_fracq)`. Since `atan2(0.0, gkk_fracq)` is essentially `0` for any non-zero `gkk_fracq`, `gkk_evpa` will be `0.0`.\n\n5. **Calculation for Each Angle**:\n   - For `theta = 1.5110653204394262`:\n     - `at2 ≈ 0.6154797086703873`, and `1.5110653204394262 > at2`.\n     - Calculate `gkk_fracq`:\n       \\[\n       gkk\\_fracq = \\frac{3.0 \\times (\\sin(1.5110653204394262))^2 - 2.0}{3.0 \\times (\\sin(1.5110653204394262))^2} \\approx 0.3333333333333333\n       \\]\n     - `gkk_evpa = 0.0`.\n\n   - For `theta = 5.168270952748489`:\n     - `5.168270952748489 > at2`.\n     - Calculate `gkk_fracq`:\n       \\[\n       gkk\\_fracq = \\frac{3.0 \\times (\\sin(5.168270952748489))^2 - 2.0}{3.0 \\times (\\sin(5.168270952748489))^2} \\approx -0.3333333333333333\n       \\]\n     - `gkk_evpa = 0.0`.\n\n6. **Output**:\n   - The results are compiled into a dictionary with keys `gkk_fracq` and `gkk_evpa`, each containing a list of calculated values for the input angles.\n\nThe final output in JSON format is:\n\n```json\n<<<{\"gkk_fracq\": [0.3333333333333333, -0.3333333333333333], \"gkk_evpa\": [0.0, 0.0]}>>>\n```"
