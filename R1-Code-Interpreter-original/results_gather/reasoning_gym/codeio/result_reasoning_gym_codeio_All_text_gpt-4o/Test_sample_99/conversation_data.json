    "To solve this problem, we need to categorize each number in the list based on its deviation from the mean in terms of standard deviation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Mean:**\n   - Sum all the numbers in the list.\n   - Divide the sum by the number of elements in the list to get the mean.\n\n2. **Calculate the Variance:**\n   - For each number, subtract the mean and square the result.\n   - Sum all these squared differences.\n   - Divide the sum by the number of elements to get the variance.\n\n3. **Calculate the Standard Deviation:**\n   - Take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation.\n\n4. **Categorize the Numbers:**\n   - **Normal Numbers:** Numbers that are within one standard deviation from the mean. This means the absolute difference between the number and the mean is less than or equal to the standard deviation.\n   - **Extra Big Numbers:** Numbers that are greater than one standard deviation above the mean. This means the number minus the mean is greater than the standard deviation.\n   - **Extra Small Numbers:** Numbers that are more than one standard deviation below the mean. This means the number minus the mean is less than the negative of the standard deviation.\n\n5. **Return the Results:**\n   - Create a dictionary with three keys: `normal_numbers`, `extra_big_numbers`, and `extra_small_numbers`.\n   - Assign the corresponding lists of numbers to each key.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given input:\n\n- **Input List:** `[53.97366361021801, -82.48259366616612, -42.6352232441785, -21.905306310778542, 79.13526911018428, -30.381397060980447, 18.76947427602687, -79.93390603373491, -65.62567469157383, 39.833959476415316, 10.605488245064024, 44.07593751845124, -11.651070449344815, -2.1992433840271985, -59.903347571813214, -55.31982102377802]`\n\n- **Mean Calculation:**\n  - Sum: `-140.0384005504713`\n  - Number of elements: `16`\n  - Mean: `-140.0384005504713 / 16 = -8.752400034404457`\n\n- **Variance Calculation:**\n  - Calculate squared differences from the mean, sum them, and divide by the number of elements.\n  - Variance: `2500.678086276206`\n\n- **Standard Deviation Calculation:**\n  - Standard Deviation: `sqrt(2500.678086276206) = 50.00678086276206`\n\n- **Categorization:**\n  - **Normal Numbers:** Numbers where `abs(x - mean) <= standard deviation`\n  - **Extra Big Numbers:** Numbers where `x - mean > standard deviation`\n  - **Extra Small Numbers:** Numbers where `x - mean < -standard deviation`\n\n- **Result:**\n  - `normal_numbers`: `[53.97366361021801, -42.6352232441785, -21.905306310778542, 18.76947427602687, 39.833959476415316, 10.605488245064024, 44.07593751845124, -11.651070449344815, -2.1992433840271985]`\n  - `extra_big_numbers`: `[79.13526911018428]`\n  - `extra_small_numbers`: `[-82.48259366616612, -79.93390603373491, -65.62567469157383, -59.903347571813214, -55.31982102377802, -30.381397060980447]`\n\nThe final output in JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"normal_numbers\": [53.97366361021801, -42.6352232441785, -21.905306310778542, 18.76947427602687, 39.833959476415316, 10.605488245064024, 44.07593751845124, -11.651070449344815, -2.1992433840271985],\n  \"extra_big_numbers\": [79.13526911018428],\n  \"extra_small_numbers\": [-82.48259366616612, -79.93390603373491, -65.62567469157383, -59.903347571813214, -55.31982102377802, -30.381397060980447]\n}\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n{\n  \"normal_numbers\": [53.97366361021801, -42.6352232441785, -21.905306310778542, 18.76947427602687, 39.833959476415316, 10.605488245064024, 44.07593751845124, -11.651070449344815, -2.1992433840271985],\n  \"extra_big_numbers\": [79.13526911018428],\n  \"extra_small_numbers\": [-82.48259366616612, -79.93390603373491, -65.62567469157383, -59.903347571813214, -55.31982102377802, -30.381397060980447]\n}\n>>>"
