    "To solve this problem, we need to determine which Sue from the list best matches a predefined set of criteria. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Criteria**: The criteria for matching are defined in `SUE_DATA`. Each field has a specific condition:\n   - `children`: must be exactly 3.\n   - `cats`: must be greater than 7.\n   - `samoyeds`: must be exactly 2.\n   - `pomeranians`: must be less than 3.\n   - `akitas`: must be exactly 0.\n   - `vizslas`: must be exactly 0.\n   - `goldfish`: must be less than 5.\n   - `trees`: must be greater than 3.\n   - `cars`: must be exactly 2.\n   - `perfumes`: must be exactly 1.\n\n2. **Parse the Input**: Each string in `raw_data` describes a Sue with a number and several attributes. We need to extract these details and convert them into a structured format, such as a named tuple.\n\n3. **Calculate Matching Score**: For each Sue, calculate how many of their attributes match the criteria. This involves:\n   - Iterating over each field in the criteria.\n   - Checking if the Sue has a value for that field.\n   - If they do, checking if the value satisfies the condition in `SUE_DATA`.\n   - Counting the number of fields that match.\n\n4. **Determine the Best Match**: The Sue with the highest number of matching fields is the best match. If there is a tie, the first Sue in the list with the highest score is chosen.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Output the number of the Sue that best matches the criteria.\n\nNow, let's apply this logic to the given input:\n\n- **Sue 1**: Matches `vizslas`, `samoyeds`, `trees`, `children`, `goldfish`, `cars`, `perfumes` (7 matches).\n- **Sue 2**: Matches `vizslas`, `samoyeds`, `akitas` (3 matches).\n- **Sue 3**: Matches `samoyeds`, `children` (2 matches).\n- **Sue 4**: Matches `vizslas`, `goldfish`, `perfumes` (3 matches).\n- **Sue 5**: Matches `cats`, `perfumes` (2 matches).\n- **Sue 6**: Matches `cats`, `akitas` (2 matches).\n- **Sue 7**: Matches `cats`, `children` (2 matches).\n- **Sue 8**: Matches `akitas` (1 match).\n- **Sue 9**: Matches `perfumes`, `children`, `vizslas`, `akitas` (4 matches).\n\nSue 1 has the highest number of matches (7), so Sue 1 is the best match.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"return\": 1}\n```"
