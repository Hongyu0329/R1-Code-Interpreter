    "To solve the problem of finding the maximum value in a list of numbers using an iterative approach, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check for Empty List**: \n   - The first step is to check if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, a `ValueError` should be raised. This is important to handle edge cases where no numbers are provided.\n\n2. **Initialize Maximum Value**:\n   - If the list is not empty, initialize a variable `max_num` with the first element of the list. This will serve as the starting point for comparison.\n\n3. **Iterate Through the List**:\n   - Loop through each element `x` in the list `nums`.\n   - For each element, compare it with the current `max_num`.\n   - If `x` is greater than `max_num`, update `max_num` to be `x`. This ensures that `max_num` always holds the largest value encountered so far.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - After completing the iteration through the list, the `max_num` will hold the maximum value found in the list.\n   - Return a dictionary with the key `\"max_value\"` and the value as `max_num`.\n\nGiven the input `{'nums': [-94, 89, -30, -38]}`, let's apply these steps:\n\n- The list is not empty, so we proceed.\n- Initialize `max_num` with the first element: `max_num = -94`.\n- Iterate through the list:\n  - Compare `89` with `max_num (-94)`: `89` is greater, so update `max_num` to `89`.\n  - Compare `-30` with `max_num (89)`: `-30` is not greater, so `max_num` remains `89`.\n  - Compare `-38` with `max_num (89)`: `-38` is not greater, so `max_num` remains `89`.\n- The iteration is complete, and the maximum value found is `89`.\n\nTherefore, the output should be a dictionary with the key `\"max_value\"` and the value `89`.\n\nThe final output in JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"max_value\": 89}\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<{\"max_value\": 89}>>>"
