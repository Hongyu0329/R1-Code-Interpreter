    "To determine a feasible input that results in the output \"not nice,\" we need to analyze the conditions under which a grid is considered \"nice\" and then construct a grid that does not meet these conditions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the \"Nice\" Condition:**\n   - A grid is \"nice\" if the maximum value among the minimum values of each row is equal to the minimum value among the maximum values of each column.\n   - Let's break this down:\n     - For each row, find the minimum value. This gives us a list of minimum values, one for each row.\n     - Find the maximum value from this list of row minimums.\n     - For each column, find the maximum value. This gives us a list of maximum values, one for each column.\n     - Find the minimum value from this list of column maximums.\n   - The grid is \"nice\" if the maximum of the row minimums equals the minimum of the column maximums.\n\n2. **Constructing a \"Not Nice\" Grid:**\n   - To make the grid \"not nice,\" we need to ensure that the maximum of the row minimums is not equal to the minimum of the column maximums.\n   - This can be achieved by carefully selecting values such that these two calculated values differ.\n\n3. **Example Construction:**\n   - Consider a 2x2 grid for simplicity:\n     ```\n     1 3\n     2 4\n     ```\n   - Calculate the minimum of each row:\n     - Row 1: min(1, 3) = 1\n     - Row 2: min(2, 4) = 2\n   - Maximum of row minimums: max(1, 2) = 2\n   - Calculate the maximum of each column:\n     - Column 1: max(1, 2) = 2\n     - Column 2: max(3, 4) = 4\n   - Minimum of column maximums: min(2, 4) = 2\n   - In this case, the maximum of row minimums (2) equals the minimum of column maximums (2), so this grid is \"nice.\"\n\n4. **Adjusting to \"Not Nice\":**\n   - Modify the grid to ensure the values differ:\n     ```\n     1 5\n     2 4\n     ```\n   - Recalculate:\n     - Row minimums: 1, 2\n     - Maximum of row minimums: 2\n     - Column maximums: 2, 5\n     - Minimum of column maximums: 2\n   - This grid is still \"nice.\" Let's try another adjustment:\n     ```\n     1 5\n     3 4\n     ```\n   - Recalculate:\n     - Row minimums: 1, 3\n     - Maximum of row minimums: 3\n     - Column maximums: 3, 5\n     - Minimum of column maximums: 3\n   - This grid is still \"nice.\" Let's try another adjustment:\n     ```\n     1 5\n     3 2\n     ```\n   - Recalculate:\n     - Row minimums: 1, 2\n     - Maximum of row minimums: 2\n     - Column maximums: 3, 5\n     - Minimum of column maximums: 3\n   - Now, the maximum of row minimums (2) is not equal to the minimum of column maximums (3), so this grid is \"not nice.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe feasible input that results in the output \"not nice\" is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"n\": 2,\n  \"mat\": [\n    [\"1\", \"5\"],\n    [\"3\", \"2\"]\n  ]\n}\n```"
