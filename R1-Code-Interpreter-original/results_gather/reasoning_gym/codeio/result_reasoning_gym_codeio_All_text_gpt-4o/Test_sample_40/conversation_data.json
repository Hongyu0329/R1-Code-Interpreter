    "To solve the problem of sorting the pebbles in the order of red, white, and blue, we can use the Dutch National Flag algorithm. This algorithm efficiently sorts an array with three distinct values using a single pass and a constant amount of extra space. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - We have three pointers: `red`, `white`, and `blue`.\n   - `red` starts at the beginning of the array and represents the boundary for red pebbles.\n   - `white` is the current index being evaluated.\n   - `blue` starts at the end of the array and represents the boundary for blue pebbles.\n\n2. **Iterate through the array**:\n   - While `white` is less than `blue`, evaluate the color of the pebble at the `white` index.\n   - If the pebble is red ('r'):\n     - Swap it with the pebble at the `red` index.\n     - Increment both `red` and `white` pointers.\n   - If the pebble is white ('w'):\n     - Simply move the `white` pointer forward.\n   - If the pebble is blue ('b'):\n     - Swap it with the pebble at the `blue` index.\n     - Decrement the `blue` pointer.\n\n3. **Termination**:\n   - The loop terminates when `white` meets `blue`, ensuring all pebbles are sorted in the order of red, white, and blue.\n\nGiven the input array:\n```python\n{'arr': ['b', 'r', 'w', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'w', 'w', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'r', 'b', 'b', 'w', 'r', 'w', 'r', 'b']}\n```\n\nFollowing the algorithm, the sorted array will be:\n- All 'r' pebbles at the beginning.\n- Followed by all 'w' pebbles.\n- Ending with all 'b' pebbles.\n\nThe final sorted array is:\n```python\n['r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'w', 'w', 'w', 'w', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b']\n```\n\nThus, the output in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n<<<{\"return\": [\"r\", \"r\", \"r\", \"r\", \"w\", \"w\", \"w\", \"w\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\"]}>>>\n```"
