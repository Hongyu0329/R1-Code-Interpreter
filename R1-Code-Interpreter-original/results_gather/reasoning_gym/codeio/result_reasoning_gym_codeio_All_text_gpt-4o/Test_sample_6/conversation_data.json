    "To solve the problem of finding the maximum value in a list of numbers using an iterative approach, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: \n   - Check if the list `nums` is empty. If it is, raise a `ValueError` because there are no elements to compare.\n\n2. **Initialization**:\n   - Assume the first element of the list is the maximum value. This is a common approach when iterating through a list to find a maximum or minimum value.\n\n3. **Iterative Comparison**:\n   - Iterate through each element in the list.\n   - For each element, compare it with the current maximum value.\n   - If the current element is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum value to the current element.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - After completing the iteration, the maximum value found in the list is returned in a dictionary with the key `\"max_value\"`.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given input:\n\nInput: `{'nums': [9, 93, 85, -74, -84, -7, 78, 18, -5, -89, 55, 70, -57, 51]}`\n\n- The list is not empty, so we proceed.\n- Initialize `max_num` to the first element: `max_num = 9`.\n- Iterate through the list and update `max_num` whenever a larger number is found:\n  - Compare 9 with 93: update `max_num` to 93.\n  - Compare 93 with 85: no change.\n  - Compare 93 with -74: no change.\n  - Compare 93 with -84: no change.\n  - Compare 93 with -7: no change.\n  - Compare 93 with 78: no change.\n  - Compare 93 with 18: no change.\n  - Compare 93 with -5: no change.\n  - Compare 93 with -89: no change.\n  - Compare 93 with 55: no change.\n  - Compare 93 with 70: no change.\n  - Compare 93 with -57: no change.\n  - Compare 93 with 51: no change.\n\n- After iterating through the entire list, the maximum value found is 93.\n\nTherefore, the output should be a dictionary with the key `\"max_value\"` and the value 93.\n\nThe final output is:\n\n<<<{\"max_value\": 93}>>>"
