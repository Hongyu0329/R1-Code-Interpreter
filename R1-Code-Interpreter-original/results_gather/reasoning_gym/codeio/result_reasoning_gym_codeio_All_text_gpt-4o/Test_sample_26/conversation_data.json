    "To solve this problem, we need to add two tonal values, one with an octave designation and another without, and determine the resulting tonal value. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Analysis**:\n   - We have two inputs:\n     - `x = [-50, -48, 89]`: This is the first tonal value with a diatonic value of -50, a chromatic value of -48, and an octave designation of 89.\n     - `y = [64, -49]`: This is the second tonal value with a diatonic value of 64 and a chromatic value of -49.\n\n2. **Addition of Tonal Values**:\n   - We need to add the corresponding components of `x` and `y`.\n   - Diatonic values: `-50 + 64 = 14`\n   - Chromatic values: `-48 + (-49) = -97`\n   - Octave designation remains the same as in `x` since `y` does not have an octave component.\n\n3. **Normalization**:\n   - **Diatonic Normalization**:\n     - The diatonic value is normalized using a modulus operation with `D_LEN = 7`.\n     - `d_val = 14 % 7 = 0`\n     - Calculate the additional octave from the diatonic value: `d_oct = 14 // 7 = 2`\n   - **Chromatic Normalization**:\n     - The chromatic value is normalized using a modulus operation with `C_LEN = 12`.\n     - `c_val = -97 % 12 = 7` (since -97 divided by 12 gives a remainder of 7 when considering the positive modulus)\n\n4. **Final Octave Calculation**:\n   - The final octave is calculated by adding the original octave from `x` and the additional octave from the diatonic normalization.\n   - `o = 89 + 2 = 91`\n\n5. **Result**:\n   - The resulting tonal value is `[d_val, c_val, o] = [0, 7, 91]`.\n\nTherefore, the final output in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n<<<{\"return\": [0, 7, 91]}>>>\n```"
