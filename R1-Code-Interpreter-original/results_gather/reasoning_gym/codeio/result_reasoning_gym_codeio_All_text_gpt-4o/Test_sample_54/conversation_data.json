    "To determine the feasible input for the given output, we need to analyze the characteristics of the roots and weights of Legendre polynomials used in Gaussian quadrature.\n\n1. **Understanding Gaussian Quadrature**: Gaussian quadrature is a numerical integration method that approximates the integral of a function using a weighted sum of function values at specified points (roots). The roots are the zeros of the Legendre polynomial of degree `n`.\n\n2. **Properties of Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - A Legendre polynomial of degree `n` has `n` roots.\n   - The roots are symmetric about the origin, meaning if `x` is a root, `-x` is also a root.\n   - For Gaussian quadrature, we only consider the non-negative roots due to symmetry.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Output**:\n   - The given output contains 9 non-negative roots and 9 corresponding weights.\n   - This suggests that the Legendre polynomial degree `n` is likely 18, as the polynomial of degree 18 would have 18 roots in total, 9 of which are non-negative.\n\n4. **Reasoning**:\n   - If `n = 18`, the Legendre polynomial will have 18 roots, and due to symmetry, 9 of these will be non-negative.\n   - The weights are calculated based on these roots and are used in the Gaussian quadrature formula.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the number of non-negative roots and weights, the most feasible input for the degree of the Legendre polynomial is `n = 18`.\n\nTherefore, the feasible input for the given output is:\n\n```json\n<<<{\"n\": 18}>>>\n```"
