    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the z-scores for the total service time of 50 customers when the total service time is between 90.17244564075081 and 103.12187270811205 minutes. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have a bank teller serving customers, and each customer's service time is a random variable with a mean of 2 minutes and a standard deviation of 1 minute.\n   - The service times are independent, and we are interested in the total service time for 50 customers.\n\n2. **Calculate the Mean and Standard Deviation for the Total Service Time:**\n   - The mean total service time for 50 customers is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Mean total service time} = \\text{mean} \\times n = 2.0 \\times 50 = 100 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - The standard deviation of the total service time is calculated using the formula for the standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Standard deviation of total service time} = \\text{standard deviation} \\times \\sqrt{n} = 1.0 \\times \\sqrt{50} \\approx 7.071\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Z-scores:**\n   - The z-score is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     z = \\frac{x - \\text{mean total service time}}{\\text{standard deviation of total service time}}\n     \\]\n   - For the lower bound \\(x1 = 90.17244564075081\\):\n     \\[\n     z_1 = \\frac{90.17244564075081 - 100}{7.071} \\approx -1.391\n     \\]\n   - For the upper bound \\(x2 = 103.12187270811205\\):\n     \\[\n     z_2 = \\frac{103.12187270811205 - 100}{7.071} \\approx 0.441\n     \\]\n\n4. **Return the Z-scores:**\n   - The z-scores for the lower and upper bounds are approximately -1.391 and 0.441, respectively.\n\nThe final output should be a JSON object containing these z-scores as a tuple.\n\n<<<{\"return\": (-1.391, 0.441)}>>>"
