    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of happy numbers and how they are determined. A happy number is defined as a number which eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit. If this process results in an endless cycle of numbers that does not include 1, then the number is not happy.\n\nGiven the output list of happy numbers `[464, 469, 478, 487, 490, 496, 536, 556]`, we need to determine a starting number (`start_num`) such that these are the first 8 happy numbers found starting from `start_num`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding Happy Numbers**: \n   - A number is happy if repeatedly summing the squares of its digits eventually leads to 1.\n   - If a number is not happy, it will fall into a cycle that does not include 1.\n\n2. **Output List**: \n   - The list `[464, 469, 478, 487, 490, 496, 536, 556]` contains the first 8 happy numbers starting from a certain number.\n\n3. **Finding the Starting Number**:\n   - We need to find the smallest number such that the first 8 happy numbers from this number are exactly the ones given in the list.\n   - The sequence of happy numbers is strictly increasing, so the starting number must be less than or equal to the smallest number in the list, which is 464.\n\n4. **Checking Numbers**:\n   - We start checking from a number less than or equal to 464 and verify if the sequence of happy numbers matches the given list.\n   - The first number in the list is 464, so it is a good candidate for `start_num`.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Starting from 464, we check if it is a happy number. If it is, we continue to find the next happy numbers until we have 8.\n   - If the sequence matches `[464, 469, 478, 487, 490, 496, 536, 556]`, then 464 is the correct starting number.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - After verifying, 464 is indeed the starting number that results in the given sequence of happy numbers.\n\nTherefore, the feasible input for the given output is:\n\n```json\n<<<{\"start_num\": 464}>>>\n```"
