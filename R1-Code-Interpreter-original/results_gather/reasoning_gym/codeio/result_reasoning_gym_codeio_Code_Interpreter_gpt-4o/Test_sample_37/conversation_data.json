    "\nassistant > To determine the output for the given input `{'numbers': [13, 22]}`, we need to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers 13 and 22.\n\nThe GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - 13 is a prime number, so its only factors are 1 and 13.\n   - 22 can be factored into 2 and 11 (since 22 = 2 * 11).\n\n2. **Common Factors:**\n   - The only common factor between 13 and 22 is 1.\n\n3. **GCD Calculation:**\n   - Since the only common factor is 1, the GCD of 13 and 22 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given input should be a dictionary with the key \"gcd\" and the value 1.\n\nThe output in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n<<<{\"gcd\": 1}>>>\n```"
