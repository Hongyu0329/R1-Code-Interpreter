  "question": "\nYou are given a question that requires some input and output variables as follows:\n\nGiven a set of altitude measurements from a sonar sensor, how can we apply a 1st order low-pass filter to smooth out the noise in the measurements while still tracking the variations in altitude? Specifically, what would be the filtered altitude estimates for the given measurements using a specified smoothing factor `alpha`?\n\nThe input and output requirements are as follows:\n\nInput:\n- `alpha` (float): The smoothing factor for the low-pass filter, where 0 < alpha < 1.\n- `data` (list of float): The input data points to be filtered. Each element in the list represents a measurement.\n\nOutput:\n- `return` (list of float): The filtered data points after applying the low-pass filter. Each element in the list represents the filtered estimate corresponding to the input data points.\n\nGiven the following input:\n\n{'alpha': 0.904117613966948, 'data': [2.356670074042777, 26.820999339315932, 20.302836155984437, 22.672000750298448, 67.47577016648839, 86.93088139161189, 92.29449578379234, 38.137952202092215]}\n\nCan you predict the output? Please think and then provide the exact output in the form of a JSON object enclosed in triple angle brackets, like this <<<JSON object>>> as your final answer. The keys and values of the object should strictly match the output requirement as specified.\n\nTip: Here is a reference code snippet for this question.
