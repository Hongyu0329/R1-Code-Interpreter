    "\nassistant > To predict a feasible input for the given output, we need to understand the OEIS A000037 series and the conditions for the output.\n\nThe OEIS A000037 series is the sequence of numbers that are not perfect squares. The given output is a dictionary with two keys: `series` and `has_square`. The `series` key contains a list of numbers, and the `has_square` key is a boolean indicating whether any of the numbers in the list are perfect squares.\n\nThe provided output is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"series\": [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 82, 83],\n  \"has_square\": False\n}\n```\n\nThe `series` list contains 74 numbers, and `has_square` is `False`, indicating that none of these numbers are perfect squares. \n\nTo determine the input `n`, we need to count the number of terms in the `series` list. Since the list contains 74 numbers, the input `n` should be 74.\n\nThus, the feasible input is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"n\": 74\n}\n```"
