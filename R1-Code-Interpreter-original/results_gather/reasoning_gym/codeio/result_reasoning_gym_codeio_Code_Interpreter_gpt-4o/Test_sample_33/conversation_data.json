    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to understand the two keyspace calculations:\n\n1. **Keyspace with no restrictions (`keyspacenomin`)**: This is calculated as \\( n^k \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of distinct English letters and \\( k \\) is the number of cyphertext symbols. This represents the total number of ways to assign cyphertext symbols to the letters without any restrictions.\n\n2. **Keyspace with at least one cyphertext symbol per English letter (`keyspaceonemin`)**: This is calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula involves summing over all subsets of the letters, adjusting for overcounting by alternating signs.\n\nGiven the output:\n- `keyspacenomin`: 100000\n- `keyspaceonemin`: 0\n\nWe need to find values of \\( n \\) and \\( k \\) that satisfy these conditions.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **For `keyspacenomin` = 100000**:\n   \\[\n   n^k = 100000\n   \\]\n   We need to find integer values of \\( n \\) and \\( k \\) such that this equation holds.\n\n2. **For `keyspaceonemin` = 0**:\n   The inclusion-exclusion principle results in zero, which typically happens when \\( k < n \\) because there aren't enough cyphertext symbols to assign at least one to each letter.\n\n### Estimation\n\nLet's try to estimate feasible values for \\( n \\) and \\( k \\):\n\n- If \\( n = 10 \\), then \\( 10^k = 100000 \\) implies \\( k = 5 \\).\n- For `keyspaceonemin` to be zero, \\( k \\) should be less than \\( n \\).\n\nLet's check if \\( n = 10 \\) and \\( k = 5 \\) satisfy these conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import factorial\n\n# Function to calculate the binomial coefficient\ndef nck(nn, kk):\n    return int(factorial(nn) / (factorial(kk) * factorial(nn - kk)))\n\n# Function to calculate keyspaces\ndef main_solution(n, k):\n    # Calculate the keyspace with no restrictions\n    keyspacenomin = n ** k\n    \n    # Calculate the keyspace with at least one cyphertext symbol per English letter\n    keyspaceonemin = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        keyspaceonemin += ((-1) ** i) * nck(n, i) * ((n - i) ** k)\n    \n    # Return the results as a dictionary\n    return {\n        \"keyspacenomin\": keyspacenomin,\n        \"keyspaceonemin\": keyspaceonemin\n    }\n\n# Test with n = 10 and k = 5\nmain_solution(10, 5)\nassistant > The values \\( n = 10 \\) and \\( k = 5 \\) satisfy the given conditions:\n\n- `keyspacenomin` is 100000, which matches the output.\n- `keyspaceonemin` is 0, which also matches the output.\n\nThus, a feasible input is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"n\": 10,\n  \"k\": 5\n}\n```"
