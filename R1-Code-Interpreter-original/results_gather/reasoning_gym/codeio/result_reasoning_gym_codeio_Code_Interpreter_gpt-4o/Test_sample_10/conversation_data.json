    "\nassistant > To find the maximum value in the list `nums` using an iterative approach, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the list is empty. If it is, raise a `ValueError`.\n2. Initialize a variable `max_num` with the first element of the list.\n3. Iterate through each element `x` in the list.\n4. If `x` is greater than `max_num`, update `max_num` to `x`.\n5. After completing the iteration, return a dictionary with the key `\"max_value\"` and the value as `max_num`.\n\nGiven the input `{'nums': [-94, 89, -30, -38]}`, let's apply these steps:\n\n- The list is not empty, so we proceed.\n- Initialize `max_num` with the first element: `max_num = -94`.\n- Iterate through the list:\n  - Compare `89` with `max_num (-94)`: `89` is greater, so update `max_num` to `89`.\n  - Compare `-30` with `max_num (89)`: `-30` is not greater, so `max_num` remains `89`.\n  - Compare `-38` with `max_num (89)`: `-38` is not greater, so `max_num` remains `89`.\n\nThe maximum value found in the list is `89`.\n\nTherefore, the output will be:\n\n```json\n<<<{\"max_value\": 89}>>>\n```"
