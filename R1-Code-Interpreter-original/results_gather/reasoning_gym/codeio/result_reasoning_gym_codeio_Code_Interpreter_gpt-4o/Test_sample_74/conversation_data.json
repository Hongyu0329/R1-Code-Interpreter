    "\nassistant > To predict a feasible input for the given output, we need to understand how the linked list is reversed in groups of a specified size. The output provided is a list of integers that represents the linked list after reversing nodes in groups of a certain size.\n\nGiven the output:\n\n```json\n{'reversed_linked_list': [8, 61, 68, 72, 3, 47, 64, 25, 9, 34, 37, 84, 95, 58, 56, 36, 60, 96, 29, 89]}\n```\n\nWe can observe that the list is divided into groups and each group is reversed. To determine the input, we need to identify the group size and the original list of integers.\n\nLet's analyze the output list:\n\n- The first group is `[8, 61, 68, 72]`, which is reversed to `[72, 68, 61, 8]`.\n- The second group is `[3, 47, 64, 25]`, which is reversed to `[25, 64, 47, 3]`.\n- The third group is `[9, 34, 37, 84]`, which is reversed to `[84, 37, 34, 9]`.\n- The fourth group is `[95, 58, 56, 36]`, which is reversed to `[36, 56, 58, 95]`.\n- The fifth group is `[60, 96, 29, 89]`, which is reversed to `[89, 29, 96, 60]`.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce that the group size is 4, as each group contains 4 elements.\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the original list by reversing each group in the output:\n\n- Reverse `[72, 68, 61, 8]` to get `[8, 61, 68, 72]`.\n- Reverse `[25, 64, 47, 3]` to get `[3, 47, 64, 25]`.\n- Reverse `[84, 37, 34, 9]` to get `[9, 34, 37, 84]`.\n- Reverse `[36, 56, 58, 95]` to get `[95, 58, 56, 36]`.\n- Reverse `[89, 29, 96, 60]` to get `[60, 96, 29, 89]`.\n\nCombining these, the original list of integers is:\n\n`[8, 61, 68, 72, 3, 47, 64, 25, 9, 34, 37, 84, 95, 58, 56, 36, 60, 96, 29, 89]`\n\nThus, the feasible input is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ints\": [8, 61, 68, 72, 3, 47, 64, 25, 9, 34, 37, 84, 95, 58, 56, 36, 60, 96, 29, 89],\n  \"group_size\": 4\n}\n```\n\nLet's present this in the required format: \n\n<<<\n{\n  \"ints\": [8, 61, 68, 72, 3, 47, 64, 25, 9, 34, 37, 84, 95, 58, 56, 36, 60, 96, 29, 89],\n  \"group_size\": 4\n}\n>>>"
