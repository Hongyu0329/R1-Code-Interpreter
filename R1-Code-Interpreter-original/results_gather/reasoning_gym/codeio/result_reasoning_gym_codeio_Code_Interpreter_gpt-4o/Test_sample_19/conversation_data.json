    "\nassistant > To predict a feasible input that results in the output \"quadratic equation,\" we need to consider the degrees of the variables in the equation. A quadratic equation typically involves a polynomial of degree 2. This means that at least one of the variables (x, y, or z) should have a degree of 2, while the other variables should have a degree of 0 or 1.\n\nBased on the reference code snippet, the function checks the degrees of the variables and returns \"quadratic equation\" if any of the variables have a degree of 2. Therefore, a feasible input could be an equation where one of the variables is squared, such as:\n\n- \\( x^2 + y + z = 0 \\)\n- \\( y^2 + x + z = 0 \\)\n- \\( z^2 + x + y = 0 \\)\n\nLet's choose the equation \\( x^2 + y + z = 0 \\) as a feasible input. This equation has a degree of 2 for the variable \\( x \\), and degrees of 1 for \\( y \\) and \\( z \\), which fits the criteria for a quadratic equation.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing the input:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"equation_str\": \"x**2 + y + z\"\n}\n```"
