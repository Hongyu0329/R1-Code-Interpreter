    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to sort the class definitions such that parent classes appear before their child classes. The input list of class definitions is given in a specific format, and we need to parse these definitions to determine the parent-child relationships.\n\nLet's break down the input:\n\n- `'class B'`: This class has no parent.\n- `'class A(B)'`: This class `A` has `B` as its parent.\n- `'class E'`: This class has no parent.\n- `'class G'`: This class has no parent.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that any class with a parent appears after its parent in the sorted list. In this case, `A` should appear after `B` because `A` is a child of `B`.\n\nGiven the input, the sorted order should be:\n\n1. `'class B'` (since `A` depends on `B`)\n2. `'class A(B)'` (after `B`)\n3. `'class E'` (independent, can appear in any order with respect to `G`)\n4. `'class G'` (independent, can appear in any order with respect to `E`)\n\nThus, the sorted list of class definitions is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"return\": [\"class B\", \"class A(B)\", \"class E\", \"class G\"]\n}\n```\n\nLet's present this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n<<<\n{\n  \"return\": [\"class B\", \"class A(B)\", \"class E\", \"class G\"]\n}\n>>>\n```"
