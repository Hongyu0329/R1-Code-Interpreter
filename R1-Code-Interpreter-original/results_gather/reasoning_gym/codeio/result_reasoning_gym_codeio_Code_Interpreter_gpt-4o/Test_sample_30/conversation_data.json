    "\nassistant > To predict a feasible input for the given output of forward rates, we need to reverse-engineer the process described in the reference code snippet. The forward rates are calculated from the zero rates using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{forward\\_rate}_i = \\left( \\frac{(1 + \\text{zero\\_rate}_i)^{i+1}}{\\prod_{j=0}^{i-1} (1 + \\text{forward\\_rate}_j)} \\right) - 1 \\]\n\nGiven the output forward rates:\n\n\\[ [0.01586388489124628, 0.15527671509596175, 0.10443790375156148, -0.10475743584907427] \\]\n\nWe can use these to calculate the corresponding zero rates. Let's calculate the zero rates step by step:\n\n1. The first forward rate is the same as the first zero rate.\n2.
