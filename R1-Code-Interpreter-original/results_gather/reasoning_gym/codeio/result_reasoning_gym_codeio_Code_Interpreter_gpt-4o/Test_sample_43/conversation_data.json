It should be between 1 and 9 inclusive.\n\nOutput:\n  `return` (list of int): A list of integers where each integer represents the Demlo number for the corresponding row.\n\nGiven the following input:\n\n{'n': 7}\n\nCan you predict the output? Please think and then provide the exact output in the form of a JSON object enclosed in triple angle brackets, like this <<<JSON object>>> as your final answer.
