    "\nassistant > To determine the value of \\( k \\) that ensures the function is continuous at \\( x = 5 \\), we need to ensure that the left-hand limit (LHL) and the right-hand limit (RHL) of the function at \\( x = 5 \\) are equal.\n\nThe function is defined as:\n\\[ f(x) = \\begin{cases} \nk \\cdot x + 1 & \\text{if } x \\leq 5 \\\\\n3 \\cdot x - 5 & \\text{if } x > 5 \n\\end{cases} \\]\n\nFor continuity at \\( x = 5 \\):\n- The left-hand limit as \\( x \\) approaches 5 from the left (\\( x \\to 5^- \\)) is \\( k \\cdot 5 + 1 \\).\n- The right-hand limit as \\( x \\) approaches 5 from the right (\\( x \\to 5^+ \\)) is \\( 3 \\cdot 5 - 5 \\).\n\nSetting these equal for continuity:\n\\[ k \\cdot 5 + 1 = 3 \\cdot 5 - 5 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\\[ 5k + 1 = 15 - 5 \\]\n\\[ 5k + 1 = 10 \\]\n\\[ 5k = 9 \\]\n\\[ k = \\frac{9}{5} = 1.8 \\]\n\nThe given output is 1.8, which matches our calculation. The input variable `delta` is used to calculate the limits, but it does not affect the value of \\( k \\) since the limits are calculated symbolically. Therefore, any small positive number for `delta` would work.\n\nA feasible input for `delta` could be a small positive number like 0.01. \n\nThus, the JSON object for the input is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delta\": 0.01\n}\n```"
