  "question": "\nYou are given a question that requires some input and output variables as follows:\n\nA bank teller serves customers standing in a queue one by one. The service time for each customer has a mean of 2 minutes and a standard deviation of 1 minute. The service times for different customers are independent. What are the z-scores corresponding to the total service time for 50 customers when the total service time is between 90 and 110 minutes?\n\nThe input and output requirements are as follows:\n\nInput:\n  `mean` (float): The mean service time for a single customer.\n  `standard_deviation` (float): The standard deviation of the service time for a single customer.\n  `n` (int): The number of customers.\n  `x1` (float): The lower bound of the total service time range.\n  `x2` (float): The upper bound of the total service time range.\n\nOutput:\n  `return` (tuple of floats): A tuple containing two z-scores corresponding to the lower and upper bounds of the total service time range.\n\nGiven the following input:\n\n{'mean': 2.0, 'standard_deviation': 1.0, 'n': 50, 'x1': 90.17244564075081, 'x2': 103.12187270811205}\n\nCan you predict the output? Please think and then provide the exact output in the form of a JSON object enclosed in triple angle brackets, like this <<<JSON object>>> as your final answer. The keys and values of the object should strictly match the output requirement as specified.\n\nTip: Here is a reference code snippet for this question. You can refer to this code to guide your reasoning but not copy spans of code directly.\n\n# import necessary packages\nimport math\n\n# main function\ndef main_solution(mean, standard_deviation, n, x1, x2):\n    # Calculate the z-scores for the given x1 and x2\n    z_score1 = (x1 - mean * n) / (standard_deviation * (n ** 0.5))\n    z_score2 = (x2 - mean * n) / (standard_deviation * (n ** 0.5))\n    \n    # Return the z-scores as a tuple\n    return (z_score1, z_score2)\n",
