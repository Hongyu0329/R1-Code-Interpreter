  "question": "\nYou are given a question that requires some input and output variables as follows:\n\nYou are given an integer `n`. Your task is to calculate the number of distinct terms in the sequence generated by `a^b` for all integers `a` and `b` where `2 <= a <= n` and `2 <= b <= n`. Return the count of distinct terms in the sequence.\n\nThe input and output requirements are as follows:\n\nInput:\n    n (int): An integer representing the upper limit for both `a` and `b` in the expression `a^b`.\n\nOutput:\n    return (dict): A dictionary with one key:\n    - distinct_terms (int): The number of distinct terms in the sequence generated by `a^b` for `2 <= a <= n` and `2 <= b <= n`.\n\nGiven the following input:\n\n{'n': 29}\n\nCan you predict the output? Please think and then provide the exact output in the form of a JSON object enclosed in triple angle brackets, like this <<<JSON object>>> as your final answer. The keys and values of the object should strictly match the output requirement as specified.\n\nTip: Here is a reference code snippet for this question.
