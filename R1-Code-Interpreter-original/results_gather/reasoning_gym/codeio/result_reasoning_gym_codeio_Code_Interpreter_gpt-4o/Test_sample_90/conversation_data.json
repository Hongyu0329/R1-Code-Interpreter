    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the scores of players in a prediction market based on their bids and the final outcome. The provided reference code snippet gives us a clear understanding of how the market operates and how scores are calculated.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Initialization**: A market is initialized with a name and an initial bid by the house. The house's bid is stored as the first bid in the market.\n\n2. **Bidding**: Players place their bids, which are added to the list of bids in the market. Each bid is a probability between 0 and 1.\n\n3. **Closing the Market**: Once all bids are placed, the market is closed to new bids.\n\n4. **Resolving the Market**: The market is resolved based on the final outcome (True or False). The scores are calculated as follows:\n   - If the outcome is True, the bids are used as they are.\n   - If the outcome is False, the bids are inverted (i.e., `1 - bid`).\n   - The score for each player is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{score} = 100 \\times (\\log_2(\\text{current bid}) - \\log_2(\\text{last bid}))\n     \\]\n   - The scores are accumulated for each player.\n\n5. **Output**: The final scores for each player are returned as a dictionary.\n\nNow, let's apply this logic to the given input:\n\n```python\n{\n  'market_name': 'Market_28',\n  'house_bid': 0.5969980871075791,\n  'player_bids': [\n    ('Player_1', 0.9095422098787996),\n    ('Player_2', 0.07098421998126647),\n    ('Player_3', 0.36655074924986386)\n  ],\n  'outcome': True\n}\n```\n\nWe'll calculate the scores for each player based on the outcome being True.
