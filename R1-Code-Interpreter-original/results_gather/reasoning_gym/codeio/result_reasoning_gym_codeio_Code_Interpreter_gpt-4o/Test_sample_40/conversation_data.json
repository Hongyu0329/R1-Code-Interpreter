    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use the Dutch National Flag algorithm, which efficiently sorts an array of three distinct elements. The algorithm maintains three pointers: `red`, `white`, and `blue`, which represent the boundaries of the regions for red, white, and blue pebbles, respectively.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the algorithm works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - `red` is initialized to 0, representing the start of the red region.\n   - `white` is initialized to 0, representing the current position being evaluated.\n   - `blue` is initialized to the length of the array, representing the start of the blue region.\n\n2. **Iteration**:\n   - While `white` is less than `blue`, evaluate the color of the pebble at the `white` index.\n   - If the pebble is red ('r'), swap it with the pebble at the `red` index, then increment both `red` and `white`.\n   - If the pebble is white ('w'), simply increment `white`.\n   - If the pebble is blue ('b'), decrement `blue` and swap the pebble at `white` with the pebble at `blue`.\n\n3. **Termination**:\n   - The loop terminates when `white` meets `blue`, ensuring all pebbles are sorted with reds first, followed by whites, and blues last.\n\nGiven the input array:\n\n```python\narr = ['b', 'r', 'w', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'w', 'w', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'r', 'b', 'b', 'w', 'r', 'w', 'r', 'b']\n```\n\nLet's apply the algorithm to predict the output.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef sort_pebbles(arr):\n    red, white, blue = 0, 0, len(arr)\n    \n    while white < blue:\n        if arr[white] == 'r':\n            arr[red], arr[white] = arr[white], arr[red]\n            red += 1\n            white += 1\n        elif arr[white] == 'w':\n            white += 1\n        else:  # arr[white] == 'b'\n            blue -= 1\n            arr[white], arr[blue] = arr[blue], arr[white]\n    \n    return arr\n\n# Given input\ninput_arr = ['b', 'r', 'w', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'w', 'w', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'r', 'b', 'b', 'w', 'r', 'w', 'r', 'b']\n\n# Sort the pebbles\nsorted_arr = sort_pebbles(input_arr)\nsorted_arr\nassistant > The sorted array, with all red pebbles first, followed by white pebbles, and then blue pebbles, is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"return\": [\"r\", \"r\", \"r\", \"r\", \"w\", \"w\", \"w\", \"w\", \"w\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\"]\n}\n```"
