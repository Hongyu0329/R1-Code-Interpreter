    "\nassistant > To determine the input value `n` for which the given output of roots and weights corresponds, we need to understand the relationship between the degree of the Legendre polynomial and the number of roots and weights.\n\nThe number of roots and weights for a Legendre polynomial of degree `n` is `n`. The roots are symmetric about the origin, so only the non-negative roots are returned. This means that for an odd degree `n`, there will be `(n + 1) // 2` non-negative roots, and for an even degree `n`, there will be `n // 2` non-negative roots.\n\nGiven the output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"roots\": [0.9915651684209309, 0.9558239495713977, 0.8926024664975557, 0.8037049589725231, 0.6916870430603532, 0.5597708310739475, 0.41175116146284263, 0.2518862256915055, 0.08477501304173532],\n  \"weights\": [0.02161601352648344, 0.049714548894969804, 0.0764257302548891, 0.10094204410628717, 0.12255520671147845, 0.14064291467065065, 0.15468467512626527, 0.16427648374583262, 0.16914238296314354]\n}\n```\n\nWe observe that there are 9 non-negative roots. This suggests that the degree of the Legendre polynomial `n` is 18, because for `n = 18`, there would be 9 non-negative roots (since 18 is even, `n // 2 = 9`).\n\nTherefore, the input `n` is 18.\n\nHere is the JSON object representing the input:\n\n```json\n<<<{\"n\": 18}>>>\n```"
