    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to add two tonal values, one with an octave designation and another without, and return the resulting tonal value. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Values:**\n   - `x = [-50, -48, 89]`: This is the first tonal value with a diatonic value of -50, a chromatic value of -48, and an octave designation of 89.\n   - `y = [64, -49]`: This is the second tonal value with a diatonic value of 64 and a chromatic value of -49.\n\n2. **Addition of Tonal Values:**\n   - We add the diatonic values: `-50 + 64 = 14`\n   - We add the chromatic values: `-48 + (-49) = -97`\n\n3. **Normalization:**\n   - **Diatonic Normalization:**\n     - The diatonic length (`D_LEN`) is 7. We normalize the diatonic value by taking the modulo: `14 % 7 = 0`\n     - Calculate the additional diatonic octave: `14 // 7 = 2`\n   - **Chromatic Normalization:**\n     - The chromatic length (`C_LEN`) is 12. We normalize the chromatic value by taking the modulo: `-97 % 12 = 7`\n\n4. **Octave Calculation:**\n   - Since the original tonal value `x` has an octave designation, we add the additional diatonic octave to the original octave: `89 + 2 = 91`\n\n5. **Resulting Tonal Value:**\n   - The resulting tonal value is `[0, 7, 91]`, where 0 is the normalized diatonic value, 7 is the normalized chromatic value, and 91 is the updated octave designation.\n\nNow, let's present the result in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": [0, 7, 91]\n}\n```\n\nThus, the final output is:\n\n<<<{\"result\": [0, 7, 91]}>>>"
