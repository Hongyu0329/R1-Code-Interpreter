  "question": "\nYou are given a question that requires some input and output variables as follows:\n\nYou are given three inputs: `profit`, `weight`, and `max_weight`. `profit` and `weight` are lists of integers representing the profit and weight of items, respectively. `max_weight` is an integer representing the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack. Your task is to implement a greedy knapsack algorithm that maximizes the profit without exceeding the maximum weight capacity. The function should return the total profit as a dictionary. The function should also handle edge cases such as negative values, zero or negative `max_weight`, and unequal lengths of `profit` and `weight` lists by raising appropriate exceptions.\n\nThe input and output requirements are as follows:\n\nInput:\n    profit (list of int): List of profit values for each item.\n    weight (list of int): List of weight values for each item.\n    max_weight (int): Maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.\n\nOutput:\n    return (dict): A dictionary with one key:\n    - total_profit (float): Total profit calculated by the greedy knapsack algorithm.\n\nGiven the following input:\n\n{'profit': [12, 80, 86, 96, 82, 66, 5, 81, 48], 'weight': [57, 68, 14, 88, 59, 77, 37, 49, 95], 'max_weight': 158}\n\nCan you predict the output?
