    "\nassistant > To predict the output for the given input, we need to understand the behavior of the `main_solution` function based on the provided code snippet.\n\nThe input specifies the `factory_type` as \"enchanted\". According to the code:\n\n1. The `main_solution` function checks the `factory_type` and selects the appropriate factory class. Since the input is \"enchanted\", it uses the `EnchantedMazeFactroy` class.\n\n2. The `create_maze` method of the `MazeGame` class is called with the `EnchantedMazeFactroy` as the factory. This method:\n   - Creates a new `Maze` object.\n   - Creates two rooms using the `make_room` method of the factory, which in this case is `EnchantedMazeFactroy`. This method returns `EnchantedRoom` objects.\n   - Creates a door between the two rooms using the `make_door` method of the factory, which returns an `EnchantedDoor`.\n   - Sets the rooms in the maze and assigns walls and doors to the sides of the rooms.\n\n3. The `create_maze` method returns a `Maze` object containing two rooms.\n\n4. The `main_solution` function then retrieves the room numbers from the maze. It iterates over room numbers 1 and 2, retrieves each room using `get_room_number`, and appends the room number to the `maze_rooms` list.\n\n5. Finally, the function returns a dictionary with the key \"room_numbers\" and the list of room numbers as the value.\n\nGiven this understanding, the output for the input `{'factory_type': 'enchanted'}` will be a dictionary with the room numbers 1 and 2.\n\nHere is the predicted output:\n\n```json\n{\"room_numbers\": [1, 2]}\n```"
