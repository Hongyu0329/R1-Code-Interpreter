Your task is to find the maximum value in the list using an iterative approach. If the list is empty, the function should raise a `ValueError`. Return the maximum value found in the list.\n\nThe input and output requirements are as follows:\n\nInput:\n    nums (list of int or float): A list of numbers, which can be integers or floats.\n\nOutput:\n    return (dict): A dictionary with one key:\n    - max_value (int or float): The maximum value found in the list.\n\nGiven the following input:\n\n{'nums': [9, 93, 85, -74, -84, -7, 78, 18, -5, -89, 55, 70, -57, 51]}\n\nCan you predict the output? Please think and then provide the exact output in the form of a JSON object enclosed in triple angle brackets, like this <<<JSON object>>> as your final answer.

    "\nassistant > To find the maximum value in the list using an iterative approach, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the list is empty. If it is, raise a `ValueError`.\n2. Initialize a variable `max_num` with the first element of the list.\n3. Iterate through each element `x` in the list.\n4. If `x` is greater than `max_num`, update `max_num` to `x`.\n5. After iterating through the list, `max_num` will hold the maximum value.\n6. Return a dictionary with the key `\"max_value\"` and the value as `max_num`.\n\nGiven the input list `{'nums': [9, 93, 85, -74, -84, -7, 78, 18, -5, -89, 55, 70, -57, 51]}`, we can apply the above logic:\n\n- Start with `max_num = 9`.\n- Compare each element with `max_num` and update `max_num` if a larger value is found.\n- The largest value in the list is `93`.\n\nTherefore, the output will be:\n\n```json\n{\"max_value\": 93}\n```\n\nSo, the final output in the required format is:\n\n<<<{\"max_value\": 93}>>>"
