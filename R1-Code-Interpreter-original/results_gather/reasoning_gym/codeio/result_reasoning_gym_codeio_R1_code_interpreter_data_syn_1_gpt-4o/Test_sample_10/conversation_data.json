    "To solve the problem of finding the maximum value in a list of numbers using an iterative approach, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check if the list is empty**: If the list `nums` is empty, we should raise a `ValueError` as specified.\n\n2. **Initialize a variable to store the maximum value**: We can start by assuming the first element of the list is the maximum value.\n\n3. **Iterate through the list**: For each element in the list, compare it with the current maximum value. If the current element is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum value.\n\n4. **Return the result**: Once the iteration is complete, return the maximum value found in the list as part of a dictionary with the key `max_value`.\n\nGiven the input `{'nums': [-94, 89, -30, -38]}`, we will apply the above logic to find the maximum value.\n\nLet's implement this logic in a Python script to compute the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_iterative(nums):\n    if len(nums) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"find_max_iterative() arg is an empty sequence\")\n    max_num = nums[0]\n    for x in nums:\n        if x > max_num:\n            max_num = x\n    return {\"max_value\": max_num}\n\n# Given input\ninput_data = {'nums': [-94, 89, -30, -38]}\n# Find the maximum value\nresult = find_max_iterative(input_data['nums'])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will be executed to find the maximum value in the list `[-94, 89, -30, -38]`. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the maximum value from the list `[-94, 89, -30, -38]`, which is `89`. This matches our expectations based on the logic we implemented.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, formatted as a JSON object, is:\n\n<<<{'max_value': 89}>>>"
