    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of distinct terms generated by the expression \\(a^b\\) for all integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) where \\(2 \\leq a \\leq n\\) and \\(2 \\leq b \\leq n\\). The approach involves iterating over all possible values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) within the given range, computing the power \\(a^b\\), and storing the results in a set to ensure all terms are distinct.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize a Set**: Use a set to store the results of \\(a^b\\) because sets automatically handle duplicate entries, ensuring all stored values are unique.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Ranges**: Use nested loops to iterate over all possible values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) within the specified range. The outer loop will iterate over \\(a\\) from 2 to \\(n\\), and the inner loop will iterate over \\(b\\) from 2 to \\(n\\).\n\n3. **Compute Powers**: For each pair \\((a, b)\\), compute the power \\(a^b\\) and add the result to the set.\n\n4. **Count Distinct Terms**: After populating the set with all possible powers, the number of distinct terms is simply the size of the set.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Return the count of distinct terms in the required dictionary format.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python code to compute the result for the given input \\(n = 29\\).\n\n```python\ndef calculate_distinct_terms(n):\n    collect_powers = set()\n    \n    for a in range(2, n + 1):\n        for b in range(2, n + 1):\n            current_pow = a ** b\n            collect_powers.add(current_pow)\n    \n    return {\"distinct_terms\": len(collect_powers)}\n\n# Given input\nn = 29\n# Calculate the result\nresult = calculate_distinct_terms(n)\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the number of distinct terms for the given input \\(n = 29\\) and print the result. Let's execute this code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `{'distinct_terms': 703}`. This indicates that there are 703 distinct terms in the sequence generated by \\(a^b\\) for all integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) where \\(2 \\leq a \\leq 29\\) and \\(2 \\leq b \\leq 29\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<{'distinct_terms': 703}>>>"
