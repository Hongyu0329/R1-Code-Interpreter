    "To predict a feasible input for the given output of forward rates, we need to reverse-engineer the process of calculating forward rates from zero rates. The forward rate for a period is derived from the zero rates using the formula:\n\n\\[ f_{i} = \\left( \\frac{(1 + z_{i})^{i+1}}{(1 + z_{0})(1 + f_{1})...(1 + f_{i-1})} \\right) - 1 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( f_{i} \\) is the forward rate for the \\( i \\)-th period.\n- \\( z_{i} \\) is the zero rate for the \\( i \\)-th year.\n\nGiven the forward rates, we can work backwards to find the zero rates. The first zero rate is the same as the first forward rate. For subsequent zero rates, we can use the forward rates to calculate the zero rates.\n\nLet's write a Python script to compute the zero rates from the given forward rates:\n\n```python\n# Given forward rates\nforward_rates = [0.01586388489124628, 0.15527671509596175, 0.10443790375156148, -0.10475743584907427]\n\n# Function to calculate zero rates from forward rates\ndef calculate_zero_rates(forward_rates):\n    zero_rates = [forward_rates[0]]  # The first zero rate is the same as the first forward rate\n    for i in range(1, len(forward_rates)):\n        # Calculate the zero rate for the i-th year\n        product_of_forward_rates = 1.0\n        for j in range(i):\n            product_of_forward_rates *= (1 + forward_rates[j])\n        zero_rate = ((1 + forward_rates[i]) * product_of_forward_rates) ** (1 / (i + 1)) - 1\n        zero_rates.append(zero_rate)\n    return zero_rates\n\n# Calculate zero rates\nzero_rates = calculate_zero_rates(forward_rates)\nprint(zero_rates)\n```\n\nThis script will compute the zero rates that correspond to the given forward rates. Let's execute this code to find the zero rates.",
    "The code execution has provided us with a set of zero rates that correspond to the given forward rates. These zero rates are calculated by reversing the process of deriving forward rates from zero rates.\n\nThe zero rates are:\n- Year 1: 0.01586388489124628\n- Year 2: 0.0833300013946725\n- Year 3: 0.09032076024880764\n- Year 4: 0.037888958162058506\n\nThese zero rates, when used in the forward rate calculation formula, should yield the given forward rates.
