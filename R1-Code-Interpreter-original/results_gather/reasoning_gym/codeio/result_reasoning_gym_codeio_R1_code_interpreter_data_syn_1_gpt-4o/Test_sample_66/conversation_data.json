    "To predict a feasible input for the given output, we need to understand the OEIS A000037 series, which is the sequence of non-square numbers. The output provided is a dictionary with a list of non-square numbers and a boolean indicating whether any of these numbers are perfect squares.\n\nThe output series is:\n```\n[2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 82, 83]\n```\n\nThe boolean `has_square` is `False`, indicating that none of these numbers are perfect squares.\n\nTo determine the input `n`, we need to find out how many terms are in the series. We can do this by counting the number of elements in the list. Let's write a small Python script to count the elements in the series and verify that none of them are perfect squares.\n\n```python\n# Given series\nseries = [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 82, 83]\n\n# Count the number of terms\nn = len(series)\n\n# Check if any term is a perfect square\nhas_square = any(int(x**0.5)**2 == x for x in series)\n\nprint(n, has_square)\n```\n\nBy running this code, we can determine the value of `n` and confirm that `has_square` is `False`. Once we have the value of `n`, we can provide the input in the required JSON format.\n\nLet's execute the code to find the value of `n`.",
    "The code output indicates that there are 74 terms in the series, and none of them are perfect squares (`has_square` is `False`). This matches the given output, confirming that the input `n` should be 74.\n\nNow, I will provide the input in the required JSON format.\n\n<<<{\"n\": 74}>>>"
