    "To determine a feasible input that results in the output \"not nice\", we need to understand the conditions that make a grid \"nice\". According to the problem, a grid is \"nice\" if:\n\n1. The maximum value among the minimum values of each row is equal to the minimum value among the maximum values of each column.\n\nTo make the grid \"not nice\", we need to ensure that these two values are not equal. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Convert the grid to integers**: The grid is given as a list of lists of strings, so we need to convert it to integers.\n\n2. **Calculate the minimum of each row**: For each row in the grid, find the minimum value.\n\n3. **Calculate the maximum of each column**: For each column in the grid, find the maximum value.\n\n4. **Compare the values**: Check if the maximum of the minimums of the rows is not equal to the minimum of the maximums of the columns.\n\nLet's construct a simple example to illustrate this:\n\n- Consider a 2x2 grid:\n  ```\n  1 3\n  2 4\n  ```\n\n- Minimum of each row:\n  - Row 1: min(1, 3) = 1\n  - Row 2: min(2, 4) = 2\n\n- Maximum of each column:\n  - Column 1: max(1, 2) = 2\n  - Column 2: max(3, 4) = 4\n\n- Maximum of the minimums of the rows: max(1, 2) = 2\n- Minimum of the maximums of the columns: min(2, 4) = 2\n\nIn this case, the grid is \"nice\" because the values are equal. To make it \"not nice\", we need to adjust the grid so that these values are not equal. Let's try another configuration:\n\n- Consider a 2x2 grid:\n  ```\n  1 4\n  2 3\n  ```\n\n- Minimum of each row:\n  - Row 1: min(1, 4) = 1\n  - Row 2: min(2, 3) = 2\n\n- Maximum of each column:\n  - Column 1: max(1, 2) = 2\n  - Column 2: max(4, 3) = 4\n\n- Maximum of the minimums of the rows: max(1, 2) = 2\n- Minimum of the maximums of the columns: min(2, 4) = 2\n\nThis configuration is still \"nice\". Let's try another configuration:\n\n- Consider a 2x2 grid:\n  ```\n  1 5\n  3 4\n  ```\n\n- Minimum of each row:\n  - Row 1: min(1, 5) = 1\n  - Row 2: min(3, 4) = 3\n\n- Maximum of each column:\n  - Column 1: max(1, 3) = 3\n  - Column 2: max(5, 4) = 5\n\n- Maximum of the minimums of the rows: max(1, 3) = 3\n- Minimum of the maximums of the columns: min(3, 5) = 3\n\nThis configuration is still \"nice\". Let's try another configuration:\n\n- Consider a 2x2 grid:\n  ```\n  1 6\n  3 4\n  ```\n\n- Minimum of each row:\n  - Row 1: min(1, 6) = 1\n  - Row 2: min(3, 4) = 3\n\n- Maximum of each column:\n  - Column 1: max(1, 3) = 3\n  - Column 2: max(6, 4) = 6\n\n- Maximum of the minimums of the rows: max(1, 3) = 3\n- Minimum of the maximums of the columns: min(3, 6) = 3\n\nThis configuration is still \"nice\".
