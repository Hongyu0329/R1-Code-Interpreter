    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of `max_n` that results in a digit sum of 346 for the numerator of the `max_n`-th convergent of the continued fraction representation of `e`.\n\nThe continued fraction for `e` is represented as follows:\n\\[ e = [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, \\ldots] \\]\n\nThe sequence of numerators for the convergents can be calculated using the recurrence relation:\n- \\( a_0 = 2 \\)\n- \\( a_1 = 3 \\)\n- For \\( n \\geq 2 \\), \\( a_n = k_n \\cdot a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} \\), where \\( k_n \\) is the sequence of coefficients in the continued fraction.\n\nThe task is to find the sum of the digits of the numerator of the `max_n`-th convergent and check if it equals 346. We will write a Python script to compute this for different values of `max_n` until we find the correct one.\n\nLet's implement the code to find the correct `max_n`.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_n_for_digit_sum(target_digit_sum):\n    pre_numerator = 1\n    cur_numerator = 2\n    max_n = 2\n\n    while True:\n        temp = pre_numerator\n        e_cont = 2 * max_n // 3 if max_n % 3 == 0 else 1\n        pre_numerator = cur_numerator\n        cur_numerator = e_cont * pre_numerator + temp\n\n        digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(cur_numerator))\n        if digit_sum == target_digit_sum:\n            return max_n\n\n        max_n += 1\n\ntarget_digit_sum = 346\nmax_n = find_max_n_for_digit_sum(target_digit_sum)\nprint(max_n)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the numerators of the convergents of `e` and their digit sums until it finds the one that matches the target digit sum of 346. Let's execute this code to find the correct `max_n`.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the result that the `max_n` value which results in a digit sum of 346 for the numerator of the `max_n`-th convergent of the continued fraction for `e` is 117.\n\nTherefore, the feasible input for the given output is:\n\n```json\n{\"max_n\": 117}\n```\n\nThis means that when `max_n` is set to 117, the sum of the digits in the numerator of the 117th convergent of the continued fraction for `e` is 346. \n\n<<<{\"max_n\": 117}>>>"
