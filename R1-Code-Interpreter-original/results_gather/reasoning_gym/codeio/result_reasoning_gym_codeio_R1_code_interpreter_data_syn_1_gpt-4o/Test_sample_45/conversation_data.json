    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the fractional Stokes Q/I and the Electric Vector Position Angle (EVPA) using the GKK method for the given angles in radians. The GKK method involves some trigonometric calculations based on the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Input Validation and Conversion**:\n   - The input angles are already in radians, so no conversion is needed.\n   - We need to ensure that the input is in the form of a list, which it already is.\n\n2. **GKK Method Calculations**:\n   - The GKK method uses a specific formula to calculate the fractional Stokes Q/I and EVPA.\n   - The fractional Stokes Q/I is calculated using a piecewise function:\n     - If the absolute value of the angle is less than or equal to `atan(1/sqrt(2))`, the fractional Stokes Q/I is `-1.0`.\n     - Otherwise, it is calculated using the formula: \\((3 \\cdot \\sin^2(\\theta) - 2) / (3 \\cdot \\sin^2(\\theta))\\).\n   - The EVPA is calculated as half the arctangent of zero divided by the fractional Stokes Q/I, which simplifies to zero in this context.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - We will implement the above logic in a Python script to compute the required values for the given input angles.\n\nLet's proceed with the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom math import atan, sin, sqrt\n\ndef gkk(theta, units='radians'):\n    # If theta is a list, makes it into a numpy array\n    if isinstance(theta, list):\n        theta = np.array(theta)\n    \n    # Calculates a constant for easy reference\n    at2 = atan(1.0 / sqrt(2.0))\n    \n    # Splits calculation based on how theta is provided; does here if it's a numpy array\n    gkk_fracq = np.piecewise(theta, [np.abs(theta) <= at2, np.abs(theta) > at2], \\\n                            [-1.0, lambda x: (3.0 * (np.sin(x))**2 - 2.0) / (3.0 * (np.sin(x))**2)])\n    gkk_evpa = 0.5 * np.arctan2(0.0, gkk_fracq)\n    \n    # Return fracq and evpa\n    return gkk_fracq, gkk_evpa\n\n# main function\ndef main_solution(theta, units):\n    # Convert theta to a list if it's a single value\n    if not isinstance(theta, list):\n        theta = [theta]\n    \n    # Call the gkk function\n    gkk_fracq, gkk_evpa = gkk(theta, units)\n    \n    # Convert the results to JSON serializable format\n    gkk_fracq = gkk_fracq.tolist() if isinstance(gkk_fracq, np.ndarray) else gkk_fracq\n    gkk_evpa = gkk_evpa.tolist() if isinstance(gkk_evpa, np.ndarray) else gkk_evpa\n    \n    # Return the results as a dictionary\n    return {\"gkk_fracq\": gkk_fracq, \"gkk_evpa\": gkk_evpa}\n\n# Given input\ninput_data = {'theta': [1.5110653204394262, 5.168270952748489], 'units': 'radians'}\n\n# Calculate the output\noutput = main_solution(input_data['theta'], input_data['units'])\n\n# Print the output\nprint(output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we obtained the output for the given input angles using the GKK method. The fractional Stokes Q/I and EVPA values have been calculated correctly.\n\nThe output is a dictionary with two keys: `gkk_fracq` and `gkk_evpa`. The `gkk_fracq` key contains a list of the fractional Stokes Q/I values for each input angle, and the `gkk_evpa` key contains a list of the EVPA values, which are both zero in this case.\n\nHere is the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n<<<{'gkk_fracq': [0.3309491357283669, 0.17305079434369625], 'gkk_evpa': [0.0, 0.0]}>>>"
