    "To determine a feasible input that results in the output \"not nice\", we need to understand the conditions that make a grid \"nice\" and then construct a grid that does not meet these conditions.\n\n### Understanding the Conditions:\n1. **Minimum of Each Row**: For each row in the grid, find the minimum value.\n2. **Maximum of Each Column**: For each column in the grid, find the maximum value.\n3. **Nice Condition**: The grid is \"nice\" if the maximum value among the minimum values of each row is equal to the minimum value among the maximum values of each column.\n\n### Constructing a \"Not Nice\" Grid:\nTo make the grid \"not nice\", we need to ensure that the maximum of the row minimums is not equal to the minimum of the column maximums.\n\n### Example Construction:\nLet's consider a 3x3 grid for simplicity. We can construct a grid where:\n- The minimum values of each row are distinct and increasing.\n- The maximum values of each column are distinct and decreasing.\n\nThis will ensure that the maximum of the row minimums is not equal to the minimum of the column maximums.\n\n### Example Grid:\n```\n3 2 1\n6 5 4\n9 8 7\n```\n\n- **Row Minimums**: [1, 4, 7]\n- **Column Maximums**: [9, 8, 7]\n\n- **Max of Row Minimums**: 7\n- **Min of Column Maximums**: 7\n\nIn this case, the grid is actually \"nice\" because the max of row minimums equals the min of column maximums. Let's adjust it to make it \"not nice\".\n\n### Adjusted Grid:\n```\n3 2 1\n6 5 4\n9 8 0\n```\n\n- **Row Minimums**: [1, 4, 0]\n- **Column Maximums**: [9, 8, 4]\n\n- **Max of Row Minimums**: 4\n- **Min of Column Maximums**: 4\n\nThis grid is still \"nice\". Let's try another approach.\n\n### Final Adjusted Grid:\n```\n3 2 1\n6 5 4\n9 8 3\n```\n\n- **Row Minimums**: [1, 4, 3]\n- **Column Maximums**: [9, 8, 4]\n\n- **Max of Row Minimums**: 4\n- **Min of Column Maximums**: 4\n\nThis grid is still \"nice\". Let's try another approach.\n\n### Final Adjusted Grid:\n```\n3 2 1\n6 5 4\n9 8 2\n```\n\n- **Row Minimums**: [1, 4, 2]\n- **Column Maximums**: [9, 8, 4]\n\n- **Max of Row Minimums**: 4\n- **Min of Column Maximums**: 4\n\nThis grid is still \"nice\". Let's try another approach.\n\n### Final Adjusted Grid:\n```\n3 2 1\n6 5 4\n9 8 5\n```\n\n- **Row Minimums**: [1, 4, 5]\n- **Column Maximums**: [9, 8, 5]\n\n- **Max of Row Minimums**: 5\n- **Min of Column Maximums**: 5\n\nThis grid is still \"nice\". Let's try another approach.\n\n### Final Adjusted Grid:\n```\n3 2 1\n6 5 4\n9 8 6\n```\n\n- **Row Minimums**: [1, 4, 6]\n- **Column Maximums**: [9, 8, 6]\n\n- **Max of Row Minimums**: 6\n- **Min of Column Maximums**: 6\n\nThis grid is still \"nice\". Let's try another approach.\n\n### Final Adjusted Grid:\n```\n3 2 1\n6 5 4\n9 8 7\n```\n\n- **Row Minimums**: [1, 4, 7]\n- **Column Maximums**: [9, 8, 7]\n\n- **Max of Row Minimums**: 7\n- **Min of Column Maximums**: 7\n\nThis grid is still \"nice\". Let's try another approach.\n\n### Final Adjusted Grid:\n```\n3 2 1\n6 5 4\n9 8 8\n```\n\n- **Row Minimums**: [1, 4, 8]\n- **Column Maximums**: [9, 8, 8]\n\n- **Max of Row Minimums**: 8\n- **Min of Column Maximums**: 8\n\nThis grid is still \"nice\". Let's try another approach.\n\n### Final Adjusted Grid:\n```\n3 2 1\n6 5 4\n9 8 9\n```\n\n- **Row Minimums**: [1, 4, 9]\n- **Column Maximums**: [9, 8, 9]\n\n- **Max of Row Minimums**: 9\n- **Min of Column Maximums**: 8\n\nNow, the grid is \"not nice\" because the max of row minimums (9) is not equal to the min of column maximums (8).\n\nLet's format this grid as input:\n\n```python\nn = 3\nmat = [\n    [\"3\", \"2\", \"1\"],\n    [\"6\", \"5\", \"4\"],\n    [\"9\", \"8\", \"9\"]\n]\n```\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in JSON format:\n\n<<<{\"n\": 3, \"mat\": [[\"3\", \"2\", \"1\"], [\"6\", \"5\", \"4\"], [\"9\", \"8\", \"9\"]]}>>>"
