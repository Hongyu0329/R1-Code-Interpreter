    "To solve the problem of sorting class definitions such that parent classes appear before their child classes, we need to parse the class definitions, identify parent-child relationships, and then sort them accordingly.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Parse Class Definitions**: We need to extract the class name and its parent (if any) from each class definition. This can be done using regular expressions.\n\n2. **Build a Dependency Graph**: We will create a graph where each node represents a class, and a directed edge from node A to node B indicates that class A is a parent of class B.\n\n3. **Topological Sorting**: Once we have the graph, we can perform a topological sort to order the classes such that each parent class appears before its child classes.\n\n4. **Output the Sorted Classes**: Finally, we will output the class definitions in the sorted order.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom typing import List, Dict\n\ndef sort_classes(classes: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n    # Regular expression to parse class definitions\n    RE_CLASS = re.compile(r\"class\\s+(?P<class>\\w+)(\\((?P<parent>\\w*)\\))?\")\n    \n    # Parse the class definitions to build a graph\n    graph: Dict[str, List[str]] = {}\n    indegree: Dict[str, int] = {}\n    \n    for c in classes:\n        match = RE_CLASS.match(c)\n        if match:\n            class_name = match.group(\"class\")\n            parent_name = match.group(\"parent\") or \"\"\n            \n            if class_name not in graph:\n                graph[class_name] = []\n            if parent_name and parent_name not in graph:\n                graph[parent_name] = []\n            \n            if parent_name:\n                graph[parent_name].append(class_name)\n                indegree[class_name] = indegree.get(class_name, 0) + 1\n            else:\n                indegree[class_name] = indegree.get(class_name, 0)\n    \n    # Topological sort using Kahn's algorithm\n    sorted_classes = []\n    zero_indegree = [node for node in graph if indegree.get(node, 0) == 0]\n    \n    while zero_indegree:\n        node = zero_indegree.pop()\n        sorted_classes.append(node)\n        \n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            indegree[neighbor] -= 1\n            if indegree[neighbor] == 0:\n                zero_indegree.append(neighbor)\n    \n    # Convert sorted class names back to class definitions\n    class_definitions = {match.group(\"class\"): c for c in classes for match in [RE_CLASS.match(c)] if match}\n    return [class_definitions[class_name] for class_name in sorted_classes if class_name in class_definitions]\n\n# Test the function with the given input\nclasses = ['class B', 'class A(B)', 'class E', 'class G']\nsorted_classes = sort_classes(classes)\nprint(sorted_classes)\n```\n\nThis code will parse the class definitions, build a dependency graph, perform a topological sort, and then output the sorted class definitions. Let's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the sorted list of class definitions. The output indicates that the classes were sorted such that parent classes appear before their child classes. \n\nGiven the input `{'classes': ['class B', 'class A(B)', 'class E', 'class G']}`, the output is `['class G', 'class E', 'class B', 'class A(B)']`. This means that classes `G` and `E` have no dependencies, and class `B` is a parent of class `A`.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n<<<{'return': ['class G', 'class E', 'class B', 'class A(B)']}>>>"
