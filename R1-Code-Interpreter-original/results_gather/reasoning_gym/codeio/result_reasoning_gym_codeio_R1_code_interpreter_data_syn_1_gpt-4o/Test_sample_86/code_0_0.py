# Given equivalent capacitance values
equivalent_parallel = 132.5630677469462
equivalent_series = 31.072169392295184

# Calculate the sum of reciprocals for series capacitors
series_sum = 1 / equivalent_series

# Let's assume a simple case with two capacitors in series
# We need to solve: 1/C1 + 1/C2 = series_sum
# Let's assume C1 = C2 for simplicity, then 2/C1 = series_sum, C1 = 2/series_sum

C1 = 2 / series_sum
C2 = C1

# For parallel capacitors, we can choose a simple set of values that sum to the required equivalent capacitance
# Let's assume three capacitors with equal values for simplicity
C_parallel = equivalent_parallel / 3
