    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the input values for `capacitors_parallel` and `capacitors_series` that would result in the given output:\n\n```json\n{'equivalent_parallel': 132.5630677469462, 'equivalent_series': 31.072169392295184}\n```\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Parallel Capacitance Calculation:**\n   - The equivalent capacitance for capacitors in parallel is simply the sum of all capacitances.\n   - Given `equivalent_parallel = 132.5630677469462`, we need to find a set of non-negative capacitance values that sum up to this value.\n\n2. **Series Capacitance Calculation:**\n   - The equivalent capacitance for capacitors in series is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{equivalent}}} = \\sum \\frac{1}{C_i}\n     \\]\n   - Given `equivalent_series = 31.072169392295184`, we need to find a set of positive capacitance values such that the reciprocal of their reciprocals sums to this value.\n\n### Approach\n\n- For the parallel capacitors, we can choose a simple set of values that sum to the required equivalent capacitance.\n- For the series capacitors, we need to solve the equation:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{31.072169392295184} = \\sum \\frac{1}{C_i}\n  \\]\n  This requires a bit more calculation to find suitable values.\n\n### Calculation\n\nLet's start by calculating the series capacitance values using Python code to find a feasible set of values.\n\n```python\n# Given equivalent capacitance values\nequivalent_parallel = 132.5630677469462\nequivalent_series = 31.072169392295184\n\n# Calculate the sum of reciprocals for series capacitors\nseries_sum = 1 / equivalent_series\n\n# Let's assume a simple case with two capacitors in series\n# We need to solve: 1/C1 + 1/C2 = series_sum\n# Let's assume C1 = C2 for simplicity, then 2/C1 = series_sum, C1 = 2/series_sum\n\nC1 = 2 / series_sum\nC2 = C1\n\n# For parallel capacitors, we can choose a simple set of values that sum to the required equivalent capacitance\n# Let's assume three capacitors with equal values for simplicity\nC_parallel = equivalent_parallel / 3\n\n# Print the results\nprint({\n    \"capacitors_parallel\": [C_parallel, C_parallel, C_parallel],\n    \"capacitors_series\": [C1, C2]\n})\n```\n\nThis code will calculate a feasible set of input values for both parallel and series capacitors. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code execution provided us with a feasible set of input values for the capacitors in both parallel and series configurations. Let's summarize the results:\n\n- For the parallel configuration, we have three capacitors each with a capacitance of approximately 44.1877, which sum up to the required equivalent capacitance of 132.5631.\n- For the series configuration, we have two capacitors each with a capacitance of approximately 62.1443, which result in the required equivalent series capacitance of 31.0722.\n\nThese values satisfy the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\nHere is the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n<<<{\"capacitors_parallel\": [44.18768924898206, 44.18768924898206, 44.18768924898206], \"capacitors_series\": [62.14433878459037, 62.14433878459037]}>>>"
