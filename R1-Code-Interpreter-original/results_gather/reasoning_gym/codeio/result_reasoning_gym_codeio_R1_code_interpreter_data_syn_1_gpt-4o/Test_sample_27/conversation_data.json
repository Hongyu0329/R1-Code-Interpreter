    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the end coordinates of a vector given its components in the x and y directions, resistance, and altitude. The provided reference code snippet outlines a class `Vector` that handles these calculations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Vector Initialization**: \n   - The vector is initialized with components `cx` and `cy`.\n   - The magnitude of the vector is calculated using the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{magnitude} = \\sqrt{cx^2 + cy^2}\n     \\]\n   - The angle of the vector with respect to the positive x-axis is calculated using the `atan2` function.\n\n2. **Distance Calculation**:\n   - The time in flight is determined by two factors: altitude and resistance.\n   - Altitude time (`at`) is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     at = \\sqrt{\\frac{alt}{4.9}}\n     \\]\n   - Calculated time (`ot`) is determined by:\n     \\[\n     ot = \\sqrt{res^2 - \\text{magnitude}^2}\n     \\]\n   - The actual time used for distance calculation is the lesser of `at` and `ot`.\n   - The distance traveled by the vector is then:\n     \\[\n     \\text{distance} = \\frac{\\text{magnitude}}{2} \\times \\text{time}\n     \\]\n\n3. **End Coordinates Calculation**:\n   - The end coordinates are calculated using the distance and the angle:\n     \\[\n     x_{\\text{end}} = \\text{distance} \\times \\cos(\\text{angle})\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y_{\\text{end}} = \\text{distance} \\times \\sin(\\text{angle})\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in a Python script to compute the end coordinates for the given input values.\n\n```python\nfrom math import sqrt, cos, sin, atan2 as atan\n\nclass Vector:\n    def __init__(self, cx, cy):\n        self.compx = cx\n        self.compy = cy\n        self.mag = sqrt(abs(self.compx**2 + self.compy**2))\n        self.angle = atan(self.compy, self.compx)\n\n    def calcDist(self, res, alt):\n        at = sqrt(abs(alt/4.9))\n        ot = sqrt(abs(float(res)**2 - self.mag**2))\n        if at < ot:\n            return (self.mag / 2) * at\n        else:\n            return (self.mag / 2) * ot\n\n    def genDistCoor(self, res, alt):\n        vd = self.calcDist(res, alt)\n        return [vd*cos(self.angle), vd*sin(self.angle)]\n\ndef main_solution(cx, cy, res, alt):\n    vector = Vector(cx, cy)\n    result = vector.genDistCoor(res, alt)\n    return result\n\n# Given input\ninput_data = {'cx': -83.07813863062816, 'cy': 30.10843090078771, 'res': 91.90239164644267, 'alt': 136.16991674093114}\noutput = main_solution(input_data['cx'], input_data['cy'], input_data['res'], input_data['alt'])\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output.",
