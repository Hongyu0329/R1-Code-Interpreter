    "To solve the problem of sorting the pebbles in the order of red, white, and blue, we can use the Dutch National Flag algorithm. This algorithm is efficient for sorting an array with three distinct values and operates in linear time, O(n), with a constant space complexity.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing three pointers: `red`, `white`, and `blue`. The `red` pointer will track the boundary for red pebbles, `white` will track the current pebble being examined, and `blue` will track the boundary for blue pebbles.\n\n2. **Iterate through the array**: We iterate through the array using the `white` pointer. The loop continues until `white` is less than `blue`.\n\n3. **Check the color of the current pebble**:\n   - If the pebble is red ('r'), we swap it with the pebble at the `red` pointer, then increment both `red` and `white` pointers.\n   - If the pebble is white ('w'), we simply move the `white` pointer forward.\n   - If the pebble is blue ('b'), we swap it with the pebble at the `blue` pointer and decrement the `blue` pointer. We do not increment the `white` pointer in this case because the swapped pebble needs to be examined.\n\n4. **Continue until sorted**: The process continues until all pebbles are sorted into their respective zones: red, white, and blue.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python code to sort the given list of pebbles.\n\n```python\ndef sort_pebbles(arr):\n    red, white, blue = 0, 0, len(arr)\n    \n    while white < blue:\n        if arr[white] == 'r':\n            arr[red], arr[white] = arr[white], arr[red]\n            red += 1\n            white += 1\n        elif arr[white] == 'w':\n            white += 1\n        else:  # arr[white] == 'b'\n            blue -= 1\n            arr[white], arr[blue] = arr[blue], arr[white]\n    \n    return arr\n\n# Given input\narr = ['b', 'r', 'w', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'w', 'w', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'r', 'b', 'b', 'w', 'r', 'w', 'r', 'b']\nsorted_arr = sort_pebbles(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)\n```\n\nThis code will sort the pebbles in the desired order and print the sorted list. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and sorted the pebbles in the desired order: all red pebbles first, followed by white pebbles, and then blue pebbles. The output matches the expected result based on the Dutch National Flag algorithm.\n\nGiven the input list of pebbles, the sorted output is:\n\n<<<{'return': ['r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'w', 'w', 'w', 'w', 'w', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b']}>>>"
