    "To determine a feasible input for the given output, we need to reverse-engineer the prime factorization process. The output provided is:\n\n```\n[('2', 4), ('3', 2), ('5', 1)]\n```\n\nThis indicates that the number is composed of the prime factors 2, 3, and 5, with exponents 4, 2, and 1, respectively. To find the original number, we need to multiply these prime factors raised to their respective powers:\n\n- \\(2^4 = 16\\)\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n- \\(5^1 = 5\\)\n\nThe original number is the product of these values:\n\n\\[ 16 \\times 9 \\times 5 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this product to find the feasible input number.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of the prime factors raised to their respective powers\nnumber = (2**4) * (3**2) * (5**1)\nprint(number)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we find that the feasible input number is 720. Therefore, the JSON object representing the input is:\n\n<<<{\"number\": 720}>>>",
