    "To solve the problem, we need to determine the initial phase at the origin for the given wave equation. The wave equation is given as:\n\n\\[ y(x, t) = A \\sin(wt + kx + \\pi/d) \\]\n\nThe initial phase at the origin is the phase of the wave when both \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( t = 0 \\). This is given by the term \\(\\pi/d\\).\n\nGiven the input parameters:\n- `amp`: 92.72325896582053 cm\n- `w`: 15.319861665440387 rad/s\n- `k`: 7.013704281390573 cm^-1\n- `div`: 4\n- `types`: 4\n\nSince the query type is 4, we need to find the initial phase at the origin. The initial phase is simply \\(\\pi/d\\), which in this case is \\(\\pi/4\\).\n\nLet's proceed to calculate and format the output as required.\n\n```python\n# Given input parameters\namp = 92.72325896582053\nw = 15.319861665440387\nk = 7.013704281390573\ndiv = 4\ntypes = 4\n\n# Calculate the initial phase\nif types == 4:\n    initial_phase = f\"π/{div}\"\n    result = {\"type\": \"initial phase\", \"value\": initial_phase}\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the expected result. The initial phase at the origin is \\(\\pi/4\\).\n\nBased on the input and the query type, the final answer is:\n\n<<<{\"type\": \"initial phase\", \"value\": \"π/4\"}>>>"
