    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse-engineer the given HD-Ratio value to find feasible input values for `TLA`, `P`, and `AP`. The HD-Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{HD-Ratio} = \\frac{\\log(\\text{AP})}{\\log(T)} \\]\n\nwhere \\( T = 2^{(P - TLA)} \\).\n\nGiven the HD-Ratio value of 0.9469858077906315, we need to find values for `TLA`, `P`, and `AP` that satisfy this equation. \n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Choose a reasonable range for `TLA` and `P`:** \n   - `TLA` and `P` are typically in the range of 0 to 128 for IPv6 addresses.\n   - `P` should be greater than `TLA` to ensure a positive power of 2.\n\n2. **Calculate `T` and `AP`:**\n   - For each combination of `TLA` and `P`, calculate `T = 2^{(P - TLA)}`.\n   - Use the given HD-Ratio to solve for `AP` using the formula: \n     \\[ \\text{AP} = T^{\\text{HD-Ratio}} \\]\n\n3. **Check for integer `AP`:**\n   - Since `AP` must be an integer, we need to ensure that the calculated `AP` is a whole number.\n\n4. **Iterate over possible values:**\n   - Iterate over possible values of `TLA` and `P` to find a combination that results in an integer `AP` and matches the given HD-Ratio.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find a feasible set of inputs.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_feasible_inputs(target_hd_ratio):\n    for TLA in range(0, 128):\n        for P in range(TLA + 1, 129):  # P must be greater than TLA\n            T = math.pow(2, (P - TLA))\n            AP = math.pow(T, target_hd_ratio)\n            if AP.is_integer():\n                return TLA, P, int(AP)\n\ntarget_hd_ratio = 0.9469858077906315\nTLA, P, AP = find_feasible_inputs(target_hd_ratio)\nprint({\"TLA\": TLA, \"P\": P, \"AP\": AP})\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over possible values of `TLA` and `P`, calculate `AP`, and check if it is an integer. Once it finds a valid combination, it will return the values. Let's execute this code to find the feasible inputs.",
    "The code execution has provided us with a feasible set of inputs that match the given HD-Ratio. The values are:\n\n- `TLA`: 0\n- `P`: 55\n- `AP`: 4774329062595789\n\nThese values satisfy the condition for the HD-Ratio calculation as per the given formula. Therefore, the feasible input set is:\n\n<<<{\"TLA\": 0, \"P\": 55, \"AP\": 4774329062595789}>>>"
