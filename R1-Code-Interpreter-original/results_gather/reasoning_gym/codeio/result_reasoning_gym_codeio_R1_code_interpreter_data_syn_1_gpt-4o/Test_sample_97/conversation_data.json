    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the room numbers in a maze based on the type of maze factory specified. The input specifies the type of maze as either \"maze\" for a regular maze or \"enchanted\" for an enchanted maze. The output should be a dictionary with a key \"room_numbers\" containing a list of integers representing the room numbers.\n\nFrom the reference code snippet, we can see that there are two types of factories: `MazeFactory` for a regular maze and `EnchantedMazeFactroy` for an enchanted maze. Both factories create a maze with two rooms, numbered 1 and 2. The main difference between the two factories is the type of rooms and doors they create, but the room numbers remain the same.\n\nGiven the input `{'factory_type': 'enchanted'}`, we need to use the `EnchantedMazeFactroy` to create the maze. The `create_maze` method in the `MazeGame` class will create two rooms with numbers 1 and 2, regardless of whether the maze is regular or enchanted.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate this process and obtain the room numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the necessary classes and methods as per the reference code\nclass MapSide:\n    def enter(self):\n        raise NotImplementedError('Doesn\"t implemented yet')\n\nclass Direction:\n    North = 0\n    South = 1\n    East = 2\n    West = 3\n\nclass Room(MapSide):\n    def __init__(self, roomNo):\n        self._roomNumber = int(roomNo)\n        self._sides = [MapSide]*4\n\n    def enter(self):\n        pass\n\n    def set_side(self, Direction, MapSide):\n        self._sides[Direction] = MapSide\n\n    def get_side(self, Direction):\n        return self._sides[Direction]\n\nclass Wall(MapSide):\n    def enter(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Door(MapSide):\n    def __init__(self, Room1=None, Room2=None):\n        self._room1 = Room1\n        self._room2 = Room2\n        self._isOpen = False\n\n    def enter(self):\n        pass\n\n    def other_side(self, Room):\n        if 1 == Room._roomNumber:\n            other_room = self._room2\n        else:\n            other_room = self._room1\n        return other_room\n\nclass Maze:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._rooms = {}\n\n    def set_room(self, room):\n        self._rooms[room._roomNumber] = room\n\n    def get_room_number(self, room_number):\n        return self._rooms[room_number]\n\nclass MazeFactory:\n    @classmethod\n    def make_maze(cls):\n        return Maze()\n\n    @classmethod\n    def make_wall(cls):\n        return Wall()\n\n    @classmethod\n    def make_door(cls, r1, r2):\n        return Door(r1, r2)\n\n    @classmethod\n    def make_room(cls, rN):\n        return Room(rN)\n\nclass Spell:\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return \"a hard coded spell !!     \"\n\nclass EnchantedDoor(Door):\n    def __init__(self, r1, r2):\n        super(EnchantedDoor, self).__init__(r1, r2)\n        self.spell = Spell()\n\n    def enter(self):\n        pass\n\nclass EnchantedRoom(Room):\n    def __init__(self, roomNo, aSpell):\n        super(EnchantedRoom, self).__init__(roomNo)\n\nclass EnchantedMazeFactroy(MazeFactory):\n    @classmethod\n    def cast_spell(cls):\n        return Spell()\n\n    @classmethod\n    def make_door(cls, r1, r2):\n        return EnchantedDoor(r1, r2)\n\n    @classmethod\n    def make_room(cls, n):\n        return EnchantedRoom(n, cls.cast_spell())\n\nclass MazeGame:\n    def create_maze(self, factory=MazeFactory):\n        maze = factory.make_maze()\n        room1 = factory.make_room(1)\n        room2 = factory.make_room(2)\n        door = factory.make_door(room1, room2)\n\n        maze.set_room(room1)\n        maze.set_room(room2)\n\n        room1.set_side(Direction.North, factory.make_wall())\n        room1.set_side(Direction.South, factory.make_wall())\n        room1.set_side(Direction.East, door)\n        room1.set_side(Direction.West, factory.make_wall())\n\n        room2.set_side(Direction.North, factory.make_wall())\n        room2.set_side(Direction.South, factory.make_wall())\n        room2.set_side(Direction.East, factory.make_wall())\n        room2.set_side(Direction.West, door)\n\n        return maze\n\ndef main_solution(factory_type):\n    factory_type = factory_type.lower()\n    if factory_type == \"maze\":\n        factory = MazeFactory\n    elif factory_type == \"enchanted\":\n        factory = EnchantedMazeFactroy\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid factory type\")\n\n    maze_game = MazeGame()\n    maze = maze_game.create_maze(factory)\n\n    maze_rooms = []\n    for room_number in range(1, 3):\n        room = maze.get_room_number(room_number)\n        maze_rooms.append(room._roomNumber)\n\n    return {\"room_numbers\": maze_rooms}\n\n# Execute the main solution with the given input\noutput = main_solution('enchanted')\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThe code above will simulate the creation of an enchanted maze and return the room numbers. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code execution has provided the output `{'room_numbers': [1, 2]}` without any errors. This indicates that the enchanted maze, as expected, contains two rooms with numbers 1 and 2. The type of maze (regular or enchanted) does not affect the room numbers, only the type of rooms and doors.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the given input is:\n\n<<<{'room_numbers': [1, 2]}>>>"
