    "To solve this problem, we need to implement a greedy knapsack algorithm. The greedy approach involves selecting items based on the highest profit-to-weight ratio until the knapsack is full or no more items can be added without exceeding the maximum weight.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: \n   - Check if `max_weight` is greater than zero. If not, raise a `ValueError`.\n   - Ensure that the lengths of `profit` and `weight` lists are equal. If not, raise an `IndexError`.\n   - Check for negative values in `profit` and `weight` lists. If any are found, raise a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Greedy Algorithm**:\n   - Pair each item's profit with its weight.\n   - Calculate the profit-to-weight ratio for each item.\n   - Sort the items in descending order based on their profit-to-weight ratio.\n   - Initialize `total_profit` to zero and `remaining_weight` to `max_weight`.\n   - Iterate over the sorted items:\n     - If the current item's weight is less than or equal to the remaining weight, add its full profit to `total_profit` and decrease the `remaining_weight` by the item's weight.\n     - If the current item's weight is more than the remaining weight, add a fraction of its profit proportional to the remaining weight and break the loop.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - Return the `total_profit` as a dictionary with the key `\"total_profit\"`.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python code to compute the result.\n\n```python\ndef greedy_knapsack(profit, weight, max_weight):\n    if max_weight <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"max_weight must be greater than zero.\")\n    if len(profit) != len(weight):\n        raise IndexError(\"The length of profit and weight must be the same.\")\n    if any(p < 0 for p in profit):\n        raise ValueError(\"Profit cannot be negative.\")\n    if any(w < 0 for w in weight):\n        raise ValueError(\"Weight cannot be negative.\")\n    \n    # Greedy knapsack algorithm\n    items = list(zip(profit, weight))\n    items.sort(key=lambda x: x[0] / x[1], reverse=True)\n    \n    total_profit = 0\n    remaining_weight = max_weight\n    \n    for p, w in items:\n        if remaining_weight >= w:\n            total_profit += p\n            remaining_weight -= w\n        else:\n            total_profit += (p / w) * remaining_weight\n            break\n    \n    return {\"total_profit\": total_profit}\n\n# Given input\ninput_data = {'profit': [12, 80, 86, 96, 82, 66, 5, 81, 48], 'weight': [57, 68, 14, 88, 59, 77, 37, 49, 95], 'max_weight': 158}\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = greedy_knapsack(input_data['profit'], input_data['weight'], input_data['max_weight'])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total profit.",
    "Based on the execution of the code, the total profit calculated by the greedy knapsack algorithm is approximately 291.35. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<{\"total_profit\": 291.3529411764706}>>>"
