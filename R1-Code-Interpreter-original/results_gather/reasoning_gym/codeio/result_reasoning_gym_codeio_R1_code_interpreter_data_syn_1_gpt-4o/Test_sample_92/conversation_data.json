    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the simplest pattern of letters and numbers that can generate at least the given number of unique license plates. We also need to find patterns that generate the closest number of plates less than and more than the population.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Pattern Representation**: \n   - \"N\" represents a digit (0-9), so it has 10 possibilities.\n   - \"L\" represents a letter (A-Z), so it has 26 possibilities.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Plates for a Pattern**:\n   - For a given pattern, the total number of plates is the product of the possibilities for each character in the pattern. For example, \"NNL\" would be 10 * 10 * 26.\n\n3. **Determine the Simplest Pattern**:\n   - Start with the simplest pattern and gradually increase the complexity until the total number of plates is at least equal to the population.\n   - The simplest pattern is the one with the fewest characters that meets or exceeds the population requirement.\n\n4. **Find Patterns with Closest Number of Plates**:\n   - Track patterns that generate the closest number of plates less than and more than the population.\n\n5. **Calculate Excess Plates**:\n   - The excess plates are the difference between the total plates generated by the simplest pattern and the population.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to find the required patterns and numbers.\n\n```python\ndef total_plates(pattern):\n    total = 1\n    for p in pattern:\n        if p == \"N\":\n            total *= 10\n        elif p == \"L\":\n            total *= 26\n    return total\n\ndef main_solution(population):\n    # Start with the simplest pattern\n    patterns = [\"\"]\n    while True:\n        new_patterns = []\n        for pattern in patterns:\n            new_patterns.append(pattern + \"N\")\n            new_patterns.append(pattern + \"L\")\n        \n        # Calculate total plates for each new pattern\n        pattern_totals = [(total_plates(p), p) for p in new_patterns]\n        pattern_totals.sort()\n        \n        # Find the simplest pattern that meets or exceeds the population\n        for total, pattern in pattern_totals:\n            if total >= population:\n                # Find previous and next patterns\n                previous_pattern = \"\"\n                next_pattern = \"\"\n                for t, p in pattern_totals:\n                    if t < population:\n                        previous_pattern = p\n                    if t > total:\n                        next_pattern = p\n                        break\n                \n                return {\n                    \"pattern\": pattern,\n                    \"total_plates\": total,\n                    \"excess_plates\": total - population,\n                    \"previous_pattern\": previous_pattern,\n                    \"next_pattern\": next_pattern\n                }\n        \n        # Update patterns for the next iteration\n        patterns = new_patterns\n\n# Given input\npopulation = 574888\nresult = main_solution(population)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will determine the simplest pattern that generates enough license plates for the given population, along with the required additional information.
