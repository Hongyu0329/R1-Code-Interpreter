    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the z-scores for the total service time of 50 customers when the total service time is between 90.17244564075081 and 103.12187270811205 minutes. The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean.\n\nGiven:\n- Mean service time for a single customer (`mean`) = 2.0 minutes\n- Standard deviation of the service time for a single customer (`standard_deviation`) = 1.0 minute\n- Number of customers (`n`) = 50\n- Lower bound of the total service time range (`x1`) = 90.17244564075081 minutes\n- Upper bound of the total service time range (`x2`) = 103.12187270811205 minutes\n\nThe total service time for 50 customers is normally distributed with:\n- Mean = `mean * n`\n- Standard deviation = `standard_deviation * sqrt(n)`\n\nThe z-score for a value `x` is calculated as:\n\\[ z = \\frac{x - \\text{mean}}{\\text{standard deviation}} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the z-scores for `x1` and `x2` using the formula above.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_z_scores(mean, standard_deviation, n, x1, x2):\n    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the total service time\n    total_mean = mean * n\n    total_std_dev = standard_deviation * math.sqrt(n)\n    \n    # Calculate the z-scores for x1 and x2\n    z_score1 = (x1 - total_mean) / total_std_dev\n    z_score2 = (x2 - total_mean) / total_std_dev\n    \n    # Return the z-scores as a tuple\n    return (z_score1, z_score2)\n\n# Given input\nmean = 2.0\nstandard_deviation = 1.0\nn = 50\nx1 = 90.17244564075081\nx2 = 103.12187270811205\n\n# Calculate and print the z-scores\nz_scores = calculate_z_scores(mean, standard_deviation, n, x1, x2)\nprint(z_scores)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the z-scores.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the z-scores for the given total service time range. Based on the output, the z-scores corresponding to the lower and upper bounds of the total service time range are approximately -1.39 and 0.44, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n<<<{\"return\": (-1.3898260659809039, 0.44149947238144843)}>>>"
