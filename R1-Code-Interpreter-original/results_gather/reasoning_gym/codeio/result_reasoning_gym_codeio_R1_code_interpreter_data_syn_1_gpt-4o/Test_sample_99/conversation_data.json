    "To solve this problem, we need to categorize each number in the list based on its deviation from the mean in terms of standard deviation. The steps involved are:\n\n1. **Calculate the Mean**: Compute the average of the numbers in the list.\n2. **Calculate the Standard Deviation**: \n   - First, find the variance by averaging the squared differences from the mean.\n   - Then, take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation.\n3. **Categorize the Numbers**:\n   - **Normal Numbers**: Numbers that are within one standard deviation from the mean.\n   - **Extra Big Numbers**: Numbers that are greater than one standard deviation above the mean.\n   - **Extra Small Numbers**: Numbers that are more than one standard deviation below the mean.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the required categories.\n\n```python\nfrom math import sqrt\n\ndef categorize_numbers(nums):\n    # Calculate the mean\n    mean = sum(nums) / len(nums)\n    \n    # Calculate the variance\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in nums) / len(nums)\n    \n    # Calculate the standard deviation\n    std_dev = sqrt(variance)\n    \n    # Categorize the numbers\n    normal_numbers = [x for x in nums if abs(x - mean) <= std_dev]\n    extra_big_numbers = [x for x in nums if x - mean > std_dev]\n    extra_small_numbers = [x for x in nums if x - mean < -std_dev]\n    \n    # Return the results as a dictionary\n    return {\n        \"normal_numbers\": normal_numbers,\n        \"extra_big_numbers\": extra_big_numbers,\n        \"extra_small_numbers\": extra_small_numbers\n    }\n\n# Given input\nnums = [53.97366361021801, -82.48259366616612, -42.6352232441785, -21.905306310778542, \n        79.13526911018428, -30.381397060980447, 18.76947427602687, -79.93390603373491, \n        -65.62567469157383, 39.833959476415316, 10.605488245064024, 44.07593751845124, \n        -11.651070449344815, -2.1992433840271985, -59.903347571813214, -55.31982102377802]\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nresult = categorize_numbers(nums)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the output.",
