    "To solve this problem, we need to add two tonal values, one with an octave designation and another without, and return the resulting tonal value. The tonal values are represented as lists, where the first list includes the diatonic value, chromatic value, and octave designation, and the second list includes only the diatonic and chromatic values.\n\nThe process involves:\n1. Adding the diatonic values from both lists.\n2. Adding the chromatic values from both lists.\n3. Adjusting the octave based on the diatonic addition.\n\nThe constants for diatonic and chromatic lengths are 7 and 12, respectively. These constants are used to normalize the diatonic and chromatic values.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n- Add the diatonic values: `d_sum = x[0] + y[0]`\n- Add the chromatic values: `c_sum = x[1] + y[1]`\n- Normalize the diatonic value: `d_val = d_sum % D_LEN`\n- Calculate the additional octave from the diatonic addition: `d_oct = d_sum // D_LEN`\n- Normalize the chromatic value: `c_val = c_sum % C_LEN`\n- Calculate the resulting octave: `o_val = x[2] + d_oct`\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in a Python script to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nD_LEN = 7  # Diatonic length\nC_LEN = 12  # Chromatic length\n\n# Input values\nx = [-50, -48, 89]\ny = [64, -49]\n\n# Compute the tonal sum\nd_sum = x[0] + y[0]\nc_sum = x[1] + y[1]\n\n# Normalize the diatonic and chromatic values\nd_val = d_sum % D_LEN\nd_oct = d_sum // D_LEN\nc_val = c_sum % C_LEN\n\n# Calculate the resulting octave\no_val = x[2] + d_oct\n\n# Resulting tonal value\nresult = [d_val, c_val, o_val]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the resulting tonal value.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `[0, 11, 91]`. This output represents the resulting tonal value after adding the two given tonal values.\n\nThe reasoning and calculations were as follows:\n- The diatonic sum was calculated and normalized using the diatonic length (7).\n- The chromatic sum was calculated and normalized using the chromatic length (12).\n- The octave was adjusted based on the diatonic addition.\n\nThe final result is `[0, 11, 91]`.\n\n<<<[0, 11, 91]>>>"
