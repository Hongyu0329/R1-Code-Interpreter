    "To solve this problem, we need to determine a feasible input that would result in the output `[1991, 1991]`. This means that the year 1991 had the highest number of authors active simultaneously, and no other period had more authors active.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We need to create a list of authors with their active periods such that the year 1991 has the highest number of active authors.\n2. If multiple years have the same number of active authors, 1991 should be the earliest year among them.\n\nTo achieve this, we can start by considering a few authors and their active periods. We need to ensure that 1991 is included in the active period of the maximum number of authors.\n\nLet's consider the following steps:\n\n- We can have several authors whose active periods include the year 1991.\n- We need to ensure that no other year has more authors active than 1991.\n\nLet's construct a feasible input:\n\n- Author A: Active from 1990 to 1991\n- Author B: Active from 1991 to 1992\n- Author C: Active from 1991 to 1991\n\nIn this setup:\n- In 1990, only Author A is active.\n- In 1991, Authors A, B, and C are active.\n- In 1992, only Author B is active.\n\nThus, 1991 has the highest number of active authors, which is 3, and it is the earliest year with this count.\n\nNow, let's represent this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bio_data\": [\n    [\"Author A\", 1990, 1991],\n    [\"Author B\", 1991, 1992],\n    [\"Author C\", 1991, 1991]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis input should result in the output `[1991, 1991]`.\n\n<<<{\"bio_data\": [[\"Author A\", 1990, 1991], [\"Author B\", 1991, 1992], [\"Author C\", 1991, 1991]]}>>>"
