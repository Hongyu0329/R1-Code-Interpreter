    "To solve the problem of generating Demlo numbers for a given number of rows `n`, we need to understand the pattern of Demlo numbers. A Demlo number for a given row `i` is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Demlo number} = \\left(\\frac{10^i}{9}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nThis formula generates a sequence of numbers where each number is a square of a repunit (a number consisting of repeated units of 1). For example, for `i = 1`, the Demlo number is 1, for `i = 2`, it is 121, and so on.\n\nGiven the input `n = 7`, we need to generate Demlo numbers for rows 1 through 7. Let's calculate these numbers using the formula and return them as a list.\n\nHere's the Python code to compute the sequence of Demlo numbers:\n\n```python\ndef generate_demlo_numbers(n):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        demlo_number = ((10**i) // 9)**2\n        result.append(demlo_number)\n    return result\n\n# Given input\nn = 7\n# Generate Demlo numbers\noutput = generate_demlo_numbers(n)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the Demlo numbers for each row from 1 to 7 and print the result. Let's execute this code to get the output.",
