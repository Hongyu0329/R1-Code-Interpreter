    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the input values for `ncenters` and `deriv_order` that would result in the given output shapes for the lookup arrays. The given output is:\n\n```python\n{'lookup_forward_shape': (3, 1), 'lookup_backward_shape': (3,)}\n```\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Shapes:**\n   - `lookup_forward_shape`: This is `(3, 1)`, which suggests that the forward lookup array has 3 rows and 1 column.\n   - `lookup_backward_shape`: This is `(3,)`, which suggests that the backward lookup array is a 1D array with 3 elements.\n\n2. **Relating Shapes to Inputs:**\n   - The `lookup_forward_shape` is determined by the number of derivatives (`nderivs`) and the `deriv_order`. Specifically, it is `(nderivs, deriv_order)`.\n   - The `lookup_backward_shape` is determined by the number of differentiable parameters raised to the power of `deriv_order`. Specifically, it is `(nparams ** deriv_order,)`.\n\n3. **Deriving the Inputs:**\n   - From `lookup_forward_shape = (3, 1)`, we can infer:\n     - `nderivs = 3`\n     - `deriv_order = 1`\n   - From `lookup_backward_shape = (3,)`, we can infer:\n     - `nparams ** deriv_order = 3`\n     - Since `deriv_order = 1`, it follows that `nparams = 3`.\n\n4. **Relating `nparams` to `ncenters`:**\n   - `nparams` is calculated as `ncenters * 3`.\n   - Given `nparams = 3`, we can solve for `ncenters`:\n     - `ncenters * 3 = 3`\n     - `ncenters = 1`\n\nThus, the feasible input values are `ncenters = 1` and `deriv_order = 1`.\n\nLet's verify this reasoning with a Python script to ensure the calculations align with the given output shapes.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\nfrom itertools import combinations_with_replacement\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef how_many_derivs(k, n):\n    val = 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        val *= (3 * k + i)\n    return int((1 / math.factorial(n)) * val)\n\ndef generate_buffer_lookup(nparams, deriv_order):\n    dimensions = (nparams,) * deriv_order \n    buffer_index_lookup = np.zeros(dimensions, dtype=int)\n    count = 0\n    for idx in combinations_with_replacement(np.arange(nparams), deriv_order):\n        for perm in permutations(idx):\n            buffer_index_lookup[perm] = count\n        count += 1\n    return buffer_index_lookup\n\ndef generate_multi_index_lookup(nparams, deriv_order, nderivs):\n    lookup = np.zeros((nderivs, deriv_order), int)\n    idx = 0\n    for indices in combinations_with_replacement(np.arange(nparams), deriv_order):\n        for i in range(len(indices)):\n            lookup[idx, i] = indices[i]\n        idx += 1\n    return lookup\n\ndef main_solution(ncenters, deriv_order):\n    ncenters = int(ncenters)\n    deriv_order = int(deriv_order)\n    \n    nderivs = how_many_derivs(ncenters, deriv_order)\n    nparams = ncenters * 3\n    \n    lookup_forward = generate_multi_index_lookup(nparams, deriv_order, nderivs)\n    lookup_backward = generate_buffer_lookup(nparams, deriv_order)\n    \n    return {\n        \"lookup_forward_shape\": lookup_forward.shape,\n        \"lookup_backward_shape\": lookup_backward.shape\n    }\n\n# Test the function with the inferred inputs\nresult = main_solution(1, 1)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we should verify that the output matches the given shapes. If it does, we can confidently provide the input values.\n\n<<<{\"ncenters\": 1, \"deriv_order\": 1}>>>"
