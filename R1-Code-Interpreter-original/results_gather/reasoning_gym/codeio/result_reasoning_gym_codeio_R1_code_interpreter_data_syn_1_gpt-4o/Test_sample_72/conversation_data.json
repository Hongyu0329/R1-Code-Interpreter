    "To solve this problem, we need to generate white noise using a specific random seed and then compute the inner products of this white noise with two cosine functions of different frequencies. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Random Seed**: This ensures that the white noise generated is reproducible.\n\n2. **Generate White Noise**: Using the Box-Mueller transform, we generate a sequence of normally distributed random numbers (white noise).\n\n3. **Compute Inner Products**: For each frequency, compute the inner product of the white noise with a cosine function of that frequency. The cosine function is defined as `cos(freq * 2 * pi * (i + 0.5) / 16)` for each element `i` in the white noise sequence.\n\n4. **Return the Results**: The results are returned as a dictionary containing the inner products for the two frequencies.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the required inner products.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport random\n\nclass BoxMueller:\n    call_count = 0\n    second_random_variable = 0.0\n    \n    @classmethod\n    def randn(cls):\n        cls.call_count += 1\n        if cls.call_count % 2 == 0:\n            return cls.second_random_variable\n        \n        u1 = 1.0 - random.random()\n        u2 = 1.0 - random.random()\n        c = math.sqrt(-2.0 * math.log(u1))\n        cls.second_random_variable = c * math.sin(2 * math.pi * u2)\n        return c * math.cos(2 * math.pi * u2)\n\ndef main_solution(seed, freq_1, freq_2):\n    random.seed(seed)\n    \n    white_noise = [BoxMueller.randn() for _ in range(16)]\n    \n    inner_product_1 = sum(math.cos(freq_1 * 2.0 * math.pi * (i + 0.5) / 16.0) * white_noise[i] for i in range(16))\n    inner_product_2 = sum(math.cos(freq_2 * 2.0 * math.pi * (i + 0.5) / 16.0) * white_noise[i] for i in range(16))\n    \n    return {\n        \"inner_product_1\": inner_product_1,\n        \"inner_product_2\": inner_product_2\n    }\n\n# Given input\ninput_data = {'seed': 914215, 'freq_1': 3, 'freq_2': 6}\n\n# Calculate the output\noutput = main_solution(input_data['seed'], input_data['freq_1'], input_data['freq_2'])\n\n# Print the output\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the white noise and compute the inner products for the given frequencies.
