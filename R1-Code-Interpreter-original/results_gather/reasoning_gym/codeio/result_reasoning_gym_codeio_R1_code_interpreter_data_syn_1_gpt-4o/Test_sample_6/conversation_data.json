    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value in a list of numbers using an iterative approach. The list can contain both integers and floats. If the list is empty, we should raise a `ValueError`. The result should be returned as a dictionary with the key `max_value`.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Check for Empty List**: If the list is empty, raise a `ValueError`.\n2. **Initialize Maximum Value**: Start by assuming the first element is the maximum.\n3. **Iterate Through the List**: Compare each element with the current maximum. If an element is greater, update the maximum.\n4. **Return the Result**: Once the iteration is complete, return the maximum value found in the list as a dictionary.\n\nGiven the input list `{'nums': [9, 93, 85, -74, -84, -7, 78, 18, -5, -89, 55, 70, -57, 51]}`, we will implement the above logic in Python to find the maximum value.\n\nLet's write the code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_iterative(nums):\n    if len(nums) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"find_max_iterative() arg is an empty sequence\")\n    max_num = nums[0]\n    for x in nums:\n        if x > max_num:\n            max_num = x\n    return {\"max_value\": max_num}\n\n# Given input\ninput_data = {'nums': [9, 93, 85, -74, -84, -7, 78, 18, -5, -89, 55, 70, -57, 51]}\n# Find the maximum value\nresult = find_max_iterative(input_data['nums'])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will iterate through the list, find the maximum value, and return it in the required format. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the maximum value from the list as expected. The output is a dictionary with the key `max_value` and the value being the maximum number found in the list.\n\nGiven the input list `{'nums': [9, 93, 85, -74, -84, -7, 78, 18, -5, -89, 55, 70, -57, 51]}`, the maximum value is `93`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n<<<{'max_value': 93}>>>"
