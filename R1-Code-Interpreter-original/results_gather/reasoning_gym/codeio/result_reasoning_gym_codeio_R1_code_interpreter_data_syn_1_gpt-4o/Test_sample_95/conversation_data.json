    "To solve this problem, we need to apply a 1st order low-pass filter to the given set of altitude measurements. The low-pass filter is used to smooth out noise while still tracking the variations in the data. The filter is defined by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{filtered\\_value} = \\alpha \\times \\text{previous\\_estimate} + (1 - \\alpha) \\times \\text{current\\_data\\_point} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\alpha\\) is the smoothing factor.\n- \\(\\text{previous\\_estimate}\\) is the last filtered value.\n- \\(\\text{current\\_data\\_point}\\) is the current measurement from the data.\n\nThe process involves iterating over each data point, applying the filter, and storing the result as the new estimate for the next iteration.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the filtered data points.\n\n```python\ndef apply_low_pass_filter(alpha, data):\n    def low_pass_filter(estimate, data_point):\n        return alpha * estimate + (1 - alpha) * data_point\n    \n    prev_estimate = None\n    estimates = []\n    \n    for data_point in data:\n        if prev_estimate is None:\n            prev_estimate = data_point\n        curr_estimate = low_pass_filter(prev_estimate, data_point)\n        estimates.append(curr_estimate)\n        prev_estimate = curr_estimate\n    \n    return estimates\n\n# Given input\nalpha = 0.904117613966948\ndata = [2.356670074042777, 26.820999339315932, 20.302836155984437, 22.672000750298448, 67.47577016648839, 86.93088139161189, 92.29449578379234, 38.137952202092215]\n\n# Calculate the filtered data\nfiltered_data = apply_low_pass_filter(alpha, data)\nprint(filtered_data)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the filtered altitude estimates for the given measurements using the specified smoothing factor `alpha`.
