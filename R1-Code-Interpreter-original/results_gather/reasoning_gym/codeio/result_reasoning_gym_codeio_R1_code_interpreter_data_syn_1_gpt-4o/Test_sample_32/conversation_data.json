    "To determine the value of \\( k \\) that ensures the function is continuous at \\( x = 5 \\), we need to ensure that the left-hand limit (LHL) and the right-hand limit (RHL) of the function at \\( x = 5 \\) are equal.\n\nThe function is defined as:\n- \\( f(x) = k \\cdot x + 1 \\) for \\( x \\leq 5 \\)\n- \\( f(x) = 3 \\cdot x - 5 \\) for \\( x > 5 \\)\n\nFor continuity at \\( x = 5 \\), the following must hold:\n\\[ \\lim_{x \\to 5^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 5^+} f(x) \\]\n\nCalculating these limits:\n- LHL: \\( \\lim_{x \\to 5^-} (k \\cdot x + 1) = k \\cdot 5 + 1 \\)\n- RHL: \\( \\lim_{x \\to 5^+} (3 \\cdot x - 5) = 3 \\cdot 5 - 5 = 15 - 5 = 10 \\)\n\nSetting LHL equal to RHL for continuity:\n\\[ k \\cdot 5 + 1 = 10 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\\[ 5k + 1 = 10 \\]\n\\[ 5k = 9 \\]\n\\[ k = \\frac{9}{5} = 1.8 \\]\n\nGiven the output of 1.8, we can deduce that the function is continuous at \\( x = 5 \\) when \\( k = 1.8 \\).\n\nNow, we need to predict a feasible input for the given output. The input variable is `delta`, which is a small positive number used to calculate the limits. The value of `delta` does not affect the calculation of \\( k \\) directly, as it is used to approach the limit. Therefore, any small positive number can be a feasible input for `delta`.\n\nA common choice for such a small number is 0.01. Therefore, the feasible input for `delta` is 0.01.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the predicted input:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delta\": 0.01\n}\n```"
