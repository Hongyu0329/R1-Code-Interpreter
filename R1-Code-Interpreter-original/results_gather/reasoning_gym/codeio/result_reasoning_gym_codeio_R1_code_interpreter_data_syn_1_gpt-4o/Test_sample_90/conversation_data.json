    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the scores of players in a prediction market based on their bids and the final outcome. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Market**: Start with the house's initial bid.\n2. **Add Player Bids**: Each player places a bid, which is added to the market.\n3. **Close the Market**: No more bids can be placed once the market is closed.\n4. **Resolve the Market**: Determine the scores based on the final outcome.\n\nThe scoring is based on the logarithmic difference between consecutive bids. If the outcome is `True`, the bids are used as they are. If the outcome is `False`, the complement of the bids (1 - bid) is used. The score for each player is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{score} = 100 \\times (\\log_2(\\text{current bid}) - \\log_2(\\text{previous bid})) \\]\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the scores for the given input.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport collections\n\ndef calculate_scores(market_name, house_bid, player_bids, outcome):\n    # Initialize the market with the house bid\n    bids = [('House', house_bid)]\n    results = collections.defaultdict(float)\n    \n    # Add player bids\n    for player, bid in player_bids:\n        bids.append((player, bid))\n    \n    # Resolve the market\n    if not outcome:\n        # If the outcome is False, use the complement of the bids\n        bids = [(player, 1 - bid) for player, bid in bids]\n    \n    # Calculate scores\n    _, last_bid = bids[0]\n    for player, bid in bids[1:]:\n        log_prob = math.log(bid, 2)\n        log_prob_last = math.log(last_bid, 2)\n        score = 100 * (log_prob - log_prob_last)\n        results[player] += score\n        last_bid = bid\n    \n    return dict(results)\n\n# Given input\nmarket_name = 'Market_28'\nhouse_bid = 0.5969980871075791\nplayer_bids = [('Player_1', 0.9095422098787996), ('Player_2', 0.07098421998126647), ('Player_3', 0.36655074924986386)]\noutcome = True\n\n# Calculate and print the scores\nscores = calculate_scores(market_name, house_bid, player_bids, outcome)\nprint(scores)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the scores for each player based on the given input.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we obtained the scores for each player based on their bids and the final outcome. The scores are calculated using the logarithmic difference between consecutive bids, as described in the reasoning process.\n\nThe final output, which is a dictionary of player names and their corresponding scores, is as follows:\n\n<<<{'Player_1': 60.74142829388364, 'Player_2': -367.957034211521, 'Player_3': 236.84427048323363}>>>"
