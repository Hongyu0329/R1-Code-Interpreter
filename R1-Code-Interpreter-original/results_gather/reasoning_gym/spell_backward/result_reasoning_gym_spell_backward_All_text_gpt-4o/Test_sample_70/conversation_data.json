    "To spell the word \"cleaded\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the original word: \"cleaded\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: c, l, e, a, d, e, d.\n3. Reverse the order of these letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: d.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: e.\n   - The third letter in the reversed word will be the third-to-last letter of the original word: d.\n   - The fourth letter in the reversed word will be the fourth-to-last letter of the original word: a.\n   - The fifth letter in the reversed word will be the fifth-to-last letter of the original word: e.\n   - The sixth letter in the reversed word will be the sixth-to-last letter of the original word: l.\n   - The seventh letter in the reversed word will be the seventh-to-last letter of the original word: c.\n\n4. Combine these letters in the new order to form the reversed word: d, e, d, a, e, l, c.\n\n5. Write out the reversed word: \"dedaelc\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"cleaded\" spelled backward is \"dedaelc\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<dedaelc>>>"
