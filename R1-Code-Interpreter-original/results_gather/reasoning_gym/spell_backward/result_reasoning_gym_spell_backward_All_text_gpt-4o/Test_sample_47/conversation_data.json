    "To spell the word \"Carayan\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the letters in the word \"Carayan\":\n   - C\n   - a\n   - r\n   - a\n   - y\n   - a\n   - n\n\n2. Reverse the order of these letters:\n   - Start with the last letter: n\n   - Then the second to last: a\n   - Then the third to last: y\n   - Then the fourth to last: a\n   - Then the fifth to last: r\n   - Then the sixth to last: a\n   - Finally, the first letter becomes the last: C\n\n3. Combine these letters in the new order to form the backward spelling:\n   - n\n   - a\n   - y\n   - a\n   - r\n   - a\n   - C\n\n4. The backward spelling of \"Carayan\" is \"nayarac\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<nayarac>>>"
