    "To spell the word \"matutinely\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"matutinely\".\n\n2. **Count the letters**: The word \"matutinely\" consists of 10 letters.\n\n3. **List the letters in order**: \n   - m\n   - a\n   - t\n   - u\n   - t\n   - i\n   - n\n   - e\n   - l\n   - y\n\n4. **Reverse the order of the letters**: \n   - Start from the last letter and move to the first.\n   - y\n   - l\n   - e\n   - n\n   - i\n   - t\n   - u\n   - t\n   - a\n   - m\n\n5. **Combine the reversed letters**: \n   - Combine the letters in the reversed order to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\n6. **Final result**: The word \"matutinely\" spelled backward is \"ylenitutam\".\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that each letter is correctly placed in the reverse order, resulting in the accurate backward spelling of the word.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<ylenitutam>>>"
