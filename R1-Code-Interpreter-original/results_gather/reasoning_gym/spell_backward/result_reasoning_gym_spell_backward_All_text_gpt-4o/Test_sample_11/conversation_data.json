    "To spell the word \"getup\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"getup\".\n\n2. **Determine the length of the word**: The word \"getup\" consists of 5 letters.\n\n3. **List the letters in order**: The letters in \"getup\" are:\n   - g\n   - e\n   - t\n   - u\n   - p\n\n4. **Reverse the order of the letters**: To spell the word backward, we need to reverse the order of these letters:\n   - Start with the last letter: p\n   - Then the second to last letter: u\n   - Then the third to last letter: t\n   - Then the fourth to last letter: e\n   - Finally, the first letter: g\n\n5. **Combine the reversed letters**: Combine these letters to form the word spelled backward:\n   - p\n   - u\n   - t\n   - e\n   - g\n\n6. **Form the final reversed word**: The word \"getup\" spelled backward is \"puteg\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<puteg>>>"
