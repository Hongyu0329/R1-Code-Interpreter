    "To spell the word \"colpus\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the letters in the word \"colpus\":\n   - The word \"colpus\" consists of 6 letters: c, o, l, p, u, s.\n\n2. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter and move to the first:\n     - The last letter is 's'.\n     - The second last letter is 'u'.\n     - The third last letter is 'p'.\n     - The fourth last letter is 'l'.\n     - The fifth last letter is 'o'.\n     - The first letter is 'c'.\n\n3. Combine the letters in the reversed order:\n   - Combine the letters as follows: s, u, p, l, o, c.\n\n4. Form the final reversed word:\n   - The reversed word is \"suploc\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"colpus\" spelled backward is \"suploc\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<suploc>>>"
