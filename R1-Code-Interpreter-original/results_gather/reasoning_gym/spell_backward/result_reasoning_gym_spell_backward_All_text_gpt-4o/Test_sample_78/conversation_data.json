    "To spell the word \"intertone\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"intertone\".\n2. Determine the number of letters in the word: 9 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: i, n, t, e, r, t, o, n, e.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: e.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: n.\n   - Continue this process for each letter:\n     - Third letter: o\n     - Fourth letter: t\n     - Fifth letter: r\n     - Sixth letter: e\n     - Seventh letter: t\n     - Eighth letter: n\n     - Ninth letter: i\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the backward spelling of \"intertone\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<enotretni>>>"
