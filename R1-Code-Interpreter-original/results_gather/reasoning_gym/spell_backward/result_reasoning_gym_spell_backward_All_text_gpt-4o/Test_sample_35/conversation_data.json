    "To spell the word \"caroba\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the original word: \"caroba\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: c, a, r, o, b, a.\n3. Reverse the order of these letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: a.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: b.\n   - The third letter in the reversed word will be the third-to-last letter of the original word: o.\n   - The fourth letter in the reversed word will be the fourth-to-last letter of the original word: r.\n   - The fifth letter in the reversed word will be the fifth-to-last letter of the original word: a.\n   - The sixth letter in the reversed word will be the sixth-to-last letter of the original word: c.\n\n4. Combine these letters in the new order to form the reversed word: a, b, o, r, a, c.\n\n5. The final reversed word is: \"aborac\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"caroba\" spelled backward is \"aborac\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<aborac>>>"
