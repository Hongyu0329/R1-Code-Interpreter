    "To spell the word \"unrotted\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"unrotted\"\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: u, n, r, o, t, t, e, d\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: d\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: e\n   - Continue this process for each letter:\n     - Third letter: t\n     - Fourth letter: t\n     - Fifth letter: o\n     - Sixth letter: r\n     - Seventh letter: n\n     - Eighth letter: u\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word: d, e, t, t, o, r, n, u\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"unrotted\" backward.\n\nFinal answer: <<<dettornu>>>"
