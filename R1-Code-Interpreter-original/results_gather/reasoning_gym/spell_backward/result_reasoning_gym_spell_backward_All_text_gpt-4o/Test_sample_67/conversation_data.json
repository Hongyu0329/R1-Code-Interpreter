    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"obfuscate\" backward, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of the letters in the word \"obfuscate\".\n\n2. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"obfuscate\".\n\n3. **Break Down the Word**: \n   - The word \"obfuscate\" consists of 9 letters: o, b, f, u, s, c, a, t, e.\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**:\n   - Start from the last letter and move to the first.\n   - The last letter is 'e', followed by 't', 'a', 'c', 's', 'u', 'f', 'b', and finally 'o'.\n\n5. **Construct the Reversed Word**:\n   - By reversing the order, the letters are arranged as: e, t, a, c, s, u, f, b, o.\n\n6. **Form the Final Answer**:\n   - Combine the reversed letters to form the word: \"etacsfubo\".\n\n7. **Verify**:\n   - Double-check each letter to ensure the order is correctly reversed.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<etacsfubo>>>"
