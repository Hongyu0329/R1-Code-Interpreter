    "To spell the word \"turbofan\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"turbofan\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: t, u, r, b, o, f, a, n.\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: n.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second last letter of the original word: a.\n   - Continue this process for each letter:\n     - Third letter: f\n     - Fourth letter: o\n     - Fifth letter: b\n     - Sixth letter: r\n     - Seventh letter: u\n     - Eighth letter: t\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nBy following these steps, the word \"turbofan\" spelled backward is \"nafobrut\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<nafobrut>>>"
