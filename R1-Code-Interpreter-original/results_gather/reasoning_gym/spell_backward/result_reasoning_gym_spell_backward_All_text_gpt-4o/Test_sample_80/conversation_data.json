    "To spell the word \"copromoter\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"copromoter\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 10 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: c, o, p, r, o, m, o, t, e, r.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter becomes the last: r\n   - The second letter becomes the second to last: e\n   - The third letter becomes the third to last: t\n   - The fourth letter becomes the fourth to last: o\n   - The fifth letter becomes the fifth to last: m\n   - The sixth letter becomes the sixth to last: o\n   - The seventh letter becomes the seventh to last: r\n   - The eighth letter becomes the eighth to last: p\n   - The ninth letter becomes the ninth to last: o\n   - The tenth letter becomes the first: c\n5. Write the letters in the new order: r, e, t, o, m, o, r, p, o, c.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"copromoter\" backward.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<retomorpc>>>"
