    "To spell the word \"Cartier\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the letters in the word \"Cartier\":\n   - C\n   - a\n   - r\n   - t\n   - i\n   - e\n   - r\n\n2. Reverse the order of these letters:\n   - Start with the last letter: r\n   - Then the second to last letter: e\n   - Then the third to last letter: i\n   - Then the fourth to last letter: t\n   - Then the fifth to last letter: r\n   - Then the sixth to last letter: a\n   - Finally, the first letter: C\n\n3. Combine these letters in the new order to form the backward spelling:\n   - r\n   - e\n   - i\n   - t\n   - r\n   - a\n   - C\n\n4. The backward spelling of \"Cartier\" is \"reitraC\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<reitraC>>>"
