    "To spell the word \"shellburst\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"shellburst\"\n2. Count the number of letters: There are 10 letters in \"shellburst.\"\n3. List the letters in order: s, h, e, l, l, b, u, r, s, t\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: t\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: s\n   - Continue this process for each letter:\n     - Third letter: r\n     - Fourth letter: u\n     - Fifth letter: b\n     - Sixth letter: l\n     - Seventh letter: l\n     - Eighth letter: e\n     - Ninth letter: h\n     - Tenth letter: s\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the backward spelling of \"shellburst.\"\n\nFinal answer: <<<tsrubllehs>>>"
