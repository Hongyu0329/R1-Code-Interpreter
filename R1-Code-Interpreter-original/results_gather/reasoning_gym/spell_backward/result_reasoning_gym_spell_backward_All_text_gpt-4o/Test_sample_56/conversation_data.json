    "To spell the word \"microzyme\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"microzyme\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: m, i, c, r, o, z, y, m, e.\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: e.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: m.\n   - Continue this process for each letter:\n     - Third letter: y\n     - Fourth letter: z\n     - Fifth letter: o\n     - Sixth letter: r\n     - Seventh letter: c\n     - Eighth letter: i\n     - Ninth letter: m\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nBy following these steps, the word \"microzyme\" spelled backward is \"emyzorcim\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<emyzorcim>>>"
