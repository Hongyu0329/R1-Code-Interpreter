    "To spell the word \"redlegs\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the original word: \"redlegs\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: r, e, d, l, e, g, s.\n3. Reverse the order of these letters: s, g, e, l, d, e, r.\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the backward spelling of \"redlegs\".\n\nThe backward spelling of \"redlegs\" is: <<<sgelder>>>"
