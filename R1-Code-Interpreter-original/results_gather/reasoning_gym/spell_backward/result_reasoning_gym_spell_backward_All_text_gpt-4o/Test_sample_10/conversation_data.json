    "To spell the word \"requiz\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the original word: \"requiz\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: r, e, q, u, i, z.\n3. Reverse the order of these letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: z.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: i.\n   - The third letter in the reversed word will be the third-to-last letter of the original word: u.\n   - The fourth letter in the reversed word will be the fourth-to-last letter of the original word: q.\n   - The fifth letter in the reversed word will be the fifth-to-last letter of the original word: e.\n   - The sixth letter in the reversed word will be the sixth-to-last letter of the original word: r.\n\n4. Combine these letters in the new order to form the reversed word: z, i, u, q, e, r.\n\n5. The final reversed word is: \"ziuqer\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"requiz\" spelled backward is \"ziuqer\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<ziuqer>>>"
