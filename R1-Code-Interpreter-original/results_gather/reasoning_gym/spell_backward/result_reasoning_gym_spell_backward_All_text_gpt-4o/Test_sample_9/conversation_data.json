    "To spell the word \"Hampshire\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: Hampshire\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: H, a, m, p, s, h, i, r, e\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: e\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: r\n   - Continue this process for each letter:\n     - Third letter: i\n     - Fourth letter: h\n     - Fifth letter: s\n     - Sixth letter: p\n     - Seventh letter: m\n     - Eighth letter: a\n     - Ninth letter: H\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word: erihspmaH\n\nTherefore, the word \"Hampshire\" spelled backward is \"erihspmaH\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<erihspmaH>>>"
