    "To spell the word \"cleithral\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"cleithral\"\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: c, l, e, i, t, h, r, a, l\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter: l\n   - Then the second to last: a\n   - Then the third to last: r\n   - Continue this process until the first letter is reached.\n\nFollowing this process, the reversed order of the letters is: l, a, r, h, t, i, e, l, c\n\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word: \"larhtielc\"\n\nTherefore, the word \"cleithral\" spelled backward is \"larhtielc\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<larhtielc>>>"
