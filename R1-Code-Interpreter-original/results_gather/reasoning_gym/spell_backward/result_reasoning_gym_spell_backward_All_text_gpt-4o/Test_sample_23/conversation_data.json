    "To spell the word \"Hedera\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the original word: \"Hedera\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: H, e, d, e, r, a.\n3. Reverse the order of these letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: a.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: r.\n   - The third letter in the reversed word will be the third-to-last letter of the original word: e.\n   - The fourth letter in the reversed word will be the fourth-to-last letter of the original word: d.\n   - The fifth letter in the reversed word will be the fifth-to-last letter of the original word: e.\n   - The sixth letter in the reversed word will be the sixth-to-last letter of the original word: H.\n\n4. Combine these letters in the new order to form the reversed word: a, r, e, d, e, H.\n\n5. Write the reversed word as a single string: \"ared eH\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"Hedera\" spelled backward is \"ared eH\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<ared eH>>>"
