    "To spell the word \"serigraphy\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"serigraphy\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: 10 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: s, e, r, i, g, r, a, p, h, y.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter: y\n   - Move to the second last letter: h\n   - Continue this process until the first letter: s\n\nBy reversing the order, we get the following sequence of letters: y, h, p, a, r, g, i, r, e, s.\n\n5. Combine these letters to form the backward spelling of the word: \"yhpargires\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"serigraphy\" spelled backward is \"yhpargires\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<yhpargires>>>"
