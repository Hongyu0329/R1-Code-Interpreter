    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"room\" backward, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"room.\"\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: We need to spell this word backward. This means we will reverse the order of the letters in the word.\n\n3. **Break Down the Word**: The word \"room\" consists of the following letters in order:\n   - First letter: r\n   - Second letter: o\n   - Third letter: o\n   - Fourth letter: m\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: To spell the word backward, we reverse the order of the letters:\n   - First letter in reverse: m\n   - Second letter in reverse: o\n   - Third letter in reverse: o\n   - Fourth letter in reverse: r\n\n5. **Combine the Reversed Letters**: Combine the letters in the new order to form the backward spelling of the word:\n   - Combined letters: m + o + o + r = \"moor\"\n\n6. **Verify the Result**: Double-check that the letters have been correctly reversed and combined to ensure accuracy.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"room\" backward.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<moor>>>"
