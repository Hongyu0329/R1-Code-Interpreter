    "To spell the word \"emptings\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"emptings.\"\n\n2. **List the letters in order**: \n   - e\n   - m\n   - p\n   - t\n   - i\n   - n\n   - g\n   - s\n\n3. **Reverse the order of the letters**: \n   - Start with the last letter and move to the first.\n   - s\n   - g\n   - n\n   - i\n   - t\n   - p\n   - m\n   - e\n\n4. **Combine the reversed letters into a new word**: \n   - The reversed sequence of letters is \"sgnitpme.\"\n\n5. **Verify the reversal**: \n   - Double-check that each letter from the original word is accounted for in the reverse order.\n   - Original: e, m, p, t, i, n, g, s\n   - Reversed: s, g, n, i, t, p, m, e\n\n6. **Ensure accuracy**: \n   - Confirm that the reversed word \"sgnitpme\" is correct by comparing it to the original word \"emptings\" to ensure all letters are present and in the correct reverse order.\n\nThe final answer, with the word \"emptings\" spelled backward, is:\n\n<<<sgnitpme>>>"
