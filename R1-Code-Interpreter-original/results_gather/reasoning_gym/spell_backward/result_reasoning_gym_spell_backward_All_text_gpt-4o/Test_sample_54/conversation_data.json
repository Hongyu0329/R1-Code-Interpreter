    "To spell the word \"cache\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the letters in the word \"cache\":\n   - The word \"cache\" consists of the following letters in order: c, a, c, h, e.\n\n2. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter and move to the first:\n     - The last letter is \"e\".\n     - The second to last letter is \"h\".\n     - The third to last letter is \"c\".\n     - The fourth to last letter is \"a\".\n     - The first letter is \"c\".\n\n3. Combine the letters in the new order:\n   - By reversing the order, we get the sequence: e, h, c, a, c.\n\n4. Form the backward spelling:\n   - Combine the letters to form the word: \"ehcac\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"cache\" spelled backward is \"ehcac\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<ehcac>>>"
