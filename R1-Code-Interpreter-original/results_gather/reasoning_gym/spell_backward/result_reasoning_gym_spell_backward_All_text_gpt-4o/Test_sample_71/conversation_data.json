    "To spell the word \"volcanism\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"volcanism\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 9 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: v, o, l, c, a, n, i, s, m.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter becomes the last: m\n   - The second letter becomes the second to last: s\n   - The third letter becomes the third to last: i\n   - The fourth letter becomes the fourth to last: n\n   - The fifth letter remains in the middle: a\n   - The sixth letter becomes the fourth from the start: c\n   - The seventh letter becomes the third from the start: l\n   - The eighth letter becomes the second from the start: o\n   - The ninth letter becomes the first: v\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling: m, s, i, n, a, c, l, o, v.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"volcanism\" backward.\n\nFinal answer: <<<msinaclov>>>"
