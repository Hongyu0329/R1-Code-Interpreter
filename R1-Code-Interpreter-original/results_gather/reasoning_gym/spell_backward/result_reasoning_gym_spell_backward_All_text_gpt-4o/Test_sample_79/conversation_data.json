    "To spell the word \"tuftily\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"tuftily\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: t, u, f, t, i, l, y.\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter: y\n   - Then the second to last letter: l\n   - Then the third to last letter: i\n   - Then the fourth to last letter: t\n   - Then the fifth to last letter: f\n   - Then the sixth to last letter: u\n   - Finally, the first letter: t\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling: ylitfut.\n\nTherefore, the word \"tuftily\" spelled backward is \"ylitfut\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<ylitfut>>>"
