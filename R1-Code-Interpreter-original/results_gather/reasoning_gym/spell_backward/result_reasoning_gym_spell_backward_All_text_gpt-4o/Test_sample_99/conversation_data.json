    "To spell the word \"strepent\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"strepent\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: s, t, r, e, p, e, n, t.\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter becomes the last: t\n   - The second letter becomes the second to last: n\n   - The third letter becomes the third to last: e\n   - The fourth letter becomes the fourth to last: p\n   - The fifth letter becomes the fifth to last: e\n   - The sixth letter becomes the sixth to last: r\n   - The seventh letter becomes the seventh to last: t\n   - The eighth letter becomes the first: s\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling: t, n, e, p, e, r, t, s.\n\nTherefore, the word \"strepent\" spelled backward is \"tneperts\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<tneperts>>>"
