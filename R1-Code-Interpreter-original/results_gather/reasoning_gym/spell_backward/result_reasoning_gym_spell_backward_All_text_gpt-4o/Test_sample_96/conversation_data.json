    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"bunemost\" backward, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"bunemost\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: We need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. This means the last letter of the word will become the first letter in the reversed word, the second last letter will become the second letter, and so on.\n\n3. **List the Letters**: Break down the word into its individual letters:\n   - b\n   - u\n   - n\n   - e\n   - m\n   - o\n   - s\n   - t\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: Start from the last letter and move to the first:\n   - t (last letter)\n   - s\n   - o\n   - m\n   - e\n   - n\n   - u\n   - b (first letter)\n\n5. **Combine the Reversed Letters**: Join the letters in the new order to form the reversed word:\n   - t\n   - s\n   - o\n   - m\n   - e\n   - n\n   - u\n   - b\n\n6. **Form the Final Answer**: The reversed word is \"tsomenub\".\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully reversed the word \"bunemost\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<tsomenub>>>"
