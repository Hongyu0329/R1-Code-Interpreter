    "To spell the word \"unvivified\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"unvivified\"\n2. Count the number of letters: The word \"unvivified\" has 10 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: u, n, v, i, v, i, f, i, e, d\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter and move to the first.\n   - The last letter is 'd', followed by 'e', 'i', 'f', 'i', 'v', 'i', 'v', 'n', and finally 'u'.\n5. Write the letters in the new order: d, e, i, f, i, v, i, v, n, u\n\nBy following these steps, we have spelled the word \"unvivified\" backward.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<deifivivnu>>>"
