    "To spell the word \"scuffle\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"scuffle.\"\n\n2. **Determine the length of the word**: \"Scuffle\" has 7 letters.\n\n3. **List the letters in order**: \n   - s\n   - c\n   - u\n   - f\n   - f\n   - l\n   - e\n\n4. **Reverse the order of the letters**: \n   - Start with the last letter and move to the first.\n   - e\n   - l\n   - f\n   - f\n   - u\n   - c\n   - s\n\n5. **Combine the reversed letters**: \n   - Join the letters together to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\n6. **Verify the result**: \n   - Check that the reversed sequence of letters is correct and matches the original word's letters in reverse order.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the backward spelling of \"scuffle.\"\n\nFinal answer: <<<elffucs>>>"
