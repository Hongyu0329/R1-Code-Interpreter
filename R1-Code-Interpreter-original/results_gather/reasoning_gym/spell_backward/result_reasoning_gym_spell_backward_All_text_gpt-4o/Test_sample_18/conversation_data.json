    "To spell the word \"gametogony\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"gametogony\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 10 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: g, a, m, e, t, o, g, o, n, y.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter from the end is 'y'.\n   - The second letter from the end is 'n'.\n   - The third letter from the end is 'o'.\n   - The fourth letter from the end is 'g'.\n   - The fifth letter from the end is 'o'.\n   - The sixth letter from the end is 't'.\n   - The seventh letter from the end is 'e'.\n   - The eighth letter from the end is 'm'.\n   - The ninth letter from the end is 'a'.\n   - The tenth letter from the end is 'g'.\n5. Combine these letters in the reversed order to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the backward spelling of the word \"gametogony\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<ynogotemag>>>"
