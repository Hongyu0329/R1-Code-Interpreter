    "To spell the word \"unreactive\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"unreactive\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 10 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: u, n, r, e, a, c, t, i, v, e.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: e.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second last letter of the original word: v.\n   - Continue this process for each letter:\n     - Third letter: i\n     - Fourth letter: t\n     - Fifth letter: c\n     - Sixth letter: a\n     - Seventh letter: e\n     - Eighth letter: r\n     - Ninth letter: n\n     - Tenth letter: u\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nThe backward spelling of \"unreactive\" is \"evitcaernu\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<evitcaernu>>>"
