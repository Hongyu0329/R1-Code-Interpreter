    "To spell the word \"Pavoncella\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the original word: Pavoncella\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: P, a, v, o, n, c, e, l, l, a\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter: a\n   - Then the second to last letter: l\n   - Continue this process: l, e, c, n, o, v, a, P\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling: all the letters in reverse order are a, l, l, e, c, n, o, v, a, P\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"Pavoncella\" backward.\n\nFinal answer: <<<allecnovaP>>>"
