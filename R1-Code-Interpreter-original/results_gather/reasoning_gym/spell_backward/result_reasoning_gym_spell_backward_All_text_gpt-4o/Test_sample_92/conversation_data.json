    "To spell the word \"Maoridom\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"Maoridom\"\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: M, a, o, r, i, d, o, m\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: m\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second last letter of the original word: o\n   - Continue this process for each letter:\n     - Third letter: d\n     - Fourth letter: i\n     - Fifth letter: r\n     - Sixth letter: o\n     - Seventh letter: a\n     - Eighth letter: M\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nBy following these steps, the word \"Maoridom\" spelled backward is \"modiraoM\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<modiraoM>>>"
