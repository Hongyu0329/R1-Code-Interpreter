    "To spell the word \"calculous\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"calculous\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 9 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: c, a, l, c, u, l, o, u, s.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter from the end is 's'.\n   - The second letter from the end is 'u'.\n   - The third letter from the end is 'o'.\n   - The fourth letter from the end is 'l'.\n   - The fifth letter from the end is 'u'.\n   - The sixth letter from the end is 'c'.\n   - The seventh letter from the end is 'l'.\n   - The eighth letter from the end is 'a'.\n   - The ninth letter from the end is 'c'.\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling: \"suolucalc\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"calculous\" spelled backward is \"suolucalc\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<suolucalc>>>"
