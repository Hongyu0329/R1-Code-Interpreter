    "To spell the word \"worktable\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"worktable\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 9 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: w, o, r, k, t, a, b, l, e.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter from the end is 'e'.\n   - The second letter from the end is 'l'.\n   - The third letter from the end is 'b'.\n   - The fourth letter from the end is 'a'.\n   - The fifth letter from the end is 't'.\n   - The sixth letter from the end is 'k'.\n   - The seventh letter from the end is 'r'.\n   - The eighth letter from the end is 'o'.\n   - The ninth letter from the end is 'w'.\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling: e, l, b, a, t, k, r, o, w.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"worktable\" backward.\n\nFinal answer: <<<elbatkrow>>>"
