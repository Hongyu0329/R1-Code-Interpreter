    "To spell the word \"palpation\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"palpation\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 9 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: p, a, l, p, a, t, i, o, n.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: n.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second to last letter of the original word: o.\n   - Continue this process for each letter:\n     - Third letter: i\n     - Fourth letter: t\n     - Fifth letter: a\n     - Sixth letter: p\n     - Seventh letter: l\n     - Eighth letter: a\n     - Ninth letter: p\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nThe backward spelling of \"palpation\" is \"noitaplap\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<noitaplap>>>"
