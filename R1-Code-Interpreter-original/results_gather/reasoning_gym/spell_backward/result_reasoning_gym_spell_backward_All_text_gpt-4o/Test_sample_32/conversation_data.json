    "To spell the word \"Chachapuya\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the original word: Chachapuya\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: C, h, a, c, h, a, p, u, y, a\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter and move to the first.\n   - The last letter is 'a', followed by 'y', then 'u', and so on.\n4. Write the letters in reverse order:\n   - a, y, u, p, a, h, c, a, h, C\n\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word: ayupahcahC\n\nTherefore, the word \"Chachapuya\" spelled backward is \"ayupahcahC\".\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<ayupahcahC>>>"
