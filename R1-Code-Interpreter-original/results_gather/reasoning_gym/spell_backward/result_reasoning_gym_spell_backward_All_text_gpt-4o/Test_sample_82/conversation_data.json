    "To spell the word \"chylemia\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"chylemia\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 8 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: c, h, y, l, e, m, i, a.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter from the end is 'a'.\n   - The second letter from the end is 'i'.\n   - The third letter from the end is 'm'.\n   - The fourth letter from the end is 'e'.\n   - The fifth letter from the end is 'l'.\n   - The sixth letter from the end is 'y'.\n   - The seventh letter from the end is 'h'.\n   - The eighth letter from the end is 'c'.\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling: a, i, m, e, l, y, h, c.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"chylemia\" backward.\n\nFinal answer: <<<aimelyhc>>>"
