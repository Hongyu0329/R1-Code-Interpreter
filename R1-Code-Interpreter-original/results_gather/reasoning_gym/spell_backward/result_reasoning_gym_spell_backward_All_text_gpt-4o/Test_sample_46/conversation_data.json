    "To spell the word \"peltate\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"peltate\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: p, e, l, t, a, t, e.\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: e.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: t.\n   - The third letter in the reversed word will be the third-to-last letter of the original word: a.\n   - The fourth letter in the reversed word will be the fourth-to-last letter of the original word: t.\n   - The fifth letter in the reversed word will be the fifth-to-last letter of the original word: l.\n   - The sixth letter in the reversed word will be the sixth-to-last letter of the original word: e.\n   - The seventh letter in the reversed word will be the seventh-to-last letter of the original word: p.\n\n4. Combine these letters to form the reversed word: e, t, a, t, l, e, p.\n\n5. The final reversed word is: \"etatlep\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"peltate\" spelled backward is \"etatlep\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<etatlep>>>"
