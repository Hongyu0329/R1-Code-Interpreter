    "To spell the word \"equatable\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"equatable\"\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: e, q, u, a, t, a, b, l, e\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter: e\n   - Then the second to last letter: l\n   - Continue this process: b, a, t, a, u, q, e\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the backward spelling of \"equatable.\"\n\nFinal answer: <<<elbatauqe>>>"
