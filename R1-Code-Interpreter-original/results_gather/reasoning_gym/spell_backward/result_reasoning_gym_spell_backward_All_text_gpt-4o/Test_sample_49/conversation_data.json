    "To spell the word \"impoverish\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"impoverish\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 10 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: i, m, p, o, v, e, r, i, s, h.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter from the end is \"h\".\n   - The second letter from the end is \"s\".\n   - The third letter from the end is \"i\".\n   - The fourth letter from the end is \"r\".\n   - The fifth letter from the end is \"e\".\n   - The sixth letter from the end is \"v\".\n   - The seventh letter from the end is \"o\".\n   - The eighth letter from the end is \"p\".\n   - The ninth letter from the end is \"m\".\n   - The tenth letter from the end is \"i\".\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling: \"hsirevopmi\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"impoverish\" spelled backward is \"hsirevopmi\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<hsirevopmi>>>"
