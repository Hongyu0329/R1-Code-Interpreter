    "To spell the word \"loper\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the letters in the word \"loper\":\n   - The word \"loper\" consists of the following letters in order: l, o, p, e, r.\n\n2. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter and move to the first:\n     - The last letter is 'r'.\n     - The second to last letter is 'e'.\n     - The third to last letter is 'p'.\n     - The fourth to last letter is 'o'.\n     - The first letter is 'l'.\n\n3. Combine the letters in the new order:\n   - When we reverse the order of the letters, we get: r, e, p, o, l.\n\n4. Form the backward spelling of the word:\n   - Combine the reversed letters to form the word: \"repol\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"loper\" spelled backward is \"repol\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<repol>>>"
