    "To spell the word \"trisected\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"trisected\"\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: t, r, i, s, e, c, t, e, d\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter: d\n   - Then the second to last letter: e\n   - Continue this process: t, c, e, s, i, r, t\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nBy following these steps, the word \"trisected\" spelled backward is \"detcesirt.\"\n\nFinal answer: <<<detcesirt>>>"
