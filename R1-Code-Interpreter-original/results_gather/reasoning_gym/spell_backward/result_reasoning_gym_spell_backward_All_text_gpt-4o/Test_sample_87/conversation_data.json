    "To spell the word \"offshoot\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"offshoot\"\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: o, f, f, s, h, o, o, t\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: t\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second to last letter of the original word: o\n   - The third letter in the reversed word will be the third to last letter of the original word: o\n   - The fourth letter in the reversed word will be the fourth to last letter of the original word: h\n   - The fifth letter in the reversed word will be the fifth to last letter of the original word: s\n   - The sixth letter in the reversed word will be the sixth to last letter of the original word: f\n   - The seventh letter in the reversed word will be the seventh to last letter of the original word: f\n   - The eighth letter in the reversed word will be the eighth to last letter of the original word: o\n\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word: t, o, o, h, s, f, f, o\n\n5. Write the final reversed word: \"toohsffo\"\n\nTherefore, the word \"offshoot\" spelled backward is \"toohsffo\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<toohsffo>>>"
