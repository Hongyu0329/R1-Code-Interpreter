    "To spell the word \"Chehalis\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: Chehalis\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: 8 letters\n3. List the letters in order: C, h, e, h, a, l, i, s\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter becomes the last: s\n   - The second letter becomes the second to last: i\n   - The third letter becomes the third to last: l\n   - The fourth letter becomes the fourth to last: a\n   - The fifth letter becomes the fifth to last: h\n   - The sixth letter becomes the sixth to last: e\n   - The seventh letter becomes the seventh to last: h\n   - The eighth letter becomes the first: C\n5.
