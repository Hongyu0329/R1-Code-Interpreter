    "To spell the word \"dampness\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze and perform this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"dampness\"\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 8 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: d, a, m, p, n, e, s, s\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: s\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second last letter of the original word: s\n   - The third letter in the reversed word will be the third last letter of the original word: e\n   - The fourth letter in the reversed word will be the fourth last letter of the original word: n\n   - The fifth letter in the reversed word will be the fifth last letter of the original word: p\n   - The sixth letter in the reversed word will be the sixth last letter of the original word: m\n   - The seventh letter in the reversed word will be the seventh last letter of the original word: a\n   - The eighth letter in the reversed word will be the eighth last letter of the original word: d\n\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word: s, s, e, n, p, m, a, d\n\n6. Write the final reversed word: \"ssenpmad\"\n\nTherefore, the word \"dampness\" spelled backward is \"ssenpmad\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<ssenpmad>>>"
