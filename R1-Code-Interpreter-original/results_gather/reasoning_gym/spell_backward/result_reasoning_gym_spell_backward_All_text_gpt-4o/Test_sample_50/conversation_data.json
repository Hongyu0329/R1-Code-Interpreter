    "To spell the word \"calyces\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"calyces\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: c, a, l, y, c, e, s.\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: s.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: e.\n   - The third letter in the reversed word will be the third-to-last letter of the original word: c.\n   - The fourth letter in the reversed word will be the fourth-to-last letter of the original word: y.\n   - The fifth letter in the reversed word will be the fifth-to-last letter of the original word: l.\n   - The sixth letter in the reversed word will be the sixth-to-last letter of the original word: a.\n   - The seventh letter in the reversed word will be the seventh-to-last letter of the original word: c.\n\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word: s, e, c, y, l, a, c.\n\n5. Join these letters together to form the final reversed word: \"secyalc\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"calyces\" spelled backward is \"secyalc\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<secyalc>>>"
