    "To spell the word \"xenium\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: The word given is \"xenium.\"\n\n2. Determine the length of the word: \"xenium\" has 6 letters.\n\n3. List the letters in order: \n   - 1st letter: x\n   - 2nd letter: e\n   - 3rd letter: n\n   - 4th letter: i\n   - 5th letter: u\n   - 6th letter: m\n\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - 1st letter in reverse: m\n   - 2nd letter in reverse: u\n   - 3rd letter in reverse: i\n   - 4th letter in reverse: n\n   - 5th letter in reverse: e\n   - 6th letter in reverse: x\n\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word: \"muinex.\"\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"xenium\" backward.\n\nFinal answer: <<<muinex>>>"
