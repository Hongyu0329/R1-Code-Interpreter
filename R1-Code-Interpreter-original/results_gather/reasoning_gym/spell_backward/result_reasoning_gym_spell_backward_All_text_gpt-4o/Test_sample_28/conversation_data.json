    "To spell the word \"selfcide\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"selfcide\".\n2. Determine the number of letters in the word: 8 letters.\n3. List the letters in order from first to last: s, e, l, f, c, i, d, e.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter becomes the last: e\n   - The second letter becomes the second to last: d\n   - The third letter becomes the third to last: i\n   - The fourth letter becomes the fourth to last: c\n   - The fifth letter becomes the fifth to last: f\n   - The sixth letter becomes the sixth to last: l\n   - The seventh letter becomes the seventh to last: e\n   - The eighth letter becomes the first: s\n5. Write the letters in the new order: e, d, i, c, f, l, e, s.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"selfcide\" backward.\n\nFinal answer: <<<edicfles>>>"
