    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"kecky\" backward, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"kecky\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: We need to reverse the order of the letters in the word \"kecky\".\n\n3. **List the Letters**: Break down the word into its individual letters:\n   - k\n   - e\n   - c\n   - k\n   - y\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: Rearrange the letters in the reverse order:\n   - Start with the last letter: y\n   - Then the second to last: k\n   - Then the middle letter: c\n   - Then the second letter: e\n   - Finally, the first letter: k\n\n5. **Combine the Reversed Letters**: Put the reversed letters together to form the new word:\n   - y\n   - k\n   - c\n   - e\n   - k\n\n6. **Form the Final Answer**: The word \"kecky\" spelled backward is \"ykcek\".\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully reversed the word \"kecky\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<ykcek>>>"
