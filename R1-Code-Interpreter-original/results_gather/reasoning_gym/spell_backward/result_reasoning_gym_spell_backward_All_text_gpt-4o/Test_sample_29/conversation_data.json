    "To spell the word \"fearlessly\" backward, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"fearlessly.\"\n\n2. **Break Down the Word**: \n   - The word \"fearlessly\" consists of 10 letters: f, e, a, r, l, e, s, s, l, y.\n\n3. **Reverse the Order of Letters**:\n   - Start from the last letter and move to the first.\n   - The last letter is 'y', followed by 'l', 's', 's', 'e', 'l', 'r', 'a', 'e', and finally 'f'.\n\n4. **Construct the Backward Word**:\n   - By reversing the order, the letters are arranged as: y, l, s, s, e, l, r, a, e, f.\n\n5. **Combine the Letters**:\n   - Combine these letters to form the backward spelling: \"ylsselraef.\"\n\n6. **Verify the Backward Spelling**:\n   - Double-check each letter to ensure accuracy: \n     - Original: f, e, a, r, l, e, s, s, l, y\n     - Backward: y, l, s, s, e, l, r, a, e, f\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The backward spelling of \"fearlessly\" is \"ylsselraef.\"\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the word is spelled backward correctly.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<ylsselraef>>>"
