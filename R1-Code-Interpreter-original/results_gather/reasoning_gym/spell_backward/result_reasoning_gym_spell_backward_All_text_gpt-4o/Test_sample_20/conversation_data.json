    "To spell the word \"idealess\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"idealess\".\n\n2. **Determine the length of the word**: The word \"idealess\" consists of 8 letters.\n\n3. **List the letters in order**: \n   - i\n   - d\n   - e\n   - a\n   - l\n   - e\n   - s\n   - s\n\n4. **Reverse the order of the letters**: \n   - Start from the last letter and move to the first.\n   - The last letter is 's', followed by another 's', then 'e', 'l', 'a', 'e', 'd', and finally 'i'.\n\n5. **Write the letters in reverse order**: \n   - s\n   - s\n   - e\n   - l\n   - a\n   - e\n   - d\n   - i\n\n6. **Combine the reversed letters to form the backward word**: \n   - The backward spelling of \"idealess\" is \"sseladei\".\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"idealess\" backward.\n\nFinal answer: <<<sseladei>>>"
