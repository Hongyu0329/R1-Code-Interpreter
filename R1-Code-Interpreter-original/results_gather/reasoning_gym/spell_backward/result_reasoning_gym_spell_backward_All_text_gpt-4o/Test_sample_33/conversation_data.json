    "To spell the word \"polyphage\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"polyphage\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 9 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: p, o, l, y, p, h, a, g, e.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: e.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second last letter of the original word: g.\n   - Continue this process for each letter:\n     - Third letter: a\n     - Fourth letter: h\n     - Fifth letter: p\n     - Sixth letter: y\n     - Seventh letter: l\n     - Eighth letter: o\n     - Ninth letter: p\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nThe backward spelling of \"polyphage\" is \"egahpylop\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<egahpylop>>>"
