    "To spell the word \"fascicular\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"fascicular\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 10 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: f, a, s, c, i, c, u, l, a, r.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: r.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: a.\n   - Continue this process for each letter.\n\nLet's write out the reversed word:\n\n- Original: f, a, s, c, i, c, u, l, a, r\n- Reversed: r, a, l, u, c, i, c, s, a, f\n\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word: \"ralucicsaf\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"fascicular\" spelled backward is \"ralucicsaf\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<ralucicsaf>>>"
