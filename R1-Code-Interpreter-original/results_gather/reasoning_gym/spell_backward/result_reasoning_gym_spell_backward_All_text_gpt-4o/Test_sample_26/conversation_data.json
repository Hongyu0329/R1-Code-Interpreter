    "To spell the word \"roquist\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the original word: \"roquist\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: r, o, q, u, i, s, t.\n3. Reverse the order of these letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: t.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: s.\n   - Continue this process for each letter:\n     - Third letter: i\n     - Fourth letter: u\n     - Fifth letter: q\n     - Sixth letter: o\n     - Seventh letter: r\n4. Combine these letters in the new order to form the reversed word: t, s, i, u, q, o, r.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final reversed word.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<tsiuqor>>>"
