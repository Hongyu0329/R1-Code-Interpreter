    "To spell the word \"melaconite\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"melaconite\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: m, e, l, a, c, o, n, i, t, e.\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter: e\n   - Then the second to last: t\n   - Continue this process: i, n, o, c, a, l, e, m\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the backward spelling of \"melaconite\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<etinocalem>>>"
