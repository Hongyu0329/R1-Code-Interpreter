    "To spell the word \"Flora\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the letters in the word \"Flora\":**\n   - The word \"Flora\" consists of the following letters in order: F, l, o, r, a.\n\n2. **Reverse the order of the letters:**\n   - Start with the last letter and move to the first:\n     - The last letter is 'a'.\n     - The second last letter is 'r'.\n     - The third last letter is 'o'.\n     - The fourth last letter is 'l'.\n     - The first letter is 'F'.\n\n3. **Combine the letters in the reversed order:**\n   - When we combine the letters in the reversed order, we get: a, r, o, l, F.\n\n4. **Form the final reversed word:**\n   - The final reversed word is \"arolF\".\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"Flora\" backward.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<arolF>>>"
