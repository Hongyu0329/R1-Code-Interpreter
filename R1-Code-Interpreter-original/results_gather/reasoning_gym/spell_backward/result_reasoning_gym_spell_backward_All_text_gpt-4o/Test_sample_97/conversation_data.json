    "To spell the word \"nematocide\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"nematocide\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: n, e, m, a, t, o, c, i, d, e.\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter: e\n   - Then the second to last: d\n   - Continue this process: i, c, o, t, a, m, e, n\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nBy following these steps, the word \"nematocide\" spelled backward is \"edicotamen\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<edicotamen>>>"
