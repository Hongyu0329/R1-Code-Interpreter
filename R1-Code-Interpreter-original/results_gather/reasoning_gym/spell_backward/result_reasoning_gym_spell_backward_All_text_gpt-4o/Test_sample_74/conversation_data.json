    "To spell the word \"collateral\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"collateral\"\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: 10 letters\n3. List the letters in order: c, o, l, l, a, t, e, r, a, l\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter and move to the first.\n   - l (10th letter)\n   - a (9th letter)\n   - r (8th letter)\n   - e (7th letter)\n   - t (6th letter)\n   - a (5th letter)\n   - l (4th letter)\n   - l (3rd letter)\n   - o (2nd letter)\n   - c (1st letter)\n\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling: \"laretalloc\"\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"collateral\" backward.\n\nFinal answer: <<<laretalloc>>>"
