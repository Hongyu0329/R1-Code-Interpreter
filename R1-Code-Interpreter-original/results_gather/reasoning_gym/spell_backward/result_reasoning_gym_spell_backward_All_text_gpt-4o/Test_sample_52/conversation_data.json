    "To spell the word \"necremia\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the original word: \"necremia\".\n2. List the letters in the word in order: n, e, c, r, e, m, i, a.\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter: a\n   - Then the second to last letter: i\n   - Continue this process: m, e, r, c, e, n\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nBy following these steps, the word \"necremia\" spelled backward is \"aimercen\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<aimercen>>>"
