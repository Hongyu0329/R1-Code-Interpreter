    "To spell the word \"dipole\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"dipole\"\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: d, i, p, o, l, e\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: e\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: l\n   - The third letter in the reversed word will be the third-to-last letter of the original word: o\n   - The fourth letter in the reversed word will be the fourth-to-last letter of the original word: p\n   - The fifth letter in the reversed word will be the fifth-to-last letter of the original word: i\n   - The sixth letter in the reversed word will be the sixth-to-last letter of the original word: d\n\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word: e, l, o, p, i, d\n\n5. Write the final reversed word: \"elopid\"\n\nTherefore, the word \"dipole\" spelled backward is \"elopid\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<elopid>>>"
