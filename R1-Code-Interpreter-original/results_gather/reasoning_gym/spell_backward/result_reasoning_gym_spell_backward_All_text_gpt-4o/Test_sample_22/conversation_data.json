    "To spell the word \"auroral\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"auroral\"\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: a, u, r, o, r, a, l\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: l\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: a\n   - The third letter in the reversed word will be the third-to-last letter of the original word: r\n   - The fourth letter in the reversed word will be the fourth-to-last letter of the original word: o\n   - The fifth letter in the reversed word will be the fifth-to-last letter of the original word: r\n   - The sixth letter in the reversed word will be the sixth-to-last letter of the original word: u\n   - The seventh letter in the reversed word will be the seventh-to-last letter of the original word: a\n\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word: l, a, r, o, r, u, a\n\n5. Join the letters to form the final reversed word: \"larorua\"\n\nTherefore, the word \"auroral\" spelled backward is \"larorua\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<larorua>>>"
