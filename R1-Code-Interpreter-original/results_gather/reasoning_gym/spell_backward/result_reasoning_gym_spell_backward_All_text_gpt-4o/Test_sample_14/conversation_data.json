    "To spell the word \"cicala\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"cicala\".\n\n2. **Determine the length of the word**: The word \"cicala\" consists of 6 letters.\n\n3. **List the letters in order**: The letters in \"cicala\" are:\n   - c\n   - i\n   - c\n   - a\n   - l\n   - a\n\n4. **Reverse the order of the letters**: To spell the word backward, we need to reverse the order of these letters:\n   - Start with the last letter: a\n   - Then the second to last letter: l\n   - Then the third to last letter: a\n   - Then the fourth to last letter: c\n   - Then the fifth to last letter: i\n   - Finally, the first letter: c\n\n5. **Combine the reversed letters**: Combine these letters to form the word spelled backward:\n   - a\n   - l\n   - a\n   - c\n   - i\n   - c\n\n6. **Form the final reversed word**: The word \"cicala\" spelled backward is \"alacic\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<alacic>>>"
