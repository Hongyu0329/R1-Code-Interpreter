    "To spell the word \"catfall\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"catfall\".\n\n2. **Determine the length of the word**: \"catfall\" has 7 letters.\n\n3. **List the letters in order**: \n   - c\n   - a\n   - t\n   - f\n   - a\n   - l\n   - l\n\n4. **Reverse the order of the letters**: \n   - Start with the last letter and move to the first.\n   - The last letter is 'l', followed by another 'l', then 'a', 'f', 't', 'a', and finally 'c'.\n\n5. **Write the letters in reverse order**: \n   - l\n   - l\n   - a\n   - f\n   - t\n   - a\n   - c\n\n6. **Combine the reversed letters to form the backward word**: \n   - The backward spelling of \"catfall\" is \"llaftac\".\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"catfall\" backward.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<llaftac>>>"
