    "To spell the word \"sprint\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"sprint.\"\n\n2. **Determine the length of the word**: The word \"sprint\" consists of 6 letters.\n\n3. **List the letters in order**: The letters in \"sprint\" are:\n   - s\n   - p\n   - r\n   - i\n   - n\n   - t\n\n4. **Reverse the order of the letters**: To spell the word backward, we need to reverse the order of these letters:\n   - Start with the last letter: t\n   - Then the second to last letter: n\n   - Then the third to last letter: i\n   - Then the fourth to last letter: r\n   - Then the fifth to last letter: p\n   - Finally, the first letter: s\n\n5. **Combine the reversed letters**: Combine these letters to form the word spelled backward:\n   - t\n   - n\n   - i\n   - r\n   - p\n   - s\n\n6. **Form the final reversed word**: The word \"sprint\" spelled backward is \"tnirps.\"\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"sprint\" backward.\n\nFinal answer: <<<tnirps>>>"
