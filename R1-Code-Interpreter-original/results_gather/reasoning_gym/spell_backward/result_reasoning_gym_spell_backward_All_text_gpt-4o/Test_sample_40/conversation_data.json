    "To spell the word \"buller\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the letters in the word \"buller\":\n   - The word \"buller\" consists of the following letters in order: b, u, l, l, e, r.\n\n2. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter and move to the first letter.\n   - The last letter is \"r\".\n   - The second to last letter is \"e\".\n   - The third to last letter is \"l\".\n   - The fourth to last letter is \"l\".\n   - The fifth to last letter is \"u\".\n   - The first letter is \"b\".\n\n3. Write the letters in the new order:\n   - The reversed order of the letters is: r, e, l, l, u, b.\n\n4. Combine the letters to form the backward spelling of the word:\n   - When combined, the letters form the word \"rellub\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"buller\" spelled backward is \"rellub\".\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<rellub>>>"
