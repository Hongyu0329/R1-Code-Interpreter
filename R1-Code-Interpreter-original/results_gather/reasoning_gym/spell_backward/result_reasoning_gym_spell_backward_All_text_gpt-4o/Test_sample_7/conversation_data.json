    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"themsel\" backward, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Word**: The word given is \"themsel\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: We need to reverse the order of the letters in the word.\n\n3. **Break Down the Word**: The word \"themsel\" consists of the following letters in order: t, h, e, m, s, e, l.\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: To spell the word backward, we need to reverse the order of these letters. This means we start from the last letter and move to the first.\n\n5. **List the Reversed Letters**: \n   - Start with the last letter: l\n   - Then the second to last: e\n   - Then the third to last: s\n   - Then the fourth to last: m\n   - Then the fifth to last: e\n   - Then the sixth to last: h\n   - Finally, the first letter: t\n\n6. **Combine the Reversed Letters**: Combine these letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\n7. **Final Check**: Ensure that all letters are included and in the correct reversed order.\n\nBy following these steps, the word \"themsel\" spelled backward is \"lesmeht\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<lesmeht>>>"
