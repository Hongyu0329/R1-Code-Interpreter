    "To spell the word \"rascalize\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"rascalize\".\n2. Determine the length of the word: It has 9 letters.\n3. Start from the last letter and move to the first letter, writing each letter in reverse order.\n\nLet's list the letters in reverse order:\n\n- The last letter is \"e\".\n- The second to last letter is \"z\".\n- The third to last letter is \"i\".\n- The fourth to last letter is \"l\".\n- The fifth to last letter is \"a\".\n- The sixth to last letter is \"c\".\n- The seventh to last letter is \"s\".\n- The eighth to last letter is \"a\".\n- The ninth to last letter (first letter in the original word) is \"r\".\n\nNow, write these letters in sequence to form the reversed word:\n\n- Start with \"e\".\n- Add \"z\" to get \"ez\".\n- Add \"i\" to get \"ezi\".\n- Add \"l\" to get \"ezil\".\n- Add \"a\" to get \"ezila\".\n- Add \"c\" to get \"ezilac\".\n- Add \"s\" to get \"ezilacs\".\n- Add \"a\" to get \"ezilacsa\".\n- Add \"r\" to get \"ezilacsar\".\n\nThe word \"rascalize\" spelled backward is \"ezilacsar\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<ezilacsar>>>"
