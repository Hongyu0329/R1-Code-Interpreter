    "To spell the word \"hutlet\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the original word: \"hutlet\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: h, u, t, l, e, t.\n3. Reverse the order of these letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: t.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: e.\n   - The third letter in the reversed word will be the third-to-last letter of the original word: l.\n   - The fourth letter in the reversed word will be the fourth-to-last letter of the original word: t.\n   - The fifth letter in the reversed word will be the fifth-to-last letter of the original word: u.\n   - The sixth letter in the reversed word will be the sixth-to-last letter of the original word: h.\n\n4. Combine these letters in the new order to form the reversed word: t, e, l, t, u, h.\n\n5. The final reversed word is: \"teltuh\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"hutlet\" spelled backward is \"teltuh\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<teltuh>>>"
