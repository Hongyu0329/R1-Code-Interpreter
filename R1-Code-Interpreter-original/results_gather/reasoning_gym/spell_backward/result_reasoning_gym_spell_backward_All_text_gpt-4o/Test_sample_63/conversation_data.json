    "To spell the word \"physopodan\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"physopodan\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 10 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: p, h, y, s, o, p, o, d, a, n.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter from the end is 'n'.\n   - The second letter from the end is 'a'.\n   - The third letter from the end is 'd'.\n   - The fourth letter from the end is 'o'.\n   - The fifth letter from the end is 'p'.\n   - The sixth letter from the end is 'o'.\n   - The seventh letter from the end is 's'.\n   - The eighth letter from the end is 'y'.\n   - The ninth letter from the end is 'h'.\n   - The tenth letter from the end is 'p'.\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling: n, a, d, o, p, o, s, y, h, p.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"physopodan\" backward.\n\nFinal answer: <<<nadoposyhp>>>"
