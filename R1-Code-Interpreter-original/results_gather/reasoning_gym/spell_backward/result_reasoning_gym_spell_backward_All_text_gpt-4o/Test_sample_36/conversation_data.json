    "To spell the word \"archaistic\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"archaistic\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: 10 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: a, r, c, h, a, i, s, t, i, c.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: c.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: i.\n   - Continue this process for each letter.\n\nLet's write out the reversed word:\n\n- Original: a, r, c, h, a, i, s, t, i, c\n- Reversed: c, i, t, s, i, a, h, c, r, a\n\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word: \"citsiahcra\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"archaistic\" spelled backward is \"citsiahcra\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<citsiahcra>>>"
