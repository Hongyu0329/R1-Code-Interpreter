    "To spell the word \"raucously\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the letters in the word \"raucously\":\n   - r\n   - a\n   - u\n   - c\n   - o\n   - u\n   - s\n   - l\n   - y\n\n2. Reverse the order of these letters:\n   - Start with the last letter and move to the first.\n   - y\n   - l\n   - s\n   - u\n   - o\n   - c\n   - u\n   - a\n   - r\n\n3. Combine these letters to form the backward spelling of the word:\n   - ylusocu ar\n\n4. Ensure there are no spaces between the letters:\n   - ylsuocuar\n\nTherefore, the word \"raucously\" spelled backward is \"ylsuocuar\".\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<ylsuocuar>>>"
