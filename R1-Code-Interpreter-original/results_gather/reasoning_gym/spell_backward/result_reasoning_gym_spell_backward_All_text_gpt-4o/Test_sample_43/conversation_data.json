    "To spell the word \"unlustily\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"unlustily\"\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 9 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: u, n, l, u, s, t, i, l, y\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter and move to the first.\n   - The last letter is 'y'.\n   - The second last letter is 'l'.\n   - The third last letter is 'i'.\n   - The fourth last letter is 't'.\n   - The fifth last letter is 's'.\n   - The sixth last letter is 'u'.\n   - The seventh last letter is 'l'.\n   - The eighth last letter is 'n'.\n   - The ninth last letter is 'u'.\n5. Write the letters in the new order: y, l, i, t, s, u, l, n, u\n\nNow, combine these letters to form the backward spelling of the word:\n\n- ylit sulnu\n\nTherefore, the word \"unlustily\" spelled backward is \"ylitsulnu\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<ylitsulnu>>>"
