    "To spell the word \"belton\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the original word: \"belton\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: b, e, l, t, o, n.\n3. Reverse the order of these letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: n.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: o.\n   - The third letter in the reversed word will be the third-to-last letter of the original word: t.\n   - The fourth letter in the reversed word will be the fourth-to-last letter of the original word: l.\n   - The fifth letter in the reversed word will be the fifth-to-last letter of the original word: e.\n   - The sixth letter in the reversed word will be the sixth-to-last letter of the original word: b.\n\n4. Combine these letters in the new order to form the reversed word: n, o, t, l, e, b.\n\n5. The final reversed word is: \"notleb\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"belton\" spelled backward is \"notleb\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<notleb>>>"
