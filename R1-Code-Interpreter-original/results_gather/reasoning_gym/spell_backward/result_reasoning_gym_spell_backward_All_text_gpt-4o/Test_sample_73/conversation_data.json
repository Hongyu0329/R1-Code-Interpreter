    "To spell the word \"blossomed\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: blossomed\n2. List the letters in the word in order: b, l, o, s, s, o, m, e, d\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter: d\n   - Move to the second last letter: e\n   - Continue this process for each letter:\n     - m\n     - o\n     - s\n     - s\n     - o\n     - l\n     - b\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word: d, e, m, o, s, s, o, l, b\n\nBy following these steps, we have spelled the word \"blossomed\" backward.\n\nFinal answer: <<<demossolb>>>"
