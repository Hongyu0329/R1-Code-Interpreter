    "To spell the word \"myxoglioma\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"myxoglioma\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 10 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: m, y, x, o, g, l, i, o, m, a.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter from the end is 'a'.\n   - The second letter from the end is 'm'.\n   - The third letter from the end is 'o'.\n   - The fourth letter from the end is 'i'.\n   - The fifth letter from the end is 'l'.\n   - The sixth letter from the end is 'g'.\n   - The seventh letter from the end is 'o'.\n   - The eighth letter from the end is 'x'.\n   - The ninth letter from the end is 'y'.\n   - The tenth letter from the end is 'm'.\n5. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling: \"amoiolgxym\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"myxoglioma\" spelled backward is \"amoiolgxym\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<amoiolgxym>>>"
