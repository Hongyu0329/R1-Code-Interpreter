    "To spell the word \"metewand\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the original word: \"metewand\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: m, e, t, e, w, a, n, d.\n3. Reverse the order of these letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: d.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: n.\n   - Continue this process for each letter:\n     - Third letter: a\n     - Fourth letter: w\n     - Fifth letter: e\n     - Sixth letter: t\n     - Seventh letter: e\n     - Eighth letter: m\n4. Combine these letters in the new order to form the reversed word.\n\nBy following these steps, the word \"metewand\" spelled backward is \"dnawetem\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<dnawetem>>>"
