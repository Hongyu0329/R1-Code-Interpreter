    "To spell the word \"forefather\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"forefather\".\n2. Count the number of letters in the word: There are 10 letters.\n3. List the letters in order: f, o, r, e, f, a, t, h, e, r.\n4. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter becomes the last: r\n   - The second letter becomes the second last: e\n   - The third letter becomes the third last: h\n   - The fourth letter becomes the fourth last: t\n   - The fifth letter becomes the fifth last: a\n   - The sixth letter becomes the sixth last: f\n   - The seventh letter becomes the seventh last: e\n   - The eighth letter becomes the eighth last: r\n   - The ninth letter becomes the ninth last: o\n   - The tenth letter becomes the first: f\n5. Write the letters in the new order: r, e, h, t, a, f, e, r, o, f.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"forefather\" backward.\n\nFinal answer: <<<rehtaforef>>>"
