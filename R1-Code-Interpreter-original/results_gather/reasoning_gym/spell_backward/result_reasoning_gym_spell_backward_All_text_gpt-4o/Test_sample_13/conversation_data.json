    "To spell the word \"Karamojo\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the original word: \"Karamojo\".\n2. List the letters in the word in order: K, a, r, a, m, o, j, o.\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: o.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: j.\n   - Continue this process for each letter:\n     - Third letter: o\n     - Fourth letter: m\n     - Fifth letter: a\n     - Sixth letter: r\n     - Seventh letter: a\n     - Eighth letter: K\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the backward spelling of \"Karamojo\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<ojomaraK>>>"
