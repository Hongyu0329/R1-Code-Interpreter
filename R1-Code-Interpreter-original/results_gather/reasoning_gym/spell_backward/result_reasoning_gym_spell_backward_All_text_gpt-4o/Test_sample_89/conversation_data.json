    "To spell the word \"garnel\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify the letters in the word \"garnel\":\n   - The word \"garnel\" consists of the following letters in order: g, a, r, n, e, l.\n\n2. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter and move to the first:\n     - The last letter is \"l\".\n     - The second to last letter is \"e\".\n     - The third to last letter is \"n\".\n     - The fourth to last letter is \"r\".\n     - The fifth to last letter is \"a\".\n     - The first letter is \"g\".\n\n3. Write the letters in the new order:\n   - The reversed order of the letters is: l, e, n, r, a, g.\n\n4. Combine the letters to form the backward spelling of the word:\n   - Combine the letters \"l\", \"e\", \"n\", \"r\", \"a\", \"g\" to form the word \"lenrag\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"garnel\" spelled backward is \"lenrag\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<lenrag>>>"
