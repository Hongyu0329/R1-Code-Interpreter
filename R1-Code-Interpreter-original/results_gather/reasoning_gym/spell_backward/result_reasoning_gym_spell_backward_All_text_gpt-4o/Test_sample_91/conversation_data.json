    "To spell the word \"rinch\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the letters in the word \"rinch\":\n   - The word \"rinch\" consists of the following letters in order: r, i, n, c, h.\n\n2. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - Start with the last letter and move to the first:\n     - The last letter is \"h\".\n     - The second to last letter is \"c\".\n     - The third to last letter is \"n\".\n     - The fourth to last letter is \"i\".\n     - The first letter is \"r\".\n\n3. Combine the letters in the new order:\n   - By reversing the order, we get the sequence: h, c, n, i, r.\n\n4. Form the backward spelling of the word:\n   - Combine the reversed sequence of letters to form the word: \"hcnir\".\n\nTherefore, the word \"rinch\" spelled backward is \"hcnir\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<hcnir>>>"
