    "To spell the word \"convener\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the original word: \"convener\".\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: c, o, n, v, e, n, e, r.\n3. Reverse the order of these letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: r.\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second-to-last letter of the original word: e.\n   - Continue this process for each letter:\n     - Third letter: n\n     - Fourth letter: e\n     - Fifth letter: v\n     - Sixth letter: n\n     - Seventh letter: o\n     - Eighth letter: c\n4. Combine these letters to form the reversed word: r, e, n, e, v, n, o, c.\n\nTherefore, the word \"convener\" spelled backward is \"renevnoc\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<renevnoc>>>"
