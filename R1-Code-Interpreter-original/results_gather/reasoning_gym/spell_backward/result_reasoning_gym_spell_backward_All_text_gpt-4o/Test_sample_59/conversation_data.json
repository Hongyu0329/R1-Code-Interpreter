    "To spell the word \"Enopla\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the original word: Enopla\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: E, n, o, p, l, a\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter in the reversed word will be the last letter of the original word: a\n   - The second letter in the reversed word will be the second to last letter of the original word: l\n   - The third letter in the reversed word will be the third to last letter of the original word: p\n   - The fourth letter in the reversed word will be the fourth to last letter of the original word: o\n   - The fifth letter in the reversed word will be the fifth to last letter of the original word: n\n   - The sixth letter in the reversed word will be the first letter of the original word: E\n\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling of the word: alponE\n\nTherefore, the word \"Enopla\" spelled backward is \"alponE\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<alponE>>>"
