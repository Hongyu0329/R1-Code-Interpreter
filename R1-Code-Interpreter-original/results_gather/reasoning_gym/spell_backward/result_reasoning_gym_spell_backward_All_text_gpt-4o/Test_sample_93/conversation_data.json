    "To spell the word \"coltskin\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the word: \"coltskin\"\n2. Break down the word into individual letters: c, o, l, t, s, k, i, n\n3. Reverse the order of the letters:\n   - The first letter from the end is 'n'\n   - The second letter from the end is 'i'\n   - The third letter from the end is 'k'\n   - The fourth letter from the end is 's'\n   - The fifth letter from the end is 't'\n   - The sixth letter from the end is 'l'\n   - The seventh letter from the end is 'o'\n   - The eighth letter from the end is 'c'\n4. Combine the reversed letters to form the backward spelling: n, i, k, s, t, l, o, c\n\nTherefore, the word \"coltskin\" spelled backward is \"nikstloc\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<nikstloc>>>"
