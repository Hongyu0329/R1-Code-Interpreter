    "To spell the word \"unstout\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the word**: The word given is \"unstout\".\n\n2. **Count the letters**: The word \"unstout\" consists of 7 letters.\n\n3. **List the letters in order**: \n   - u\n   - n\n   - s\n   - t\n   - o\n   - u\n   - t\n\n4. **Reverse the order of the letters**: \n   - Start from the last letter and move to the first.\n   - The last letter is 't', followed by 'u', 'o', 't', 's', 'n', and finally 'u'.\n\n5. **Write the letters in reverse order**: \n   - t\n   - u\n   - o\n   - t\n   - s\n   - n\n   - u\n\n6. **Combine the reversed letters to form the backward word**: \n   - The backward spelling of \"unstout\" is \"tuotsnu\".\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully spelled the word \"unstout\" backward.\n\nFinal answer: <<<tuotsnu>>>"
