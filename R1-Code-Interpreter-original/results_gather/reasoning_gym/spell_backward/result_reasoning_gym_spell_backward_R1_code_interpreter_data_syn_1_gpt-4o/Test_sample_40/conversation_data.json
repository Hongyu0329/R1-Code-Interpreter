    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"buller\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the characters in the word. This can be efficiently done using Python by utilizing string slicing.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Take the input word \"buller\".\n2. Reverse the string using Python's slicing feature.\n3. Print the reversed string.\n\nLet's implement this in a Python script:\n\n```python\n# Define the word\nword = \"buller\"\n\n# Reverse the word using slicing\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\n\n# Print the reversed word\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed word.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output \"rellub\" is the word \"buller\" spelled backward. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<rellub>>>"
