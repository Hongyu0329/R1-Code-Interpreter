    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"recheck\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. The process involves taking the string \"recheck\" and reversing it to get the backward spelling.\n\nLet's write a simple Python script to reverse the string \"recheck\".\n\n```python\n# Define the word\nword = \"recheck\"\n\n# Reverse the word\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\n\n# Print the reversed word\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nThis script will reverse the string and print the result. Let's execute the code to get the backward spelling of \"recheck\".",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the reversed string \"kcehcer\". This is the correct backward spelling of the word \"recheck\".\n\n<<<kcehcer>>>"
