    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"shellburst\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the characters in the string. This can be efficiently done using Python, which provides straightforward methods for string manipulation.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We have the word \"shellburst\".\n2. We need to reverse the string to get the backward spelling.\n3. In Python, strings can be reversed using slicing. The slice notation `[::-1]` is used to reverse a string.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the string \"shellburst\".\n\n```python\n# Define the word\nword = \"shellburst\"\n\n# Reverse the word using slicing\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\n\n# Print the reversed word\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed word.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output \"tsrubllehs\" is the word \"shellburst\" spelled backward. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<tsrubllehs>>>"
