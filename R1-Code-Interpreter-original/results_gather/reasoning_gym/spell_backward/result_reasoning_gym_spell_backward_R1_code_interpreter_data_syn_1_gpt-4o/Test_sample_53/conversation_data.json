    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"scuffle\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. This can be efficiently done using Python by utilizing string slicing. The slicing method allows us to reverse a string by specifying a step of -1.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the word \"scuffle\":\n\n```python\nword = \"scuffle\"\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nThis script will reverse the string and print the result. Let's execute the code to get the reversed word.",
