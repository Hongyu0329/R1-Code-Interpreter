    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"blossomed\" backward, we need to reverse the string. The process involves taking the string and reversing the order of its characters. This can be efficiently done using Python, which provides a simple way to reverse strings using slicing.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the word \"blossomed\":\n\n```python\n# Define the word\nword = \"blossomed\"\n\n# Reverse the word using slicing\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\n\n# Print the reversed word\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nThis script will reverse the string \"blossomed\" and print the result. Let's execute the code to get the reversed word.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output \"demossolb\" is the correct reversed version of the word \"blossomed\". \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<demossolb>>>"
