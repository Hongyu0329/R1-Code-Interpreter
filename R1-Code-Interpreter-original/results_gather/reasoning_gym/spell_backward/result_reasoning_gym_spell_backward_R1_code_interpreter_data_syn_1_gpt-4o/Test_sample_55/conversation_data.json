    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"catfall\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the characters in the word. This can be efficiently done using Python by utilizing string slicing. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We have the word \"catfall\".\n2. To reverse it, we can use Python's slicing feature, which allows us to specify a start, stop, and step for slicing a string.\n3. By using a step of -1, we can reverse the string.\n\nLet's write a Python script to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Define the word\nword = \"catfall\"\n\n# Reverse the word using slicing\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\n\n# Print the reversed word\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nThis script will reverse the string \"catfall\" and print the result. Let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the reversed string \"llaftac\". This is the correct backward spelling of the word \"catfall\". \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<llaftac>>>"
