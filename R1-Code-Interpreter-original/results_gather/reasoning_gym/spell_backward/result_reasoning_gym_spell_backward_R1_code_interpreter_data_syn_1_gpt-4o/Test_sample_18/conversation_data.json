    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"gametogony\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the characters in the word. This can be efficiently done using Python by utilizing string slicing. \n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Take the input word \"gametogony\".\n2. Use Python's string slicing feature to reverse the string.\n3. Print the reversed string.\n\nLet's implement this in a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Define the word\nword = \"gametogony\"\n\n# Reverse the word using string slicing\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\n\n# Print the reversed word\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed word.",
    "The code executed successfully and reversed the word \"gametogony\" to \"ynogotemag\". \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<ynogotemag>>>"
