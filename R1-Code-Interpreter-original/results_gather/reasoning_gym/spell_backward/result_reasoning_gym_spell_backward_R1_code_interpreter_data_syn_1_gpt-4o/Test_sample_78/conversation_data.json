    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"intertone\" backward, we need to reverse the string. This can be efficiently done using Python, which provides straightforward methods for string manipulation.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Take the input word \"intertone\".\n2. Reverse the string.\n3. Output the reversed string.\n\nLet's write a Python script to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Define the word\nword = \"intertone\"\n\n# Reverse the word\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\n\n# Print the reversed word\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nThis script will reverse the string \"intertone\" and print the result. Let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and reversed the word \"intertone\" to \"enotretni\". \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<enotretni>>>"
