    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"impoverish\" backward, we need to reverse the string. This can be efficiently done using Python, which provides straightforward methods for string manipulation.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Take the word \"impoverish\".\n2. Reverse the string using Python slicing.\n\nLet's write the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nword = \"impoverish\"\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nThis code will reverse the string \"impoverish\" and print the result. Let's execute this code to get the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and reversed the word \"impoverish\" to \"hsirevopmi\". \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<hsirevopmi>>>"
