    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"jongleur\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the characters in the word. This can be efficiently done using Python, which provides straightforward methods for string manipulation.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Take the input word \"jongleur\".\n2. Reverse the string.\n3. Output the reversed string.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the word\nword = \"jongleur\"\n\n# Reverse the word\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\n\n# Print the reversed word\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the reversed word.",
