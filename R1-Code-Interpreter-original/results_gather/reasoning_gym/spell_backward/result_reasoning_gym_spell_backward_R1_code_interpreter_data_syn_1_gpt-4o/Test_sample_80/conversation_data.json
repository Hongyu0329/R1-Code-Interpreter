    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"copromoter\" backward, we need to reverse the string. This can be efficiently done using Python, which provides straightforward methods for string manipulation.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We have the word \"copromoter\".\n2. We need to reverse the string to get the backward spelling.\n3. In Python, strings can be reversed using slicing. The syntax for reversing a string `s` is `s[::-1]`.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the word \"copromoter\" and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the word\nword = \"copromoter\"\n\n# Reverse the word using slicing\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\n\n# Print the reversed word\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the backward spelling of \"copromoter\".",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the reversed string of \"copromoter\" as \"retomorpoc\". \n\nTherefore, the backward spelling of \"copromoter\" is:\n\n<<<retomorpoc>>>"
