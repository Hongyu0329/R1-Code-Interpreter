    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"matutinely\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the characters in the word. This can be efficiently done using Python by utilizing string slicing.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Take the input word \"matutinely\".\n2. Reverse the string using Python's slicing feature.\n3. Print the reversed string.\n\nLet's write the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nword = \"matutinely\"\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed word.",
