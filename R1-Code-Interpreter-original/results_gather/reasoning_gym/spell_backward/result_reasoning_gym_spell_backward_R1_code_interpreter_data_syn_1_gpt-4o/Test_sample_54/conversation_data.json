    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"cache\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the letters in the word. The word \"cache\" consists of the letters 'c', 'a', 'c', 'h', and 'e'. Reversing these letters will give us the word spelled backward.\n\nLet's write a simple Python script to reverse the word \"cache\".\n\n```python\nword = \"cache\"\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nThis script uses Python's slicing feature to reverse the string. The slice `[::-1]` means to take the string and step backward through it, effectively reversing it.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed word.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output \"ehcac\" is the word \"cache\" spelled backward. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<ehcac>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Spell this word backward (example: sun -> nus): cache\nEnclose final answer within triple angle brackets, i.e. <<<the answer>>>",
