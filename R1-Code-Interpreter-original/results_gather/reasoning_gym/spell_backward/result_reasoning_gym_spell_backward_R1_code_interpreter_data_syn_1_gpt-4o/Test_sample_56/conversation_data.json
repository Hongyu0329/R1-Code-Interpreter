    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"microzyme\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the characters in the string. This can be efficiently done using Python, which provides straightforward methods for string manipulation.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Take the input word \"microzyme\".\n2. Reverse the string using Python slicing.\n3. Print the reversed string.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the word\nword = \"microzyme\"\n\n# Reverse the word using slicing\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\n\n# Print the reversed word\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed word.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the reversed word \"emyzorcim\". \n\nTherefore, the word \"microzyme\" spelled backward is:\n\n<<<emyzorcim>>>"
