    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"Flora\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the characters in the string. This can be efficiently done using Python, which provides straightforward methods for string manipulation.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We have the word \"Flora\".\n2. We need to reverse the string to get the backward spelling.\n3. In Python, we can reverse a string using slicing. The syntax for reversing a string `s` is `s[::-1]`.\n\nLet's implement this in a Python script to get the reversed word.\n\n```python\n# Original word\nword = \"Flora\"\n\n# Reversed word\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\n\n# Output the reversed word\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the reversed word \"arolF\". \n\nTherefore, the word \"Flora\" spelled backward is:\n\n<<<arolF>>>"
