    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"metewand\" backward, we need to reverse the order of the characters in the string. This can be efficiently done using Python, which provides straightforward methods for string manipulation.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We have the word \"metewand\".\n2. To reverse the string, we can use Python's slicing feature. By using the slice notation `[::-1]`, we can reverse the string.\n3. The reversed string will be the answer.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original word\nword = \"metewand\"\n\n# Reversed word\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\n\n# Output the reversed word\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed word.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output \"dnawetem\" is the word \"metewand\" spelled backward. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<dnawetem>>>"
