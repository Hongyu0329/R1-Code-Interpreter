    "To solve the problem of spelling the word \"obfuscate\" backward, we need to reverse the string. The process involves taking the string and reversing the order of its characters. This can be efficiently done using Python, which provides straightforward methods for string manipulation.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Take the input string \"obfuscate\".\n2. Reverse the string using Python's slicing feature.\n3. Output the reversed string.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the word\nword = \"obfuscate\"\n\n# Reverse the word using slicing\nreversed_word = word[::-1]\n\n# Print the reversed word\nprint(reversed_word)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed word.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the reversed string \"etacsufbo\". \n\nTherefore, the word \"obfuscate\" spelled backward is:\n\n<<<etacsufbo>>>"
