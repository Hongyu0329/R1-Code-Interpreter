    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the start position '=' to the goal 't'. BFS is well-suited for this task because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's implement this approach to find the minimum number of steps.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the maze\nmaze = [\n    \",,,,,,,,,,\",\n    \",llllllll,\",\n    \",ll,,llll,\",\n    \",llllllll,\",\n    \",ll,llll,,\",\n    \",l,llll,,,\",\n    \",tlllll,l,\",\n    \",lll,,=ll,\",\n    \",,lll,lll,\",\n    \",,,,,,,,,,\"\n]\n\n# Convert the maze into a 2D list for easier manipulation\nmaze = [list(row) for row in maze]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (7, 6)  # Position of '='\ngoal = (6, 1)   # Position of 't'\n\n# Define possible movements: up, down, left, right\nmovements = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue for BFS and add the start position\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (current_pos, steps) = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the goal\n    if current_pos == goal:\n        min_steps = steps\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for move in movements:\n        new_pos = (current_pos[0] + move[0], current_pos[1] + move[1])\n        \n        # Check if the new position is within bounds and is a passage\n        if (0 <= new_pos[0] < len(maze) and\n            0 <= new_pos[1] < len(maze[0]) and\n            maze[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] == 'l' and\n            new_pos not in visited):\n            \n            visited.add(new_pos)\n            queue.append((new_pos, steps + 1))\n\nmin_steps\nassistant > It seems there was an error in the code execution.
