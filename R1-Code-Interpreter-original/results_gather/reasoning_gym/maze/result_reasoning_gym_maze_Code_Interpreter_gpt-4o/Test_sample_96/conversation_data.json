    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the start position ('$') to the goal ('K') in the grid. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it does so with the minimum number of steps.\n\nLet's implement this approach to find the minimum number of steps.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"uuuuuuuu\",\n    \"u$uuuuuu\",\n    \"uPPPuuPu\",\n    \"uPPPPPPu\",\n    \"uuPKPuPu\",\n    \"uPuPPuuu\",\n    \"uPPPPPPu\",\n    \"uuuuuuuu\"\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (1, 1)  # Position of '$'\ngoal = (4, 3)   # Position of 'K'\n\n# Define possible movements: up, down, left, right\nmovements = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs_shortest_path(grid, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in movements:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if (0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and\n                grid[nx][ny] != 'u' and (nx, ny) not in visited):\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs_shortest_path(grid, start, goal)\nmin_steps\nassistant > The minimum number of steps to reach the goal 'K' from the start '$' is <<<5>>>."
