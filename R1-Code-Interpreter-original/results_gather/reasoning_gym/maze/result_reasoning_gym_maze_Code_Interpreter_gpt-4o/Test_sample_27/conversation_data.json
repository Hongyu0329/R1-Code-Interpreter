    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the start position '@' to the goal 'W'. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's implement this approach to find the minimum number of steps required.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"ssssssssss\",\n    \"saaaWsaaas\",\n    \"ssassssaas\",\n    \"ssaaaassss\",\n    \"saaaaassss\",\n    \"saaaaa@aas\",\n    \"sasaaasass\",\n    \"saaaaaaaas\",\n    \"saaasaasss\",\n    \"ssssssssss\"\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (5, 7)  # '@' position\ngoal = (1, 4)   # 'W' position\n\n# Define possible movements: up, down, left, right\nmovements = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, goal, grid):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in movements:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if (0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and\n                grid[nx][ny] == 'a' and (nx, ny) not in visited):\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start, goal, grid)\nmin_steps\nassistant > It seems there was an error in the implementation.
