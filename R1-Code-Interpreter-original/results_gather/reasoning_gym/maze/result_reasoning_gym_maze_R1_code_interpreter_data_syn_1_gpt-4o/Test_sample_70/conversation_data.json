    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position ';' to the goal position 'J' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where 'i' represents walls, ']' represents passages, and we can only move through passages. The task is to determine the minimum number of steps required to reach 'J' from ';'.\n\nThe approach to solve this problem is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning and the corresponding Python code to implement BFS:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: First, we need to locate the positions of ';' and 'J' in the grid.\n\n2. **Initialize BFS**: Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the number of steps taken to reach there. Start with the initial position of ';' and 0 steps.\n\n3. **Explore Neighbors**: For each position, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) if they are within bounds and are passages (']').\n\n4. **Check for Goal**: If the goal 'J' is reached, return the number of steps taken.\n\n5. **Avoid Revisiting**: Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles and redundant work.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_min_steps(grid):\n    # Locate start and goal positions\n    start = None\n    goal = None\n    for r in range(len(grid)):\n        for c in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[r][c] == ';':\n                start = (r, c)\n            elif grid[r][c] == 'J':\n                goal = (r, c)\n    \n    # Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # BFS initialization\n    queue = deque([(start[0], start[1], 0)])  # (row, col, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        r, c, steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the goal\n        if (r, c) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if (0 <= nr < len(grid) and 0 <= nc < len(grid[0]) and\n                grid[nr][nc] in [']', 'J'] and (nr, nc) not in visited):\n                visited.add((nr, nc))\n                queue.append((nr, nc, steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"iiiiiiii\",\n    \"i]ii]]ii\",\n    \"i]iii]ii\",\n    \"ii]]]J]i\",\n    \"i]i]]]]i\",\n    \"i]]]]]ii\",\n    \"i;]i]i]i\",\n    \"iiiiiiii\"\n]\n\n# Find the minimum steps\nmin_steps = find_min_steps(grid)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach 'J' from ';'. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
