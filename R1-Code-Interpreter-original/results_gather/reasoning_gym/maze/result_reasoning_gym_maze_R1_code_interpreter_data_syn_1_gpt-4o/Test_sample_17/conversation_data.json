    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point 'Q' to the goal 'e' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where '8' represents walls, 'I' represents passages, 'Q' is the starting point, and 'e' is the goal.\n\nThe problem can be approached using a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Represent the grid as a 2D list.\n2. Use BFS to explore the grid starting from 'Q'.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n4. Count the number of steps taken to reach 'e'.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"8888888\",\n    \"88III88\",\n    \"8Q8II88\",\n    \"8IIIII8\",\n    \"8II8II8\",\n    \"88IeI88\",\n    \"8888888\"\n]\n\n# Convert grid to a list of lists for easier manipulation\ngrid = [list(row) for row in grid]\n\n# Find the starting point 'Q'\nstart = None\nfor i in range(len(grid)):\n    for j in range(len(grid[i])):\n        if grid[i][j] == 'Q':\n            start = (i, j)\n            break\n    if start:\n        break\n\n# Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we've reached the goal\n        if grid[x][y] == 'e':\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                if grid[nx][ny] in ('I', 'e'):  # Can move to passages or the goal\n                    visited.add((nx, ny))\n                    queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the minimum number of steps.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `5`, which indicates that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'e' from the starting point 'Q' is 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
