    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '}' to the goal '`' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where '|' represents walls and 'W' represents passages. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: \n   - Start ('}') is at position (1, 7).\n   - Goal ('`') is at position (4, 3).\n\n2. **Set Up the BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Use a dictionary to store the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n3. **Define Valid Moves**:\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move doesn't hit a wall ('|') or go out of bounds.\n\n4. **Implement the BFS**:\n   - Start from the initial position and explore all possible moves.\n   - For each move, check if it leads to the goal. If yes, return the number of steps taken.\n   - If not, add the new position to the queue and continue exploring.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"||||||||||\",\n    \"||W||W}WW|\",\n    \"|WWW|W|WW|\",\n    \"|W||WWWW||\",\n    \"|WWW`WW|||\",\n    \"|||W|WWWW|\",\n    \"||WW|WW|W|\",\n    \"||WWW||WW|\",\n    \"|WWWW|W|W|\",\n    \"||||||||||\"\n]\n\n# Define start and goal positions\nstart = (1, 7)\ngoal = (4, 3)\n\n# Define possible moves (up, down, left, right)\nmoves = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue for BFS\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# BFS algorithm\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore all possible moves\n    for dx, dy in moves:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        \n        # Check if the new position is within bounds and not a wall\n        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] != '|' and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n            visited.add((nx, ny))\n            queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position.",
    "The code has successfully executed and found that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal '`' from the start '}' is 7. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7>>>"
