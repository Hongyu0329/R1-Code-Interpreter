    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position (marked as ''') to the goal position (marked as '\\') in the given grid. The grid is represented as a 2D array where 'A' represents a wall and 'n' represents a passage. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: \n   - The start position is at (7, 1) (0-indexed).\n   - The goal position is at (7, 5) (0-indexed).\n\n2. **Set Up the BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid.\n   - Start from the initial position and explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) that lead to a passage ('n').\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n3. **Implement the BFS**:\n   - Initialize the queue with the start position and a step count of 0.\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue the front element, check if it is the goal, and if not, enqueue all valid neighboring positions with an incremented step count.\n   - If the goal is reached, return the step count.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"AAAAAAAAA\",\n    \"AAnAnnnAA\",\n    \"AnnnAAAnA\",\n    \"AnnnAnAAA\",\n    \"AAnnnnAnA\",\n    \"AnAnAAnAA\",\n    \"AAnnnnAAA\",\n    \"A\\nnnn'nA\",\n    \"AAAAAAAAA\"\n]\n\n# Convert grid to a list of lists for easier manipulation\ngrid = [list(row) for row in grid]\n\n# Define start and goal positions\nstart = (7, 1)\ngoal = (7, 5)\n\n# Define possible moves (up, down, left, right)\nmoves = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue for BFS\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for dx, dy in moves:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n            if grid[nx][ny] == 'n':\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position."

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Navigate from ''' (start) to '\\' (goal):\n\n```\nAAAAAAAAA\nAAnAnnnAA\nAnnnAAAnA\nAnnnAnAAA\nAAnnnnAnA\nAnAnAAnAA\nAAnnnnAAA\nA\\nnnn'nA\nAAAAAAAAA\n```\nLegend: 'A' = Wall, 'n' = Passage\n\nWhat is the minimum number of steps to reach the goal?\nGive only the number of steps as your final answer, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<10>>>."
