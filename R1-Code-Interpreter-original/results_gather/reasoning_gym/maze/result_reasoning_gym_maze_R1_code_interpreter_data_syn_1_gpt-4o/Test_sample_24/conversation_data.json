    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point 'Y' to the goal '@' in the given grid. This is a classic pathfinding problem that can be efficiently solved using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning and approach:\n\n1. **Grid Representation**: We have a grid where '*' represents walls, '1' represents open passages, 'Y' is the starting point, and '@' is the goal.\n\n2. **BFS Algorithm**: We'll use BFS because it explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n3. **Queue Initialization**: We'll initialize a queue with the starting position 'Y' and a step count of 0.\n\n4. **Direction Vectors**: We'll define possible movements (up, down, left, right) as direction vectors.\n\n5. **Visited Set**: To avoid revisiting nodes, we'll maintain a set of visited nodes.\n\n6. **BFS Execution**: We'll dequeue a position, check if it's the goal '@', and if not, enqueue all valid, unvisited neighboring positions with an incremented step count.\n\n7. **Output**: Once we reach the goal, the step count will be the minimum number of steps required.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"*********\",\n    \"*11**111*\",\n    \"*@111111*\",\n    \"*1*11111*\",\n    \"*11***11*\",\n    \"*11*1111*\",\n    \"**11Y111*\",\n    \"*1111111*\",\n    \"*********\"\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (6, 4)  # 'Y' position\ngoal = (2, 1)   # '@' position\n\n# Define possible movements: up, down, left, right\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue with the start position and step count\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# BFS algorithm\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if (0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and\n            grid[nx][ny] != '*' and (nx, ny) not in visited):\n            visited.add((nx, ny))\n            queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal '@' from the start 'Y'. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
