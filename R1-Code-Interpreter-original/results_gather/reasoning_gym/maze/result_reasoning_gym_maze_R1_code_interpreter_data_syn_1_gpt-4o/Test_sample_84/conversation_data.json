    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point '}' to the goal 'C' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where '/' represents walls and '(' represents passages. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: \n   - Start at the position of '}'.\n   - Goal is at the position of 'C'.\n\n2. **Set Up the BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n3. **Explore the Grid**:\n   - From each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) that lead to a passage '(' and are within the grid bounds.\n   - If the goal 'C' is reached, return the number of steps taken.\n\n4. **Implement the BFS in Python**:\n   - Use a queue to manage the exploration of the grid.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to prevent cycles.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"////////\",\n    \"//((//(/\",\n    \"/((((((/\",\n    \"/(((/(}/\",\n    \"/((/(((/\",\n    \"/((((///\",\n    \"/((((C//\",\n    \"////////\"\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal\nstart = (3, 7)  # Position of '}'\ngoal = (6, 5)   # Position of 'C'\n\n# Define possible moves (up, down, left, right)\nmoves = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the BFS queue\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for dx, dy in moves:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n            if grid[nx][ny] == '(' or grid[nx][ny] == 'C':\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'C' from the start '}'. Let's execute it to find the answer."
