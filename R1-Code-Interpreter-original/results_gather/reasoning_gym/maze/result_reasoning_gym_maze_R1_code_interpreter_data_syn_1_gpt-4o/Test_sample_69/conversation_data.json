    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '(' to the goal 'J' in the given grid. This is a classic pathfinding problem that can be efficiently solved using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: \n   - Start: '(' is located at (2, 5).\n   - Goal: 'J' is located at (1, 1).\n\n2. **Set Up the BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Use a dictionary or a 2D list to store the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n3. **Define Movement Directions**:\n   - The possible movements are up, down, left, and right.\n\n4. **Implement the BFS**:\n   - Initialize the queue with the start position and set the initial step count to 0.\n   - Explore each position by moving in all possible directions.\n   - If the goal is reached, return the number of steps taken.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"--------\",\n    \"-ooo-o--\",\n    \"-Jooooo-\",\n    \"-o-o-(o-\",\n    \"-ooooo--\",\n    \"-o-oo-o-\",\n    \"--oo-oo-\",\n    \"--------\"\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (2, 5)\ngoal = (1, 1)\n\n# Define the possible movements: up, down, left, right\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue for BFS\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if (0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and\n            grid[nx][ny] == 'o' and (nx, ny) not in visited):\n            visited.add((nx, ny))\n            queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'J' from the start '(' in the grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and found that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'J' from the start '(' is 5. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
