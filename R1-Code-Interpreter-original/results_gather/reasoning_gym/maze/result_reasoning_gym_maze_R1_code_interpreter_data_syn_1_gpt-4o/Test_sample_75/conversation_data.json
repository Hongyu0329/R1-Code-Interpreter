    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '-' to the goal position '~' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a 10x10 matrix with walls ('v') and passages ('<'). The start position is marked with '-' and the goal position is marked with '~'.\n\nThe approach to solve this problem is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Parse the grid to identify the start and goal positions.\n2. Implement the BFS algorithm:\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - For each position, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) if they are passages ('<') and not walls ('v').\n   - Stop when the goal position is reached and return the number of steps taken.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"vvvvvvvvvv\",\n    \"vv<vvvvvvv\",\n    \"vv<<<vv<<v\",\n    \"v<<<~<<<vv\",\n    \"v<<vv<<<<v\",\n    \"v<<vvv<<<v\",\n    \"vv<<<vv<vv\",\n    \"vv<vv<<<<v\",\n    \"v<<vv<-<<v\",\n    \"vvvvvvvvvv\"\n]\n\n# Find the start and goal positions\nstart = None\ngoal = None\nfor i, row in enumerate(grid):\n    for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n        if cell == '-':\n            start = (i, j)\n        elif cell == '~':\n            goal = (i, j)\n\n# Directions for moving in the grid (left, right, up, down)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the goal\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < 10 and 0 <= ny < 10 and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                if grid[nx][ny] == '<' or grid[nx][ny] == '~':\n                    visited.add((nx, ny))\n                    queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start, goal)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the minimum number of steps.",
    "The code executed successfully and found that the minimum number of steps to reach the goal '~' from the start '-' is 9. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
