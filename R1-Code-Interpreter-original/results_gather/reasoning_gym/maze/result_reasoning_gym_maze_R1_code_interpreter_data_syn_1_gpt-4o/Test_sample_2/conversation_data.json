    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '-' to the goal '3' in the given grid. This is a classic pathfinding problem that can be efficiently solved using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning and approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: \n   - The start position '-' is located at (3, 7) in the grid.\n   - The goal position '3' is located at (1, 1) in the grid.\n\n2. **Grid Representation**:\n   - The grid is represented as a 2D list where '&' represents walls, 'J' represents passages, '-' is the start, and '3' is the goal.\n\n3. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize a queue with the start position and a step count of 0.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - If a move leads to the goal, return the step count.\n   - If a move is valid (within bounds, not a wall, and not visited), add it to the queue with an incremented step count.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - Implement the BFS algorithm in Python to compute the minimum number of steps.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"&&&&&&&&&&\",\n    \"&J3JJJ&&J&\",\n    \"&&JJ&J&&J&\",\n    \"&&&JJJ&-&&\",\n    \"&&&&&JJJJ&\",\n    \"&JJJJJ&J&&\",\n    \"&&JJ&&JJ&&\",\n    \"&JJJ&JJJ&&\",\n    \"&&J&JJJ&&&\",\n    \"&&&&&&&&&&\"\n]\n\n# Define start and goal positions\nstart = (3, 7)\ngoal = (1, 1)\n\n# Define possible moves (up, down, left, right)\nmoves = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, goal, grid):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the goal\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in moves:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] != '&' and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start, goal, grid)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the minimum number of steps.",
    "The code execution indicates that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal '3' from the start '-' is 10. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10>>>"
