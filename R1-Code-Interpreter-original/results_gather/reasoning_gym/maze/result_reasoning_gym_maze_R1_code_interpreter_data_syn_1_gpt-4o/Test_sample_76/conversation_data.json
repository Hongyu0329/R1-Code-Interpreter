    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point 'a' to the goal '[' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where 'g' represents walls, '|' represents passages, and we can only move through passages. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: \n   - Start ('a') is at position (5, 3).\n   - Goal ('[') is at position (1, 5).\n\n2. **Set Up the BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n3. **Define Valid Moves**:\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages ('|').\n\n4. **Implement the BFS**:\n   - Start from the position of 'a'.\n   - Explore all possible moves from the current position.\n   - If the goal is reached, return the number of steps taken.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"gggggggg\",\n    \"g||g|[|g\",\n    \"gggg|||g\",\n    \"gg|||||g\",\n    \"gg|g|||g\",\n    \"g|gag|gg\",\n    \"g|g|||gg\",\n    \"gggggggg\"\n]\n\n# Define start and goal positions\nstart = (5, 3)\ngoal = (1, 5)\n\n# Define possible moves (up, down, left, right)\nmoves = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue for BFS\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore all possible moves\n    for dx, dy in moves:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n            if grid[nx][ny] == '|':\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position."
