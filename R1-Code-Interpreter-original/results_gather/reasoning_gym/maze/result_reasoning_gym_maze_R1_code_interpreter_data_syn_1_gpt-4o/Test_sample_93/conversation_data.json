    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '/' to the goal 'C' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where 'v' denotes walls, 's' denotes passages, and we can only move through passages. The goal is to determine the minimum number of steps required to reach 'C' from '/'.\n\nThe approach to solve this problem is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it does so with the minimum number of steps.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Parse the grid to identify the start position ('/') and the goal position ('C').\n2. Implement the BFS algorithm:\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the number of steps taken to reach it.\n   - Start from the initial position and explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) that lead to a passage ('s').\n   - Mark visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - When the goal 'C' is reached, return the number of steps taken.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"vvvvvvvv\",\n    \"vsssvssv\",\n    \"vvsvssvv\",\n    \"vsssvvsv\",\n    \"vssssssv\",\n    \"vssvsssv\",\n    \"vssCv/vv\",\n    \"vvvvvvvv\"\n]\n\n# Find the start and goal positions\nstart = None\ngoal = None\nfor i, row in enumerate(grid):\n    for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n        if cell == '/':\n            start = (i, j)\n        elif cell == 'C':\n            goal = (i, j)\n\n# Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # If we reach the goal, return the number of steps\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                if grid[nx][ny] == 's' or grid[nx][ny] == 'C':  # Can move to passage or goal\n                    visited.add((nx, ny))\n                    queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n\n# Calculate the minimum steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start, goal)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the minimum number of steps.",
    "The code execution indicates that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'C' from the start '/' is 8. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8>>>"
