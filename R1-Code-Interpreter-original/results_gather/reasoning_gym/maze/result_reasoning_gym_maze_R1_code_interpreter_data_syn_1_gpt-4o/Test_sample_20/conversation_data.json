    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '}' to the goal position '$' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where 'y' represents walls that cannot be passed through, and '6' represents passages that can be traversed.\n\nThe problem can be approached using a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's outline the steps for the BFS algorithm:\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting position to it.\n2. Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the front position and explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n4. If a neighbor is the goal, return the number of steps taken to reach it.\n5. If a neighbor is a valid passage ('6') and hasn't been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it with an incremented step count.\n6. Continue until the goal is reached.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"yyyyyyyy\",\n    \"yy666yyy\",\n    \"yyy666}y\",\n    \"y666666y\",\n    \"y666666y\",\n    \"yy6666yy\",\n    \"y66y6$yy\",\n    \"yyyyyyyy\"\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (2, 6)  # Position of '}'\ngoal = (6, 5)   # Position of '$'\n\n# Define possible movements (up, down, left, right)\nmovements = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue with the start position and step count\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for dx, dy in movements:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n            if grid[nx][ny] == '6' or grid[nx][ny] == '$':\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position.",
    "The code has successfully executed and found that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position is 5. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
