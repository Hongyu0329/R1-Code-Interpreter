    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '<' to the goal '1' in the given grid. The grid consists of walls ('F') and passages ('$'). We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Parse the grid to find the start position ('<') and the goal position ('1').\n2. Implement a BFS to explore the grid from the start position, keeping track of the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n3. Stop the search when the goal position is reached and return the number of steps taken.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"FFFFFFFFFF\",\n    \"F$$F$$F$$F\",\n    \"FF$$$$$F$F\",\n    \"FF$$F$$$FF\",\n    \"F$$$FF$$FF\",\n    \"F$$F$F$$<F\",\n    \"F$F$$FF$$F\",\n    \"F$$$F1$$$F\",\n    \"FF$$F$FF$F\",\n    \"FFFFFFFFFF\"\n]\n\n# Find the start and goal positions\nstart = None\ngoal = None\nfor i, row in enumerate(grid):\n    for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n        if cell == '<':\n            start = (i, j)\n        elif cell == '1':\n            goal = (i, j)\n\n# Directions for moving up, down, left, right\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the goal\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                if grid[nx][ny] == '$' or grid[nx][ny] == '1':  # Can move to passage or goal\n                    visited.add((nx, ny))\n                    queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start, goal)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the minimum number of steps.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal. Based on the BFS algorithm, the shortest path from the start position '<' to the goal '1' in the given grid is 5 steps.\n\n<<<5>>>"
