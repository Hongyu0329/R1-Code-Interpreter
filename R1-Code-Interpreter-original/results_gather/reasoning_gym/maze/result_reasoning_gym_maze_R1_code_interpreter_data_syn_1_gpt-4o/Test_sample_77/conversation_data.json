    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start point 'W' to the goal 'V' in the given grid. The grid is essentially a maze where 'z' represents walls that cannot be passed through, and 't' represents open passages that can be traversed.\n\nThe most efficient way to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this is to use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's outline the steps for the BFS algorithm:\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting position 'W' to it.\n2. Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n3. For each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) that lead to a 't' and are within bounds.\n4. If the goal 'V' is reached, return the number of steps taken.\n5. If the queue is exhausted without finding 'V', the goal is unreachable (though in this problem, it is reachable).\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"zzzzzzzzz\",\n    \"zttttzttz\",\n    \"ztttztzzz\",\n    \"zttttttWz\",\n    \"ztVtztttz\",\n    \"zttzttztz\",\n    \"ztttztztz\",\n    \"ztztttttz\",\n    \"zzzzzzzzz\"\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (3, 7)  # Position of 'W'\ngoal = (4, 2)   # Position of 'V'\n\n# Define possible moves (up, down, left, right)\nmoves = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue for BFS\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for dx, dy in moves:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if (0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and\n            grid[nx][ny] == 't' and (nx, ny) not in visited):\n            visited.add((nx, ny))\n            queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'V' from the start 'W'. Let's execute it to find the answer."
