    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position 'i' to the goal 'C' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where '9' represents walls, 'r' represents passages, 'i' is the starting point, and 'C' is the goal.\n\nThe best approach to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this is to use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's outline the steps for the BFS algorithm:\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting position 'i' to it.\n2. Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n3. For each position, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) if they are passages ('r') and not visited.\n4. If a neighbor is the goal 'C', return the number of steps taken to reach it.\n5. If the queue is exhausted without finding 'C', the goal is unreachable (though in this problem, we assume it is reachable).\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"999999999\",\n    \"9Cr9rrrr9\",\n    \"9rrrr9r99\",\n    \"9rr9rirr9\",\n    \"9rrrrr9r9\",\n    \"9rrrrrr99\",\n    \"9r99rr999\",\n    \"9rrr9r9r9\",\n    \"999999999\"\n]\n\n# Find the start position 'i'\nstart = None\nfor r in range(len(grid)):\n    for c in range(len(grid[0])):\n        if grid[r][c] == 'i':\n            start = (r, c)\n            break\n    if start:\n        break\n\n# Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (r, c), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the goal\n        if grid[r][c] == 'C':\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < len(grid) and 0 <= nc < len(grid[0]) and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                if grid[nr][nc] in ('r', 'C'):  # Can move to passage or goal\n                    visited.add((nr, nc))\n                    queue.append(((nr, nc), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If goal is not reachable\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the minimum number of steps.",
