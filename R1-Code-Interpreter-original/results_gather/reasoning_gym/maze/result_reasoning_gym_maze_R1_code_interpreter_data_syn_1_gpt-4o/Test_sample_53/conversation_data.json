    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position ';' to the goal position 'd' in the given grid. This is a classic pathfinding problem that can be efficiently solved using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning and approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: \n   - Start (';') is at position (5, 6).\n   - Goal ('d') is at position (7, 3).\n\n2. **Grid Representation**:\n   - The grid is a 9x9 matrix where 'p' represents walls and '`' represents passages.\n\n3. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid level by level.\n   - Start from the initial position and explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) that lead to a passage ('`').\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach the goal.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - Implement the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from ';' to 'd'.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"ppppppppp\",\n    \"p``p`p``p\",\n    \"p`p`p`p`p\",\n    \"pp`pp```p\",\n    \"pp`p````p\",\n    \"p```p`;pp\",\n    \"p````p``p\",\n    \"p``d```pp\",\n    \"ppppppppp\"\n]\n\n# Convert grid to a list of lists for easier manipulation\ngrid = [list(row) for row in grid]\n\n# Define start and goal positions\nstart = (5, 6)\ngoal = (7, 3)\n\n# Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the goal\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                if grid[nx][ny] == '`' or (nx, ny) == goal:\n                    visited.add((nx, ny))\n                    queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start, goal)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position using BFS. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and found that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'd' from the start ';' is 5. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
