    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start point 'N' to the goal 'p' in the given grid. This is a classic pathfinding problem that can be efficiently solved using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points**: \n   - The grid is an 8x8 matrix.\n   - 'N' is the starting point, and 'p' is the goal.\n   - 'L' represents walls that cannot be passed through.\n   - 'X' represents passages that can be traversed.\n\n2. **Locate the Start and Goal**:\n   - We need to find the coordinates of 'N' and 'p' in the grid.\n\n3. **Implement BFS**:\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid level by level.\n   - Start from 'N', and explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) to adjacent 'X' cells.\n   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach 'p'.\n\n4. **Output the Minimum Steps**:\n   - Once 'p' is reached, the number of steps taken is the minimum number of steps required.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"LLLLLLLL\",\n    \"LXXLLXXL\",\n    \"LXXXXXXL\",\n    \"LLXXLLXL\",\n    \"LXXLXLNL\",\n    \"LXpXXLXL\",\n    \"LXXLXLXL\",\n    \"LLLLLLLL\"\n]\n\n# Find the start (N) and goal (p) positions\nstart = None\ngoal = None\nfor i in range(len(grid)):\n    for j in range(len(grid[i])):\n        if grid[i][j] == 'N':\n            start = (i, j)\n        elif grid[i][j] == 'p':\n            goal = (i, j)\n\n# Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # If we reach the goal, return the number of steps\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                if grid[nx][ny] == 'X' or grid[nx][ny] == 'p':  # Can move to passage or goal\n                    visited.add((nx, ny))\n                    queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Get the minimum steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start, goal)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'p' from the start 'N'.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `9`, which indicates that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'p' from the start 'N' is 9.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
