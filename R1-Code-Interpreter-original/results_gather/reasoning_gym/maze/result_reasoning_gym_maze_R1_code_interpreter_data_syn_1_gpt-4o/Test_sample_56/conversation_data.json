    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start point 'G' to the goal 'n' in the given grid. This is a classic pathfinding problem that can be efficiently solved using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning and approach:\n\n1. **Grid Representation**: We have a 10x10 grid where 'O' represents walls, 'o' represents passages, 'G' is the start point, and 'n' is the goal.\n\n2. **BFS Algorithm**: We'll use BFS because it explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance from the start node) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time we reach the goal, it is via the shortest path.\n\n3. **Implementation Details**:\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the number of steps taken to reach there.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Start from the position of 'G' and explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) that lead to a passage ('o') or the goal ('n').\n   - Stop when the goal 'n' is reached and return the number of steps taken.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef min_steps_to_goal(grid):\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # Find the start and goal positions\n    start = None\n    goal = None\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == 'G':\n                start = (i, j)\n            elif cell == 'n':\n                goal = (i, j)\n    \n    # Initialize BFS\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the goal\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                if grid[nx][ny] in ('o', 'n'):  # Can move to passage or goal\n                    visited.add((nx, ny))\n                    queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"OOOOOOOOOO\",\n    \"OoOooooOoO\",\n    \"OooooooOoO\",\n    \"OoOoooooOO\",\n    \"OoooOOooGO\",\n    \"OonoOOoOoO\",\n    \"OooooooOOO\",\n    \"OooooooOOO\",\n    \"OooooooooO\",\n    \"OOOOOOOOOO\"\n]\n\n# Convert grid to list of lists\ngrid = [list(row) for row in grid]\n\n# Get the minimum steps\nmin_steps = min_steps_to_goal(grid)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'n' from the start 'G'.",
