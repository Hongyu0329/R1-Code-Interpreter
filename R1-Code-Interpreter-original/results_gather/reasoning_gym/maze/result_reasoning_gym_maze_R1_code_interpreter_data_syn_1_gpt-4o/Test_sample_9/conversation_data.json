    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start point 't' to the goal 'l' in the given grid. The grid is essentially a maze where 'M' represents walls that cannot be passed through, and 'G' represents passages that can be traversed. The task is to determine the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start.\n\nThe most suitable algorithm for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this is the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from 't' to 'l'.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"MMMMMMMM\",\n    \"MGGtGMlM\",\n    \"MMGMGGGM\",\n    \"MMGGGGMM\",\n    \"MGMMGMMM\",\n    \"MGGGMGMM\",\n    \"MGGGGGMM\",\n    \"MMMMMMMM\"\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (1, 2)  # 't' is at (1, 2)\ngoal = (1, 6)   # 'l' is at (1, 6)\n\n# Define the possible movements (up, down, left, right)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # If we reach the goal, return the number of steps\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                if grid[nx][ny] == 'G' or grid[nx][ny] == 'l':  # Can move to 'G' or 'l'\n                    visited.add((nx, ny))\n                    queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start, goal)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and return the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal. Based on the BFS algorithm, the shortest path from 't' to 'l' in the given grid is 8 steps.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8>>>"
