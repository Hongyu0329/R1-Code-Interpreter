    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '/' to the goal position 'W' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a 2D array where ',' represents walls, '7' represents passages, '/' is the start, and 'W' is the goal.\n\nWe can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid. BFS is suitable here because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring that the first time we reach the goal, it is via the shortest path.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [',', ',', ',', ',', ',', ',', ',', ','],\n    [',', '7', ',', '7', ',', '7', ',', ','],\n    [',', '7', '7', '7', ',', ',', ',', ','],\n    [',', ',', '7', '7', '7', '7', '/', ','],\n    [',', 'W', '7', '7', ',', ',', '7', ','],\n    [',', ',', '7', '7', '7', '7', ',', ','],\n    [',', '7', ',', ',', ',', ',', ',', ','],\n    [',', ',', ',', ',', ',', ',', ',', ',']\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (3, 6)\ngoal = (4, 1)\n\n# Define the possible movements (up, down, left, right)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(grid, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                if grid[nx][ny] == '7' or grid[nx][ny] == 'W':  # Can move to passage or goal\n                    visited.add((nx, ny))\n                    queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(grid, start, goal)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the goal and print the minimum number of steps required.",
    "The BFS algorithm has successfully found the shortest path from the start position '/' to the goal position 'W' in the grid. The output indicates that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal is 6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
