    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start point 'g' to the goal 'H' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a 2D array where ')' represents a wall, 'G' represents a passage, and we can move up, down, left, or right.\n\nThe problem can be approached using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Parse the grid to identify the start and goal positions.\n2. Implement BFS to explore the grid from the start position.\n3. Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n4. Count the number of steps taken to reach the goal.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"))))))\",\n    \")gGGG)\",\n    \")GGG))\",\n    \")G)GH)\",\n    \")G))G)\",\n    \"))))))\"\n]\n\n# Directions for moving in the grid (right, down, left, up)\ndirections = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n\n# Find the start and goal positions\nstart = None\ngoal = None\nfor i, row in enumerate(grid):\n    for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n        if cell == 'g':\n            start = (i, j)\n        elif cell == 'H':\n            goal = (i, j)\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n\n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if we have reached the goal\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n\n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if (0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and\n                grid[nx][ny] != ')' and (nx, ny) not in visited):\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n\n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Calculate the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start, goal)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'H' from the start 'g'. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
