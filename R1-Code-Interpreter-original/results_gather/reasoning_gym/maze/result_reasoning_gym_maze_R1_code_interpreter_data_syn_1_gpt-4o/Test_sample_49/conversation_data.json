    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point 'H' to the goal '*' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where '#' represents walls that cannot be passed through, and 'W' represents passages that can be traversed. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nThe BFS algorithm will explore all possible paths from the starting point and will stop as soon as it reaches the goal, ensuring that the path found is the shortest. We will implement this algorithm in Python to compute the minimum number of steps required.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Parse the grid to identify the starting point 'H' and the goal '*'.\n2. Use a queue to perform BFS, starting from 'H'.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n4. Count the number of steps taken to reach the goal.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"#########\",\n    \"#W#WW#W##\",\n    \"#*WWWWWW#\",\n    \"#W###WW##\",\n    \"#W#WWW###\",\n    \"##HW#W#W#\",\n    \"#WWWW##W#\",\n    \"#WWW#W#W#\",\n    \"#########\"\n]\n\n# Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Find the start and goal positions\nstart = None\ngoal = None\nfor r in range(len(grid)):\n    for c in range(len(grid[0])):\n        if grid[r][c] == 'H':\n            start = (r, c)\n        elif grid[r][c] == '*':\n            goal = (r, c)\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n\n    while queue:\n        (current, steps) = queue.popleft()\n        if current == goal:\n            return steps\n\n        for direction in directions:\n            nr, nc = current[0] + direction[0], current[1] + direction[1]\n            if (0 <= nr < len(grid) and 0 <= nc < len(grid[0]) and\n                grid[nr][nc] != '#' and (nr, nc) not in visited):\n                visited.add((nr, nc))\n                queue.append(((nr, nc), steps + 1))\n\n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Calculate the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start, goal)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start. Based on the BFS algorithm, the shortest path from 'H' to '*' in the given grid is 10 steps.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10>>>"
