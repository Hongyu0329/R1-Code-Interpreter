    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '-' to the goal position '+' in the given grid. The grid consists of walls ('5'), passages ('<'), a start point ('-'), and a goal point ('+').\n\nThe most suitable algorithm for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid is the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning and the code to implement BFS for this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: We need to locate the positions of '-' and '+' in the grid.\n\n2. **Set Up BFS**: Use a queue to explore the grid. Start from the '-' position and explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) that lead to a passage ('<') or the goal ('+').\n\n3. **Track Visited Positions**: To avoid revisiting positions, maintain a set of visited positions.\n\n4. **Count Steps**: Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n5. **Stop When Goal is Reached**: As soon as the goal is reached, the number of steps taken is the minimum number of steps required.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"5555555555\",\n    \"5<5<<<5<55\",\n    \"5<5<<<55<5\",\n    \"5<<-55<<<5\",\n    \"555<<<<<<5\",\n    \"5<5<<<<<<5\",\n    \"5<5<55<<55\",\n    \"5<+<<<<5<5\",\n    \"5555<<5<<5\",\n    \"5555555555\"\n]\n\n# Find the start and goal positions\nstart = None\ngoal = None\nfor i, row in enumerate(grid):\n    for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n        if cell == '-':\n            start = (i, j)\n        elif cell == '+':\n            goal = (i, j)\n\n# Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS setup\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n            if grid[nx][ny] in '<+':  # Can move to passage or goal\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
