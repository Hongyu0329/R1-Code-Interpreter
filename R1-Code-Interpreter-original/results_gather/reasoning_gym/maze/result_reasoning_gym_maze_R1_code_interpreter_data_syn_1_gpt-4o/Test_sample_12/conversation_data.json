    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '(' to the goal '`' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where 'Q' represents walls that cannot be passed through, and '%' represents passages that can be traversed. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: \n   - Start: '(' is at position (5, 5).\n   - Goal: '`' is at position (2, 2).\n\n2. **Set Up the BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n3. **Define Valid Moves**:\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move stays within bounds and does not hit a wall ('Q').\n\n4. **Implement the BFS**:\n   - Start from the initial position, enqueue it, and mark it as visited.\n   - Explore all possible moves from the current position.\n   - If the goal is reached, return the number of steps taken.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"QQQQQQQ\",\n    \"QQ%%%%Q\",\n    \"QQ`%Q%Q\",\n    \"Q%%Q%%Q\",\n    \"Q%%%Q%Q\",\n    \"Q%QQ%(Q\",\n    \"QQQQQQQ\"\n]\n\n# Define start and goal positions\nstart = (5, 5)\ngoal = (2, 2)\n\n# Define possible moves: up, down, left, right\nmoves = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS setup\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# BFS loop\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for dx, dy in moves:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n            if grid[nx][ny] == '%':\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position."
