    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point '`' to the goal 'i' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where '4' represents walls that cannot be passed through, 'A' represents passages that can be traversed, and we can move in four possible directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\nThe problem can be approached using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"4444444\",\n    \"4AAAAi4\",\n    \"4A4A4A4\",\n    \"4A4AA44\",\n    \"44AAAA4\",\n    \"44A`444\",\n    \"4444444\"\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (5, 3)  # Position of '`'\ngoal = (1, 5)   # Position of 'i'\n\n# Define possible movements: up, down, left, right\nmovements = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue for BFS and visited set\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (current_x, current_y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the goal\n    if (current_x, current_y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for dx, dy in movements:\n        new_x, new_y = current_x + dx, current_y + dy\n        if (0 <= new_x < len(grid) and 0 <= new_y < len(grid[0]) and\n            grid[new_x][new_y] in 'Ai' and (new_x, new_y) not in visited):\n            visited.add((new_x, new_y))\n            queue.append(((new_x, new_y), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'i' from the start '`'. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and found that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'i' from the start '`' is 6. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
