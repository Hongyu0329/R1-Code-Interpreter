    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start point '8' to the goal 'u' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a 2D array where ',' represents a wall and 'm' represents a passage. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Grid Representation**: Convert the given grid into a 2D list for easier manipulation.\n2. **Locate Start and Goal**: Identify the coordinates of the start ('8') and goal ('u') positions.\n3. **BFS Initialization**: Use a queue to explore the grid. Start from the '8' position and explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) to adjacent 'm' cells.\n4. **Track Visited Cells**: Maintain a set of visited cells to avoid revisiting and looping.\n5. **Count Steps**: For each move, count the number of steps taken. When the goal 'u' is reached, the step count will be the minimum number of steps required.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [',', ',', ',', ',', ',', ',', ',', ','],\n    [',', 'm', 'm', 'm', 'm', 'm', 'm', ','],\n    [',', 'm', ',', 'm', 'm', 'm', ',', ','],\n    [',', ',', 'u', 'm', ',', 'm', 'm', ','],\n    [',', 'm', 'm', ',', ',', 'm', ',', ','],\n    [',', 'm', ',', 'm', 'm', 'm', 'm', ','],\n    [',', 'm', 'm', '8', 'm', 'm', 'm', ','],\n    [',', ',', ',', ',', ',', ',', ',', ',']\n]\n\n# Locate start and goal\nstart = (6, 3)\ngoal = (3, 2)\n\n# Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the goal\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                if grid[nx][ny] == 'm' or grid[nx][ny] == 'u':  # Can move to passage or goal\n                    visited.add((nx, ny))\n                    queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start, goal)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nThis code will execute and return the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal.",
