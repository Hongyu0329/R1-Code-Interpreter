    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '&' to the goal '4' in the given grid. This is a classic pathfinding problem that can be efficiently solved using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning and approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: \n   - The start position '&' is located at (7, 7).\n   - The goal position '4' is located at (3, 3).\n\n2. **Grid Representation**:\n   - The grid is represented as a 2D list where 'W' represents walls, '-' represents open passages, '&' is the start, and '4' is the goal.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize a queue with the start position and a step count of 0.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - If a move leads to the goal, return the step count.\n   - If a move is valid (within bounds, not a wall, and not visited), add it to the queue with an incremented step count.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - Implement the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"WWWWWWWWW\",\n    \"W--W--WWW\",\n    \"W-W----WW\",\n    \"W--4---WW\",\n    \"W-------W\",\n    \"W-W--WWWW\",\n    \"W-WW--W-W\",\n    \"WW-----&W\",\n    \"WWWWWWWWW\"\n]\n\n# Define start and goal positions\nstart = (7, 7)\ngoal = (3, 3)\n\n# Define possible moves (up, down, left, right)\nmoves = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue with the start position and step count\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore all possible moves\n    for dx, dy in moves:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        \n        # Check if the new position is valid\n        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] != 'W' and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n            visited.add((nx, ny))\n            queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position.",
    "The code executed successfully and found that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal '4' from the start '&' is 8. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8>>>"
