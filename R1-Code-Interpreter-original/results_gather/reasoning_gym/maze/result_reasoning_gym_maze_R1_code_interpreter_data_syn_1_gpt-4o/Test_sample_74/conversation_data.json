    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point '2' to the goal '*' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where '{' represents walls, 'Z' represents passages, '2' is the starting point, and '*' is the goal.\n\nWe can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this. BFS is suitable because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring that the first time we reach the goal, it is via the shortest path.\n\nLet's outline the steps for the BFS algorithm:\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting position (coordinates of '2') to it.\n2. Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the front position and explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n4. If a neighbor is the goal '*', return the number of steps taken to reach it.\n5. If a neighbor is a passage 'Z' and hasn't been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it with an incremented step count.\n6. If the queue is exhausted without finding the goal, the goal is unreachable (though in this problem, we assume it is reachable).\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"{{{{{{{{{\",\n    \"{{Z{{Z{Z{\",\n    \"{ZZZ{Z2Z{\",\n    \"{ZZZZ{ZZ{\",\n    \"{Z{ZZ{ZZ{\",\n    \"{ZZ*ZZZZ{\",\n    \"{Z{ZZZZ{{\",\n    \"{{{{ZZZZ{\",\n    \"{{{{{{{{{\"\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal characters\nstart_char = '2'\ngoal_char = '*'\n\n# Find the start position\nstart_pos = None\nfor i, row in enumerate(grid):\n    if start_char in row:\n        start_pos = (i, row.index(start_char))\n        break\n\n# Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, grid):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the goal\n        if grid[x][y] == goal_char:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                if grid[nx][ny] in ('Z', goal_char):\n                    visited.add((nx, ny))\n                    queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If goal is not reachable\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start_pos, grid)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the minimum number of steps.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `6`, which indicates that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal '*' from the starting point '2' is 6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
