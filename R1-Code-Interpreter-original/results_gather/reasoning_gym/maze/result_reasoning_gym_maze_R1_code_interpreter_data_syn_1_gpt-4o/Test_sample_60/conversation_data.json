    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '+' to the goal position ')' in the given grid. The grid consists of walls ('R') and passages ('%'). We can only move through the passages, and we need to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal.\n\nThe grid is represented as follows:\n\n```\nRRRRRRRRRR\nRR%%RRR%%R\nRRRR%%%%%R\nR%%%%%RR%R\nR%%%%%%%%R\nR%%R%%%RRR\nR%%+%%%%%R\nR%%%R%%)RR\nR%%%%%RR%R\nRRRRRRRRRR\n```\n\nThe start position '+' is at (6, 3) and the goal position ')' is at (7, 7).\n\nTo find the shortest path, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the minimum number of steps:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"RRRRRRRRRR\",\n    \"RR%%RRR%%R\",\n    \"RRRR%%%%%R\",\n    \"R%%%%%RR%R\",\n    \"R%%%%%%%%R\",\n    \"R%%R%%%RRR\",\n    \"R%%+%%%%%R\",\n    \"R%%%R%%)RR\",\n    \"R%%%%%RR%R\",\n    \"RRRRRRRRRR\"\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (6, 3)\ngoal = (7, 7)\n\n# Define the possible movements (up, down, left, right)\nmovements = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue for BFS and the visited set\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore the neighbors\n    for dx, dy in movements:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if (0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and\n            grid[nx][ny] == '%' and (nx, ny) not in visited):\n            visited.add((nx, ny))\n            queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal. Let's execute it to find the answer."
