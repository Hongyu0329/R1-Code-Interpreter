    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '#' to the goal 'e' in the given grid. This is a classic pathfinding problem that can be efficiently solved using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Parse the grid to identify the start and goal positions.\n2. Implement the BFS algorithm to explore the grid.\n3. Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n4. Stop the search when the goal is reached and return the number of steps.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"XXXXXXXX\",\n    \"XXX___eX\",\n    \"X_X_XX_X\",\n    \"X____XXX\",\n    \"X_X__#_X\",\n    \"XX_X___X\",\n    \"X___X_XX\",\n    \"XXXXXXXX\"\n]\n\n# Define the directions for movement: right, left, down, up\ndirections = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n\n# Find the start and goal positions\nstart = None\ngoal = None\nfor i, row in enumerate(grid):\n    for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n        if cell == '#':\n            start = (i, j)\n        elif cell == 'e':\n            goal = (i, j)\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n\n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n\n        # Check if we have reached the goal\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n\n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] != 'X' and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n\n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start, goal)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position using BFS. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and found that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'e' from the start position '#' is 8. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8>>>"
