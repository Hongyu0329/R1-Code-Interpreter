    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '-' to the goal position '<' in the given grid. The grid is essentially a maze where 'Z' represents walls, '\\' represents passages, and we can move horizontally or vertically through the passages.\n\nThe approach to solve this problem is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Parse the grid to identify the start and goal positions.\n2. Implement BFS to explore the grid:\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the number of steps taken to reach it.\n   - Mark visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - For each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) and add valid moves to the queue.\n3. Stop the search when the goal is reached and return the number of steps taken.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"ZZZZZZZ\",\n    \"Z-ZZ\\\\Z\",\n    \"Z\\\\ZZ\\\\Z\",\n    \"Z\\\\\\\\Z\\\\Z\",\n    \"Z\\\\\\\\\\\\<Z\",\n    \"Z\\\\\\\\Z\\\\Z\",\n    \"ZZZZZZZ\"\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (1, 1)  # Row 1, Column 1\ngoal = (4, 5)   # Row 4, Column 5\n\n# Define possible moves: up, down, left, right\nmoves = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue for BFS\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (current_row, current_col), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the goal\n    if (current_row, current_col) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore all possible moves\n    for move in moves:\n        new_row = current_row + move[0]\n        new_col = current_col + move[1]\n        new_position = (new_row, new_col)\n        \n        # Check if the new position is within bounds and is a passage\n        if (0 <= new_row < len(grid) and 0 <= new_col < len(grid[0]) and\n            grid[new_row][new_col] in ['\\\\', '<'] and new_position not in visited):\n            visited.add(new_position)\n            queue.append((new_position, steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position. Let's execute it to find the answer."
