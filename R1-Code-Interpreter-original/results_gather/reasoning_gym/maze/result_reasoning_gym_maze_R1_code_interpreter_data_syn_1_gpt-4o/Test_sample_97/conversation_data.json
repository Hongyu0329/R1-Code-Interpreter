    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point 'y' to the goal '5' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where '.' represents a wall and '%' represents a passage. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: \n   - Start ('y') is at position (6, 4).\n   - Goal ('5') is at position (2, 3).\n\n2. **Set Up the BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n3. **Define Movement Directions**:\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n\n4. **Implement the BFS**:\n   - Start from the 'y' position, mark it as visited, and enqueue it with a step count of 0.\n   - Explore each direction from the current position.\n   - If the goal '5' is reached, return the step count.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"........\",\n    \".%.%%%%.\",\n    \".%%5%%..\",\n    \".%%%.%%.\",\n    \".%%%%%%.\",\n    \".%%%.%%.\",\n    \".%..y%%.\",\n    \"........\"\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (6, 4)\ngoal = (2, 3)\n\n# Define possible movements: up, down, left, right\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue for BFS\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n            if grid[nx][ny] == '%':  # Check if it's a passage\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position."
