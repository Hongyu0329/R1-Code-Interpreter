    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point 'b' to the goal '<' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a 2D array where '^' represents walls that cannot be passed through, and ':' represents passages that can be traversed.\n\nWe can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Parse the grid to identify the starting point 'b' and the goal '<'.\n2. Implement BFS to explore the grid:\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the number of steps taken to reach that position.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - For each position, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) if they are within bounds, not walls, and not visited.\n   - If the goal is reached, return the number of steps taken.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"^^^^^^^^^^\",\n    \"^^^::::::^\",\n    \"^:::^:^^^^\",\n    \"^::::^^::^\",\n    \"^::::b::^^\",\n    \"^:::::^^^^\",\n    \"^:^::^::^^\",\n    \"^::::::::^\",\n    \"^<:::^:::^\",\n    \"^^^^^^^^^^\"\n]\n\n# Convert grid to a list of lists for easier manipulation\ngrid = [list(row) for row in grid]\n\n# Find the start and goal positions\nstart = None\ngoal = None\nfor i, row in enumerate(grid):\n    for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n        if cell == 'b':\n            start = (i, j)\n        elif cell == '<':\n            goal = (i, j)\n\n# Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the goal\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] != '^' and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start, goal)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
