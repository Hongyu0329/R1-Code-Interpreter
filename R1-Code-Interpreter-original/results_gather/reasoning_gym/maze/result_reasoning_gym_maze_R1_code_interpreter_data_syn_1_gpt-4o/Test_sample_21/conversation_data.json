    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point 'W' to the goal '#' in the given grid. This is a classic pathfinding problem that can be efficiently solved using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning and approach:\n\n1. **Grid Representation**: We have a grid where ';' represents walls, 'r' represents passages, 'W' is the starting point, and '#' is the goal.\n\n2. **BFS Algorithm**: We'll use BFS because it explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Initialize a queue with the starting position 'W'.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n   - For each node, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) if they are within bounds, not walls, and not visited.\n   - If the goal '#' is reached, return the number of steps taken.\n\n4. **Code Implementation**: We'll write a Python script to implement the BFS algorithm and find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \";;;;;;;;;\",\n    \";;rrrr;;;\",\n    \";rrrrrrW;\",\n    \";;rrrrrr;\",\n    \";rrrrr;;;\",\n    \";rr;#rrr;\",\n    \";rr;rr;;;\",\n    \";r;rr;rr;\",\n    \";;;;;;;;;\"\n]\n\n# Find the starting point 'W'\nstart = None\nfor i, row in enumerate(grid):\n    if 'W' in row:\n        start = (i, row.index('W'))\n        break\n\n# Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the goal\n        if grid[x][y] == '#':\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] != ';' and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n\n# Get the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from 'W' to '#' and print the minimum number of steps required. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal '#' from the starting point 'W' is 6. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
