    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '$' to the goal 'b' in the given grid. The grid is essentially a maze where 'E' represents walls that cannot be passed through, and 'L' represents passages that can be traversed. The task is to determine the minimum number of steps required to reach 'b' from '$'.\n\nThe approach to solve this problem is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Parse the grid to identify the start position ('$') and the goal position ('b').\n2. Implement the BFS algorithm:\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the number of steps taken to reach there.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - From each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) and add valid moves to the queue.\n   - Stop when the goal is reached and return the number of steps taken.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"EEEEEEEEE\",\n    \"ELELLEELE\",\n    \"ELLLLLLbE\",\n    \"ELLLELLLE\",\n    \"ELEELLLLE\",\n    \"ELLEELELE\",\n    \"E$LLELLLE\",\n    \"ELELEELLE\",\n    \"EEEEEEEEE\"\n]\n\n# Find the start and goal positions\nstart = None\ngoal = None\nfor i, row in enumerate(grid):\n    for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n        if cell == '$':\n            start = (i, j)\n        elif cell == 'b':\n            goal = (i, j)\n\n# Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                if grid[nx][ny] == 'L' or grid[nx][ny] == 'b':  # Can move to passages or goal\n                    visited.add((nx, ny))\n                    queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start, goal)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the minimum number of steps.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `10`, which indicates that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'b' from the start position '$' is 10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10>>>"
