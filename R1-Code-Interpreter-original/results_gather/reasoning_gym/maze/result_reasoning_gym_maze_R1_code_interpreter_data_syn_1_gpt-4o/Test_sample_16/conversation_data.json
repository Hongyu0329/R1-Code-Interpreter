    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position 'g' to the goal position '*' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a 2D array where ')' represents a wall and 'E' represents a passage. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: \n   - The start position 'g' is at (1, 5).\n   - The goal position '*' is at (3, 2).\n\n2. **Set Up the BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Start from the 'g' position and explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) to adjacent 'E' cells.\n\n3. **Implement the BFS**:\n   - Initialize the queue with the start position and a step count of 0.\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue the front element, check if it's the goal, and if not, enqueue all valid adjacent positions with an incremented step count.\n   - If the goal is reached, return the step count.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \")))))))))\",\n    \"))EEEg)E)\",\n    \")EEEEEEE)\",\n    \"))*)EE)E)\",\n    \")EEEEEE))\",\n    \")E)EEEEE)\",\n    \"))EEE)E))\",\n    \"))EE))E))\",\n    \")))))))))\"\n]\n\n# Convert grid to a list of lists for easier manipulation\ngrid = [list(row) for row in grid]\n\n# Define start and goal positions\nstart = (1, 5)\ngoal = (3, 2)\n\n# Define possible moves (up, down, left, right)\nmoves = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue for BFS\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for dx, dy in moves:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] == 'E' and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n            visited.add((nx, ny))\n            queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position."
