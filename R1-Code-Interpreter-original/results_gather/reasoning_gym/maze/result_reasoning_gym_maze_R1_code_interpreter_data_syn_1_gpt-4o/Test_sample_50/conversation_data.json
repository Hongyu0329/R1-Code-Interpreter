    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '#' to the goal 'B' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where 'i' denotes a wall, '!' denotes a passage, '#' is the start, and 'B' is the goal. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: \n   - Start ('#') is at position (2, 5).\n   - Goal ('B') is at position (4, 1).\n\n2. **Set Up the BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n3. **Define Movement Directions**:\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n\n4. **Implement the BFS**:\n   - Start from the initial position and explore all possible moves.\n   - If the goal is reached, return the number of steps taken.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"iiiiiii\",\n    \"i!i!iii\",\n    \"iiii!#i\",\n    \"ii!!i!i\",\n    \"iB!!!!i\",\n    \"i!!i!ii\",\n    \"iiiiiii\"\n]\n\n# Define start and goal positions\nstart = (2, 5)\ngoal = (4, 1)\n\n# Define possible movements: up, down, left, right\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue for BFS\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n            if grid[nx][ny] == '!':\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal. Let's execute it to find the answer."
