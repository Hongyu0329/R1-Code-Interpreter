    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point '@' to the goal 'W' in the given grid. This is a classic pathfinding problem that can be efficiently solved using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning and approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points**: \n   - The grid is a 10x10 matrix.\n   - '@' is located at (5, 6).\n   - 'W' is located at (1, 4).\n\n2. **Define Movements**: \n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We can only move through 'a' (passage) and not through 's' (wall).\n\n3. **Implement BFS**:\n   - Start from the '@' position.\n   - Use a queue to explore each position.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach 'W'.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"ssssssssss\",\n    \"saaaWsaaas\",\n    \"ssassssaas\",\n    \"ssaaaassss\",\n    \"saaaaassss\",\n    \"saaaaa@aas\",\n    \"sasaaasass\",\n    \"saaaaaaaas\",\n    \"saaasaasss\",\n    \"ssssssssss\"\n]\n\n# Define start and goal positions\nstart = (5, 6)\ngoal = (1, 4)\n\n# Define possible movements: up, down, left, right\nmovements = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS initialization\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# BFS loop\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for dx, dy in movements:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if 0 <= nx < 10 and 0 <= ny < 10 and (nx, ny) not in visited and grid[nx][ny] in 'aW':\n            visited.add((nx, ny))\n            queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach 'W' from '@'. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided the output, which indicates the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'W' from the start '@'. Based on the BFS algorithm, the shortest path has been calculated.\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<10>>>"
