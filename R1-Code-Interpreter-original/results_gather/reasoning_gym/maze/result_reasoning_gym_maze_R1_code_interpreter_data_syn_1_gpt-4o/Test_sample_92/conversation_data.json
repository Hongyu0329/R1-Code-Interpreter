    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start point '0' to the goal 'm' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where 'z' denotes walls, ')' denotes passages, and we can move in four possible directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\nThe most suitable algorithm for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this is the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"zzzzzzzzzz\",\n    \"z)z)))))zz\",\n    \"z)m)))zz)z\",\n    \"zzzz))))zz\",\n    \"z)z)))zz)z\",\n    \"zzzz)0zzzz\",\n    \"z)z)z)z))z\",\n    \"z)))z)))zz\",\n    \"z)zz)))z)z\",\n    \"zzzzzzzzzz\"\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (5, 5)  # Position of '0'\ngoal = (2, 2)   # Position of 'm'\n\n# Define possible movements: right, left, down, up\ndirections = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(grid, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                if grid[nx][ny] == ')':  # Check if it's a passage\n                    queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n                    visited.add((nx, ny))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(grid, start, goal)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from '0' to 'm' and print the minimum number of steps required.",
