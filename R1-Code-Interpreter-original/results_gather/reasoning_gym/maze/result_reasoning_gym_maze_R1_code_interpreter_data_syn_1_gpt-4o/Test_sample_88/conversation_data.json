    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start point 'o' to the goal '>' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where '$' are walls, 'v' are passages, 'o' is the start, and '>' is the goal. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: First, we need to locate the positions of 'o' and '>' in the grid.\n\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Setup**: We'll use a queue to explore the grid. Starting from 'o', we'll explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) to adjacent 'v' cells, marking them as visited to avoid revisiting.\n\n3. **Track Steps**: As we explore, we'll keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each cell. When we reach the goal '>', we'll have found the shortest path.\n\n4. **Implement the BFS Algorithm**: We'll write a Python script to implement this logic and find the minimum number of steps.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"$$$$$$$$$$\",\n    \"$v$v$vvv$$\",\n    \"$$$vvvvvv$\",\n    \"$vv$$v$vv$\",\n    \"$$vovv$$v$\",\n    \"$vvv$vvvv$\",\n    \"$vvvv$vv$$\",\n    \"$>vvvvv$$$\",\n    \"$v$$vvvv$$\",\n    \"$$$$$$$$$$\"\n]\n\n# Find the start and goal positions\nstart = None\ngoal = None\nfor i, row in enumerate(grid):\n    for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n        if cell == 'o':\n            start = (i, j)\n        elif cell == '>':\n            goal = (i, j)\n\n# Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # If we reach the goal, return the number of steps\n        if (x, y) == goal:\n            return steps\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                if grid[nx][ny] in 'v>':  # Can move to passage or goal\n                    visited.add((nx, ny))\n                    queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # If no path is found\n\n# Find the minimum number of steps\nmin_steps = bfs(start, goal)\nprint(min_steps)\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `5`, which indicates that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal '>' from the start 'o' is 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
