    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '(' to the goal 'g' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where '''' are walls and '$' are passages. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions**: \n   - Start: '(' is at position (3, 0).\n   - Goal: 'g' is at position (5, 3).\n\n2. **Set Up the BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n3. **Define Valid Moves**:\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right if the next position is a passage ('$') and not a wall (''').\n\n4. **Implement the BFS**:\n   - Start from the initial position and explore all possible moves.\n   - Stop when the goal is reached and return the number of steps taken.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the minimum number of steps.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"'''''''\",\n    \"''$$$''\",\n    \"'$$$$$'\",\n    \"'('$$$'\",\n    \"'$''$$'\",\n    \"''$'g$'\",\n    \"'''''''\"\n]\n\n# Convert grid to a list of lists for easier manipulation\ngrid = [list(row) for row in grid]\n\n# Define start and goal positions\nstart = (3, 0)\ngoal = (5, 3)\n\n# Define possible moves (up, down, left, right)\nmoves = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue for BFS\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for dx, dy in moves:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if (0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and\n            grid[nx][ny] == '$' and (nx, ny) not in visited):\n            visited.add((nx, ny))\n            queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start position. Let's execute it to find the answer."

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
