    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point 'n' to the goal 'D' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a maze where '|' represents walls and '=' represents passages. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Grid Representation**: First, we need to represent the grid in a way that we can easily navigate. We'll use a 2D list where each element corresponds to a cell in the grid.\n\n2. **BFS Initialization**: We'll initialize a queue for BFS that will store the current position and the number of steps taken to reach that position. We'll also maintain a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n3. **BFS Execution**: We'll perform BFS by exploring all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position. If we reach the goal 'D', we'll return the number of steps taken.\n\n4. **Boundary and Validity Check**: For each move, we'll check if the new position is within the grid boundaries and is a passage ('=') that hasn't been visited yet.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"|||||||||\",\n    \"|=|===|=|\",\n    \"||====|=|\",\n    \"|==n=|==|\",\n    \"|===|=|=|\",\n    \"|===|===|\",\n    \"|==|===||\",\n    \"|D===|=||\",\n    \"|||||||||\"\n]\n\n# Convert grid to a list of lists for easier manipulation\ngrid = [list(row) for row in grid]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (3, 3)  # 'n' position\ngoal = (7, 1)   # 'D' position\n\n# Define possible moves (up, down, left, right)\nmoves = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the BFS queue\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore all possible moves\n    for dx, dy in moves:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        \n        # Check if the new position is within bounds and is a passage\n        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] == '=' and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n            visited.add((nx, ny))\n            queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'D' from the start 'n'. Let's execute it to find the answer."
