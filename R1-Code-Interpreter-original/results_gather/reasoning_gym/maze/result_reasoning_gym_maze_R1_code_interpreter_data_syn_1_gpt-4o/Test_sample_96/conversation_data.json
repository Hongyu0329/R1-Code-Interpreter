    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '$' to the goal 'K' in a grid. The grid is represented as a maze where 'u' represents walls, 'P' represents passages, and we can only move through passages. The task is to determine the minimum number of steps required to reach 'K' from '$'.\n\nThe grid can be visualized as follows:\n\n```\nuuuuuuuu\nu$uuuuuu\nuPPPuuPu\nuPPPPPPu\nuuPKPuPu\nuPuPPuuu\nuPPPPPPu\nuuuuuuuu\n```\n\nThe start position is at (1, 1) and the goal position is at (4, 3). We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this. BFS is suitable because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring that the first time we reach the goal, it is via the shortest path.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the minimum number of steps:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    \"uuuuuuuu\",\n    \"u$uuuuuu\",\n    \"uPPPuuPu\",\n    \"uPPPPPPu\",\n    \"uuPKPuPu\",\n    \"uPuPPuuu\",\n    \"uPPPPPPu\",\n    \"uuuuuuuu\"\n]\n\n# Define the start and goal positions\nstart = (1, 1)\ngoal = (4, 3)\n\n# Define the possible movements: up, down, left, right\nmovements = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue for BFS and visited set\nqueue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, steps)\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start)\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    (x, y), steps = queue.popleft()\n    \n    # Check if we have reached the goal\n    if (x, y) == goal:\n        print(steps)\n        break\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for dx, dy in movements:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if (0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and\n            grid[nx][ny] in 'PK' and (nx, ny) not in visited):\n            visited.add((nx, ny))\n            queue.append(((nx, ny), steps + 1))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'K' from the start '$'. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided the output, which is the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'K' from the start '$'. The BFS algorithm successfully found the shortest path in the grid.\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
