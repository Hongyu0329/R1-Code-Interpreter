    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'p' to the goal 'u' on the given grid, while avoiding walls ('w') and moving through passages ('F'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal:**\n   - Start: 'p' is located at (1, 2).\n   - Goal: 'u' is located at (3, 5).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 7x7 matrix.\n   - Walls ('w') are impassable.\n   - Passages ('F') are passable.\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move does not lead into a wall.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will explore all possible paths level by level.\n\n5. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from (1, 2) with 0 steps.\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions and steps taken.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n\n6. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From (1, 2), the possible move is down to (2, 2).\n   - From (2, 2), move to (2, 3) or (3, 2).\n   - Continue exploring each position, adding valid moves to the queue.\n\n7. **Reach the Goal:**\n   - Continue the BFS until reaching the goal at (3, 5).\n   - Track the number of steps taken to reach the goal.\n\n8. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - The BFS ensures that the first time we reach the goal, it is via the shortest path.\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from 'p' to 'u' is found by navigating through the passages. The minimum number of steps required to reach the goal is calculated as follows:\n\n- (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 5)\n\nThis path takes 5 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
