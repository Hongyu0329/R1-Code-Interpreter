    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start point ';' to the goal 'd' on the given grid, while avoiding walls ('p') and only moving through passages ('`'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path, which is essentially a breadth-first search (BFS) in this context.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start (';') is located at (5, 6).\n   - Goal ('d') is located at (7, 3).\n\n2. **Define Possible Moves:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - Moves are valid only if they lead to a passage ('`') and stay within the grid boundaries.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Initialize a queue with the start position and a step count of 0.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting and looping.\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue the front element, which contains the current position and the current step count.\n     - If the current position is the goal, return the step count as the answer.\n     - Otherwise, explore all valid moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n     - For each valid move, if the new position has not been visited, enqueue it with an incremented step count and mark it as visited.\n\n4. **Execute the BFS:**\n   - Start from (5, 6) with 0 steps.\n   - Explore the grid using BFS, ensuring to only move through passages and not revisiting any position.\n   - Continue until the goal (7, 3) is reached.\n\n5. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS approach, we ensure that the first time we reach the goal, it is through the shortest path.\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach the goal.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'd' from the start ';' is found to be 10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10>>>"
