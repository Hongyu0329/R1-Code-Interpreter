    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'E' to the goal '1' through the passages marked by '*', while avoiding the walls marked by '3'. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('E') is located at position (4, 3).\n   - Goal ('1') is located at position (4, 1).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We can only move through cells marked with '*'.\n\n3. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Start at (4, 3).\n   - Goal is at (4, 1).\n\n4. **Explore Possible Paths:**\n   - From (4, 3), the possible moves are:\n     - Left to (4, 2)\n     - Up to (3, 3)\n     - Down to (5, 3)\n   - Moving left to (4, 2) is a valid move (cell is '*').\n\n5. **Continue Path Exploration:**\n   - From (4, 2), the possible moves are:\n     - Left to (4, 1) (Goal)\n     - Right to (4, 3) (Back to start)\n   - Moving left to (4, 1) reaches the goal.\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - (4, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 1)\n   - Total steps = 2\n\nThus, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start is 2.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<2>>>"
