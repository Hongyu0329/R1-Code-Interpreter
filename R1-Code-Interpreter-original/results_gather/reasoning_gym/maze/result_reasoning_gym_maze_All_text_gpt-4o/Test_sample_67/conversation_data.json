    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'p' to the goal '/' in the given grid. The grid is represented as follows:\n\n```\nPPPPPP\nPPMPMP\nPMMMMP\nPMMPpP\nPM/MPP\nPPPPPP\n```\n\nLegend:\n- 'P' = Wall (cannot pass through)\n- 'M' = Passage (can pass through)\n- 'p' = Start\n- '/' = Goal\n\nThe task is to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start. We will use a step-by-step approach to analyze the grid and find the shortest path.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal:**\n   - Start ('p') is located at position (3, 4).\n   - Goal ('/') is located at position (4, 2).\n\n2. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, but only through 'M' (Passage).\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n   - We will explore all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\n4. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from (3, 4) and mark it as visited.\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore, starting with the initial position and step count 0.\n\n5. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From (3, 4), explore all possible moves:\n     - Up to (2, 4) [M]\n     - Down to (4, 4) [M]\n     - Left to (3, 3) [M]\n     - Right to (3, 5) [P] (not possible, as it's a wall)\n   - Add valid moves to the queue with incremented step count.\n\n6. **Continue BFS:**\n   - From each new position, continue exploring valid moves, marking positions as visited to avoid cycles.\n   - Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n7. **Reach the Goal:**\n   - Continue the BFS process until the goal '/' at (4, 2) is reached.\n   - The first time the goal is reached, the step count will be the minimum number of steps required.\n\n8. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS process, the shortest path from (3, 4) to (4, 2) is found to be:\n     - (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2)\n   - This path takes 5 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
