    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point 'C' to the goal '\\' in the given grid. The grid is composed of walls ('o') and passages ('c'). We can only move through passages, and we can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('C') is located at (1, 4).\n   - Goal ('\\') is located at (4, 1).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement Constraints:**\n   - We can only move through 'c' (passages).\n   - We cannot move through 'o' (walls).\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - We will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path. BFS is suitable because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found in an unweighted grid like this.\n\n4. **Execute BFS:**\n   - Start from (1, 4).\n   - Explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n   - Continue exploring until the goal (4, 1) is reached.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Path Exploration:**\n   - From (1, 4), possible moves are to (1, 3), (1, 5), and (2, 4).\n   - From (2, 4), possible moves are to (2, 3), (2, 5), and (3, 4).\n   - From (3, 4), possible moves are to (3, 3), (3, 5), and (4, 4).\n   - From (4, 4), possible moves are to (4, 3), (5, 4), and (3, 4).\n   - From (4, 3), possible moves are to (4, 2), (5, 3), and (3, 3).\n   - From (4, 2), possible moves are to (4, 1) (goal), (5, 2), and (3, 2).\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - The shortest path from (1, 4) to (4, 1) is:\n     - (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 1)\n   - This path consists of 6 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
