    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate through a grid from the starting point 'e' to the goal '''. The grid is represented as follows:\n\n```\nAAAAAAAA\nApepAAAA\nApApApAA\nAppppppA\nAAAApppA\nA'pppAAA\nApAppppA\nAAAAAAAA\n```\n\nLegend:\n- 'A' represents a wall, which cannot be passed through.\n- 'p' represents a passage, which can be traversed.\n- 'e' is the starting point, which is located at the position of the first 'p' in the second row.\n- ''' is the goal, located in the sixth row, second column.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal:**\n   - Start ('e') is at position (1, 1) in the grid (considering the top-left corner as (0, 0)).\n   - Goal (''') is at position (5, 1).\n\n2. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages ('p').\n\n3. **Pathfinding Strategy:**\n   - We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from the start to the goal. BFS is suitable because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found in an unweighted grid.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Pathfinding:**\n   - Start at (1, 1).\n   - From (1, 1), the possible move is to (2, 1).\n   - From (2, 1), move to (3, 1).\n   - From (3, 1), move to (3, 2).\n   - From (3, 2), move to (3, 3).\n   - From (3, 3), move to (3, 4).\n   - From (3, 4), move to (3, 5).\n   - From (3, 5), move to (3, 6).\n   - From (3, 6), move to (4, 6).\n   - From (4, 6), move to (5, 6).\n   - From (5, 6), move to (5, 5).\n   - From (5, 5), move to (5, 4).\n   - From (5, 4), move to (5, 3).\n   - From (5, 3), move to (5, 2).\n   - Finally, from (5, 2), move to (5, 1) where the goal is located.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path taken involves 14 steps from the start to the goal.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal is 14.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<14>>>"
