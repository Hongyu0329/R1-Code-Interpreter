    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '=' to the goal position ';' in the given grid. The grid is represented as follows:\n\n```\nYYYYYYYY\nYffffYfY\nYYfYYf;Y\nYfffYYfY\nYfYffffY\nYfYffffY\nYYf=fffY\nYYYYYYYY\n```\n\nLegend:\n- 'Y' represents a wall, which cannot be passed through.\n- 'f' represents a passage, which can be traversed.\n- '=' is the starting point.\n- ';' is the goal.\n\nWe will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('=') is located at (6, 3).\n   - Goal (';') is located at (2, 6).\n\n2. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move does not go through a wall ('Y') or out of bounds.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n   - We will explore all possible paths level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to the goal.\n\n4. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from (6, 3) and mark it as visited.\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore, starting with the initial position and a step count of 0.\n\n5. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a move leads to the goal (';'), record the number of steps taken and stop.\n   - If a move leads to a passage ('f') that hasn't been visited, add it to the queue with an incremented step count and mark it as visited.\n\n6. **Continue Until Goal is Reached:**\n   - Continue the BFS process until the goal is reached, ensuring that the first time we reach the goal, it is via the shortest path due to the nature of BFS.\n\n7. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS process, we find the shortest path from the start to the goal.\n\nLet's outline the path:\n\n- Start at (6, 3).\n- Move up to (5, 3).\n- Move up to (4, 3).\n- Move right to (4, 4).\n- Move right to (4, 5).\n- Move up to (3, 5).\n- Move up to (2, 5).\n- Move right to (2, 6) where the goal ';' is located.\n\nThe path consists of 7 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<7>>>"
