    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position '#' to the goal 'e' in the given grid, while avoiding walls 'X'. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path, which is essentially a breadth-first search (BFS) in this context.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('#') is located at position (4, 5).\n   - Goal ('e') is located at position (1, 6).\n\n2. **Define Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided you do not move into a wall ('X') or outside the grid boundaries.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Use a queue to explore each position starting from the start position.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting and looping.\n   - For each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a move leads to the goal, record the number of steps taken.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Exploration:**\n   - Start at (4, 5) with 0 steps.\n   - From (4, 5), possible moves are to (3, 5) and (4, 6).\n   - From (3, 5), possible moves are to (3, 4) and (4, 5).\n   - From (4, 6), possible moves are to (3, 6) and (4, 5).\n   - Continue exploring each position, marking them as visited, and counting steps.\n   - Eventually, reach the goal at (1, 6).\n\n5. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - The shortest path from (4, 5) to (1, 6) is:\n     - (4, 5) -> (4, 6) -> (3, 6) -> (2, 6) -> (1, 6)\n   - This path takes 4 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
