    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'n' to the goal 'D' in the given grid, while avoiding walls ('|') and only moving through passages ('='). We will analyze the grid step by step to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('n') is located at row 3, column 3.\n   - Goal ('D') is located at row 7, column 1.\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We cannot move through walls ('|').\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid:**\n   ```\n   Row 1: |||||||||\n   Row 2: |=|===|=|\n   Row 3: ||=|===|=|\n   Row 4: |==n=|==|\n   Row 5: |===|=|=|\n   Row 6: |===|===|\n   Row 7: |==|===||\n   Row 8: |D===|=||\n   Row 9: |||||||||\n   ```\n\n4. **Explore Possible Paths:**\n   - From the start position (3,3), we can move:\n     - Right to (3,4)\n     - Down to (4,3)\n   - From (3,4), we can move:\n     - Right to (3,5)\n     - Down to (4,4)\n   - From (4,3), we can move:\n     - Right to (4,4)\n     - Down to (5,3)\n   - Continue exploring paths while avoiding walls and backtracking.\n\n5. **Find the Shortest Path:**\n   - Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to ensure the shortest path is found.\n   - Track the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - Starting from (3,3), the shortest path to (7,1) is:\n     - (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (7,3) -> (7,2) -> (7,1)\n   - This path takes 6 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal 'D' from the start 'n' is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
