    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'a' to the goal '[' in the given grid. The grid is composed of walls ('g') and passages ('|'). We can only move through the passages, and we need to find the shortest path from 'a' to '['.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal:**\n   - Start ('a') is located at position (5, 3).\n   - Goal ('[') is located at position (1, 5).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages ('|').\n\n3. **Visualize the Path:**\n   - Starting from 'a' at (5, 3), we need to find a path through the passages to reach the goal at (1, 5).\n\n4. **Explore Possible Paths:**\n   - From (5, 3), move up to (4, 3).\n   - From (4, 3), move up to (3, 3).\n   - From (3, 3), move up to (2, 3).\n   - From (2, 3), move right to (2, 4).\n   - From (2, 4), move right to (2, 5).\n   - From (2, 5), move up to (1, 5) where the goal '[' is located.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - (5, 3) to (4, 3): 1 step\n   - (4, 3) to (3, 3): 1 step\n   - (3, 3) to (2, 3): 1 step\n   - (2, 3) to (2, 4): 1 step\n   - (2, 4) to (2, 5): 1 step\n   - (2, 5) to (1, 5): 1 step\n\n6. **Calculate the Total Steps:**\n   - Total steps = 6\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is 6.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<6>>>"
