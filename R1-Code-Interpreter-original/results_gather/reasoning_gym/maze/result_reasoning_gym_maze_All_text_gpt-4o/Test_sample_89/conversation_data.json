    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position '-' to the goal 'O' in the given grid, while only moving through passages 'r'. The walls 'b' are impassable. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('-') is located at (2, 4).\n   - Goal ('O') is located at (5, 6).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement Constraints:**\n   - We can only move through 'r' (passages).\n   - We cannot move through 'b' (walls).\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, we can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move stays within the grid and lands on an 'r'.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n   - We will explore all possible moves from the start position, layer by layer, until we reach the goal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Exploration:**\n   - Start at (2, 4).\n   - From (2, 4), the possible move is to (3, 4) (down).\n   - From (3, 4), the possible moves are to (4, 4) (down) and (3, 3) (left).\n   - From (4, 4), the possible move is to (4, 5) (right).\n   - From (3, 3), the possible move is to (3, 2) (left).\n   - From (4, 5), the possible move is to (5, 5) (down).\n   - From (3, 2), the possible move is to (4, 2) (down).\n   - From (5, 5), the possible move is to (5, 6) (right), which is the goal.\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path taken is: (2, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 6).\n   - This path consists of 5 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is 5.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<5>>>"
