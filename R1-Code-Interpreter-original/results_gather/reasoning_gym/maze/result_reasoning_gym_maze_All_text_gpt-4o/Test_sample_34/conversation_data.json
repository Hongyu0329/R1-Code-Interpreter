    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'T' to the goal 'v' on a grid where '9' represents a wall and 'D' represents a passage. The goal is to find the minimum number of steps required to reach 'v' from 'T'.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('T') is located at (6, 2).\n   - Goal ('v') is located at (1, 3).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 9x9 matrix.\n   - '9' represents walls that cannot be passed through.\n   - 'D' represents passages that can be traversed.\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move is within bounds and lands on a 'D'.\n\n4. **Pathfinding Strategy:**\n   - Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - Start from 'T' and explore all possible moves, marking visited positions to avoid cycles.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step BFS Execution:**\n   - Initialize a queue with the starting position (6, 2) and a step count of 0.\n   - Mark the starting position as visited.\n   - While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue the front position and check if it is the goal.\n     - If it is the goal, return the step count.\n     - Otherwise, enqueue all valid adjacent positions (up, down, left, right) that are 'D' and not visited, incrementing the step count.\n   - Continue this process until the goal is reached.\n\n6. **Trace the Path:**\n   - Starting from (6, 2), explore the grid:\n     - Move up to (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (2, 3), and finally to (1, 3).\n   - Count the steps taken: 1 (6, 2) -> 2 (5, 2) -> 3 (4, 2) -> 4 (3, 2) -> 5 (3, 3) -> 6 (2, 3) -> 7 (1, 3).\n\nThe minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'v' from 'T' is 7.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<7>>>"
