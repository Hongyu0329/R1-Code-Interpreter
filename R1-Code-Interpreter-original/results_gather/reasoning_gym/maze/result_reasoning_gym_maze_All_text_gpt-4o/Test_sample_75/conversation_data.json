    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position '-' to the goal '~' through a grid where 'v' represents walls and '<' represents passages. The goal is to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('-') is located at position (8, 6).\n   - Goal ('~') is located at position (3, 4).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can only move through '<' (passages).\n   - We cannot move through 'v' (walls).\n\n3. **Trace the Path:**\n   - Starting from (8, 6), we can move left to (8, 5).\n   - Continue moving left to (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), and (8, 1).\n   - Move up to (7, 1).\n   - Move left to (7, 0).\n   - Move up to (6, 0).\n   - Move right to (6, 1), (6, 2), and (6, 3).\n   - Move up to (5, 3).\n   - Move left to (5, 2), (5, 1), and (5, 0).\n   - Move up to (4, 0).\n   - Move right to (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3).\n   - Move up to (3, 3).\n   - Finally, move right to reach the goal at (3, 4).\n\n4. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path taken is: (8, 6) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 4) -> (8, 3) -> (8, 2) -> (8, 1) -> (7, 1) -> (7, 0) -> (6, 0) -> (6, 1) -> (6, 2) -> (6, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 4).\n   - Total steps = 21.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<21>>>"
