    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '2' to the goal 'A' through the grid, moving only through the passages marked as '7'. The walls marked as 'G' are impassable. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('2') is located at position (1, 1).\n   - Goal ('A') is located at position (2, 4).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We can only move through cells marked as '7'.\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid with Coordinates:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) G G G G G G\n   (1,0) G 7 7 G 7 G\n   (2,0) G 7 7 7 A G\n   (3,0) G G 7 G G G\n   (4,0) G 7 7 2 7 G\n   (5,0) G G G G G G\n   ```\n\n4. **Explore Possible Paths:**\n   - Start at (1, 1).\n   - From (1, 1), move to (1, 2).\n   - From (1, 2), move to (2, 2).\n   - From (2, 2), move to (2, 3).\n   - From (2, 3), move to (2, 4) where 'A' is located.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - (1, 1) to (1, 2): 1 step\n   - (1, 2) to (2, 2): 1 step\n   - (2, 2) to (2, 3): 1 step\n   - (2, 3) to (2, 4): 1 step\n\n6. **Calculate the Total Number of Steps:**\n   - Total steps = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'A' from the start '2' is 4.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<4>>>"
