    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'q' to the goal '?' on the grid, moving only through passages 'p' and avoiding walls '-'. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('q') is located at position (0, 2).\n   - Goal ('?') is located at position (2, 2).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement Constraints:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages 'p'.\n   - We cannot move through walls '-'.\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid with Coordinates:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5)\n   (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)\n   (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)\n   (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)\n   (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)\n   ```\n\n4. **Trace the Path from Start to Goal:**\n   - Start at (0, 2).\n   - Move down to (1, 2) [1 step].\n   - Move down to (2, 2) [1 more step].\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - Total steps from (0, 2) to (2, 2) is 2 steps.\n\n6. **Verify the Path:**\n   - The path (0, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) is valid as it only moves through passages 'p'.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The minimum number of steps required to reach the goal '?' from 'q' is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>"
