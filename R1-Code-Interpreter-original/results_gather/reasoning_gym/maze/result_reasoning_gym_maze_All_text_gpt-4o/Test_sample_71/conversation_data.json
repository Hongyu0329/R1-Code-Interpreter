    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '}' to the goal '`' in the given grid, while avoiding walls ('|') and only moving through passages ('W'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('}') is located at (1, 6).\n   - Goal ('`') is located at (4, 3).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement Constraints:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but cannot move diagonally.\n   - We cannot pass through walls ('|').\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid:**\n   ```\n   ||||||||||\n   ||W||W}WW|\n   |WWW|W|WW|\n   |W||WWWW||\n   |WWW`WW|||\n   |||W|WWWW|\n   ||WW|WW|W|\n   ||WWW||WW|\n   |WWWW|W|W|\n   ||||||||||\n   ```\n\n4. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Start at (1, 6).\n   - We need to find a path to (4, 3) using the fewest steps.\n\n5. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will explore all possible moves from the start and keep track of the number of steps taken.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Path Exploration:**\n   - From (1, 6), possible moves are to (1, 5) and (2, 6).\n   - From (1, 5), move to (1, 4) or (2, 5).\n   - From (2, 6), move to (2, 5) or (3, 6).\n   - Continue exploring until reaching (4, 3).\n\n7. **Path to Goal:**\n   - A possible shortest path is:\n     - (1, 6) -> (2, 6) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 3)\n   - This path takes 6 steps.\n\n8. **Verify the Path:**\n   - Check each move to ensure it is valid (i.e., not moving into a wall and staying within bounds).\n   - Confirm that the path is indeed the shortest by ensuring no shorter path exists.\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   - The minimum number of steps required to reach the goal is 6.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<6>>>"
