    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'W' to the goal '#' through the passages 'r', while avoiding the walls ';'. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('W') is located at (2, 7).\n   - Goal ('#') is located at (5, 3).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is a 9x9 matrix.\n   - Walls (';') are impassable.\n   - Passages ('r') are passable.\n\n3. **Determine Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move is within the grid and not into a wall.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will explore all possible paths level by level, starting from 'W'.\n\n5. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from (2, 7) with a step count of 0.\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore and their respective step counts.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting.\n\n6. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From (2, 7), explore all adjacent positions that are passages and not visited.\n   - Continue exploring from each new position, incrementing the step count each time a new position is reached.\n   - Stop when the goal position (5, 3) is reached.\n\n7. **Trace the Path:**\n   - From (2, 7), the possible moves are:\n     - (2, 6), (3, 7), (1, 7), (2, 8)\n   - Continue exploring from these positions, ensuring to avoid walls and revisiting positions.\n   - The path to reach (5, 3) with the minimum steps is:\n     - (2, 7) -> (2, 6) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 3)\n\n8. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path from 'W' to '#' is 7 steps long.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<7>>>"
