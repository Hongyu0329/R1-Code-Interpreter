    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate through the grid from the starting point '2' to the goal '*', while avoiding walls '{'. The passages 'Z' are the only traversable paths. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path, as BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('2') is located at position (2, 6).\n   - Goal ('*') is located at position (5, 3).\n\n2. **Define Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, as long as you don't hit a wall '{' or go out of bounds.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Initialization:**\n   - Initialize a queue with the starting position (2, 6) and a step count of 0.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and step count.\n   - Check if the current position is the goal. If it is, return the step count.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each valid move (not a wall and not visited), enqueue the new position with an incremented step count and mark it as visited.\n\n5. **Continue Until Goal is Found:**\n   - Repeat the process until the queue is empty or the goal is reached.\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - The first time the goal is reached, the step count will be the minimum number of steps required.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- Start at (2, 6) with 0 steps.\n- From (2, 6), possible moves are to (1, 6), (3, 6), and (2, 5).\n- Continue exploring each valid move, updating the step count and marking positions as visited.\n- Eventually, reach the goal at (5, 3).\n\nBy following the BFS approach, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal '*' from the start '2' is calculated.\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
