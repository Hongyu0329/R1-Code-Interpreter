    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '=' to the goal 't' through the passages marked by 'l', while avoiding the walls marked by ','.\n\nLet's break down the grid and identify the positions:\n\n```\nRow 0: ,,,,,,,,,,\nRow 1: ,llllllll,\nRow 2: ,ll,,llll,\nRow 3: ,llllllll,\nRow 4: ,ll,llll,,\nRow 5: ,l,llll,,,\nRow 6: ,tlllll,l,\nRow 7: ,lll,,=ll,\nRow 8: ,,lll,lll,\nRow 9: ,,,,,,,,,,\n```\n\n- Start ('=') is at position (7, 6).\n- Goal ('t') is at position (6, 1).\n\nWe need to find the shortest path from (7, 6) to (6, 1) using only the 'l' passages.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move is within bounds and lands on a passage ('l').\n\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n   - Start from the initial position (7, 6) and explore all possible moves.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n\n3. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - Start at (7, 6).\n   - Possible moves from (7, 6): (6, 6), (7, 5), (7, 7).\n   - Continue exploring from each new position, marking them as visited.\n\n4. **Path Exploration:**\n   - From (7, 6) move to (7, 5).\n   - From (7, 5) move to (7, 4).\n   - From (7, 4) move to (6, 4).\n   - From (6, 4) move to (6, 3).\n   - From (6, 3) move to (6, 2).\n   - From (6, 2) move to (6, 1) (goal).\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path taken is: (7, 6) -> (7, 5) -> (7, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 3) -> (6, 2) -> (6, 1).\n   - This path consists of 6 steps.\n\nThus, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 't' from the start '=' is 6.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<6>>>"
