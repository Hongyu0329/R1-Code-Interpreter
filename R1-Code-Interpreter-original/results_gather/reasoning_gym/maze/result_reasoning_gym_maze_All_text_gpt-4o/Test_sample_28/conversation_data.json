    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point ',' to the goal 'j' on the given grid. The grid is a 10x10 matrix where 'D' represents a wall that cannot be passed through, and 'A' represents a passage that can be traversed. We need to find the shortest path from the start to the goal.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start (',') is located at (8, 3).\n   - Goal ('j') is located at (2, 2).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We cannot move through 'D' (walls).\n\n3. **Pathfinding Strategy:**\n   - Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach since it is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found first.\n\n4. **Implement BFS:**\n   - Initialize a queue with the start position (8, 3) and a step count of 0.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting and looping.\n   - For each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a move leads to the goal, return the step count.\n   - If a move is valid (within bounds, not a wall, and not visited), add it to the queue with an incremented step count.\n\n5. **Execute BFS:**\n   - Start from (8, 3), explore possible moves.\n   - Move to (8, 4), (7, 3), and so on, avoiding walls and revisiting.\n   - Continue exploring until reaching (2, 2).\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS approach, the shortest path is found when the goal is reached.\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach the goal.\n\nAfter executing the BFS, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'j' from the start ',' is found to be 14.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<14>>>"
