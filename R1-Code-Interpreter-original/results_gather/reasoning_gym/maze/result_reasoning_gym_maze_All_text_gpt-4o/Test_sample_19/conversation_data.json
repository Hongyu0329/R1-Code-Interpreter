    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point ')' to the goal 'k' on the grid, moving only through passages ('#') and avoiding walls ('v'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start: ')' is located at (3, 6).\n   - Goal: 'k' is located at (6, 5).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages ('#').\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid with Coordinates:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (0,7) (0,8)\n   (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (1,8)\n   (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7) (2,8)\n   (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) (3,8)\n   (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7) (4,8)\n   (5,0) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (5,8)\n   (6,0) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (6,8)\n   (7,0) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) (7,8)\n   (8,0) (8,1) (8,2) (8,3) (8,4) (8,5) (8,6) (8,7) (8,8)\n   ```\n\n4. **Trace the Path:**\n   - Start at (3, 6).\n   - Move left to (3, 5).\n   - Move left to (3, 4).\n   - Move down to (4, 4).\n   - Move down to (5, 4).\n   - Move down to (6, 4).\n   - Move right to (6, 5) where 'k' is located.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - Total steps taken: 6.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal 'k' from the start ')' is 6.\n\nFinal answer: <<<6>>>"
