    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '(' to the goal '{' on the given grid. The grid is represented as follows:\n\n```\nyyyyyy\nyyyy(y\ny{yOOy\nyOOOOy\nyOOOOy\nyyyyyy\n```\n\nLegend:\n- 'y' represents a wall, which cannot be passed through.\n- 'O' represents a passage, which can be traversed.\n- '(' is the starting point.\n- '{' is the goal.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start: The starting point '(' is located at position (1, 4) (row 1, column 4).\n   - Goal: The goal '{' is located at position (2, 1) (row 2, column 1).\n\n2. **Determine Possible Movements:**\n   - From any open passage 'O', you can move up, down, left, or right, provided you do not move into a wall 'y'.\n\n3. **Pathfinding Strategy:**\n   - We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from the start to the goal. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found in an unweighted grid like this.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Start at (1, 4).\n   - From (1, 4), the only possible move is down to (2, 4) since all other directions are walls.\n   - From (2, 4), move left to (2, 3).\n   - From (2, 3), move left to (2, 2).\n   - From (2, 2), move left to (2, 1), which is the goal.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - (1, 4) to (2, 4): 1 step\n   - (2, 4) to (2, 3): 1 step\n   - (2, 3) to (2, 2): 1 step\n   - (2, 2) to (2, 1): 1 step\n\nTotal steps = 4.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is 4.\n\nFinal answer: <<<4>>>"
