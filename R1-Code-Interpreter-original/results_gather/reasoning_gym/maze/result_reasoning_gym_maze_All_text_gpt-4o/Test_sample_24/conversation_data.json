    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point 'Y' to the goal '@' in the given grid. The grid is surrounded by walls ('*'), and we can only move through passages ('1'). We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path, as it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time we reach the goal, it is via the shortest path.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('Y') is located at position (6, 4).\n   - Goal ('@') is located at position (1, 1).\n\n2. **Define Possible Moves:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, as long as we stay within the bounds of the grid and do not move into a wall ('*').\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore, starting with the initial position of 'Y' (6, 4).\n   - Keep a set to track visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **Perform BFS:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and check if it is the goal ('@'). If it is, return the number of steps taken to reach it.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all valid neighboring positions (those that are passages and not yet visited) with an incremented step count.\n   - Continue this process until the goal is reached.\n\n5. **Trace the Path:**\n   - Starting from (6, 4), explore the neighboring positions:\n     - (5, 4) is a valid move.\n     - (6, 5) is a valid move.\n   - From (5, 4), explore:\n     - (4, 4) is a valid move.\n     - (5, 5) is a valid move.\n   - From (6, 5), explore:\n     - (5, 5) is already visited.\n     - (6, 6) is a valid move.\n   - Continue this process, exploring all possible paths level by level, until reaching (1, 1).\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS approach, the shortest path from 'Y' to '@' is found to be 14 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<14>>>"
