    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position '/' to the goal 'W' on the given grid. The grid is represented as follows:\n\n```\n,,,,,,,,\n,7,7,7,,\n,777,,,,\n,,7777/,\n,W77,,7,\n,,7777,,\n,7,,,,,,\n,,,,,,,,\n```\n\nLegend:\n- ',' = Wall (impassable)\n- '7' = Passage (can be traversed)\n- '/' = Start position\n- 'W' = Goal position\n\nWe will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path from '/' to 'W'. This is essentially a pathfinding problem on a grid, which can be solved using algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) due to its ability to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('/') is at position (3, 5).\n   - Goal ('W') is at position (4, 1).\n\n2. **Define Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move stays within the grid and lands on a '7' (passage).\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Initialize a queue with the start position (3, 5) and a step count of 0.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue the front element, which gives the current position and the number of steps taken to reach there.\n     - If the current position is the goal (4, 1), return the step count as the answer.\n     - Otherwise, explore all valid neighboring positions (up, down, left, right) that are passages ('7') and not yet visited.\n     - Enqueue each valid neighboring position with an incremented step count and mark it as visited.\n\n4. **Execute BFS:**\n   - Start from (3, 5) with 0 steps.\n   - Explore neighbors: (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5).\n   - Continue exploring from each new position, incrementing the step count.\n   - Follow the shortest path until reaching the goal at (4, 1).\n\n5. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS approach, we find the shortest path from (3, 5) to (4, 1).\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'W' from the start '/' is determined.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
