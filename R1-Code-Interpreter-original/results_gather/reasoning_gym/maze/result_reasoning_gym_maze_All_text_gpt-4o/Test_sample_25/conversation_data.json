    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start point '.' to the goal ':' in the given grid, while avoiding walls ('5') and moving through passages ('L'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('.') is located at position (3, 8).\n   - Goal (':') is located at position (7, 4).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is a 10x10 matrix.\n   - Walls ('5') are impassable.\n   - Passages ('L') are passable.\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move is within bounds and not into a wall.\n\n4. **Pathfinding Strategy:**\n   - Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to explore the shortest path.\n   - BFS is suitable because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n5. **BFS Implementation Steps:**\n   - Initialize a queue with the start position (3, 8) and a step count of 0.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting.\n   - While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue the front position and step count.\n     - If the current position is the goal (7, 4), return the step count.\n     - For each possible move (up, down, left, right):\n       - Calculate the new position.\n       - Check if the new position is within bounds, not a wall, and not visited.\n       - If valid, mark it as visited and enqueue it with an incremented step count.\n\n6. **Execute BFS:**\n   - Start from (3, 8) and explore the grid using BFS.\n   - Track the number of steps taken to reach the goal.\n\n7. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS approach, we find the shortest path from the start to the goal.\n\nAfter executing the BFS, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<11>>>"
