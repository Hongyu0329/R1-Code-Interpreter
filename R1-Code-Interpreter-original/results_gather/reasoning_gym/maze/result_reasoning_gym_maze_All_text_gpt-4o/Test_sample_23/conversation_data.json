    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'j' to the goal 'C' on the given grid. The grid is composed of walls ('b') and passages ('p'). We can only move through passages, and we need to find the shortest path from 'j' to 'C'. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('j') is located at (2, 3).\n   - Goal ('C') is located at (6, 4).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages ('p').\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - From (2, 3), we can move right to (2, 4).\n   - Continue moving right to (2, 5).\n   - Move down to (3, 5).\n   - Move down to (4, 5).\n   - Move down to (5, 5).\n   - Move down to (6, 5).\n   - Move left to (6, 4) to reach 'C'.\n\n4. **Count the Steps:**\n   - (2, 3) to (2, 4): 1 step\n   - (2, 4) to (2, 5): 1 step\n   - (2, 5) to (3, 5): 1 step\n   - (3, 5) to (4, 5): 1 step\n   - (4, 5) to (5, 5): 1 step\n   - (5, 5) to (6, 5): 1 step\n   - (6, 5) to (6, 4): 1 step\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Steps:**\n   - Total steps = 7\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal 'C' from 'j' is 7.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<7>>>"
