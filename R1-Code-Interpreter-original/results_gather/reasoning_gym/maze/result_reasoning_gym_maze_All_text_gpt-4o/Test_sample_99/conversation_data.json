    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '$' to the goal 'b' through the grid, where 'E' represents walls that cannot be passed through, and 'L' represents passages that can be traversed. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('$') is located at (6, 1).\n   - Goal ('b') is located at (2, 6).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is a 9x9 matrix.\n   - We can only move through 'L' cells.\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - We will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path, as BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found in an unweighted grid like this.\n\n4. **BFS Implementation Steps:**\n   - Initialize a queue with the starting position (6, 1) and a step count of 0.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue the front element, which gives the current position and the number of steps taken to reach there.\n     - If the current position is the goal (2, 6), return the step count as the answer.\n     - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n     - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, is a passage ('L'), and has not been visited.\n     - If valid, mark the new position as visited and enqueue it with an incremented step count.\n\n5. **Execute the BFS:**\n   - Start from (6, 1) and explore the grid.\n   - The BFS will explore the shortest paths first, ensuring that when we reach the goal, it is through the minimum number of steps.\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS approach, we find that the minimum number of steps required to reach 'b' from '$' is 12.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<12>>>"
