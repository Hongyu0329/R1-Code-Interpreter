    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position '-' to the goal position '+' in the given grid, while avoiding walls ('5') and only moving through passages ('<'). We will analyze the grid step by step to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('-') is located at (3, 3).\n   - Goal ('+') is located at (7, 2).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move left, right, up, or down through passages ('<').\n\n3. **Analyze the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 10x10 matrix.\n   - We need to find a path from (3, 3) to (7, 2) using the passages.\n\n4. **Pathfinding Strategy:**\n   - Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path.\n   - BFS is suitable because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found first.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Pathfinding:**\n   - Start at (3, 3).\n   - From (3, 3), move left to (3, 2).\n   - From (3, 2), move left to (3, 1).\n   - From (3, 1), move left to (3, 0).\n   - From (3, 0), move down to (4, 0).\n   - From (4, 0), move right to (4, 1).\n   - From (4, 1), move right to (4, 2).\n   - From (4, 2), move right to (4, 3).\n   - From (4, 3), move right to (4, 4).\n   - From (4, 4), move right to (4, 5).\n   - From (4, 5), move right to (4, 6).\n   - From (4, 6), move down to (5, 6).\n   - From (5, 6), move down to (6, 6).\n   - From (6, 6), move left to (6, 5).\n   - From (6, 5), move left to (6, 4).\n   - From (6, 4), move left to (6, 3).\n   - From (6, 3), move left to (6, 2).\n   - From (6, 2), move down to (7, 2) (goal).\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - Total steps taken: 17.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<17>>>"
