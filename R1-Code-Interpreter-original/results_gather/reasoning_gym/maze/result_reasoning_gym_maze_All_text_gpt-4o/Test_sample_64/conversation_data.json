    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point ']' to the goal 'O' through the passages 'E', avoiding the walls 'L'. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start: ']' is located at (1, 1).\n   - Goal: 'O' is located at (4, 2).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We can only move through 'E' (passages), not 'L' (walls).\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will explore all possible moves level by level.\n\n4. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from (1, 1).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore and the number of steps taken to reach them.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting.\n\n5. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From (1, 1), explore all possible moves:\n     - Right to (1, 2): 'E' (valid move)\n     - Down to (2, 1): 'L' (invalid move)\n     - Left and Up are out of bounds or 'L' (invalid moves)\n   - Add (1, 2) to the queue with 1 step.\n\n6. **Continue BFS:**\n   - From (1, 2), explore:\n     - Right to (1, 3): 'E' (valid move)\n     - Down to (2, 2): 'L' (invalid move)\n     - Left to (1, 1): already visited\n     - Up is out of bounds\n   - Add (1, 3) to the queue with 2 steps.\n\n7. **Repeat the Process:**\n   - From (1, 3), explore:\n     - Right to (1, 4): 'E' (valid move)\n     - Down to (2, 3): 'E' (valid move)\n     - Left to (1, 2): already visited\n     - Up is out of bounds\n   - Add (1, 4) and (2, 3) to the queue with 3 steps.\n\n8. **Continue Exploring:**\n   - From (2, 3), explore:\n     - Right to (2, 4): 'E' (valid move)\n     - Down to (3, 3): 'E' (valid move)\n     - Left to (2, 2): 'L' (invalid move)\n     - Up to (1, 3): already visited\n   - Add (2, 4) and (3, 3) to the queue with 4 steps.\n\n9. **Reach the Goal:**\n   - From (3, 3), explore:\n     - Right to (3, 4): 'E' (valid move)\n     - Down to (4, 3): 'E' (valid move)\n     - Left to (3, 2): 'E' (valid move)\n     - Up to (2, 3): already visited\n   - Add (3, 4), (4, 3), and (3, 2) to the queue with 5 steps.\n\n10. **Find the Goal:**\n    - From (4, 3), explore:\n      - Right to (4, 4): 'L' (invalid move)\n      - Down to (5, 3): 'O' (goal reached)\n      - Left to (4, 2): 'O' (goal reached)\n      - Up to (3, 3): already visited\n    - Goal (4, 2) is reached with 6 steps.\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal 'O' from the start ']' is 6.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<6>>>"
