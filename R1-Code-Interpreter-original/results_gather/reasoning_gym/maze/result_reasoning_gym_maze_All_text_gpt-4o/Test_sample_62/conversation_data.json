    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start point 'f' to the goal 'z' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a 9x9 matrix, where '(' represents a wall and 'n' represents a passage. We can only move through passages, and we can move up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('f') is located at position (4, 1).\n   - Goal ('z') is located at position (7, 7).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement Constraints:**\n   - We can only move through 'n' (passages).\n   - We cannot move diagonally, only up, down, left, or right.\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid with Coordinates:**\n   ```\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n   0 ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( (\n   1 ( n ( ( ( n n n (\n   2 ( n n ( n n n ( (\n   3 ( n n n n ( n n (\n   4 ( f ( n n n ( ( (\n   5 ( n n n ( n n ( (\n   6 ( ( n n n n n n (\n   7 ( ( n n n n n z (\n   8 ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( (\n   ```\n\n4. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Start at (4, 1).\n   - Move to (5, 1).\n   - Move to (5, 2).\n   - Move to (5, 3).\n   - Move to (4, 3).\n   - Move to (3, 3).\n   - Move to (3, 4).\n   - Move to (2, 4).\n   - Move to (1, 4).\n   - Move to (1, 5).\n   - Move to (1, 6).\n   - Move to (2, 6).\n   - Move to (3, 6).\n   - Move to (4, 6).\n   - Move to (5, 6).\n   - Move to (6, 6).\n   - Move to (6, 7).\n   - Move to (7, 7) (goal).\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path consists of 17 steps from start to goal.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is 17.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<17>>>"
