    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '$' to the goal 's' in the given grid, while avoiding walls ('R') and moving through passages ('A'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('$') is located at position (5, 1).\n   - Goal ('s') is located at position (2, 2).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is an 8x8 matrix.\n   - 'R' represents walls that cannot be passed through.\n   - 'A' represents passages that can be traversed.\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move does not lead into a wall ('R') or out of bounds.\n\n4. **Pathfinding Strategy:**\n   - We will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - BFS explores all possible moves level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\n5. **BFS Implementation Steps:**\n   - Initialize a queue with the starting position (5, 1) and a step count of 0.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue the front element, which contains the current position and the current step count.\n     - If the current position is the goal (2, 2), return the current step count as the answer.\n     - Otherwise, explore all valid adjacent positions (up, down, left, right) that are passages ('A') and not yet visited.\n     - Enqueue each valid position with an incremented step count and mark it as visited.\n\n6. **Execute the BFS:**\n   - Start from (5, 1) and explore the grid using BFS.\n   - The path will be traced through valid passages until the goal is reached.\n\n7. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS approach, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start is determined.\n\nAfter executing the BFS, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal 's' from the start '$' is found to be:\n\n<<<10>>>"
