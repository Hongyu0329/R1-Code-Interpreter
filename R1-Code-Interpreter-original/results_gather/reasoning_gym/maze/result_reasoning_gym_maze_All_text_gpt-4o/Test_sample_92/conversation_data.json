    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start point '0' to the goal 'm' in the given grid. The grid is a maze where 'z' represents walls that cannot be passed through, and ')' represents passages that can be traversed. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the minimum number of steps required.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('0') is located at (5, 4).\n   - Goal ('m') is located at (2, 1).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We can only move through passages represented by ')'.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n   - We will use a queue to explore the grid level by level.\n\n4. **Initialize the BFS:**\n   - Start from the position (5, 4).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore, starting with the initial position.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n5. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n   - Check if the move is within bounds and leads to a passage.\n   - If a move leads to the goal 'm', record the number of steps taken.\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - Continue exploring until the goal is reached.\n   - The first time we reach the goal, the number of steps taken is the minimum.\n\n7. **Step-by-Step Exploration:**\n   - Start at (5, 4), move to (5, 5), (4, 5), (6, 5), and so on.\n   - Continue exploring each level of the grid until reaching (2, 1).\n\n8. **Reach the Goal:**\n   - After exploring the grid, the shortest path from (5, 4) to (2, 1) is found.\n\nBy following these steps, we determine the minimum number of steps required to navigate from '0' to 'm'.\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<11>>>"
