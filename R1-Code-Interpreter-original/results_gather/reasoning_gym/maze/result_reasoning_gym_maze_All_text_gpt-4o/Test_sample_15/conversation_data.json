    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point 'T' to the goal ')', navigating through the grid where 'J' represents walls and '8' represents passages. We will use a step-by-step approach to analyze the grid and determine the minimum number of steps required.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('T') is located at position (6, 1).\n   - Goal (')') is located at position (4, 5).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is 8 rows by 8 columns.\n   - 'J' represents walls that cannot be passed through.\n   - '8' represents open passages that can be traversed.\n\n3. **Determine Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move does not go through a wall ('J') or out of bounds.\n\n4. **Use a Pathfinding Algorithm:**\n   - A Breadth-First Search (BFS) is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n5. **Perform BFS from Start to Goal:**\n   - Initialize a queue with the start position (6, 1) and a step count of 0.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Explore all possible moves from the current position, adding valid moves to the queue with an incremented step count.\n   - Continue this process until the goal position (4, 5) is reached.\n\n6. **Trace the Path:**\n   - Starting from (6, 1), the possible moves are:\n     - (5, 1) [down]\n     - (6, 2) [right]\n   - From (6, 2), move to (5, 2).\n   - From (5, 2), move to (4, 2).\n   - From (4, 2), move to (4, 3).\n   - From (4, 3), move to (4, 4).\n   - From (4, 4), move to (4, 5) [goal].\n\n7. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path taken is: (6, 1) -> (6, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 5).\n   - This path consists of 6 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal is 6.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<6>>>"
