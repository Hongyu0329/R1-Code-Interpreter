    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position marked by '*' to the goal position marked by 'r' in the given grid. The grid is surrounded by walls ('\"') and contains passages ('n') that can be traversed. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('*') is located at (2, 5).\n   - Goal ('r') is located at (3, 0).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is 8 rows by 9 columns.\n   - Walls ('\"') are impassable.\n   - Passages ('n') are traversable.\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move stays within the grid and does not hit a wall.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will use a queue to explore each position level by level.\n\n5. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from the position (2, 5).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore, starting with the initial position.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting.\n\n6. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - Dequeue a position and check if it is the goal.\n   - If it is the goal, return the number of steps taken to reach it.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all valid neighboring positions (up, down, left, right) that have not been visited and are not walls.\n\n7. **Continue Until Goal is Found:**\n   - Continue the BFS process until the goal is reached.\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach the goal.\n\n8. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS approach, we ensure that the first time we reach the goal, it is via the shortest path.\n\nLet's apply this step-by-step:\n\n- Start at (2, 5).\n- From (2, 5), possible moves are to (1, 5), (3, 5), (2, 4), and (2, 6).\n- Continue exploring each level, marking positions as visited.\n- Eventually, reach the goal at (3, 0).\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start is found to be 12.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<12>>>"
