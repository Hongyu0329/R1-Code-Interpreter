    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position marked by '*' to the goal marked by 'C' through the passages marked by 'U'. The walls marked by 'h' are impassable. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('*') is located at (2, 6).\n   - Goal ('C') is located at (5, 1).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is 8 rows by 8 columns.\n   - We can only move through 'U' cells.\n   - We cannot move diagonally, only up, down, left, or right.\n\n3. **Explore Possible Paths:**\n   - From the start position (2, 6), we can move to (2, 5) or (3, 6).\n   - From (2, 5), we can move to (2, 4) or (3, 5).\n   - From (3, 6), we can move to (3, 5) or (4, 6).\n   - Continue exploring paths, ensuring not to revisit any position to avoid loops.\n\n4. **Use Breadth-First Search (BFS):**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - Start from (2, 6) and explore all possible moves level by level.\n   - Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n5. **Track the Path:**\n   - From (2, 6) -> (3, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (4, 5) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (5, 1).\n   - This path takes 14 steps.\n\n6. **Verify the Path:**\n   - Ensure each move is valid (only through 'U' and within grid bounds).\n   - Confirm that the path is the shortest by checking alternative routes and ensuring no shorter path exists.\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal 'C' from the start '*' is 14.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<14>>>"
