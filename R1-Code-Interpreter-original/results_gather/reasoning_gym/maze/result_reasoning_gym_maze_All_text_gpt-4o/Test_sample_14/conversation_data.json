    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '5' to the goal '.' in the given grid, while avoiding walls ('9') and moving through passages ('P'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('5') is located at position (4, 7).\n   - Goal ('.') is located at position (6, 4).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We cannot move through walls ('9').\n\n3. **Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n   - We will explore all possible moves from the start position, layer by layer, until we reach the goal.\n\n4. **Initialize the BFS:**\n   - Start from (4, 7) with 0 steps.\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore and the number of steps taken to reach them.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n5. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each position, attempt to move in all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).\n   - Check if the new position is within bounds, not a wall, and not visited.\n   - If valid, add the new position to the queue with incremented step count and mark it as visited.\n\n6. **Reach the Goal:**\n   - Continue the BFS until the goal position (6, 4) is dequeued.\n   - The step count at this point will be the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal.\n\n7. **Perform the BFS:**\n   - Start from (4, 7), explore possible moves:\n     - (4, 6), (4, 8), (3, 7), (5, 7)\n   - Continue exploring from each new position, ensuring not to revisit or hit walls.\n   - Eventually, reach (6, 4) and count the steps taken.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal is found to be 11.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<11>>>"
