    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '<' to the goal '1' through the grid, moving only through the passages marked by '$'. The walls marked by 'F' are impassable. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal:**\n   - Start: '<' is located at (5, 8).\n   - Goal: '1' is located at (7, 5).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through '$' passages.\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 10x10 matrix with walls ('F') and passages ('$').\n\n4. **Pathfinding Strategy:**\n   - Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from the start to the goal. BFS is suitable because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found in an unweighted grid.\n\n5. **BFS Implementation:**\n   - Start from the position (5, 8).\n   - Use a queue to explore each position and mark it as visited.\n   - For each position, check all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a move leads to a '$' and hasn't been visited, add it to the queue.\n   - Continue until reaching the goal at (7, 5).\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Pathfinding:**\n   - Start at (5, 8).\n   - Move to (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), and finally (7, 5).\n\n7. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path from (5, 8) to (7, 5) involves 13 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<13>>>"
