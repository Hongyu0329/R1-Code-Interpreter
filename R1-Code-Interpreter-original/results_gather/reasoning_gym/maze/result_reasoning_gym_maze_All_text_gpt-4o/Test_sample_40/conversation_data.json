    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'n' to the goal 'I' on a grid, where '9' represents walls that cannot be passed through, and '/' represents passages that can be traversed. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('n') is located at position (6, 1).\n   - Goal ('I') is located at position (6, 6).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is a 9x9 matrix.\n   - We can only move through cells marked with '/'.\n   - We cannot move diagonally; only up, down, left, or right.\n\n3. **Explore Possible Paths:**\n   - We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the shortest path from 'n' to 'I'.\n   - BFS is suitable because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found first.\n\n4. **BFS Implementation Steps:**\n   - Initialize a queue with the starting position (6, 1) and a step count of 0.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting and looping.\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue the front element, which contains the current position and the current step count.\n     - Check if the current position is the goal position (6, 6). If yes, return the step count.\n     - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n     - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, is a passage ('/'), and has not been visited.\n     - If valid, enqueue the new position with an incremented step count and mark it as visited.\n\n5. **Execute BFS:**\n   - Start from (6, 1) with 0 steps.\n   - Explore the grid using BFS, ensuring to only move through passages and not revisiting any position.\n   - The BFS will find the shortest path to (6, 6).\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS approach, we find the shortest path from 'n' to 'I'.\n   - The minimum number of steps required to reach the goal is determined by the BFS traversal.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal 'I' from the start 'n' is found to be 10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10>>>"
