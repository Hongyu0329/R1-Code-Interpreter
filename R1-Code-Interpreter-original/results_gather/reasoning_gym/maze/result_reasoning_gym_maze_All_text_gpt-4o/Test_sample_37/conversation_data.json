    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'c' to the goal 'l' on a grid, avoiding walls ('^') and moving through passages ('4'). The goal is to find the minimum number of steps required to reach 'l' from 'c'.\n\nLet's break down the grid:\n\n```\nRow 0: ^^^^^^^^\nRow 1: ^4^44c4^\nRow 2: ^44^4^4^\nRow 3: ^4^^4^4^\nRow 4: ^44l4^^^\nRow 5: ^4^44^^^\nRow 6: ^4^^44^^\nRow 7: ^^^^^^^^\n```\n\nThe starting point 'c' is located at (1, 5) and the goal 'l' is located at (4, 3).\n\nWe will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from 'c' to 'l'. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it does so with the minimum number of steps.\n\n1. **Initialize the BFS:**\n   - Start from the position of 'c' at (1, 5).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore, starting with the initial position.\n   - Keep a set to track visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n2. **Explore the grid:**\n   - From each position, consider moving up, down, left, or right, as long as the move stays within bounds and lands on a passage ('4').\n   - For each valid move, add the new position to the queue if it hasn't been visited yet.\n   - Mark the new position as visited.\n\n3. **Check for the goal:**\n   - If the current position is the goal 'l' at (4, 3), record the number of steps taken to reach it.\n\n4. **Continue until the goal is reached:**\n   - Continue the BFS until the goal is reached, ensuring that the first time it is reached, it is with the minimum number of steps.\n\nLet's outline the path:\n\n- Start at (1, 5).\n- Move to (1, 4).\n- Move to (1, 3).\n- Move to (2, 3).\n- Move to (3, 3).\n- Move to (4, 3) (goal).\n\nThe path is: (1, 5) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (4, 3).\n\nCounting the steps, we have 5 steps from 'c' to 'l'.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
