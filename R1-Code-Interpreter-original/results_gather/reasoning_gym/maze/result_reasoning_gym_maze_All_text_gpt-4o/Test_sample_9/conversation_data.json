    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 't' to the goal 'l' on the given grid. The grid is composed of walls ('M') and passages ('G'). We can only move through the passages, and we need to find the shortest path from 't' to 'l'.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('t') is located at position (1, 2).\n   - Goal ('l') is located at position (1, 6).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through 'G' (passages).\n   - We cannot move diagonally or through 'M' (walls).\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid:**\n   ```\n   MMMMMMMM\n   MGGtGMlM\n   MMGMGGGM\n   MMGGGGMM\n   MGMMGMMM\n   MGGGMGMM\n   MGGGGGMM\n   MMMMMMMM\n   ```\n\n4. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Starting at (1, 2), we need to find a path to (1, 6).\n   - We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path since all moves have equal weight.\n\n5. **Execute the Pathfinding:**\n   - Start at (1, 2).\n   - From (1, 2), move right to (1, 3).\n   - From (1, 3), move right to (1, 4).\n   - From (1, 4), move right to (1, 5).\n   - From (1, 5), move right to (1, 6).\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path is: (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 6).\n   - This path consists of 4 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'l' from the start 't' is 4.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<4>>>"
