    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '{' to the goal 'x' through the passages represented by ':'. The walls represented by 'a' cannot be passed through. We will analyze the grid step by step to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal:**\n   - Start ('{') is located at row 3, column 6.\n   - Goal ('x') is located at row 1, column 2.\n\n2. **Understand the Grid:**\n   - The grid is 10 rows by 10 columns.\n   - We can only move through ':' and cannot pass through 'a'.\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move is within bounds and the destination is a ':'.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will start from the '{' position and explore all possible moves level by level.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Path Exploration:**\n   - Start at (3, 6).\n   - Explore all possible moves from (3, 6):\n     - Move left to (3, 5).\n     - Move up to (2, 6).\n     - Move down to (4, 6).\n   - From each new position, continue exploring:\n     - From (3, 5), move left to (3, 4).\n     - From (2, 6), move left to (2, 5) and up to (1, 6).\n     - From (4, 6), move left to (4, 5) and down to (5, 6).\n   - Continue this process, ensuring not to revisit any position, until reaching the goal at (1, 2).\n\n6. **Tracking Steps:**\n   - Count each move as a step.\n   - Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n7. **Reaching the Goal:**\n   - After exploring the grid, the shortest path to reach 'x' from '{' is found to be 14 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<14>>>"
