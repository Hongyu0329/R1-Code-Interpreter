    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate through a grid from the starting point '(' to the goal 'd', moving only through passages ('o') and avoiding walls ('i'). We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path, as BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start: '(' is located at position (1, 6).\n   - Goal: 'd' is located at position (6, 6).\n\n2. **Define Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, as long as you stay within the grid and move to a passage ('o').\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Initialization:**\n   - Start from the initial position (1, 6).\n   - Use a queue to explore each position, starting with the initial position.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and check if it is the goal.\n   - If it is the goal, return the number of steps taken to reach it.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all valid neighboring positions (up, down, left, right) that are passages ('o') and have not been visited.\n   - Mark each new position as visited.\n\n5. **Continue Until Goal is Found:**\n   - Repeat the BFS process until the goal is reached.\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - The BFS will ensure that the first time we reach the goal, it is via the shortest path.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the grid:\n\n- Start at (1, 6).\n- From (1, 6), the possible moves are to (2, 6) and (1, 5).\n- Continue exploring each position using BFS, marking positions as visited.\n- Eventually, you will reach the goal at (6, 6).\n\nBy following the BFS process, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'd' from the start '(' is determined.\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<12>>>"
