    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'v' to the goal 'Q' through the passages ('/') while avoiding the walls ('N'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('v') is at position (2, 1).\n   - Goal ('Q') is at position (5, 3).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is an 8x8 matrix.\n   - Walls ('N') are impassable.\n   - Passages ('/') are passable.\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move is within bounds and not into a wall.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will explore all possible moves level by level.\n\n5. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from (2, 1).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore, starting with the initial position.\n   - Keep a set to track visited positions to avoid revisiting.\n\n6. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From (2, 1), explore all possible moves:\n     - (2, 2) is a passage, move here.\n   - From (2, 2), explore:\n     - (2, 3) is a passage, move here.\n   - From (2, 3), explore:\n     - (3, 3) is a passage, move here.\n   - From (3, 3), explore:\n     - (4, 3) is a passage, move here.\n   - From (4, 3), explore:\n     - (5, 3) is the goal, move here.\n\n7. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path taken is: (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (5, 3).\n   - This path consists of 5 steps.\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal is 5.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<5>>>"
