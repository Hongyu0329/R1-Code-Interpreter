    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point ';' to the goal 'J' through the grid, moving only through the passages represented by ']'. The walls, represented by 'i', are impassable. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start (';') is located at (6, 1).\n   - Goal ('J') is located at (3, 5).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages (']').\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid with Coordinates:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) i i i i i i i i\n   (1,0) i ] i i ] ] i i\n   (2,0) i ] i i i ] i i\n   (3,0) i i ] ] ] J ] i\n   (4,0) i ] i ] ] ] ] i\n   (5,0) i ] ] ] ] ] i i\n   (6,0) i ; ] i ] i ] i\n   (7,0) i i i i i i i i\n   ```\n\n4. **Explore Possible Paths:**\n   - Start at (6, 1).\n   - From (6, 1), move to (6, 2).\n   - From (6, 2), move to (5, 2).\n   - From (5, 2), move to (5, 3).\n   - From (5, 3), move to (5, 4).\n   - From (5, 4), move to (5, 5).\n   - From (5, 5), move to (4, 5).\n   - From (4, 5), move to (3, 5) where the goal 'J' is located.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - (6, 1) to (6, 2): 1 step\n   - (6, 2) to (5, 2): 1 step\n   - (5, 2) to (5, 3): 1 step\n   - (5, 3) to (5, 4): 1 step\n   - (5, 4) to (5, 5): 1 step\n   - (5, 5) to (4, 5): 1 step\n   - (4, 5) to (3, 5): 1 step\n\n   Total steps = 7\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal is 7.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<7>>>"
