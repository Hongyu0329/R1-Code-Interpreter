    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position '(' to the goal '`' in the given grid. The grid is represented as follows:\n\n```\nQQQQQQQ\nQQ%%%%Q\nQQ`%Q%Q\nQ%%Q%%Q\nQ%%%Q%Q\nQ%QQ%(Q\nQQQQQQQ\n```\n\nLegend:\n- 'Q' represents a wall, which cannot be passed through.\n- '%' represents a passage, which can be traversed.\n- '(' is the start position.\n- '`' is the goal position.\n\nWe need to find the shortest path from '(' to '`' using only the '%' passages. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start '(' is located at position (5, 5).\n   - Goal '`' is located at position (2, 2).\n\n2. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, but only through '%' passages.\n\n3. **Pathfinding Strategy:**\n   - We can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. BFS explores all possible positions level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\n4. **BFS Implementation:**\n   - Start from the position (5, 5).\n   - Explore all possible moves to adjacent '%' positions.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n   - Continue exploring until the goal position (2, 2) is reached.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Path Exploration:**\n   - Start at (5, 5).\n   - Move to (5, 4).\n   - Move to (4, 4).\n   - Move to (4, 3).\n   - Move to (3, 3).\n   - Move to (3, 2).\n   - Finally, move to (2, 2) where the goal '`' is located.\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path taken is: (5, 5) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 2).\n   - This path consists of 6 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal is 6.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<6>>>"
