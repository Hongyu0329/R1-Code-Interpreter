    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'g' to the goal '*' on the grid, moving only through passages ('E') and avoiding walls (')'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('g') is located at position (1, 5).\n   - Goal ('*') is located at position (3, 2).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement Constraints:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We can only move through 'E' and cannot pass through ')'.\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path, as BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found first.\n\n4. **Execute the BFS:**\n   - Start from (1, 5) and explore all possible moves.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n   - Use a queue to manage the exploration of positions, storing the current position and the number of steps taken to reach it.\n\n5. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From (1, 5), possible moves are:\n     - Down to (2, 5)\n     - Left to (1, 4)\n     - Right to (1, 6)\n   - Continue exploring from each new position, always checking if the goal (3, 2) is reached.\n\n6. **Find the Shortest Path:**\n   - Continue the BFS until the goal is reached.\n   - Track the number of steps taken to reach the goal.\n\n7. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - After exploring the grid, the shortest path from 'g' to '*' is found to be 8 steps.\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<8>>>"
