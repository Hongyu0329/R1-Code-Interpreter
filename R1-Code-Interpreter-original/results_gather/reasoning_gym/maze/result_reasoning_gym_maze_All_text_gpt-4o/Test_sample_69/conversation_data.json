    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start position '(' to the goal 'J' in the given grid. The grid is represented as a 2D array where '-' represents a wall, 'o' represents a passage, 'J' is the goal, and '(' is the start. We can only move through passages ('o') and need to avoid walls ('-').\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start '(' is located at row 2, column 6.\n   - Goal 'J' is located at row 1, column 1.\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We can only move through cells marked with 'o'.\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid with Coordinates:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (0,7)\n   (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7)\n   (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7)\n   (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7)\n   (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7)\n   (5,0) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7)\n   (6,0) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7)\n   ```\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Use BFS to explore the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - Start from the position (2,6) and explore all possible moves.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n\n5. **Path Exploration:**\n   - From (2,6), move to (2,5).\n   - From (2,5), move to (2,4).\n   - From (2,4), move to (2,3).\n   - From (2,3), move to (2,2).\n   - From (2,2), move to (1,2).\n   - From (1,2), move to (1,3).\n   - From (1,3), move to (1,4).\n   - From (1,4), move to (1,5).\n   - From (1,5), move to (1,6).\n   - From (1,6), move to (1,1) (goal).\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path from start to goal is: (2,6) -> (2,5) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5) -> (1,6) -> (1,1).\n   - This path consists of 10 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<10>>>"
