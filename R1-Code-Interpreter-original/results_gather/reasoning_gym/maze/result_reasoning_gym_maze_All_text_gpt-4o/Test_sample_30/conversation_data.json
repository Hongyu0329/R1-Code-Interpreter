    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '8' to the goal 'u' through the passages marked by 'm'. The grid is surrounded by walls (',') which cannot be traversed. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('8') is located at position (6, 3).\n   - Goal ('u') is located at position (3, 2).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages ('m').\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will explore all possible moves from the start position and keep track of the number of steps taken.\n\n4. **Initialize the BFS:**\n   - Start from (6, 3) with 0 steps.\n   - Use a queue to explore each position and a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n\n5. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From (6, 3), the possible moves are:\n     - Up to (5, 3)\n   - From (5, 3), the possible moves are:\n     - Up to (4, 3)\n   - From (4, 3), the possible moves are:\n     - Left to (4, 2)\n     - Down to (5, 3) (already visited)\n   - From (4, 2), the possible moves are:\n     - Up to (3, 2) (goal reached)\n     - Right to (4, 3) (already visited)\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - (6, 3) to (5, 3): 1 step\n   - (5, 3) to (4, 3): 2 steps\n   - (4, 3) to (4, 2): 3 steps\n   - (4, 2) to (3, 2): 4 steps\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'u' from the start '8' is 4.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
