    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'i' to the goal 'C' on the given grid. The grid is surrounded by walls ('9'), and we can only move through passages ('r'). We need to find the shortest path in terms of the number of steps.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('i') is located at position (3, 5).\n   - Goal ('C') is located at position (1, 1).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We cannot move through walls ('9').\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid:**\n   ```\n   999999999\n   9Cr9rrrr9\n   9rrrr9r99\n   9rr9rirr9\n   9rrrrr9r9\n   9rrrrrr99\n   9r99rr999\n   9rrr9r9r9\n   999999999\n   ```\n\n4. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Starting from (3, 5), we need to find a path to (1, 1).\n   - We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n5. **Execute the Pathfinding:**\n   - Start at (3, 5).\n   - Move left to (3, 4).\n   - Move left to (3, 3).\n   - Move up to (2, 3).\n   - Move left to (2, 2).\n   - Move left to (2, 1).\n   - Move up to (1, 1).\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path is: (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 1).\n   - This path consists of 6 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'C' from the start 'i' is 6.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<6>>>."
