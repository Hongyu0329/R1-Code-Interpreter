    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start point 'o' to the goal '>' in the given grid. The grid is surrounded by walls ('$'), and we can only move through passages ('v'). We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path, as BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('o') is located at (4, 3).\n   - Goal ('>') is located at (7, 1).\n\n2. **Define Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move stays within the grid and lands on a passage ('v').\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from the position (4, 3) with a step count of 0.\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore, starting with the initial position.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **Perform BFS:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and check if it is the goal. If it is, return the step count.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all valid neighboring positions (up, down, left, right) that are passages and have not been visited.\n   - Increment the step count for each move.\n\n5. **Continue Until Goal is Found:**\n   - Continue the BFS process until the goal is reached, ensuring that each position is only visited once to prevent infinite loops.\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - The BFS will naturally find the shortest path due to its level-order exploration.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the grid:\n\n- Start at (4, 3).\n- Explore neighbors: (3, 3), (5, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4).\n- Continue exploring each level, marking positions as visited.\n- Eventually, reach the goal at (7, 1).\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start is found to be 12.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<12>>>"
