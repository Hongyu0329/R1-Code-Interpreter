    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '}' to the goal 'C' through a grid where '/' represents walls and '(' represents passages. We can only move through passages, and we need to find the shortest path in terms of steps.\n\nLet's break down the grid and identify the coordinates of the start and goal:\n\n1. The grid is an 8x8 matrix.\n2. The starting point '}' is located at (3, 6).\n3. The goal 'C' is located at (7, 5).\n\nWe can only move up, down, left, or right through the passages '('.\n\nNow, let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n- Start at (3, 6).\n- From (3, 6), the possible moves are:\n  - Up to (2, 6)\n  - Left to (3, 5)\n- Move to (3, 5).\n- From (3, 5), the possible moves are:\n  - Up to (2, 5)\n  - Left to (3, 4)\n- Move to (3, 4).\n- From (3, 4), the possible moves are:\n  - Up to (2, 4)\n  - Left to (3, 3)\n- Move to (3, 3).\n- From (3, 3), the possible moves are:\n  - Up to (2, 3)\n  - Left to (3, 2)\n- Move to (3, 2).\n- From (3, 2), the possible moves are:\n  - Up to (2, 2)\n  - Left to (3, 1)\n- Move to (3, 1).\n- From (3, 1), the possible moves are:\n  - Up to (2, 1)\n  - Left to (3, 0)\n- Move to (3, 0).\n- From (3, 0), the possible moves are:\n  - Up to (2, 0)\n  - Right to (3, 1)\n- Move to (2, 0).\n- From (2, 0), the possible moves are:\n  - Down to (3, 0)\n  - Right to (2, 1)\n- Move to (2, 1).\n- From (2, 1), the possible moves are:\n  - Down to (3, 1)\n  - Right to (2, 2)\n- Move to (2, 2).\n- From (2, 2), the possible moves are:\n  - Down to (3, 2)\n  - Right to (2, 3)\n- Move to (2, 3).\n- From (2, 3), the possible moves are:\n  - Down to (3, 3)\n  - Right to (2, 4)\n- Move to (2, 4).\n- From (2, 4), the possible moves are:\n  - Down to (3, 4)\n  - Right to (2, 5)\n- Move to (2, 5).\n- From (2, 5), the possible moves are:\n  - Down to (3, 5)\n  - Right to (2, 6)\n- Move to (2, 6).\n- From (2, 6), the possible moves are:\n  - Down to (3, 6)\n  - Right to (2, 7)\n- Move to (2, 7).\n- From (2, 7), the possible moves are:\n  - Down to (3, 7)\n  - Left to (2, 6)\n- Move to (3, 7).\n- From (3, 7), the possible moves are:\n  - Down to (4, 7)\n  - Left to (3, 6)\n- Move to (4, 7).\n- From (4, 7), the possible moves are:\n  - Down to (5, 7)\n  - Left to (4, 6)\n- Move to (5, 7).\n- From (5, 7), the possible moves are:\n  - Down to (6, 7)\n  - Left to (5, 6)\n- Move to (6, 7).\n- From (6, 7), the possible moves are:\n  - Down to (7, 7)\n  - Left to (6, 6)\n- Move to (7, 7).\n- From (7, 7), the possible moves are:\n  - Left to (7, 6)\n- Move to (7, 6).\n- From (7, 6), the possible moves are:\n  - Left to (7, 5)\n- Move to (7, 5), which is the goal 'C'.\n\nCounting the steps from the start to the goal, we have taken 14 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<14>>>"
