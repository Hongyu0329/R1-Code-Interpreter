    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'm' to the goal '{' in the given grid, while only moving through the passages marked as 'W'. The walls marked as 'i' are impassable. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('m') is located at position (1, 5).\n   - Goal ('{') is located at position (6, 5).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement Constraints:**\n   - We can only move through 'W' (passages).\n   - We cannot move through 'i' (walls).\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid with Coordinates:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (0,7)\n   (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7)\n   (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7)\n   (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7)\n   (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7)\n   (5,0) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7)\n   (6,0) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7)\n   (7,0) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7)\n   ```\n\n4. **Trace the Path from Start to Goal:**\n   - Start at (1, 5).\n   - Move to (1, 4) (left).\n   - Move to (2, 4) (down).\n   - Move to (2, 3) (left).\n   - Move to (3, 3) (down).\n   - Move to (4, 3) (down).\n   - Move to (4, 4) (right).\n   - Move to (5, 4) (down).\n   - Move to (5, 5) (right).\n   - Move to (6, 5) (down) to reach the goal '{'.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path consists of 9 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
