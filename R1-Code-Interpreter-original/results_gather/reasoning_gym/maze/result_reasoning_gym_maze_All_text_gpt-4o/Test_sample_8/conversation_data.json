    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '&' to the goal '4' on the grid, moving only through passages ('-') and avoiding walls ('W'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path, which is essentially a breadth-first search (BFS) in this context.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('&') is located at (7, 7).\n   - Goal ('4') is located at (3, 3).\n\n2. **Define Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided you do not move into a wall ('W') or outside the grid.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Use a queue to explore each position starting from the start position.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting and looping.\n   - For each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) and add them to the queue if they are valid (i.e., not a wall and not visited).\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach each new position.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Exploration:**\n   - Start at (7, 7) with 0 steps.\n   - From (7, 7), the possible move is to (7, 6).\n   - From (7, 6), move to (7, 5).\n   - From (7, 5), move to (7, 4).\n   - From (7, 4), move to (7, 3).\n   - From (7, 3), move to (6, 3).\n   - From (6, 3), move to (5, 3).\n   - From (5, 3), move to (4, 3).\n   - From (4, 3), move to (3, 3), which is the goal.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path taken is: (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 3) -> (6, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (3, 3).\n   - This path consists of 8 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal is 8.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<8>>>"
