    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'c' to the goal 'H' on the given grid. The grid is surrounded by walls ('u'), and we can only move through passages ('+'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('c') is located at position (6, 2).\n   - Goal ('H') is located at position (4, 6).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We cannot move through walls ('u').\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid with Coordinates:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (0,7)\n   (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7)\n   (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7)\n   (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7)\n   (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7)\n   (5,0) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7)\n   (6,0) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7)\n   (7,0) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7)\n   ```\n\n4. **Trace the Path from 'c' to 'H':**\n   - Start at (6, 2).\n   - Move up to (5, 2).\n   - Move up to (4, 2).\n   - Move right to (4, 3).\n   - Move right to (4, 4).\n   - Move right to (4, 5).\n   - Move right to (4, 6) where 'H' is located.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - From (6, 2) to (5, 2): 1 step\n   - From (5, 2) to (4, 2): 1 step\n   - From (4, 2) to (4, 3): 1 step\n   - From (4, 3) to (4, 4): 1 step\n   - From (4, 4) to (4, 5): 1 step\n   - From (4, 5) to (4, 6): 1 step\n\n   Total steps = 6\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal 'H' from the start 'c' is 6.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<6>>>"
