    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'g' to the goal 'H' through the grid, avoiding walls represented by ')'. The passages are represented by 'G'. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('g') is at position (1, 1).\n   - Goal ('H') is at position (4, 4).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is a 6x6 matrix.\n   - Walls are represented by ')', and passages are represented by 'G'.\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided you do not move into a wall.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will explore all possible moves level by level, starting from the initial position.\n\n5. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from (1, 1) with 0 steps.\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore and the number of steps taken to reach them.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting.\n\n6. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From (1, 1), the possible moves are:\n     - Right to (1, 2) [G]\n     - Down to (2, 1) [G]\n   - Add these positions to the queue with 1 step.\n\n7. **Continue BFS:**\n   - From (1, 2), move to (1, 3) [G] and (2, 2) [G].\n   - From (2, 1), move to (3, 1) [G].\n   - Continue this process, exploring all possible paths and counting steps.\n\n8. **Reach the Goal:**\n   - Continue exploring until you reach the goal at (4, 4).\n   - Track the number of steps taken to reach this position.\n\n9. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - The BFS ensures that the first time you reach the goal, it is via the shortest path.\n   - Count the steps taken to reach (4, 4).\n\nBy following these steps, we find that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'H' from the start 'g' is 7.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7>>>"
