    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position '#' to the goal 'B' through the passages '!' while avoiding the walls 'i'. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('#') is located at (2, 5).\n   - Goal ('B') is located at (4, 1).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages '!'.\n   - We cannot move through walls 'i'.\n\n3. **Explore Possible Paths:**\n   - We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the shortest path from the start to the goal.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Steps:**\n   - Start from (2, 5).\n   - Explore all possible moves from the current position.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Path Exploration:**\n   - Start at (2, 5).\n   - From (2, 5), move to (2, 4).\n   - From (2, 4), move to (2, 3).\n   - From (2, 3), move to (3, 3).\n   - From (3, 3), move to (3, 2).\n   - From (3, 2), move to (3, 1).\n   - From (3, 1), move to (4, 1) (goal).\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path taken is: (2, 5) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 1) -> (4, 1).\n   - This path consists of 6 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'B' from the start '#' is 6.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<6>>>"
