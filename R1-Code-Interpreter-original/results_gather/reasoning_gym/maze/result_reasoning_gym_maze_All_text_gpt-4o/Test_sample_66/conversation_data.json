    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '5' to the goal 'R' on the given grid, while avoiding walls ('J') and only moving through passages (','). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path, which is essentially a breadth-first search (BFS) in this context.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('5') is located at position (5, 2).\n   - Goal ('R') is located at position (3, 5).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is surrounded by walls ('J'), so we cannot move outside the given grid.\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid level by level.\n   - Start from the initial position (5, 2) and mark it as visited.\n   - Explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - If a move leads to the goal ('R'), record the number of steps taken.\n   - If a move leads to a passage (','), add the new position to the queue and continue.\n   - Avoid revisiting positions to prevent infinite loops.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Exploration:**\n   - Start at (5, 2).\n   - From (5, 2), possible moves are to (4, 2) and (5, 3).\n   - From (5, 3), possible moves are to (4, 3) and (5, 4).\n   - From (5, 4), possible moves are to (4, 4) and (5, 5).\n   - From (5, 5), possible move is to (4, 5).\n   - From (4, 5), we reach the goal 'R'.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - (5, 2) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (3, 5)\n   - Total steps taken: 5\n\nThus, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'R' from the start '5' is 5.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<5>>>"
