    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position '+' to the goal position ')' through the passage '%' while avoiding the walls 'R'. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('+') is at position (6, 4).\n   - Goal (')') is at position (7, 8).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is a 10x10 matrix.\n   - 'R' represents walls that cannot be passed through.\n   - '%' represents passages that can be traversed.\n\n3. **Determine Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move does not lead into a wall ('R') or out of bounds.\n\n4. **Use a Pathfinding Algorithm:**\n   - A Breadth-First Search (BFS) is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n5. **Implement BFS:**\n   - Start from the initial position (6, 4).\n   - Explore all possible moves from the current position.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n   - Continue exploring until the goal position (7, 8) is reached.\n\n6. **Trace the Path:**\n   - From (6, 4), move to (6, 5).\n   - From (6, 5), move to (6, 6).\n   - From (6, 6), move to (6, 7).\n   - From (6, 7), move to (5, 7).\n   - From (5, 7), move to (4, 7).\n   - From (4, 7), move to (3, 7).\n   - From (3, 7), move to (2, 7).\n   - From (2, 7), move to (1, 7).\n   - From (1, 7), move to (1, 8).\n   - From (1, 8), move to (2, 8).\n   - From (2, 8), move to (3, 8).\n   - From (3, 8), move to (4, 8).\n   - From (4, 8), move to (5, 8).\n   - From (5, 8), move to (6, 8).\n   - From (6, 8), move to (7, 8).\n\n7. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path consists of 14 steps from start to goal.\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal is 14.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<14>>>"
