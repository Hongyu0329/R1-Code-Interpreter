    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'Q' to the goal 'X' on a grid, where '9' represents walls that cannot be passed through, and 'e' represents passages that can be traversed. The goal is to find the minimum number of steps required to reach 'X' from 'Q'.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('Q') is located at position (7, 3).\n   - Goal ('X') is located at position (2, 2).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We cannot move through walls ('9').\n\n3. **Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will use a queue to explore each position level by level.\n\n4. **Initialize the BFS:**\n   - Start from the position of 'Q' (7, 3).\n   - Mark the starting position as visited.\n\n5. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n   - Ensure that moves are within bounds and not through walls.\n   - Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n6. **Stop When Goal is Reached:**\n   - As soon as we reach 'X', we record the number of steps taken.\n\n7. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - The BFS ensures that the first time we reach 'X', it is via the shortest path.\n\nLet's outline the path:\n\n- Start at (7, 3).\n- Move up to (6, 3).\n- Move up to (5, 3).\n- Move up to (4, 3).\n- Move up to (3, 3).\n- Move left to (3, 2).\n- Move up to (2, 2) where 'X' is located.\n\nThe path taken is: (7, 3) -> (6, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 2).\n\nCounting the steps, we have moved 6 times vertically and 1 time horizontally, totaling 7 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach 'X' from 'Q' is 7.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<7>>>"
