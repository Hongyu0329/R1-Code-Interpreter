    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point 'H' to the goal '*' in the given grid. The grid is a maze where '#' represents walls that cannot be passed through, 'W' represents open passages that can be traversed, and we can move up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal:**\n   - Start ('H') is located at position (5, 2).\n   - Goal ('*') is located at position (2, 1).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - We cannot move through walls ('#').\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - We need to find a path from (5, 2) to (2, 1) using the open passages ('W').\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n   - We will explore all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Path Exploration:**\n   - Start at (5, 2).\n   - From (5, 2), the possible moves are:\n     - Up to (4, 2)\n     - Left to (5, 1)\n   - From (4, 2), the possible moves are:\n     - Up to (3, 2)\n     - Down to (5, 2) (already visited)\n   - From (5, 1), the possible moves are:\n     - Up to (4, 1)\n     - Right to (5, 2) (already visited)\n   - From (3, 2), the possible moves are:\n     - Up to (2, 2)\n     - Down to (4, 2) (already visited)\n   - From (4, 1), the possible moves are:\n     - Up to (3, 1)\n     - Down to (5, 1) (already visited)\n   - From (2, 2), the possible moves are:\n     - Left to (2, 1) (goal reached)\n     - Down to (3, 2) (already visited)\n   - From (3, 1), the possible moves are:\n     - Up to (2, 1) (goal reached)\n     - Down to (4, 1) (already visited)\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - The shortest path from (5, 2) to (2, 1) is:\n     - (5, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 1)\n   - This path takes 4 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
