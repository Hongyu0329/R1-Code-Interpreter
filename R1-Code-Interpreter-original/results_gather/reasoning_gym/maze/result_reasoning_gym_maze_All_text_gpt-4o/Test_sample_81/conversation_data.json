    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '}' to the goal 'z' on the given grid. The grid is surrounded by walls ('3'), and we can only move through passages ('@'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('}') is located at position (5, 2).\n   - Goal ('z') is located at position (4, 7).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right through passages ('@').\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid:**\n   ```\n   333333333\n   3@@@@@3@3\n   3@@@@3@@3\n   3@@@@@3@3\n   3@@@@@@z3\n   33}@@@3@3\n   3333@@@@3\n   3@3@@@@@3\n   333333333\n   ```\n\n4. **Plan the Path:**\n   - From (5, 2), move up to (4, 2).\n   - From (4, 2), move right to (4, 3).\n   - Continue moving right through (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), and finally reach (4, 7) where 'z' is located.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - Move from (5, 2) to (4, 2): 1 step.\n   - Move from (4, 2) to (4, 3): 1 step.\n   - Move from (4, 3) to (4, 4): 1 step.\n   - Move from (4, 4) to (4, 5): 1 step.\n   - Move from (4, 5) to (4, 6): 1 step.\n   - Move from (4, 6) to (4, 7): 1 step.\n\n6. **Calculate the Total Steps:**\n   - Total steps = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
