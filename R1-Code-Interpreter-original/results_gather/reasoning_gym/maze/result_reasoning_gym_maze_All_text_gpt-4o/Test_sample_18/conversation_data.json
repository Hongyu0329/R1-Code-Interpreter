    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'K' to the goal '>' in the given grid, while avoiding walls ('\"') and only moving through passages ('y'). We will analyze the grid step by step to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is a 5x5 matrix.\n   - The starting point 'K' is at position (0, 0).\n   - The goal '>' is at position (3, 3).\n   - Walls are represented by '\"', and passages by 'y'.\n\n2. **Grid Representation:**\n   ```\n   Row 0: \"K\"yy\"\n   Row 1: \"yy\"y\"\n   Row 2: \"yyy>\"\n   Row 3: \"\"\"\"y\"\n   Row 4: \"\"\"\"\"\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move is within bounds and lands on a passage ('y').\n\n4. **Starting Point:**\n   - Start at (0, 0) with 'K'.\n\n5. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - Use a queue to explore each position and track the number of steps taken.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Path Exploration:**\n   - Start at (0, 0) with 0 steps.\n   - From (0, 0), move to (0, 2) with 1 step.\n   - From (0, 2), move to (1, 2) with 2 steps.\n   - From (1, 2), move to (2, 2) with 3 steps.\n   - From (2, 2), move to (2, 3) with 4 steps.\n   - From (2, 3), move to (3, 3) with 5 steps, reaching the goal.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The minimum number of steps required to reach the goal '>' from 'K' is 5.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<5>>>"
