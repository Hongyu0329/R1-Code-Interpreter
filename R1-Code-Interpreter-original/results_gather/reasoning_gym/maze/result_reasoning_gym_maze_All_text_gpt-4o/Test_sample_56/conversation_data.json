    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start point 'G' to the goal 'n' in the given grid. The grid is a maze where 'O' represents walls that cannot be passed through, and 'o' represents open passages that can be traversed. We will use a step-by-step approach to navigate through the maze.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('G') is located at position (4, 8).\n   - Goal ('n') is located at position (5, 2).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We cannot move through walls ('O').\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will explore all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\n4. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from the position of 'G' (4, 8).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore, starting with the initial position.\n   - Keep a set to track visited positions to avoid revisiting.\n\n5. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n   - Check if the move is within bounds and not a wall.\n   - If a move reaches the goal ('n'), record the number of steps taken.\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - Continue exploring until the goal is reached.\n   - The first time the goal is reached in BFS will be the shortest path.\n\n7. **Perform the BFS:**\n   - Start from (4, 8), explore possible moves.\n   - Move to (4, 7), (3, 8), (5, 8) as they are open passages.\n   - Continue exploring from each new position, marking them as visited.\n   - Eventually, reach (5, 2) from the shortest path.\n\n8. **Count the Steps:**\n   - Track the number of steps taken to reach the goal.\n   - The path with the minimum steps is the answer.\n\nAfter performing the BFS and counting the steps, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'n' from 'G' is:\n\n<<<16>>>"
