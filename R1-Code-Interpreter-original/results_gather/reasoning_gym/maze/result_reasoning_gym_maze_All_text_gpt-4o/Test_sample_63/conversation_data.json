    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position '(' to the goal 'g' in the given grid, moving only through the passages ('$'). We will analyze the grid step by step to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start: '(' is located at position (3, 1).\n   - Goal: 'g' is located at position (5, 3).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement Constraints:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through the passages ('$').\n   - We cannot move through walls (''').\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid with Coordinates:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6)\n   (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)\n   (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)\n   (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)\n   (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)\n   (5,0) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)\n   ```\n\n4. **Trace the Path from Start to Goal:**\n   - Start at (3, 1).\n   - Move right to (3, 2).\n   - Move right to (3, 3).\n   - Move down to (4, 3).\n   - Move down to (5, 3) where the goal 'g' is located.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - From (3, 1) to (3, 2): 1 step.\n   - From (3, 2) to (3, 3): 1 step.\n   - From (3, 3) to (4, 3): 1 step.\n   - From (4, 3) to (5, 3): 1 step.\n   - Total steps = 4.\n\nThe minimum number of steps required to reach the goal is 4.\n\nFinal answer: <<<4>>>"
