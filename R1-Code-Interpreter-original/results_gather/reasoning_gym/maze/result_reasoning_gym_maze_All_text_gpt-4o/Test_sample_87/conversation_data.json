    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position, marked as `'''`, to the goal position, marked as `\\'`, on the given grid. The grid consists of walls ('A') and passages ('n'). We can only move through the passages, and we need to find the shortest path in terms of the number of steps.\n\nLet's break down the grid and identify the start and goal positions:\n\n```\nRow 0: AAAAAAAAA\nRow 1: AAnAnnnAA\nRow 2: AnnnAAAnA\nRow 3: AnnnAnAAA\nRow 4: AAnnnnAnA\nRow 5: AnAnAAnAA\nRow 6: AAnnnnAAA\nRow 7: A\\nnnn'nA\nRow 8: AAAAAAAAA\n```\n\n- Start position (`'''`): Row 7, Column 6\n- Goal position (`\\'`): Row 7, Column 1\n\nWe need to find the shortest path from (7, 6) to (7, 1) using only the passages ('n').\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Possible Moves**: From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages ('n').\n\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Since we are looking for the shortest path in an unweighted grid, a BFS is appropriate. It explores all possible moves level by level.\n\n3. **Initialize BFS**:\n   - Start from (7, 6).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore, starting with the initial position.\n   - Keep a set to track visited positions to avoid revisiting.\n\n4. **Explore the Grid**:\n   - From (7, 6), explore all possible moves:\n     - Move left to (7, 5).\n   - From (7, 5), explore:\n     - Move left to (7, 4).\n   - From (7, 4), explore:\n     - Move left to (7, 3).\n   - From (7, 3), explore:\n     - Move left to (7, 2).\n   - From (7, 2), explore:\n     - Move left to (7, 1), which is the goal.\n\n5. **Count the Steps**:\n   - The path from (7, 6) to (7, 1) is: (7, 6) -> (7, 5) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 3) -> (7, 2) -> (7, 1).\n   - This path consists of 5 steps.\n\nThus, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is 5.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<5>>>"
