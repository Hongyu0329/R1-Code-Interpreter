    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position 'S' to the goal '}' while avoiding walls ('>'). We can only move through passages ('R'). The goal is to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('S') is located at row 0, column 5.\n   - Goal ('}') is located at row 4, column 7.\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages ('R').\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid:**\n   ```\n   Row 0: >>>>>>>>\n   Row 1: >RRRRS>>>\n   Row 2: >>>RRRRR>\n   Row 3: >RRRRR>R>\n   Row 4: >RRRRRR}>\n   Row 5: >RR>R>>R>\n   Row 6: >RR>>>>>>>\n   Row 7: >>RRRR>R>\n   Row 8: >>>>>>>>\n   ```\n\n4. **Plan the Path:**\n   - From the start position (0, 5), we need to find a path to (4, 7).\n   - We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the shortest path.\n\n5. **Explore the Path:**\n   - Start at (0, 5).\n   - Move down to (1, 5).\n   - Move right to (1, 6).\n   - Move right to (1, 7).\n   - Move down to (2, 7).\n   - Move down to (3, 7).\n   - Move down to (4, 7) where the goal is located.\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path is: (0, 5) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 6) -> (1, 7) -> (2, 7) -> (3, 7) -> (4, 7).\n   - This path consists of 6 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is 6.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<6>>>"
