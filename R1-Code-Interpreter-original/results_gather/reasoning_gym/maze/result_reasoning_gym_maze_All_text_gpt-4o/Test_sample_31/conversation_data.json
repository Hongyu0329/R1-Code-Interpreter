    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'w' to the goal 'Z' on a grid, where 'U' represents a wall that cannot be passed through, and 'B' represents a passage that can be traversed. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('w') is located at position (3, 2).\n   - Goal ('Z') is located at position (4, 3).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is a 6x6 matrix.\n   - 'U' cells are walls and cannot be traversed.\n   - 'B' cells are passages and can be traversed.\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move does not lead to a wall or go out of bounds.\n\n4. **Pathfinding Strategy:**\n   - We will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - BFS explores all possible moves level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\n5. **BFS Implementation:**\n   - Start from the initial position (3, 2).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore, starting with the initial position.\n   - Keep a set of visited positions to avoid revisiting.\n   - For each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a move leads to the goal position (4, 3), record the number of steps taken and terminate the search.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Pathfinding:**\n   - Start at (3, 2).\n   - From (3, 2), the possible moves are:\n     - Down to (4, 2) [valid move, 'B']\n     - Right to (3, 3) [valid move, 'B']\n   - Move to (3, 3) (1 step).\n   - From (3, 3), the possible moves are:\n     - Down to (4, 3) [valid move, 'Z']\n   - Move to (4, 3) (2 steps).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The shortest path from 'w' to 'Z' is found in 2 steps.\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
