    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'b' to the goal '<' on the given grid. The grid consists of walls ('^') and passages (':'). We can only move through the passages, and we need to find the shortest path in terms of the number of steps.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('b') is located at (4, 5).\n   - Goal ('<') is located at (8, 1).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages (':').\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - We need to find a path from (4, 5) to (8, 1) using the passages.\n   - We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to ensure we find the shortest path.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Steps:**\n   - Start from the initial position (4, 5).\n   - Explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - Add each valid move to a queue, marking it as visited to avoid revisiting.\n   - Continue this process until we reach the goal position (8, 1).\n\n5. **Execute the BFS:**\n   - From (4, 5), move to (4, 6).\n   - From (4, 6), move to (4, 7).\n   - From (4, 7), move to (4, 8).\n   - From (4, 8), move to (5, 8).\n   - From (5, 8), move to (6, 8).\n   - From (6, 8), move to (7, 8).\n   - From (7, 8), move to (7, 7).\n   - From (7, 7), move to (7, 6).\n   - From (7, 6), move to (7, 5).\n   - From (7, 5), move to (7, 4).\n   - From (7, 4), move to (7, 3).\n   - From (7, 3), move to (7, 2).\n   - From (7, 2), move to (8, 2).\n   - From (8, 2), move to (8, 1).\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path from (4, 5) to (8, 1) consists of 13 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<13>>>"
