    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'b' to the goal 'Z' through the passages represented by '|'. The walls represented by 'q' cannot be passed through. We will analyze the grid step by step to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('b') is located at position (2, 5).\n   - Goal ('Z') is located at position (1, 1).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is 7 rows by 7 columns.\n   - Walls ('q') are impassable.\n   - Passages ('|') are the only traversable paths.\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move is within bounds and not into a wall.\n\n4. **Pathfinding Strategy:**\n   - Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from 'b' to 'Z'. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found first.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Pathfinding:**\n   - Start at (2, 5).\n   - Explore all possible moves from the current position.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n   - Continue exploring until the goal (1, 1) is reached.\n\n6. **Detailed Path Exploration:**\n   - From (2, 5), move left to (2, 4).\n   - From (2, 4), move left to (2, 3).\n   - From (2, 3), move up to (1, 3).\n   - From (1, 3), move left to (1, 2).\n   - From (1, 2), move left to (1, 1) which is the goal.\n\n7. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path taken is: (2, 5) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1).\n   - This path consists of 5 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'Z' from the start 'b' is 5.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<5>>>"
