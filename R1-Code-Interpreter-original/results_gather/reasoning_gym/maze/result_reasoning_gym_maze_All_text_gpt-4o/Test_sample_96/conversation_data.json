    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '$' to the goal 'K' on the given grid. The grid is surrounded by walls ('u'), and we can only move through passages ('P'). We will analyze the grid step by step to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal:**\n   - Start ('$') is located at position (1, 1).\n   - Goal ('K') is located at position (4, 3).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - Walls ('u') are impassable.\n   - Passages ('P') are the only traversable paths.\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n\n4. **Pathfinding Strategy:**\n   - Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from '$' to 'K'.\n   - BFS is suitable because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found first.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Pathfinding:**\n   - Start at (1, 1).\n   - From (1, 1), the only possible move is down to (2, 1).\n   - From (2, 1), move right to (2, 2).\n   - From (2, 2), move right to (2, 3).\n   - From (2, 3), move down to (3, 3).\n   - From (3, 3), move down to (4, 3) where 'K' is located.\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - (1, 1) to (2, 1): 1 step\n   - (2, 1) to (2, 2): 1 step\n   - (2, 2) to (2, 3): 1 step\n   - (2, 3) to (3, 3): 1 step\n   - (3, 3) to (4, 3): 1 step\n\n7. **Total Steps:**\n   - The total number of steps from '$' to 'K' is 5.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
