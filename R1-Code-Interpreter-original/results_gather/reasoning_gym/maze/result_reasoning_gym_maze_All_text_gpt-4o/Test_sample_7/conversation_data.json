    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point 'N' to the goal '3' in the given grid. The grid is surrounded by walls ('q'), and we can only move through passages ('x'). We will use a step-by-step approach to determine the minimum number of steps required.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal:**\n   - Start: 'N' is located at (1, 2).\n   - Goal: '3' is located at (3, 5).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We cannot move through walls ('q').\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 9x9 matrix with walls on the outer edges and some internal walls.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will explore all possible paths level by level, starting from 'N'.\n\n5. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from (1, 2) with 0 steps.\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the number of steps taken.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting.\n\n6. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each position, explore all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).\n   - Check if the new position is within bounds and is a passage ('x').\n   - If the new position is the goal '3', return the number of steps taken.\n   - If not, add the new position to the queue and mark it as visited.\n\n7. **Perform BFS:**\n   - Start from (1, 2):\n     - Move to (1, 3), (2, 2).\n   - From (1, 3):\n     - Move to (1, 4), (2, 3).\n   - From (2, 2):\n     - Move to (3, 2).\n   - Continue this process, exploring all possible paths.\n   - Eventually, reach (3, 5) from (3, 4).\n\n8. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The shortest path from 'N' to '3' is found by counting the steps taken in the BFS process.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal '3' from the start 'N' is determined.\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal is: <<<7>>>."
