    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'y' to the goal '[' in the given grid, while avoiding walls ('%') and only moving through passages ('S'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('y') is located at (1, 4) in the grid.\n   - Goal ('[') is located at (5, 2) in the grid.\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We cannot move through walls ('%').\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will explore all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\n4. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from the position (1, 4).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore, starting with the initial position.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting.\n\n5. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n   - Check if the move is within bounds and not a wall.\n   - If a move reaches the goal, record the number of steps taken.\n   - If a move is valid and not visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n\n6. **Continue Until Goal is Reached:**\n   - Continue exploring until the goal is reached.\n   - The first time the goal is reached, the number of steps taken is the minimum.\n\n7. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - Follow the BFS process to determine the shortest path from 'y' to '['.\n\nLet's outline the path:\n\n- Start at (1, 4).\n- Move to (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), and finally to (5, 2).\n\nThe path is: (1, 4) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 2).\n\n8. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The number of steps taken is 8.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<8>>>"
