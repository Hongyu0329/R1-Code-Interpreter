    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'T' to the goal 'W' on the grid, moving only through passages ('-') and avoiding walls ('V'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('T') is located at (4, 3).\n   - Goal ('W') is located at (1, 3).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We cannot move through walls ('V').\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid with Coordinates:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) V V V V V V V\n   (1,0) V - - W - - V\n   (2,0) V - V - - - V\n   (3,0) V - - V - V V\n   (4,0) V V - T - - V\n   (5,0) V - V - - - V\n   (6,0) V V V V V V V\n   ```\n\n4. **Explore Possible Paths:**\n   - From (4, 3), we can move to (4, 2) or (4, 4).\n   - From (4, 2), we can move to (3, 2).\n   - From (4, 4), we can move to (3, 4).\n   - Continue exploring each path, ensuring we do not revisit any position.\n\n5. **Find the Shortest Path:**\n   - Starting at (4, 3), move to (4, 4).\n   - From (4, 4), move to (3, 4).\n   - From (3, 4), move to (2, 4).\n   - From (2, 4), move to (2, 3).\n   - From (2, 3), move to (1, 3) where 'W' is located.\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - (4, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 3)\n   - Total steps = 5\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal 'W' from 'T' is 5.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<5>>>"
