    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'b' to the goal 'g' on the given grid. The grid is represented as follows:\n\n```\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\"W\"WbW\"\"\n\"WWWW\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\"WW\"\"\n\"WW\"W\"W\"\n\"\"\"\"Wg\"\"\n\"WWWWWW\"\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n```\n\nLegend:\n- '\"' = Wall (impassable)\n- 'W' = Passage (passable)\n\nThe task is to find the minimum number of steps required to reach 'g' from 'b'. We will use a step-by-step approach to analyze the possible paths:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('b') is located at (1, 3).\n   - Goal ('g') is located at (5, 5).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is 8 rows by 8 columns.\n   - Walls ('\"') are impassable, so we can only move through passages ('W').\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move is within bounds and not into a wall.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will explore all possible paths level by level, ensuring we find the shortest path.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Path Exploration:**\n   - Start at (1, 3).\n   - Explore all possible moves from the current position.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n   - Continue exploring until the goal (5, 5) is reached.\n\n6. **Path Exploration:**\n   - From (1, 3), possible moves are to (1, 2) and (1, 4).\n   - From (1, 2), move to (0, 2) or (2, 2).\n   - From (1, 4), move to (0, 4) or (2, 4).\n   - Continue this process, exploring all possible paths.\n\n7. **Reaching the Goal:**\n   - After exploring the grid, the shortest path from 'b' to 'g' is found to be:\n     - (1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 5)\n   - This path consists of 8 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal is 8.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<8>>>"
