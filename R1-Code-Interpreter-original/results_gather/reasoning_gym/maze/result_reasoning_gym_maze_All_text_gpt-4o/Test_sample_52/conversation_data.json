    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '4' to the goal '!' on a grid, avoiding walls ('~') and moving through passages ('A'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path, which is essentially a breadth-first search (BFS) in this context.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('4') is located at (5, 6).\n   - Goal ('!') is located at (7, 1).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is a 10x10 matrix.\n   - Walls ('~') are impassable.\n   - Passages ('A') are passable.\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move stays within the grid and does not hit a wall.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Use a queue to explore each position starting from the start position.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting and looping.\n   - For each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a move leads to the goal, record the number of steps taken.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Exploration:**\n   - Start at (5, 6) with 0 steps.\n   - Explore all possible moves from (5, 6):\n     - Move to (5, 5), (5, 7), (4, 6), (6, 6) if they are passages.\n   - Continue exploring from each new position, incrementing the step count.\n   - Avoid revisiting positions and hitting walls.\n   - Continue this process until reaching the goal at (7, 1).\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS approach, ensure that the first time the goal is reached, it is done in the minimum number of steps.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start is determined.\n\nThe final answer, representing the minimum number of steps, is:\n\n<<<14>>>"
