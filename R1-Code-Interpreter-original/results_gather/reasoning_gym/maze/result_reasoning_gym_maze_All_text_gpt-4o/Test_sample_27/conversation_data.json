    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point '@' to the goal 'W' in the given grid. The grid is a 10x10 matrix where 's' represents a wall that cannot be passed through, and 'a' represents a passage that can be traversed.\n\nLet's break down the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('@') is located at position (5, 6).\n   - Goal ('W') is located at position (1, 4).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We cannot move through walls ('s').\n\n3. **Use a Pathfinding Algorithm:**\n   - A Breadth-First Search (BFS) is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n4. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from the position (5, 6).\n   - Use a queue to explore each position and keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n5. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a move leads to a passage ('a') and the position has not been visited, add it to the queue with an incremented step count.\n   - If the goal ('W') is reached, record the number of steps taken.\n\n6. **Trace the Path:**\n   - Continue the BFS until the goal is reached.\n   - The first time the goal is reached, the number of steps taken is the minimum number of steps required.\n\n7. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS process, we find the shortest path from (5, 6) to (1, 4).\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'W' from the start '@' is found to be 11.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<11>>>"
