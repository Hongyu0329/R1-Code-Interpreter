    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'N' to the goal 'p' on the given grid. The grid is composed of walls ('L') and passages ('X'). We can only move through the passages, and we need to find the shortest path from 'N' to 'p'. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('N') is located at position (4, 6).\n   - Goal ('p') is located at position (5, 2).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages ('X').\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid with Coordinates:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (0,7)\n   (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7)\n   (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7)\n   (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7)\n   (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7)\n   (5,0) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7)\n   (6,0) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7)\n   (7,0) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7)\n   ```\n\n4. **Trace the Path:**\n   - Start at (4, 6) 'N'.\n   - Move left to (4, 5).\n   - Move left to (4, 4).\n   - Move up to (3, 4).\n   - Move up to (2, 4).\n   - Move left to (2, 3).\n   - Move left to (2, 2).\n   - Move down to (3, 2).\n   - Move down to (4, 2).\n   - Move down to (5, 2) 'p'.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - Total steps taken: 9.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start is 9.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<9>>>"
