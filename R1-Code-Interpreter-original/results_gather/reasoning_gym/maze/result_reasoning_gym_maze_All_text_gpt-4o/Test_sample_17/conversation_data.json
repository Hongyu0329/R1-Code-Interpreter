    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'Q' to the goal 'e' in the given grid, while avoiding walls ('8') and moving through passages ('I'). We will analyze the grid step by step to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('Q') is located at position (2, 1).\n   - Goal ('e') is located at position (5, 3).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is surrounded by walls ('8'), so we cannot move outside the grid.\n   - We can only move through passages ('I').\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We cannot move through walls ('8').\n\n4. **Pathfinding Strategy:**\n   - Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path.\n   - BFS is suitable because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found first.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Pathfinding:**\n   - Start at (2, 1) and explore all possible moves.\n   - From (2, 1), the possible move is to (3, 1).\n   - From (3, 1), the possible moves are to (3, 2) and (4, 1).\n   - From (3, 2), the possible move is to (3, 3).\n   - From (4, 1), the possible move is to (4, 2).\n   - From (3, 3), the possible move is to (4, 3).\n   - From (4, 2), the possible move is to (5, 2).\n   - From (4, 3), the possible move is to (5, 3), which is the goal.\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - The path from 'Q' to 'e' is: (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (5, 3).\n   - This path consists of 5 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
