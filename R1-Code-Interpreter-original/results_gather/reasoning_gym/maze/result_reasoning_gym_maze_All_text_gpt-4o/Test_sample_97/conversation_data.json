    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'y' to the goal '5' on the given grid. The grid consists of walls ('.') and passages ('%'). We can only move through the passages, and we need to find the shortest path in terms of steps.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('y') is located at position (6, 4).\n   - Goal ('5') is located at position (2, 3).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages ('%').\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid with Coordinates:**\n   ```\n   (0,0)........\n   (1,0).%.%%%%.\n   (2,0).%%5%%..\n   (3,0).%%%.%%.\n   (4,0).%%%%%%.\n   (5,0).%%%.%%.\n   (6,0).%..y%%.\n   (7,0)........\n   ```\n\n4. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Start at (6, 4).\n   - Move up to (5, 4).\n   - Move up to (4, 4).\n   - Move left to (4, 3).\n   - Move up to (3, 3).\n   - Move up to (2, 3) where the goal '5' is located.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - From (6, 4) to (5, 4): 1 step\n   - From (5, 4) to (4, 4): 1 step\n   - From (4, 4) to (4, 3): 1 step\n   - From (4, 3) to (3, 3): 1 step\n   - From (3, 3) to (2, 3): 1 step\n\n6. **Calculate the Total Steps:**\n   - Total steps = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 steps\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is 5.\n\nFinal answer: <<<5>>>"
