    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '3' to the goal 'z' on a grid, where '>' represents walls that cannot be passed through, and 'e' represents passages that can be traversed. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - The start position '3' is located at (5, 6).\n   - The goal position 'z' is located at (5, 3).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is a 9x9 matrix.\n   - We can only move through 'e' (passages) and cannot move through '>' (walls).\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move stays within the grid and lands on an 'e'.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will use a queue to explore each position and track the number of steps taken to reach it.\n\n5. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from (5, 6) with 0 steps.\n   - Use a queue to store positions and steps: `queue = [(5, 6, 0)]`.\n   - Use a set to track visited positions to avoid revisiting: `visited = {(5, 6)}`.\n\n6. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the first element from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the goal (5, 3). If yes, return the number of steps.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each valid move (within bounds, not a wall, and not visited), enqueue the new position with incremented steps and mark it as visited.\n\n7. **Continue Until Goal is Found:**\n   - Repeat the BFS process until the goal is reached.\n   - The first time the goal is reached, the number of steps taken is the minimum number of steps required.\n\n8. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS process, we find the shortest path from '3' to 'z'.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'z' from the start '3' is determined.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
