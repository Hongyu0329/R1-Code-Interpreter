    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the start point '/' to the goal 'C' in the given grid. The grid is surrounded by walls ('$'), and we can only move through passages ('r'). We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path, as it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time we reach the goal, it is via the shortest path.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal:**\n   - Start: '/' is located at (3, 2).\n   - Goal: 'C' is located at (6, 4).\n\n2. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move is within bounds and not into a wall ('$').\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Steps:**\n   - Initialize a queue with the start position (3, 2) and a step count of 0.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n     - Dequeue the front position and its associated step count.\n     - If the current position is the goal (6, 4), return the step count as the answer.\n     - Otherwise, explore all valid neighboring positions (up, down, left, right) that are passages ('r') and not yet visited.\n     - Add these positions to the queue with an incremented step count and mark them as visited.\n\n4. **Detailed Path Exploration:**\n   - Start at (3, 2), step count = 0.\n   - From (3, 2), possible moves are to (3, 3) and (4, 2).\n   - Continue exploring from these positions, incrementing the step count each time a new position is reached.\n   - Follow the BFS approach to explore all possible paths until reaching the goal at (6, 4).\n\n5. **Path to Goal:**\n   - The shortest path found using BFS is as follows:\n     - (3, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (6, 4)\n   - This path takes 5 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'C' from the start '/' is 5.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<5>>>"
