    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '`' to the goal 'W' in the given grid. The grid is composed of walls ('f') and passages ('B'). We can only move through the passages, and we need to find the shortest path from the start to the goal.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal:**\n   - Start ('`') is located at position (4, 1).\n   - Goal ('W') is located at position (1, 3).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages ('B').\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid with Coordinates:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) f f f f f f f\n   (1,0) f B B W B f f\n   (2,0) f B B f f B f\n   (3,0) f B B B f B f\n   (4,0) f ` B f B f f\n   (5,0) f B f B f B f\n   (6,0) f f f f f f f\n   ```\n\n4. **Find the Path:**\n   - Start at (4, 1).\n   - Move to (4, 2).\n   - Move to (3, 2).\n   - Move to (3, 1).\n   - Move to (2, 1).\n   - Move to (1, 1).\n   - Move to (1, 2).\n   - Move to (1, 3) where the goal 'W' is located.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - From (4, 1) to (4, 2): 1 step\n   - From (4, 2) to (3, 2): 1 step\n   - From (3, 2) to (3, 1): 1 step\n   - From (3, 1) to (2, 1): 1 step\n   - From (2, 1) to (1, 1): 1 step\n   - From (1, 1) to (1, 2): 1 step\n   - From (1, 2) to (1, 3): 1 step\n\n   Total steps = 7\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal is 7.\n\nFinal answer: <<<7>>>"
