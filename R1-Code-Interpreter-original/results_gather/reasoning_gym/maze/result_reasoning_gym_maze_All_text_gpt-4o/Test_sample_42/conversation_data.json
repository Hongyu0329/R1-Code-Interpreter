    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'e' to the goal 'E' on the given grid, moving only through the passages ('$') and avoiding the walls (';'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('e') is located at position (8, 7).\n   - Goal ('E') is located at position (4, 2).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through '$' cells.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will use a queue to explore each position and keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n4. **Initialize the BFS:**\n   - Start from (8, 7) with 0 steps.\n   - Use a queue to store positions and steps: `queue = [(8, 7, 0)]`.\n   - Use a set to track visited positions to avoid revisiting: `visited = {(8, 7)}`.\n\n5. **Perform BFS:**\n   - Dequeue the first element from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the goal (4, 2). If yes, return the number of steps.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, is a passage ('$'), and has not been visited.\n   - If valid, add the new position to the queue with incremented steps and mark it as visited.\n\n6. **Continue Until Goal is Found:**\n   - Repeat the process until the queue is empty or the goal is reached.\n\n7. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS, we ensure that the first time we reach the goal, it is with the minimum number of steps.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the minimum number of steps required to reach 'E' from 'e' is found to be 14.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<14>>>"
