    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'I' to the goal '/' in the given grid. The grid is represented as follows:\n\n```\niiiiii\ni/iUUi\niUUiii\niUUUIi\niUUiUi\niiiiii\n```\n\nLegend:\n- 'i' = Wall (impassable)\n- 'U' = Passage (passable)\n- 'I' = Start\n- '/' = Goal\n\nThe task is to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal:**\n   - Start ('I') is at position (1, 1).\n   - Goal ('/') is at position (1, 2).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through 'U' (passage) or directly to the goal ('/').\n\n3. **Initial Observation:**\n   - The start is immediately adjacent to the goal. Therefore, we can move directly from the start to the goal.\n\n4. **Calculate the Steps:**\n   - From (1, 1) to (1, 2), it is a direct move to the right.\n   - This move constitutes 1 step.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the start is directly next to the goal, the minimum number of steps required is 1.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
