    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '!' to the goal 'w' through the passages marked as 'R'. The walls marked as 'y' are impassable. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('!') is at position (4, 2).\n   - Goal ('w') is at position (7, 4).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is a 9x9 matrix.\n   - We can only move through 'R' cells.\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - From the start at (4, 2), we need to find a path to (7, 4) using the shortest number of steps.\n   - We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Steps:**\n   - Start from (4, 2).\n   - Explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - Ensure that moves are within bounds and only to 'R' cells.\n   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid cycles.\n   - Count the number of steps taken to reach each cell.\n   - Stop when the goal (7, 4) is reached.\n\n5. **Execute the BFS:**\n   - Start at (4, 2).\n   - Move to (4, 3) [1 step].\n   - Move to (4, 4) [2 steps].\n   - Move to (3, 4) [3 steps].\n   - Move to (2, 4) [4 steps].\n   - Move to (1, 4) [5 steps].\n   - Move to (1, 5) [6 steps].\n   - Move to (2, 5) [7 steps].\n   - Move to (3, 5) [8 steps].\n   - Move to (4, 5) [9 steps].\n   - Move to (5, 5) [10 steps].\n   - Move to (6, 5) [11 steps].\n   - Move to (7, 5) [12 steps].\n   - Move to (7, 4) [13 steps].\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'w' from the start '!' is 13.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<13>>>"
