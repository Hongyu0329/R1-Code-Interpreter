    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate through the grid from the starting point 'L' to the goal '6', moving only through the passages marked as 'S'. The grid is surrounded by walls marked as 'o', which cannot be traversed. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('L') is located at (5, 3).\n   - Goal ('6') is located at (6, 7).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement Constraints:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through 'S' cells.\n   - We cannot move diagonally or through 'o' cells.\n\n3. **Visualize the Path:**\n   - We need to find a path from (5, 3) to (6, 7) using the shortest number of steps.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will explore all possible moves from the start position, marking each cell with the number of steps taken to reach it.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Path Exploration:**\n   - Start at (5, 3) and mark it as step 0.\n   - From (5, 3), explore adjacent 'S' cells: (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 4), and (6, 3).\n   - Continue exploring from each new position, marking the number of steps taken to reach each cell.\n   - Avoid revisiting cells to prevent loops.\n\n6. **Path Exploration:**\n   - From (5, 3) to (5, 4) to (5, 5) to (5, 6) to (6, 6) to (6, 7).\n   - This path takes 5 steps.\n\n7. **Verify the Path:**\n   - Ensure that each move is valid and that the path is indeed the shortest.\n\n8. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path from 'L' to '6' takes 5 steps.\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
