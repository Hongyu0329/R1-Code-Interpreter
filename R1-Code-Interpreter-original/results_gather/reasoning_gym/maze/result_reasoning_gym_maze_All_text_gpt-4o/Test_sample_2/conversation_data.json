    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position '-' to the goal '3' in the given grid, while avoiding walls ('&') and only moving through passages ('J'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('-') is located at position (3, 7).\n   - Goal ('3') is located at position (1, 1).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We can only move through 'J' and not through '&'.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will use a queue to explore each position and keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n4. **Initialize the BFS:**\n   - Start from (3, 7) with 0 steps.\n   - Use a queue to store positions and steps: `queue = [(3, 7, 0)]`.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting: `visited = {(3, 7)}`.\n\n5. **Perform BFS:**\n   - Dequeue the first element from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the goal (1, 1). If yes, return the number of steps.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, not a wall ('&'), and not visited.\n   - If valid, add the new position to the queue with incremented steps and mark it as visited.\n\n6. **Continue Until Goal is Found:**\n   - Repeat the BFS process until the goal is reached.\n   - The first time we reach the goal, we will have found the shortest path due to the nature of BFS.\n\n7. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS process, we find that the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal from the start is 10.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<10>>>"
