    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '}' to the goal 'J' in the given grid, while avoiding walls ('\"') and only moving through passages ('+'). We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path, as BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('}') is located at position (5, 3).\n   - Goal ('J') is located at position (3, 5).\n\n2. **Define Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, as long as you stay within the grid and do not move into a wall ('\"').\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Initialization:**\n   - Initialize a queue with the starting position (5, 3) and a step count of 0.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and step count.\n   - Check if the current position is the goal (3, 5). If it is, return the step count.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all valid neighboring positions (up, down, left, right) that are passages ('+') and have not been visited yet, with an incremented step count.\n   - Mark the current position as visited.\n\n5. **Continue Until Goal is Reached:**\n   - Repeat the BFS process until the goal is reached, ensuring that each position is only visited once to prevent infinite loops.\n\n6. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - The BFS will naturally find the shortest path due to its level-order traversal, so the first time we reach the goal, we will have the minimum number of steps.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the grid:\n\n- Start at (5, 3).\n- From (5, 3), possible moves are to (4, 3) and (5, 4).\n- Continue exploring each level of the BFS until reaching (3, 5).\n\nBy following the BFS process, we find that the minimum number of steps required to reach 'J' from '}' is 6.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
