    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point 'm' to the goal '^' in the given grid. The grid consists of walls ('a') and passages ('.'). We can only move through the passages, and we can move up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal:**\n   - Start ('m') is located at (3, 1).\n   - Goal ('^') is located at (7, 1).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - We cannot move through walls ('a').\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - We need to find a path from (3, 1) to (7, 1) using the passages ('.').\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will explore all possible moves from the start position and keep track of the number of steps taken.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Path Exploration:**\n   - Start at (3, 1).\n   - From (3, 1), move down to (4, 1).\n   - From (4, 1), move down to (5, 1).\n   - From (5, 1), move down to (6, 1).\n   - From (6, 1), move down to (7, 1), which is the goal.\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path is: (3, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (5, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (7, 1).\n   - This path consists of 4 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is 4.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<4>>>"
