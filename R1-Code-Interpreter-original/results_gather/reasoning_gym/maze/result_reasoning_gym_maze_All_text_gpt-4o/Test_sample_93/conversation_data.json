    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position '/' to the goal 'C' in the given grid. The grid is composed of walls ('v') and passages ('s'). We can only move through the passages, and we need to find the shortest path in terms of steps.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('/') is located at the bottom row, last column (7, 7).\n   - Goal ('C') is located at row 6, column 3 (6, 3).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages ('s').\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Starting from (7, 7), we need to find a path to (6, 3) using the passages.\n\n4. **Pathfinding Strategy:**\n   - We can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Pathfinding:**\n   - Start at (7, 7).\n   - Move left to (7, 6).\n   - Move left to (7, 5).\n   - Move up to (6, 5).\n   - Move left to (6, 4).\n   - Move left to (6, 3) where 'C' is located.\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - From (7, 7) to (7, 6): 1 step\n   - From (7, 6) to (7, 5): 1 step\n   - From (7, 5) to (6, 5): 1 step\n   - From (6, 5) to (6, 4): 1 step\n   - From (6, 4) to (6, 3): 1 step\n\n7. **Total Steps:**\n   - Total steps = 5\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal 'C' from the start '/' is 5.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<5>>>"
