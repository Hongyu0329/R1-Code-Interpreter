    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'l' to the goal 'q' on the given grid. The grid is represented as follows:\n\n```\nuuuuuuu\nunnnuuu\nuqunnlu\nuunnuuu\nununnnu\nunnnnnu\nuuuuuuu\n```\n\nLegend:\n- 'u' = Wall (cannot pass through)\n- 'n' = Passage (can pass through)\n- 'l' = Start\n- 'q' = Goal\n\nThe task is to find the minimum number of steps required to reach 'q' from 'l'. We will analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('l') is located at position (2, 6).\n   - Goal ('q') is located at position (2, 1).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through passages ('n').\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - From the start position (2, 6), we need to find a path to the goal (2, 1) using the passages.\n\n4. **Pathfinding:**\n   - Start at (2, 6).\n   - Move left to (2, 5).\n   - Move left to (2, 4).\n   - Move up to (1, 4).\n   - Move left to (1, 3).\n   - Move left to (1, 2).\n   - Move down to (2, 2).\n   - Move left to (2, 1) where the goal 'q' is located.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path taken is: (2, 6) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 4) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 1).\n   - This path consists of 7 steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal 'q' from the start 'l' is 7.\n\nFinal answer: <<<7>>>"
