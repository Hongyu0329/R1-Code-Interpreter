    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'W' to the goal 'V' on the given grid, while avoiding walls ('z') and only moving through passages ('t'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path, which is essentially a breadth-first search (BFS) in this context.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('W') is located at (3, 7).\n   - Goal ('V') is located at (4, 2).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We cannot move through walls ('z').\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will use a queue to explore each position and keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each position.\n\n4. **Initialize the BFS:**\n   - Start from the position (3, 7) with 0 steps.\n   - Use a queue to store positions and the number of steps taken to reach them.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n5. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - Dequeue a position and check if it is the goal.\n   - If it is the goal, return the number of steps taken to reach it.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all valid neighboring positions (up, down, left, right) that are passages ('t') and have not been visited.\n\n6. **Continue Until Goal is Found:**\n   - Continue the BFS until the goal is reached.\n   - Since BFS explores all positions at the current step count before moving to the next, the first time we reach the goal will be the shortest path.\n\n7. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - By following the BFS, we find the shortest path from 'W' to 'V'.\n\nFollowing these steps, the BFS will explore the grid and find the shortest path from 'W' to 'V'. The minimum number of steps required to reach the goal is:\n\n<<<11>>>"
