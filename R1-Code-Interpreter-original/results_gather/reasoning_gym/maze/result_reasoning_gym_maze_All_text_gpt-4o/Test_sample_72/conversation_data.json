    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position '~' to the goal 't' in the given grid, while avoiding walls ('2') and moving through passages ('p'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('~') is located at position (2, 1).\n   - Goal ('t') is located at position (2, 5).\n\n2. **Understand the Grid Layout:**\n   - The grid is surrounded by walls ('2'), and we can only move through passages ('p').\n   - We can move in four possible directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\n3. **Visualize the Path:**\n   - Starting from (2, 1), we need to find a path to (2, 5) using the passages.\n\n4. **Explore Possible Moves:**\n   - From (2, 1), the possible moves are:\n     - Down to (3, 1)\n     - Right to (2, 2)\n   - From (2, 2), the possible moves are:\n     - Left to (2, 1) (backtracking, not optimal)\n     - Right to (2, 3)\n   - From (2, 3), the possible moves are:\n     - Left to (2, 2) (backtracking, not optimal)\n     - Right to (2, 4)\n   - From (2, 4), the possible moves are:\n     - Left to (2, 3) (backtracking, not optimal)\n     - Right to (2, 5) (goal)\n\n5. **Calculate the Minimum Steps:**\n   - The path from start to goal is: (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5).\n   - This path consists of 4 steps.\n\n6. **Verify the Path:**\n   - Ensure that each move is valid and does not pass through walls.\n   - The path is valid as it only moves through passages.\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal is 4.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<4>>>"
