    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position '-' to the goal position '<' in the given grid. The grid is represented as follows:\n\n```\nZZZZZZZ\nZ-ZZ\\\\Z\nZ\\\\ZZ\\Z\nZ\\\\\\Z\\Z\nZ\\\\\\\\<Z\nZ\\\\\\Z\\Z\nZZZZZZZ\n```\n\nLegend:\n- 'Z' = Wall (cannot pass through)\n- '\\' = Passage (can pass through)\n- '-' = Start position\n- '<' = Goal position\n\nWe need to find the shortest path from '-' to '<' using the passages ('\\') and avoiding the walls ('Z').\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('-') is at position (1, 1).\n   - Goal ('<') is at position (4, 5).\n\n2. **Possible Moves:**\n   - From any position, you can move up, down, left, or right, provided the move is within bounds and not into a wall ('Z').\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - We will use a queue to explore each position level by level.\n\n4. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from (1, 1) with 0 steps.\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore and the number of steps taken to reach them.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting.\n\n5. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From (1, 1), the possible moves are:\n     - Right to (1, 2) (valid move, passage '\\')\n   - From (1, 2), the possible moves are:\n     - Down to (2, 2) (valid move, passage '\\')\n   - From (2, 2), the possible moves are:\n     - Down to (3, 2) (valid move, passage '\\')\n   - From (3, 2), the possible moves are:\n     - Down to (4, 2) (valid move, passage '\\')\n   - From (4, 2), the possible moves are:\n     - Right to (4, 3) (valid move, passage '\\')\n   - From (4, 3), the possible moves are:\n     - Right to (4, 4) (valid move, passage '\\')\n   - From (4, 4), the possible moves are:\n     - Right to (4, 5) (goal position '<')\n\n6. **Count the Steps:**\n   - The path taken is: (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 5)\n   - Total steps = 7\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps to reach the goal is 7.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<7>>>"
