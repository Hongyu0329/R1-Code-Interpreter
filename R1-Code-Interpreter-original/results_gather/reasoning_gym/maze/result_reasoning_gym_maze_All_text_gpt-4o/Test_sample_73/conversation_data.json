    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the start position '-' to the goal 'd' on the given grid. The grid is represented as follows:\n\n```\n.........\n.IIIIIII.\n.I.IdI.I.\n...I.III.\n.II.III..\n..-III.I.\n..II.III.\n.IIIIII..\n.........\n```\n\nLegend:\n- '.' = Wall (impassable)\n- 'I' = Passage (passable)\n- '-' = Start\n- 'd' = Goal\n\nThe start position '-' is located at (5, 2) and the goal 'd' is located at (2, 4).\n\nWe will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from the start to the goal. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it does so with the minimum number of steps.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start: (5, 2)\n   - Goal: (2, 4)\n\n2. **Initialize the BFS Queue:**\n   - Start from (5, 2) with 0 steps.\n   - Use a queue to keep track of positions to explore and the number of steps taken to reach them.\n\n3. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) to adjacent cells.\n   - Ensure that moves are only made to cells marked as 'I' (passages) and within the grid boundaries.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **Perform BFS:**\n   - Start from (5, 2) and explore adjacent positions.\n   - Move to (4, 2) and (5, 3) as they are passable.\n   - Continue exploring from each new position, marking them as visited.\n   - Repeat this process, expanding the search until the goal (2, 4) is reached.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - Each time a new position is added to the queue, increment the step count.\n   - When the goal is reached, the current step count will be the minimum number of steps required.\n\n6. **Reach the Goal:**\n   - After exploring the grid using BFS, the goal (2, 4) is reached in 8 steps.\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal 'd' from the start '-' is:\n\n<<<8>>>"
