    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point '`' to the goal 'i' on the given grid. The grid is surrounded by walls ('4'), and we can only move through passages ('A'). We will analyze the grid step by step to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal:**\n   - Start: '`' is located at (5, 5).\n   - Goal: 'i' is located at (1, 5).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right through passages ('A').\n\n3. **Trace the Path:**\n   - Start at (5, 5). The only possible move is up to (4, 5).\n   - From (4, 5), move up to (3, 5).\n   - From (3, 5), move up to (2, 5).\n   - From (2, 5), move up to (1, 5), which is the goal.\n\n4. **Count the Steps:**\n   - (5, 5) to (4, 5): 1 step\n   - (4, 5) to (3, 5): 1 step\n   - (3, 5) to (2, 5): 1 step\n   - (2, 5) to (1, 5): 1 step\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Steps:**\n   - Total steps = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal is 4.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<4>>>"
