    "To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point 'b' to the goal 'Q' on the given grid, while avoiding walls ('6') and only moving through passages ('y'). We will use a step-by-step approach to find the shortest path.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Goal Positions:**\n   - Start ('b') is at position (5, 4).\n   - Goal ('Q') is at position (5, 7).\n\n2. **Understand the Movement:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally.\n   - We cannot move through walls ('6').\n\n3. **Visualize the Grid:**\n   ```\n   6666666666\n   6yyyyyyyy6\n   66yyy66yy6\n   66yyyyy6y6\n   666yyyy6y6\n   6yy6b6yQy6\n   6y6yyyyyy6\n   6y666yyyy6\n   6yyy66yy66\n   6666666666\n   ```\n\n4. **Plan the Path:**\n   - From (5, 4), move right to (5, 5).\n   - From (5, 5), move right to (5, 6).\n   - From (5, 6), move right to (5, 7) where 'Q' is located.\n\n5. **Count the Steps:**\n   - (5, 4) to (5, 5): 1 step\n   - (5, 5) to (5, 6): 1 step\n   - (5, 6) to (5, 7): 1 step\n\n6. **Calculate the Total Steps:**\n   - Total steps = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the goal 'Q' from the start 'b' is 3.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<3>>>"
