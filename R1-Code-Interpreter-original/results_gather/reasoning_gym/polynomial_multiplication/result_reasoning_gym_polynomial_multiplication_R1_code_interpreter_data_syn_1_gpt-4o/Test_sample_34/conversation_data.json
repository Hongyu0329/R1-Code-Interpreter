    "To solve the expression \\((92 - 94*x)*(31*x + 59)*(-32*x**3 - 64*x + 72)\\), we need to expand and simplify it. The expression is a product of three polynomials, and we will expand it step by step.\n\n1. **First Step**: Expand the first two polynomials \\((92 - 94*x)\\) and \\((31*x + 59)\\).\n\n2. **Second Step**: Multiply the result from the first step with the third polynomial \\((-32*x**3 - 64*x + 72)\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 92 - 94*x\npoly2 = 31*x + 59\npoly3 = -32*x**3 - 64*x + 72\n\n# Expand the first two polynomials\nexpanded_first_two = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Expand the result with the third polynomial\nfinal_expansion = expand(expanded_first_two * poly3)\n\n# Print the final expanded polynomial\nprint(final_expansion)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the given expression and provide the simplified polynomial. Let's execute it to find the result.",
