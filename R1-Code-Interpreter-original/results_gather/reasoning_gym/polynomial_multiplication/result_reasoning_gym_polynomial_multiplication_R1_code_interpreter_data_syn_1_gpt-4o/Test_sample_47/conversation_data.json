    "To solve the given expression, we need to multiply the three polynomial expressions:\n\n1. \\((-112*x**3 - x**2)\\)\n2. \\((-93*x**3 - 77*x - 45)\\)\n3. \\((35*x**3 - 35*x**2 - 15*x)\\)\n\nThe multiplication of these polynomials will result in a new polynomial. The degree of the resulting polynomial will be the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. Let's calculate the degree of each polynomial:\n\n- The first polynomial \\((-112*x**3 - x**2)\\) has a degree of 3.\n- The second polynomial \\((-93*x**3 - 77*x - 45)\\) has a degree of 3.\n- The third polynomial \\((35*x**3 - 35*x**2 - 15*x)\\) has a degree of 3.\n\nThe resulting polynomial will have a degree of \\(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\\).\n\nTo find the coefficients of the resulting polynomial, we need to perform the multiplication step by step. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial with each term in the second polynomial, and then distributing the result with each term in the third polynomial.\n\nLet's perform this calculation using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = -112*x**3 - x**2\npoly2 = -93*x**3 - 77*x - 45\npoly3 = 35*x**3 - 35*x**2 - 15*x\n\n# Multiply the polynomials\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the expanded form of the polynomial resulting from the multiplication of the three given polynomials. Let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
