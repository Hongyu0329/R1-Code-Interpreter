    "To simplify the expression \\((49*z**2 - z)*(-78*z**2 - 94*z - 144)*(-164*z**3 - 32*z + 96)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves expanding the expression by multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, and then multiplying the resulting polynomial by the third polynomial.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Multiply the first two polynomials**: \n   - \\((49*z**2 - z)\\) and \\((-78*z**2 - 94*z - 144)\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the resulting polynomial by the third polynomial**:\n   - The result from step 1 and \\((-164*z**3 - 32*z + 96)\\).\n\nThis process can be quite complex due to the number of terms involved, so using a computational approach with Python will help ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these multiplications and simplify the expression.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 49*z**2 - z\npoly2 = -78*z**2 - 94*z - 144\npoly3 = -164*z**3 - 32*z + 96\n\n# Multiply the first two polynomials\nresult1 = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Multiply the result with the third polynomial\nfinal_result = expand(result1 * poly3)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nThis script will compute the expanded form of the given expression. Let's execute it to find the simplified expression.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the expanded and simplified form of the given expression. The expression has been expanded into a polynomial of degree 7 with the following terms:\n\n- \\(626808*z^7\\)\n- \\(742592*z^6\\)\n- \\(1264072*z^5\\)\n- \\(-245632*z^4\\)\n- \\(-211904*z^3\\)\n- \\(-672960*z^2\\)\n- \\(13824*z\\)\n\nThus, the simplified expression is:\n\n<<<626808*z**7 + 742592*z**6 + 1264072*z**5 - 245632*z**4 - 211904*z**3 - 672960*z**2 + 13824*z>>>"
