    "To simplify the expression \\((-137*x**3 + 36*x)*(-13*x**3 - 23*x**2 - 57*x - 52)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication process:\n\n1. Multiply each term in the first polynomial \\((-137*x**3 + 36*x)\\) by each term in the second polynomial \\((-13*x**3 - 23*x**2 - 57*x - 52)\\).\n\n2. Combine the results and simplify by combining like terms.\n\nTo perform this calculation efficiently, we can use Python to automate the distribution and combination of terms. Let's write a Python script to handle this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = -137*x**3 + 36*x\npoly2 = -13*x**3 - 23*x**2 - 57*x - 52\n\n# Perform the multiplication and simplify\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis script uses the `sympy` library to handle symbolic mathematics, which will allow us to expand and simplify the polynomial expression. Let's execute this code to find the simplified expression.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the simplified polynomial expression. The expression \\((-137*x**3 + 36*x)*(-13*x**3 - 23*x**2 - 57*x - 52)\\) simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 1781*x**6 + 3151*x**5 + 7341*x**4 + 6296*x**3 - 2052*x**2 - 1872*x \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1781*x**6 + 3151*x**5 + 7341*x**4 + 6296*x**3 - 2052*x**2 - 1872*x>>>"
