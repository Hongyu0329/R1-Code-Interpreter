    "To simplify the expression \\(-223*z**2*(84*z**3 - 54*z**2 - 80)\\), we need to distribute the \\(-223*z**2\\) term across the terms inside the parentheses. This involves multiplying \\(-223*z**2\\) by each term inside the parentheses separately.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n1. Multiply \\(-223*z**2\\) by \\(84*z**3\\):\n   \\[\n   -223*z**2*84*z**3 = -223*84*z**(2+3) = -223*84*z**5\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply \\(-223*z**2\\) by \\(-54*z**2\\):\n   \\[\n   -223*z**2*(-54*z**2) = 223*54*z**(2+2) = 223*54*z**4\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply \\(-223*z**2\\) by \\(-80\\):\n   \\[\n   -223*z**2*(-80) = 223*80*z**2\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute these products to get the simplified expression. We will use Python to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Define the coefficients\na = -223\nb1 = 84\nb2 = -54\nb3 = -80\n\n# Calculate each term\nterm1 = a * b1\nterm2 = a * b2\nterm3 = a * b3\n\n# Print the results\nprint(term1, term2, term3)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the coefficients for each term in the simplified expression.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the coefficients for each term in the simplified expression. Let's use these results to write the final simplified expression:\n\n1. The coefficient for \\(z**5\\) is \\(-18732\\).\n2. The coefficient for \\(z**4\\) is \\(12042\\).\n3. The coefficient for \\(z**2\\) is \\(17840\\).\n\nThus, the simplified expression is:\n\n\\[\n-18732*z**5 + 12042*z**4 + 17840*z**2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-18732*z**5 + 12042*z**4 + 17840*z**2>>>"
