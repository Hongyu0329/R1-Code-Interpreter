    "To solve the expression \\((-58*x**3 + 41*x)*(-25*x**3 - 50*x)*(54*x**3 - 93*x**2 + 49*x)\\), we need to expand the product of these three polynomials. This involves multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, and then multiplying the resulting polynomial by each term in the third polynomial.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **First Multiplication**: Multiply the first two polynomials:\n   \\((-58*x**3 + 41*x)\\) and \\((-25*x**3 - 50*x)\\).\n\n2. **Second Multiplication**: Multiply the result from the first multiplication by the third polynomial:\n   \\((54*x**3 - 93*x**2 + 49*x)\\).\n\nTo perform these multiplications, we will use Python to handle the polynomial expansion and simplification.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = -58*x**3 + 41*x\npoly2 = -25*x**3 - 50*x\npoly3 = 54*x**3 - 93*x**2 + 49*x\n\n# First multiplication\nresult1 = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Second multiplication\nfinal_result = expand(result1 * poly3)\n\n# Print the final expanded polynomial\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the given expression and simplify it to a single polynomial. Let's execute the code to find the final expanded form.",
