    "To solve the expression \\((114 - 88*y)*(89*y**2 - 57*y)\\), we need to expand it by multiplying each term in the first parenthesis by each term in the second parenthesis. This is a straightforward polynomial multiplication problem.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the terms**:\n   - The first expression is \\(114 - 88*y\\).\n   - The second expression is \\(89*y**2 - 57*y\\).\n\n2. **Multiply each term in the first expression by each term in the second expression**:\n   - \\(114 * 89*y**2\\)\n   - \\(114 * -57*y\\)\n   - \\(-88*y * 89*y**2\\)\n   - \\(-88*y * -57*y\\)\n\n3. **Simplify each multiplication**:\n   - \\(114 * 89*y**2 = 10146*y**2\\)\n   - \\(114 * -57*y = -6498*y\\)\n   - \\(-88*y * 89*y**2 = -7832*y**3\\)\n   - \\(-88*y * -57*y = 5016*y**2\\)\n\n4. **Combine like terms**:\n   - The terms are \\(-7832*y**3\\), \\(10146*y**2 + 5016*y**2\\), and \\(-6498*y\\).\n\n5. **Final expression**:\n   - Combine the like terms: \\(10146*y**2 + 5016*y**2 = 15162*y**2\\).\n   - The final expression is \\(-7832*y**3 + 15162*y**2 - 6498*y\\).\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to compute this expression for a given value of \\(y\\).\n\n```python\ndef calculate_expression(y):\n    term1 = 114 * 89 * y**2\n    term2 = 114 * -57 * y\n    term3 = -88 * y * 89 * y**2\n    term4 = -88 * y * -57 * y\n    \n    result = term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n    return result\n\n# Example calculation for y = 1\ny_value = 1\nresult = calculate_expression(y_value)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the expression for \\(y = 1\\). You can change the value of `y_value` to compute the expression for different values of \\(y\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the result of the expression for \\(y = 1\\) as 832. This confirms that the expression was expanded and calculated correctly.\n\nThe final expanded expression is:\n\\[\n-7832*y^3 + 15162*y^2 - 6498*y\n\\]\n\nFor \\(y = 1\\), the expression evaluates to 832.\n\n<<<832>>>"
