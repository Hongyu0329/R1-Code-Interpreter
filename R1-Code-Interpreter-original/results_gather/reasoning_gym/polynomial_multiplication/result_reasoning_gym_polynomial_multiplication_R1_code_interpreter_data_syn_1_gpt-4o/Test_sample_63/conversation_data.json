    "To simplify the expression \\((4*z**2 + 102)*(-64*z**3 + 78*z**2 + 24*z)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication step-by-step:\n\n1. Multiply each term in the first polynomial \\(4*z**2 + 102\\) by each term in the second polynomial \\(-64*z**3 + 78*z**2 + 24*z\\).\n\n2. Combine the results and simplify by combining like terms.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 4*z**2 + 102\npoly2 = -64*z**3 + 78*z**2 + 24*z\n\n# Perform the multiplication and simplify\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Print the simplified result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the simplified expression.",
