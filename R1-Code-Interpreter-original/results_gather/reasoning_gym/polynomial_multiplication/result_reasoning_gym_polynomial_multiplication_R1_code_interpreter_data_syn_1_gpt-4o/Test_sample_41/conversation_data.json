    "To simplify the expression \\((54*y**3 - 64*y)*(-3*y**3 - 129*y**2 - 76)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Distribute each term in the first polynomial**:\n   - Multiply \\(54*y**3\\) by each term in the second polynomial \\((-3*y**3 - 129*y**2 - 76)\\).\n   - Multiply \\(-64*y\\) by each term in the second polynomial \\((-3*y**3 - 129*y**2 - 76)\\).\n\n2. **Combine like terms**:\n   - After distributing, we will have several terms. We need to combine terms with the same power of \\(y\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 54*y**3 - 64*y\npoly2 = -3*y**3 - 129*y**2 - 76\n\n# Perform the multiplication and simplify\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the expanded form of the expression and combine like terms. Let's execute it to find the simplified expression.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the expanded and simplified form of the expression. The simplified expression is:\n\n\\[\n-162*y**6 - 6966*y**5 + 192*y**4 + 4152*y**3 + 4864*y\n\\]\n\nThis is the result of multiplying and combining like terms from the original expression \\((54*y**3 - 64*y)*(-3*y**3 - 129*y**2 - 76)\\).\n\n<<<-162*y**6 - 6966*y**5 + 192*y**4 + 4152*y**3 + 4864*y>>>"
