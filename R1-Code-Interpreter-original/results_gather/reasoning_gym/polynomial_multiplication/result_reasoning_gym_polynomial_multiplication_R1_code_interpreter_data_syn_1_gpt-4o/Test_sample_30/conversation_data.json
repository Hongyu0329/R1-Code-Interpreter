    "To simplify the expression \\((82*z**2 + 21)*(-86*z**3 - 31*z)\\), we need to distribute each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. This involves using the distributive property of multiplication over addition.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n1. Distribute \\(82*z**2\\) to \\(-86*z**3\\) and \\(-31*z\\).\n2. Distribute \\(21\\) to \\(-86*z**3\\) and \\(-31*z\\).\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n- \\(82*z**2 * -86*z**3 = -7052*z**5\\)\n- \\(82*z**2 * -31*z = -2542*z**3\\)\n- \\(21 * -86*z**3 = -1806*z**3\\)\n- \\(21 * -31*z = -651*z\\)\n\nNow, we combine the like terms:\n\n- The \\(z**5\\) term is \\(-7052*z**5\\).\n- The \\(z**3\\) terms are \\(-2542*z**3 - 1806*z**3 = -4348*z**3\\).\n- The \\(z\\) term is \\(-651*z\\).\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations and verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the coefficients\ncoeff1 = 82\ncoeff2 = 21\ncoeff3 = -86\ncoeff4 = -31\n\n# Calculate each term\nterm1 = coeff1 * coeff3  # Coefficient for z**5\nterm2 = coeff1 * coeff4  # Coefficient for z**3\nterm3 = coeff2 * coeff3  # Coefficient for z**3\nterm4 = coeff2 * coeff4  # Coefficient for z\n\n# Combine like terms\nz5_term = term1\nz3_term = term2 + term3\nz1_term = term4\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(f\"Simplified expression: {z5_term}*z**5 + {z3_term}*z**3 + {z1_term}*z\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the simplified expression.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output provides the simplified expression. Based on the calculations, the simplified expression is:\n\n\\[\n-7052*z**5 - 4348*z**3 - 651*z\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-7052*z**5 - 4348*z**3 - 651*z>>>"
