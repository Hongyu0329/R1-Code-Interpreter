    "To solve the given expression \\((72*z^3 - 158)*(96*z^3 + 37*z)*(-31*z^3 + 44*z^2 - 87*z)\\), we need to expand and simplify it. This involves multiplying the polynomials together.\n\nThe expression is a product of three polynomials:\n1. \\(72*z^3 - 158\\)\n2. \\(96*z^3 + 37*z\\)\n3. \\(-31*z^3 + 44*z^2 - 87*z\\)\n\nThe process involves:\n- First, multiply the first two polynomials.\n- Then, multiply the result with the third polynomial.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 72*z**3 - 158\npoly2 = 96*z**3 + 37*z\npoly3 = -31*z**3 + 44*z**2 - 87*z\n\n# Multiply the first two polynomials\nresult1 = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Multiply the result with the third polynomial\nfinal_result = expand(result1 * poly3)\n\n# Print the final expanded polynomial\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the expression and provide the simplified polynomial.
