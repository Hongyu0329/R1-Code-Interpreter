    "To solve the expression \\(186 \\cdot z^3 \\cdot (-6 \\cdot z^2 - 85 \\cdot z) \\cdot (85 \\cdot z^3 + 63)\\), we need to expand and simplify it. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the components**: \n   - \\(186 \\cdot z^3\\)\n   - \\((-6 \\cdot z^2 - 85 \\cdot z)\\)\n   - \\((85 \\cdot z^3 + 63)\\)\n\n2. **Expand the expression**: \n   - First, expand the product of the second and third components: \\((-6 \\cdot z^2 - 85 \\cdot z) \\cdot (85 \\cdot z^3 + 63)\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by \\(186 \\cdot z^3\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the expression**: \n   - Combine like terms and simplify the expression to get the final result.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpression = 186 * z**3 * (-6 * z**2 - 85 * z) * (85 * z**3 + 63)\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expression = expand(expression)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the expanded and simplified form of the expression.",
