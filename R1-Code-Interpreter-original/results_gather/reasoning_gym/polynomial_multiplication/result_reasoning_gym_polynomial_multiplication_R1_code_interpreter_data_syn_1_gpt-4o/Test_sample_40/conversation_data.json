    "To solve the expression \\((-180*x**2 + 92*x)*(29*x**3 + 82)\\), we need to expand the product by distributing each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial. This involves multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n1. The first polynomial is \\(-180*x**2 + 92*x\\).\n2. The second polynomial is \\(29*x**3 + 82\\).\n\nWe will distribute each term in the first polynomial across each term in the second polynomial:\n\n- Multiply \\(-180*x**2\\) by \\(29*x**3\\).\n- Multiply \\(-180*x**2\\) by \\(82\\).\n- Multiply \\(92*x\\) by \\(29*x**3\\).\n- Multiply \\(92*x\\) by \\(82\\).\n\nAfter calculating these products, we will sum them up to get the expanded form of the expression.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpression = (-180*x**2 + 92*x)*(29*x**3 + 82)\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expression = expand(expression)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the given expression and provide the result. Let's execute it to find the expanded form.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the expanded form of the expression \\((-180*x**2 + 92*x)*(29*x**3 + 82)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-5220*x**5 + 2668*x**4 - 14760*x**2 + 7544*x\n\\]\n\nThis result is obtained by distributing each term in the first polynomial across each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\n<<<-5220*x**5 + 2668*x**4 - 14760*x**2 + 7544*x>>>"
