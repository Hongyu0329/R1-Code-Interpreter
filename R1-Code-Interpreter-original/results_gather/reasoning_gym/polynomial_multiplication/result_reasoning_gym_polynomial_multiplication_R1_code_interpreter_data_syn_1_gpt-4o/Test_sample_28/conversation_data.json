    "To simplify the given expression, we need to multiply the three polynomials together. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n(-93*y**2 - 82)*(-14*y**3 + 8*y**2 + 72)*(-20*y**3 - 24*y**2 + 62*y + 6)\n\\]\n\nThe process involves expanding the product of these polynomials. This can be quite complex due to the number of terms involved, so using a computational approach is efficient.\n\n### Steps to Simplify:\n\n1. **Expand the Expression**: Multiply the polynomials together. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial with each term in the second polynomial, and then the result with the third polynomial.\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms**: After expanding, combine terms with the same power of \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Simplify the Coefficients**: Sum up the coefficients for each power of \\( y \\).\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these operations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = -93*y**2 - 82\npoly2 = -14*y**3 + 8*y**2 + 72\npoly3 = -20*y**3 - 24*y**2 + 62*y + 6\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expr = expand(poly1 * poly2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(expanded_expr)\n```\n\nThis script will expand the expression and combine like terms, providing the simplified polynomial. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
