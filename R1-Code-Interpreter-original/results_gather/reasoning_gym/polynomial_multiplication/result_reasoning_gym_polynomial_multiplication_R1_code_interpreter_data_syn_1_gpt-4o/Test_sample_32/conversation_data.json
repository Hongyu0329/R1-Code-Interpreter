    "To simplify the expression \\((-65*y**2 + 79*y - 88)*(57*y**2 + 11*y - 1)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nThe expression can be expanded as follows:\n\n1. Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n2. Combine like terms to simplify the expression.\n\nLet's perform these steps using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = -65*y**2 + 79*y - 88\npoly2 = 57*y**2 + 11*y - 1\n\n# Expand the product of the two polynomials\nexpanded_expression = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the given polynomial expression and combine like terms to provide the simplified result. Let's execute the code to find the simplified expression.",
