    "To simplify the given expression \\((35*z**3 - 58*z)*(78*z**2 - 90*z - 97)*(-14*z**3 - 68*z**2 - 11*z - 48)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves expanding the expression by multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, and then multiplying the resulting polynomial by the third polynomial.\n\nThe expression is a product of three polynomials:\n1. \\(35*z**3 - 58*z\\)\n2. \\(78*z**2 - 90*z - 97\\)\n3. \\(-14*z**3 - 68*z**2 - 11*z - 48\\)\n\nThe process involves:\n1. Expanding the first two polynomials.\n2. Expanding the result with the third polynomial.\n3. Combining like terms to simplify the expression.\n\nGiven the complexity of the expression, it is efficient to use a symbolic computation tool like Python's `sympy` library to perform the expansion and simplification.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these operations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 35*z**3 - 58*z\npoly2 = 78*z**2 - 90*z - 97\npoly3 = -14*z**3 - 68*z**2 - 11*z - 48\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expr = expand(poly1 * poly2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(expanded_expr)\n```\n\nThis script will expand and simplify the expression, providing the final result. Let's execute the code to obtain the simplified expression.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is the expanded and simplified form of the given expression. The expression has been expanded into a polynomial of degree 8 with the following terms:\n\n- \\(-38220*z**8\\)\n- \\(-141540*z**7\\)\n- \\(295036*z**6\\)\n- \\(369022*z**5\\)\n- \\(-195415*z**4\\)\n- \\(-59876*z**3\\)\n- \\(-312446*z**2\\)\n- \\(-270048*z\\)\n\nThus, the simplified expression is:\n\n<<<-38220*z**8 - 141540*z**7 + 295036*z**6 + 369022*z**5 - 195415*z**4 - 59876*z**3 - 312446*z**2 - 270048*z>>>"
