    "To simplify the expression \\((40 - 25*x**3)*(-62*x**2 - 4)*(83*x**3 + 80*x)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves expanding the expression by multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, and then multiplying the resulting expression by the third polynomial.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **First Multiplication**: Multiply \\((40 - 25*x**3)\\) by \\((-62*x**2 - 4)\\).\n   - Distribute each term in the first polynomial across each term in the second polynomial.\n   - This will result in a new polynomial.\n\n2. **Second Multiplication**: Multiply the resulting polynomial from step 1 by \\((83*x**3 + 80*x)\\).\n   - Again, distribute each term in the resulting polynomial across each term in the third polynomial.\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms**: After performing the multiplications, combine like terms to simplify the expression.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\nexpr1 = (40 - 25*x**3)\nexpr2 = (-62*x**2 - 4)\nexpr3 = (83*x**3 + 80*x)\n\n# Perform the multiplications\nresult = expand(expr1 * expr2 * expr3)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will expand and simplify the given expression. Let's execute it to find the simplified form.",
