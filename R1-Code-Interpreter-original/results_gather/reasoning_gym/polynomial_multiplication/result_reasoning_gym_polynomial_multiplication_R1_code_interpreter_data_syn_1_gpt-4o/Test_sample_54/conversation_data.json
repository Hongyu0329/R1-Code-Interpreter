    "To solve the expression \\((59 - 106*x)*(95*x**2 + 116)*(-61*x**3 + 62*x)\\), we need to expand and simplify it. The expression is a product of three polynomials, and we will expand it step by step.\n\n1. **Expand the first two polynomials**: \\((59 - 106*x)*(95*x**2 + 116)\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the result with the third polynomial**: \\((-61*x**3 + 62*x)\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 59 - 106*x\npoly2 = 95*x**2 + 116\npoly3 = -61*x**3 + 62*x\n\n# Expand the first two polynomials\nexpanded_poly1_2 = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Multiply the result with the third polynomial\nfinal_expansion = expand(expanded_poly1_2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the final expanded polynomial\nprint(final_expansion)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the expanded polynomial.",
