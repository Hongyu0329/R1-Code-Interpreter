    "To solve the expression \\((34 - 43*x)*(-25*x**2 - 53*x)*(-94*x**2 + 99*x - 15)\\), we need to expand it step by step. This involves multiplying the polynomials together.\n\n1. **First Step**: Multiply the first two polynomials: \\((34 - 43*x)\\) and \\((-25*x**2 - 53*x)\\).\n\n2. **Second Step**: Multiply the result from the first step with the third polynomial: \\((-94*x**2 + 99*x - 15)\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 34 - 43*x\npoly2 = -25*x**2 - 53*x\npoly3 = -94*x**2 + 99*x - 15\n\n# First multiplication\nresult1 = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Second multiplication\nfinal_result = expand(result1 * poly3)\n\n# Print the final expanded polynomial\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the given expression step by step and provide the final expanded polynomial. Let's execute it to find the result.",
