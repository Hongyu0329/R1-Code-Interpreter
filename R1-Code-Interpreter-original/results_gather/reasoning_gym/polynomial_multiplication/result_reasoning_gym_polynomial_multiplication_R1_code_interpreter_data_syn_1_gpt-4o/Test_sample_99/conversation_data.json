    "To solve the expression \\((17*y + 27)*(213*y**2 - 95)*(-77*y**3 + 34*y - 20)\\), we need to expand and simplify it. The expression involves three polynomials in terms of \\(y\\). \n\nThe steps to solve this are as follows:\n\n1. **Expand the Expression**: We need to multiply the three polynomials together. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial across the terms in the second polynomial, and then distributing the result across the terms in the third polynomial.\n\n2. **Simplify the Expression**: After expanding, we will combine like terms to simplify the expression.\n\nLet's perform these steps using Python to handle the algebraic expansion and simplification.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 17*y + 27\npoly2 = 213*y**2 - 95\npoly3 = -77*y**3 + 34*y - 20\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expr = expand(poly1 * poly2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expr)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the given expression and simplify it by combining like terms. Let's execute the code to find the result.",
