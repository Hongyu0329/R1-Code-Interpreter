    "To simplify the expression \\((36*z**3 + 136*z - 82)*(49*z**3 + 69*z**2 - 68*z)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication process:\n\n1. Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n2. Combine like terms to simplify the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n(36*z^3 + 136*z - 82) * (49*z^3 + 69*z^2 - 68*z)\n\\]\n\nWe will perform the multiplication step-by-step:\n\n- Multiply \\(36*z^3\\) by each term in the second polynomial.\n- Multiply \\(136*z\\) by each term in the second polynomial.\n- Multiply \\(-82\\) by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nAfter performing these multiplications, we will combine like terms to get the simplified expression.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 36*z**3 + 136*z - 82\npoly2 = 49*z**3 + 69*z**2 - 68*z\n\n# Perform the multiplication and simplify\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the expanded form of the polynomial multiplication and simplify it. Let's execute the code to get the simplified expression.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the simplified form of the polynomial expression. The expanded polynomial is:\n\n\\[ 1764*z^6 + 2484*z^5 + 4216*z^4 + 5366*z^3 - 14906*z^2 + 5576*z \\]\n\nThis is the result of multiplying and simplifying the given expression.\n\n<<<1764*z**6 + 2484*z**5 + 4216*z**4 + 5366*z**3 - 14906*z**2 + 5576*z>>>"
