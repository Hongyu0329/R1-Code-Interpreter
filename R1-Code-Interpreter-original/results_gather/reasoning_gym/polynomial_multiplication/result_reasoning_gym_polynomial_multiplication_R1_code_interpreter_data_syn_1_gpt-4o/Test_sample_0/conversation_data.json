    "To simplify the expression \\((-39*x - 93)*(61*x^2 + 133*x + 43)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication:\n\n1. Multiply \\(-39*x\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(-39*x * 61*x^2 = -2379*x^3\\)\n   - \\(-39*x * 133*x = -5187*x^2\\)\n   - \\(-39*x * 43 = -1677*x\\)\n\n2. Multiply \\(-93\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(-93 * 61*x^2 = -5673*x^2\\)\n   - \\(-93 * 133*x = -12369*x\\)\n   - \\(-93 * 43 = -3999\\)\n\nNow, combine all these terms and simplify by combining like terms:\n\n- The \\(x^3\\) term: \\(-2379*x^3\\)\n- The \\(x^2\\) terms: \\(-5187*x^2 - 5673*x^2 = -10860*x^2\\)\n- The \\(x\\) terms: \\(-1677*x - 12369*x = -14046*x\\)\n- The constant term: \\(-3999\\)\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations and verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the coefficients of the polynomials\ncoeff1 = [-39, -93]\ncoeff2 = [61, 133, 43]\n\n# Calculate the resulting coefficients after multiplication\nx3_term = coeff1[0] * coeff2[0]\nx2_term = coeff1[0] * coeff2[1] + coeff1[1] * coeff2[0]\nx1_term = coeff1[0] * coeff2[2] + coeff1[1] * coeff2[1]\nconstant_term = coeff1[1] * coeff2[2]\n\n# Print the simplified polynomial\nprint(f\"{x3_term}*x**3 + {x2_term}*x**2 + {x1_term}*x + {constant_term}\")\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the simplified polynomial expression.",
    "The code output confirms the calculations we performed manually. The expression \\((-39*x - 93)*(61*x^2 + 133*x + 43)\\) simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-2379*x^3 - 10860*x^2 - 14046*x - 3999\n\\]\n\nThe negative signs in the output are consistent with the expected results from the multiplication process. \n\nTherefore, the final simplified expression is:\n\n<<<-2379*x**3 - 10860*x**2 - 14046*x - 3999>>>"
