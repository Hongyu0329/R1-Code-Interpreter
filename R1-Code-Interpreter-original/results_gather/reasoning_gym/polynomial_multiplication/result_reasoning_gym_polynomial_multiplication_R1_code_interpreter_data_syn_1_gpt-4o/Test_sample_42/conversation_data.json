    "To solve the expression \\(-103*z^3*(6*z^2 - 30*z + 36)\\), we need to distribute the \\(-103*z^3\\) term across the polynomial inside the parentheses. This involves multiplying each term inside the parentheses by \\(-103*z^3\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Multiply \\(-103*z^3\\) by \\(6*z^2\\):\n   \\[\n   -103*z^3*6*z^2 = -618*z^{3+2} = -618*z^5\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply \\(-103*z^3\\) by \\(-30*z\\):\n   \\[\n   -103*z^3*(-30*z) = 3090*z^{3+1} = 3090*z^4\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply \\(-103*z^3\\) by \\(36\\):\n   \\[\n   -103*z^3*36 = -3708*z^3\n   \\]\n\nNow, we combine these results to get the expanded expression:\n\\[\n-618*z^5 + 3090*z^4 - 3708*z^3\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpression = -103*z**3*(6*z**2 - 30*z + 36)\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expression = expand(expression)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the expanded expression.",
    "The code execution confirms that the expanded expression is correct. The expression \\(-103*z^3*(6*z^2 - 30*z + 36)\\) expands to:\n\n\\[\n-618*z^5 + 3090*z^4 - 3708*z^3\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-618*z**5 + 3090*z**4 - 3708*z**3>>>"
