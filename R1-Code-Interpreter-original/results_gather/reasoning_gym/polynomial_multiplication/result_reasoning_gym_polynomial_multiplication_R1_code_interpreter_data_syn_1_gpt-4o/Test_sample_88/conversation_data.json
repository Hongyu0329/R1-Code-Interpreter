    "To simplify the expression \\((28*z**2 - 82*z)*(-9*z**3 - 25)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication:\n\n1. Multiply \\(28*z**2\\) by \\(-9*z**3\\):\n   \\[\n   28*z**2 * -9*z**3 = -252*z**5\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply \\(28*z**2\\) by \\(-25\\):\n   \\[\n   28*z**2 * -25 = -700*z**2\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply \\(-82*z\\) by \\(-9*z**3\\):\n   \\[\n   -82*z * -9*z**3 = 738*z**4\n   \\]\n\n4. Multiply \\(-82*z\\) by \\(-25\\):\n   \\[\n   -82*z * -25 = 2050*z\n   \\]\n\nNow, we combine all these terms to get the simplified expression. Let's write a Python script to perform these calculations and combine the terms.\n\n```python\n# Define the coefficients and powers\ncoefficients = [28, -82]\npowers = [2, 1]\nsecond_poly = [-9, -25]\nsecond_powers = [3, 0]\n\n# Calculate each term\nterm1 = coefficients[0] * second_poly[0] * z**(powers[0] + second_powers[0])\nterm2 = coefficients[0] * second_poly[1] * z**(powers[0] + second_powers[1])\nterm3 = coefficients[1] * second_poly[0] * z**(powers[1] + second_powers[0])\nterm4 = coefficients[1] * second_poly[1] * z**(powers[1] + second_powers[1])\n\n# Combine the terms\nsimplified_expression = f\"{term1} + {term3} + {term2} + {term4}\"\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(simplified_expression)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the simplified expression.",
    "The error occurred because the variable `z` was not defined in the code. To fix this, we need to treat the terms as symbolic expressions. We can use Python's `sympy` library to handle symbolic mathematics. Let's rewrite the code using `sympy` to perform the polynomial multiplication.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the symbol\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the polynomials\nfirst_poly = 28*z**2 - 82*z\nsecond_poly = -9*z**3 - 25\n\n# Perform the multiplication\nsimplified_expression = expand(first_poly * second_poly)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(simplified_expression)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the simplified expression.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the simplified expression is:\n\n\\[\n-252*z**5 + 738*z**4 - 700*z**2 + 2050*z\n\\]\n\nThus, the simplified form of the expression \\((28*z**2 - 82*z)*(-9*z**3 - 25)\\) is:\n\n<<<-252*z**5 + 738*z**4 - 700*z**2 + 2050*z>>>"
