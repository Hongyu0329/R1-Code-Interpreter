    "To solve the expression \\((39 - 126*z**2)*(93*z**2 - 20*z)\\), we need to expand it by multiplying each term in the first parenthesis by each term in the second parenthesis. This is a straightforward polynomial multiplication problem.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Multiply \\(39\\) by each term in the second parenthesis:\n   - \\(39 * 93*z**2 = 3627*z**2\\)\n   - \\(39 * -20*z = -780*z\\)\n\n2. Multiply \\(-126*z**2\\) by each term in the second parenthesis:\n   - \\(-126*z**2 * 93*z**2 = -11718*z**4\\)\n   - \\(-126*z**2 * -20*z = 2520*z**3\\)\n\nNow, we combine all these terms together:\n\n- \\(-11718*z**4\\)\n- \\(2520*z**3\\)\n- \\(3627*z**2\\)\n- \\(-780*z\\)\n\nThe final expression after combining all terms is:\n\\[\n-11718*z**4 + 2520*z**3 + 3627*z**2 - 780*z\n\\]\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify this calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\nz = symbols('z')\nexpression = (39 - 126*z**2)*(93*z**2 - 20*z)\nexpanded_expression = expand(expression)\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the given expression and print the result. Let's execute it to confirm our manual calculation.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed our manual calculation. The expanded expression is:\n\n\\[\n-11718*z**4 + 2520*z**3 + 3627*z**2 - 780*z\n\\]\n\nThis matches the result we derived manually. \n\n<<<-11718*z**4 + 2520*z**3 + 3627*z**2 - 780*z>>>"
