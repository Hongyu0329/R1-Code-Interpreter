    "To simplify the expression \\( 2100 \\cdot x^2 \\cdot (98 \\cdot x^2 + 22) \\), we need to distribute the \\( 2100 \\cdot x^2 \\) term across the terms inside the parentheses.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n1. Distribute \\( 2100 \\cdot x^2 \\) to \\( 98 \\cdot x^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   2100 \\cdot x^2 \\cdot 98 \\cdot x^2 = 2100 \\cdot 98 \\cdot x^2 \\cdot x^2 = 2100 \\cdot 98 \\cdot x^{2+2} = 2100 \\cdot 98 \\cdot x^4\n   \\]\n\n2. Distribute \\( 2100 \\cdot x^2 \\) to \\( 22 \\):\n   \\[\n   2100 \\cdot x^2 \\cdot 22 = 2100 \\cdot 22 \\cdot x^2\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the coefficients:\n\n- For the first term: \\( 2100 \\cdot 98 \\)\n- For the second term: \\( 2100 \\cdot 22 \\)\n\nWe can use Python to compute these products efficiently.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the coefficients\nterm1_coefficient = 2100 * 98\nterm2_coefficient = 2100 * 22\n\n# Print the results\nprint(term1_coefficient, term2_coefficient)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the coefficients needed to write the simplified expression.",
    "With the calculated coefficients, we can now write the simplified expression:\n\n1. The first term is \\( 205800 \\cdot x^4 \\).\n2. The second term is \\( 46200 \\cdot x^2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is:\n\n\\[\n205800 \\cdot x^4 + 46200 \\cdot x^2\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<205800*x**4 + 46200*x**2>>>"
