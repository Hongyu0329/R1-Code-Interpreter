    "To solve the expression \\((-84*y^2 - 17*y)*(74*y^2 - 67*y - 6)*(46*y^3 + 26*y - 11)\\), we need to expand and simplify it. This involves multiplying the polynomials together.\n\nThe expression is a product of three polynomials:\n1. \\(-84*y^2 - 17*y\\)\n2. \\(74*y^2 - 67*y - 6\\)\n3. \\(46*y^3 + 26*y - 11\\)\n\nThe process involves:\n- First, multiplying the first two polynomials to get an intermediate polynomial.\n- Then, multiplying the result with the third polynomial.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = -84*y**2 - 17*y\npoly2 = 74*y**2 - 67*y - 6\npoly3 = 46*y**3 + 26*y - 11\n\n# Multiply the first two polynomials\nintermediate_poly = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Multiply the result with the third polynomial\nfinal_result = expand(intermediate_poly * poly3)\n\n# Print the final expanded polynomial\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the given expression and provide the simplified polynomial.
