    "To simplify the expression \\((24*x**3 - 38*x + 82)*(20*x**3 + 78*x**2 - 39*x + 1)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify the terms**: \n   - First polynomial: \\(24*x**3, -38*x, 82\\)\n   - Second polynomial: \\(20*x**3, 78*x**2, -39*x, 1\\)\n\n2. **Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial**:\n   - \\(24*x**3 * 20*x**3\\)\n   - \\(24*x**3 * 78*x**2\\)\n   - \\(24*x**3 * -39*x\\)\n   - \\(24*x**3 * 1\\)\n   - \\(-38*x * 20*x**3\\)\n   - \\(-38*x * 78*x**2\\)\n   - \\(-38*x * -39*x\\)\n   - \\(-38*x * 1\\)\n   - \\(82 * 20*x**3\\)\n   - \\(82 * 78*x**2\\)\n   - \\(82 * -39*x\\)\n   - \\(82 * 1\\)\n\n3. **Combine like terms**: After multiplying, we will have terms with different powers of \\(x\\). We need to combine terms with the same power of \\(x\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 24*x**3 - 38*x + 82\npoly2 = 20*x**3 + 78*x**2 - 39*x + 1\n\n# Expand the product of the two polynomials\nexpanded_poly = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Print the expanded polynomial\nprint(expanded_poly)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the expanded form of the polynomial product, and the result will be displayed.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the expanded form of the polynomial product. The expression \\((24*x**3 - 38*x + 82)*(20*x**3 + 78*x**2 - 39*x + 1)\\) simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 480*x**6 + 1872*x**5 - 1696*x**4 - 1300*x**3 + 7878*x**2 - 3236*x + 82 \\]\n\n<<<480*x**6 + 1872*x**5 - 1696*x**4 - 1300*x**3 + 7878*x**2 - 3236*x + 82>>>"
