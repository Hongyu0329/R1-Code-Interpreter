    "To solve the expression \\((20*y**2 + 9)*(22*y**3 - 156)*(89*y**3 + 22*y)\\), we need to expand and simplify it. The expression involves three polynomial terms, and we will multiply them together.\n\n1. **Expression Breakdown:**\n   - First term: \\(20*y**2 + 9\\)\n   - Second term: \\(22*y**3 - 156\\)\n   - Third term: \\(89*y**3 + 22*y\\)\n\n2. **Multiplication Process:**\n   - We will first multiply the first two terms: \\((20*y**2 + 9)*(22*y**3 - 156)\\).\n   - Then, we will multiply the result with the third term: \\((89*y**3 + 22*y)\\).\n\n3. **Code Implementation:**\n   - We will use Python to perform the polynomial multiplication and simplification.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the expressions\nexpr1 = 20*y**2 + 9\nexpr2 = 22*y**3 - 156\nexpr3 = 89*y**3 + 22*y\n\n# Multiply the first two expressions\nresult1 = expand(expr1 * expr2)\n\n# Multiply the result with the third expression\nfinal_result = expand(result1 * expr3)\n\n# Print the final expanded expression\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the given expression and provide the simplified polynomial form. Let's execute it to find the result.",
