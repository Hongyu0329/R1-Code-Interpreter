    "To simplify the expression \\((68*x**2 + 93*x)*(56*x**3 + 125*x**2)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication step-by-step:\n\n1. Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(68*x**2 * 56*x**3\\)\n   - \\(68*x**2 * 125*x**2\\)\n   - \\(93*x * 56*x**3\\)\n   - \\(93*x * 125*x**2\\)\n\n2. Simplify each multiplication:\n   - \\(68*x**2 * 56*x**3 = 3808*x**5\\)\n   - \\(68*x**2 * 125*x**2 = 8500*x**4\\)\n   - \\(93*x * 56*x**3 = 5208*x**4\\)\n   - \\(93*x * 125*x**2 = 11625*x**3\\)\n\n3. Combine like terms:\n   - Combine the \\(x**4\\) terms: \\(8500*x**4 + 5208*x**4 = 13708*x**4\\)\n\nThe simplified expression is:\n\\[ 3808*x**5 + 13708*x**4 + 11625*x**3 \\]\n\nLet's verify this by writing a Python script to perform the multiplication and simplification:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 68*x**2 + 93*x\npoly2 = 56*x**3 + 125*x**2\n\n# Perform the multiplication and simplify\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
