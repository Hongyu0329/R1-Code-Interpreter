    "To solve the given expression:\n\n\\[\n(-14*x^3 - 38)*(-9*x^3 - 51*x^2)*(33*x^2 - 4*x + 94)\n\\]\n\nwe need to expand and simplify it. The expression is a product of three polynomials. The process involves:\n\n1. Expanding the product of the first two polynomials: \\((-14*x^3 - 38)\\) and \\((-9*x^3 - 51*x^2)\\).\n2. Multiplying the result with the third polynomial: \\((33*x^2 - 4*x + 94)\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Expand the first two polynomials\n\nThe first step is to expand \\((-14*x^3 - 38)\\) and \\((-9*x^3 - 51*x^2)\\).\n\n### Step 2: Multiply the result with the third polynomial\n\nAfter obtaining the result from Step 1, multiply it with \\((33*x^2 - 4*x + 94)\\).\n\nTo perform these calculations efficiently, we can use Python to handle the polynomial multiplication and expansion. Let's write a Python script to perform these operations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = -14*x**3 - 38\npoly2 = -9*x**3 - 51*x**2\npoly3 = 33*x**2 - 4*x + 94\n\n# Expand the product of the first two polynomials\nresult1 = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Expand the product of the result with the third polynomial\nfinal_result = expand(result1 * poly3)\n\n# Print the final expanded polynomial\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nThis script will expand the given expression and provide the simplified polynomial. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
