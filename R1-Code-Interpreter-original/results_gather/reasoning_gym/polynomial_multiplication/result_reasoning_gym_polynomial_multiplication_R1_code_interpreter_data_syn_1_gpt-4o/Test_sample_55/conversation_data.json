    "To solve the expression \\((-64*x**2 - 11)*(81*x**2 + 50)\\), we need to expand it by multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. This is a straightforward application of the distributive property.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Multiply \\(-64*x**2\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(-64*x**2 * 81*x**2 = -5184*x**4\\)\n   - \\(-64*x**2 * 50 = -3200*x**2\\)\n\n2. Multiply \\(-11\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(-11 * 81*x**2 = -891*x**2\\)\n   - \\(-11 * 50 = -550\\)\n\n3. Combine all the terms:\n   - The \\(x**4\\) term: \\(-5184*x**4\\)\n   - The \\(x**2\\) terms: \\(-3200*x**2 - 891*x**2 = -4091*x**2\\)\n   - The constant term: \\(-550\\)\n\nThus, the expanded form of the expression is:\n\\[\n-5184*x**4 - 4091*x**2 - 550\n\\]\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to verify this calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\nx = symbols('x')\nexpression = (-64*x**2 - 11)*(81*x**2 + 50)\nexpanded_expression = expand(expression)\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the given expression and print the result. Let's execute it to confirm our manual calculation.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed our manual calculation. The expanded form of the expression \\((-64*x**2 - 11)*(81*x**2 + 50)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-5184*x**4 - 4091*x**2 - 550\n\\]\n\n<<<-5184*x**4 - 4091*x**2 - 550>>>"
