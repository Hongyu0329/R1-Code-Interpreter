    "To solve the expression \\((32 - 155*y)*(-57*y**3 - 57*y)*(-39*y**2 + 53*y - 69)\\), we need to expand and simplify it. The expression involves three polynomials in terms of \\(y\\). \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Expand the Expression**: We need to multiply the three polynomials together. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial across the terms in the second and third polynomials.\n\n2. **Simplify the Result**: After expanding, we will combine like terms to simplify the expression.\n\n3. **Compute the Result**: If a specific value of \\(y\\) is given, we can substitute it into the simplified expression to compute the result. However, since no specific value of \\(y\\) is provided, we will leave the expression in its expanded form.\n\nLet's perform the expansion and simplification using Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the polynomials\nexpr1 = (32 - 155*y)\nexpr2 = (-57*y**3 - 57*y)\nexpr3 = (-39*y**2 + 53*y - 69)\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expr = expand(expr1 * expr2 * expr3)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expr)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the given expression and output the result. Let's execute it to see the expanded form.",
