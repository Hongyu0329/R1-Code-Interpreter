    "To simplify the expression \\((22 - 42*z)*(31*z - 51)\\), we need to perform the multiplication of the two binomials. This involves using the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials), which stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last:\n\n1. **First**: Multiply the first terms of each binomial: \\(22 * 31*z\\).\n2. **Outer**: Multiply the outer terms: \\(22 * -51\\).\n3. **Inner**: Multiply the inner terms: \\(-42*z * 31*z\\).\n4. **Last**: Multiply the last terms: \\(-42*z * -51\\).\n\nLet's calculate each of these products and then combine them to get the simplified expression.\n\n```python\n# Define the coefficients\na = 22\nb = -42\nc = 31\nd = -51\n\n# Calculate each part of the expression\nfirst = a * c\nouter = a * d\ninner = b * c\nlast = b * d\n\n# Combine the results\nsimplified_expression = f\"{first}*z + ({outer} + {inner})*z + {last}\"\nprint(simplified_expression)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the simplified expression.",
    "The code output provides the intermediate steps of the simplification process. Let's combine these results to form the final simplified expression:\n\n1. The first term is \\(682*z\\).\n2. The combined middle terms are \\(-1122 + -1302\\), which simplifies to \\(-2424\\).\n3. The last term is \\(2142\\).\n\nThus, the simplified expression is:\n\n\\[ 682*z^2 - 2424*z + 2142 \\]\n\nNow, let's present the final answer.\n\n<<<682*z**2 - 2424*z + 2142>>>"
