    "To solve the expression \\((-57*z**3 - 33*z**2)*(28*z**3 + 65*z**2 - 9*z)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication step-by-step:\n\n1. Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n2. Combine like terms to simplify the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[\n(-57*z**3 - 33*z**2)*(28*z**3 + 65*z**2 - 9*z)\n\\]\n\nLet's perform the multiplication:\n\n- \\(-57*z**3 * 28*z**3 = -1596*z**6\\)\n- \\(-57*z**3 * 65*z**2 = -3705*z**5\\)\n- \\(-57*z**3 * (-9*z) = 513*z**4\\)\n\n- \\(-33*z**2 * 28*z**3 = -924*z**5\\)\n- \\(-33*z**2 * 65*z**2 = -2145*z**4\\)\n- \\(-33*z**2 * (-9*z) = 297*z**3\\)\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n- \\(z**6\\) term: \\(-1596*z**6\\)\n- \\(z**5\\) term: \\(-3705*z**5 - 924*z**5 = -4629*z**5\\)\n- \\(z**4\\) term: \\(513*z**4 - 2145*z**4 = -1632*z**4\\)\n- \\(z**3\\) term: \\(297*z**3\\)\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform these calculations and verify the result.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\nz = symbols('z')\nexpr = (-57*z**3 - 33*z**2)*(28*z**3 + 65*z**2 - 9*z)\nexpanded_expr = expand(expr)\nprint(expanded_expr)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the polynomial expression and provide the simplified result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the expanded polynomial expression. The result of the multiplication is:\n\n\\[\n-1596*z**6 - 4629*z**5 - 1632*z**4 + 297*z**3\n\\]\n\nThis matches our manual calculations. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1596*z**6 - 4629*z**5 - 1632*z**4 + 297*z**3>>>"
