    "To simplify the expression \\((-81*y**2 - 37)*(-51*y**2 - 147*y + 35)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication step-by-step:\n\n1. Multiply \\(-81*y**2\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(-81*y**2 * -51*y**2 = 4131*y**4\\)\n   - \\(-81*y**2 * -147*y = 11907*y**3\\)\n   - \\(-81*y**2 * 35 = -2835*y**2\\)\n\n2. Multiply \\(-37\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(-37 * -51*y**2 = 1887*y**2\\)\n   - \\(-37 * -147*y = 5439*y\\)\n   - \\(-37 * 35 = -1295\\)\n\n3. Combine all the terms obtained from the above steps:\n   - \\(4131*y**4 + 11907*y**3 + (-2835*y**2 + 1887*y**2) + 5439*y - 1295\\)\n\n4. Simplify by combining like terms:\n   - Combine the \\(y**2\\) terms: \\(-2835*y**2 + 1887*y**2 = -948*y**2\\)\n\nThe simplified expression is:\n\\[4131*y**4 + 11907*y**3 - 948*y**2 + 5439*y - 1295\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the expressions\nexpr1 = -81*y**2 - 37\nexpr2 = -51*y**2 - 147*y + 35\n\n# Expand the product of the two expressions\nsimplified_expr = expand(expr1 * expr2)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(simplified_expr)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will confirm the result and provide the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches our manual calculation. Therefore, the simplified expression is:\n\n<<<4131*y**4 + 11907*y**3 - 948*y**2 + 5439*y - 1295>>>"
