    "To simplify the expression \\((31*x**2 + 63*x)*(-16*x**3 + 42*x**2)*(-5*x**3 - 88*x**2 + 25*x)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves expanding the expression by multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, and then multiplying the resulting polynomial by the third polynomial.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Multiply the first two polynomials:**\n   - \\((31*x**2 + 63*x)\\) and \\((-16*x**3 + 42*x**2)\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the result by the third polynomial:**\n   - The result from step 1 and \\((-5*x**3 - 88*x**2 + 25*x)\\).\n\n3. **Combine like terms:**\n   - After expanding, combine terms with the same power of \\(x\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 31*x**2 + 63*x\npoly2 = -16*x**3 + 42*x**2\npoly3 = -5*x**3 - 88*x**2 + 25*x\n\n# Multiply the first two polynomials\nresult1 = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Multiply the result by the third polynomial\nfinal_result = expand(result1 * poly3)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the expression and combine like terms to give us the simplified polynomial. Let's execute the code to find the simplified expression.",
