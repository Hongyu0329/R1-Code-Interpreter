    "To solve the expression \\((18 - 95*z**3)*(-12*z**2 - 104*z + 78)\\), we need to expand it by multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. This will involve distributing the terms and combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication:\n\n1. Multiply \\(18\\) by each term in \\(-12*z**2 - 104*z + 78\\).\n2. Multiply \\(-95*z**3\\) by each term in \\(-12*z**2 - 104*z + 78\\).\n\nAfter performing these multiplications, we will combine like terms to simplify the expression.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpr = (18 - 95*z**3)*(-12*z**2 - 104*z + 78)\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expr = expand(expr)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expr)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the expanded form of the expression.",
