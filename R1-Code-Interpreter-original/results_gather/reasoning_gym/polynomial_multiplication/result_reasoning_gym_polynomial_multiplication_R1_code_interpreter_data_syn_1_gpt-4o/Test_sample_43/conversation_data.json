    "To simplify the expression \\((2*y**3 + 6*y)*(23*y**3 + 36*y)*(-19*y**3 - 26*y**2 + 70*y)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves expanding the expression by multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, and then multiplying the resulting expression by each term in the third polynomial.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **First Multiplication**: Multiply \\((2*y**3 + 6*y)\\) by \\((23*y**3 + 36*y)\\).\n2. **Second Multiplication**: Multiply the result from the first multiplication by \\((-19*y**3 - 26*y**2 + 70*y)\\).\n\nWe will use Python to perform these multiplications and simplify the expression.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 2*y**3 + 6*y\npoly2 = 23*y**3 + 36*y\npoly3 = -19*y**3 - 26*y**2 + 70*y\n\n# Perform the multiplications\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the simplified result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the expression and simplify it. Let's execute it to find the simplified form.",
