    "To simplify the expression \\((91 - 26*y)*(-197*y**3 - 83*y + 100)\\), we need to distribute each term in the first polynomial across each term in the second polynomial. This involves multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication:\n\n1. Multiply \\(91\\) by each term in \\(-197*y**3 - 83*y + 100\\):\n   - \\(91 * -197*y**3 = -17927*y**3\\)\n   - \\(91 * -83*y = -7553*y\\)\n   - \\(91 * 100 = 9100\\)\n\n2. Multiply \\(-26*y\\) by each term in \\(-197*y**3 - 83*y + 100\\):\n   - \\(-26*y * -197*y**3 = 5122*y**4\\)\n   - \\(-26*y * -83*y = 2158*y**2\\)\n   - \\(-26*y * 100 = -2600*y\\)\n\nNow, we combine all these terms:\n\n- \\(5122*y**4\\)\n- \\(-17927*y**3\\)\n- \\(2158*y**2\\)\n- \\(-7553*y\\)\n- \\(-2600*y\\)\n- \\(9100\\)\n\nNext, we combine like terms:\n\n- Combine the \\(y\\) terms: \\(-7553*y - 2600*y = -10153*y\\)\n\nThe simplified expression is:\n\\[ 5122*y**4 - 17927*y**3 + 2158*y**2 - 10153*y + 9100 \\]\n\nLet's verify this by writing a Python script to perform the calculations and ensure the simplification is correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpression = (91 - 26*y) * (-197*y**3 - 83*y + 100)\n\n# Expand the expression\nsimplified_expression = expand(expression)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(simplified_expression)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the expression and confirm the simplification. Let's execute it.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches our manual simplification. Therefore, the simplified expression is:\n\n<<<5122*y**4 - 17927*y**3 + 2158*y**2 - 10153*y + 9100>>>"
