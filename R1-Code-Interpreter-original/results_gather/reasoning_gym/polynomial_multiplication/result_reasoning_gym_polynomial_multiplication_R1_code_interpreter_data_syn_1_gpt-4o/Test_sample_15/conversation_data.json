    "To solve the expression \\( 44 \\cdot y \\cdot (y^3 + 62) \\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Expression**: The expression is a polynomial in terms of \\( y \\). It involves multiplying 44 by \\( y \\) and then by the sum of \\( y^3 \\) and 62.\n\n2. **Expand the Expression**: We can expand the expression by distributing the multiplication over the addition inside the parentheses:\n   \\[\n   44 \\cdot y \\cdot (y^3 + 62) = 44 \\cdot y \\cdot y^3 + 44 \\cdot y \\cdot 62\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify Each Term**:\n   - The first term is \\( 44 \\cdot y \\cdot y^3 = 44 \\cdot y^4 \\).\n   - The second term is \\( 44 \\cdot y \\cdot 62 = 2728 \\cdot y \\).\n\n4. **Combine the Terms**: The expanded and simplified expression is:\n   \\[\n   44 \\cdot y^4 + 2728 \\cdot y\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to compute this expression for a given value of \\( y \\).\n\n```python\n# Define the function to compute the expression\ndef compute_expression(y):\n    return 44 * y**4 + 2728 * y\n\n# Example: Compute the expression for a specific value of y\ny_value = 1  # You can change this value to compute for different y\nresult = compute_expression(y_value)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function to compute the expression and then calculates it for a specific value of \\( y \\). You can change the `y_value` to compute the expression for different values of \\( y \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output 2772 for \\( y = 1 \\). This means that when \\( y = 1 \\), the expression \\( 44 \\cdot y \\cdot (y^3 + 62) \\) evaluates to 2772.\n\nIf you need the expression evaluated for a different value of \\( y \\), you can change the `y_value` in the code and run it again.\n\n<<<2772>>>"
