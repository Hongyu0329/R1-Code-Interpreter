    "To simplify the expression \\((-77*y**2 - 18)*(16*y**2 + 68)*(35*y**2 + 44)\\), we need to expand the product of these three polynomials. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial across the terms in the second and third polynomials. \n\nThe expression is a product of three polynomials:\n1. \\(-77*y**2 - 18\\)\n2. \\(16*y**2 + 68\\)\n3. \\(35*y**2 + 44\\)\n\nThe process involves:\n1. Expanding the first two polynomials: \\((-77*y**2 - 18)*(16*y**2 + 68)\\).\n2. Expanding the result with the third polynomial: \\((result)*(35*y**2 + 44)\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = -77*y**2 - 18\npoly2 = 16*y**2 + 68\npoly3 = 35*y**2 + 44\n\n# Expand the product of the first two polynomials\nexpanded_poly1_2 = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Expand the result with the third polynomial\nfinal_expansion = expand(expanded_poly1_2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the final expanded expression\nprint(final_expansion)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the expression step by step and provide the simplified form of the polynomial. Let's execute it to find the final answer.",
