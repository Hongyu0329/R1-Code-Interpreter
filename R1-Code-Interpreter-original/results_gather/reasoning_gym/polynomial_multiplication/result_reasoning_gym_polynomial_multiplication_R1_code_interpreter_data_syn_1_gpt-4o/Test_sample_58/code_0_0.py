# Define the coefficients
a = -87
b = 4
c = 46
d = 45

# Calculate each term
term1 = a * c  # Coefficient for x**6
term2 = a * d  # Coefficient for x**5
term3 = b * c  # Coefficient for x**4
term4 = b * d  # Coefficient for x**3

# Print the results
print(f"{term1}*x**6 + {term2}*x**5 + {term3}*x**4 + {term4}*x**3")
