    "To simplify the expression \\((-87*x**3 + 4*x)*(46*x**3 + 45*x**2)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication step-by-step:\n\n1. Multiply \\(-87*x**3\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(-87*x**3 * 46*x**3 = -87*46*x**6\\)\n   - \\(-87*x**3 * 45*x**2 = -87*45*x**5\\)\n\n2. Multiply \\(4*x\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(4*x * 46*x**3 = 4*46*x**4\\)\n   - \\(4*x * 45*x**2 = 4*45*x**3\\)\n\nNow, let's compute these products and combine like terms:\n\n```python\n# Define the coefficients\na = -87\nb = 4\nc = 46\nd = 45\n\n# Calculate each term\nterm1 = a * c  # Coefficient for x**6\nterm2 = a * d  # Coefficient for x**5\nterm3 = b * c  # Coefficient for x**4\nterm4 = b * d  # Coefficient for x**3\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"{term1}*x**6 + {term2}*x**5 + {term3}*x**4 + {term4}*x**3\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the coefficients and simplify the expression.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the coefficients for each term in the simplified polynomial expression. The expression \\((-87*x**3 + 4*x)*(46*x**3 + 45*x**2)\\) simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-4002*x**6 - 3915*x**5 + 184*x**4 + 180*x**3\n\\]\n\nThus, the final simplified expression is:\n\n<<<-4002*x**6 - 3915*x**5 + 184*x**4 + 180*x**3>>>"
