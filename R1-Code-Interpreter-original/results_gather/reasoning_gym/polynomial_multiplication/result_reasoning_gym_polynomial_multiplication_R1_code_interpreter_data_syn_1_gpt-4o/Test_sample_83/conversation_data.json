    "To simplify the expression \\((-37*y**3 - 129*y**2)*(71*y**3 - 69)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication:\n\n1. Multiply \\(-37*y**3\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(-37*y**3 * 71*y**3 = -37*71*y**6\\)\n   - \\(-37*y**3 * (-69) = 37*69*y**3\\)\n\n2. Multiply \\(-129*y**2\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(-129*y**2 * 71*y**3 = -129*71*y**5\\)\n   - \\(-129*y**2 * (-69) = 129*69*y**2\\)\n\nNow, let's compute these products and combine like terms. We will use Python to perform these calculations efficiently.\n\n```python\n# Define the coefficients\na1, a2 = -37, -129\nb1, b2 = 71, -69\n\n# Calculate each term\nterm1 = a1 * b1  # Coefficient of y**6\nterm2 = a1 * b2  # Coefficient of y**3\nterm3 = a2 * b1  # Coefficient of y**5\nterm4 = a2 * b2  # Coefficient of y**2\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"{term1}*y**6 + {term3}*y**5 + {term2}*y**3 + {term4}*y**2\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the simplified expression.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the coefficients for each term in the simplified polynomial expression. Let's write out the final simplified expression based on these coefficients:\n\nThe expression \\((-37*y**3 - 129*y**2)*(71*y**3 - 69)\\) simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-2627*y**6 - 9159*y**5 + 2553*y**3 + 8901*y**2\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-2627*y**6 - 9159*y**5 + 2553*y**3 + 8901*y**2>>>"
