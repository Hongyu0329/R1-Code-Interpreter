    "To solve the expression \\((-36*z**3 - 3*z)*(111*z**3 - 3*z)\\), we need to expand the product of these two polynomials. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the terms**: \n   - The first polynomial is \\(-36*z**3 - 3*z\\).\n   - The second polynomial is \\(111*z**3 - 3*z\\).\n\n2. **Expand the product**: \n   - Use the distributive property to expand the expression: \n     \\((-36*z**3 - 3*z)*(111*z**3 - 3*z) = (-36*z**3)*(111*z**3) + (-36*z**3)*(-3*z) + (-3*z)*(111*z**3) + (-3*z)*(-3*z)\\).\n\n3. **Calculate each term**:\n   - \\((-36*z**3)*(111*z**3) = -36*111*z**6\\).\n   - \\((-36*z**3)*(-3*z) = 108*z**4\\).\n   - \\((-3*z)*(111*z**3) = -333*z**4\\).\n   - \\((-3*z)*(-3*z) = 9*z**2\\).\n\n4. **Combine like terms**:\n   - Combine the \\(z**4\\) terms: \\(108*z**4 - 333*z**4 = -225*z**4\\).\n\n5. **Final expression**:\n   - The expanded expression is \\(-3996*z**6 - 225*z**4 + 9*z**2\\).\n\nNow, let's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpr = (-36*z**3 - 3*z)*(111*z**3 - 3*z)\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expr = expand(expr)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expr)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the expanded expression.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed the expanded expression. Therefore, the final expanded form of the given expression is:\n\n<<<-3996*z**6 - 225*z**4 + 9*z**2>>>"
