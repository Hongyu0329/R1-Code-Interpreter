    "To solve the given expression \\((51*z**2 - 85)*(72*z**3 + 65*z**2)*(-66*z**2 + 17*z + 13)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. The expression involves three polynomials in terms of \\(z\\). \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the polynomials:**\n   - \\(P_1 = 51*z**2 - 85\\)\n   - \\(P_2 = 72*z**3 + 65*z**2\\)\n   - \\(P_3 = -66*z**2 + 17*z + 13\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the polynomials:**\n   - First, multiply \\(P_1\\) and \\(P_2\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result with \\(P_3\\).\n\n3. **Expand the expression:**\n   - Use the distributive property to expand the product of the polynomials.\n\n4. **Simplify the expression:**\n   - Combine like terms to simplify the expression.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the polynomials\nP1 = 51*z**2 - 85\nP2 = 72*z**3 + 65*z**2\nP3 = -66*z**2 + 17*z + 13\n\n# Multiply the polynomials\nresult = expand(P1 * P2 * P3)\n\n# Print the expanded and simplified result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the expanded and simplified polynomial expression.",
