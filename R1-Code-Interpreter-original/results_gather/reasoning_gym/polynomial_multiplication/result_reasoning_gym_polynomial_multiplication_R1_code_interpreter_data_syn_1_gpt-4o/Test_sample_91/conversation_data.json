    "To simplify the expression \\( 11092 \\cdot x^6 \\cdot (44 \\cdot x^2 - 23) \\), we need to distribute the term \\( 11092 \\cdot x^6 \\) across the terms inside the parentheses. This involves multiplying each term inside the parentheses by \\( 11092 \\cdot x^6 \\).\n\nThe expression inside the parentheses is \\( 44 \\cdot x^2 - 23 \\). We will distribute \\( 11092 \\cdot x^6 \\) to both \\( 44 \\cdot x^2 \\) and \\(-23\\).\n\n1. Multiply \\( 11092 \\cdot x^6 \\) by \\( 44 \\cdot x^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   11092 \\cdot x^6 \\cdot 44 \\cdot x^2 = 11092 \\cdot 44 \\cdot x^{6+2} = 11092 \\cdot 44 \\cdot x^8\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply \\( 11092 \\cdot x^6 \\) by \\(-23\\):\n   \\[\n   11092 \\cdot x^6 \\cdot (-23) = -11092 \\cdot 23 \\cdot x^6\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute these multiplications to get the simplified expression.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the coefficients\ncoefficient1 = 11092 * 44\ncoefficient2 = 11092 * 23\n\n# Print the results\nprint(coefficient1, coefficient2)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will use the results to write the final simplified expression.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the coefficients needed to simplify the expression. Using these coefficients, we can write the simplified expression as follows:\n\n1. The first term is \\( 488048 \\cdot x^8 \\).\n2. The second term is \\(-255116 \\cdot x^6\\).\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is:\n\n\\[\n488048 \\cdot x^8 - 255116 \\cdot x^6\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<488048*x**8 - 255116*x**6>>>"
