    "To solve the expression \\(-25*y**3*(-99*y**3 + 123*y**2)*(9*y**3 + 43*y)\\), we need to expand and simplify it. Let's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the terms**: \n   - The expression is a product of three terms: \n     - \\(-25*y**3\\)\n     - \\((-99*y**3 + 123*y**2)\\)\n     - \\((9*y**3 + 43*y)\\)\n\n2. **Expand the expression**:\n   - We will first expand the product of the second and third terms: \\((-99*y**3 + 123*y**2)*(9*y**3 + 43*y)\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by the first term \\(-25*y**3\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the expression**:\n   - Combine like terms and simplify the expression to get the final result.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpression = -25*y**3 * (-99*y**3 + 123*y**2) * (9*y**3 + 43*y)\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expression = expand(expression)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the given expression and simplify it. Let's execute it to find the final answer.",
