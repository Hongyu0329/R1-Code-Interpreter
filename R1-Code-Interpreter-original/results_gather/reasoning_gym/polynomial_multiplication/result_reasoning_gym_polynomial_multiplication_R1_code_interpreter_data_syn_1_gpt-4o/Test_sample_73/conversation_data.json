Use ** instead of ^ to represent exponents. For example, write 7*X**2 instead of 7*X^2.\n2. Always include the * symbol for all multiplication operations in your reasoning steps. For example, write `-3*X**3*sin(X) - 9*X**2*cos(X) + 18*X*sin(X) + 18*cos(X) + C` instead of `-3x3sin(x) - 9x2cos(x) + 18xsin(x) + 18cos(x) + C`.\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve the given expression, we need to expand and simplify the polynomial:\n\n\\[ 11 \\cdot z^3 \\cdot (87 \\cdot z^2 + 81 \\cdot z) \\cdot (-99 \\cdot z^3 + 45 \\cdot z^2 + 5) \\]\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Expand the Inner Parentheses**: \n   - First, expand \\( (87 \\cdot z^2 + 81 \\cdot z) \\cdot (-99 \\cdot z^3 + 45 \\cdot z^2 + 5) \\).\n   - This involves distributing each term in the first parenthesis with each term in the second parenthesis.\n\n2. **Multiply by the Outer Term**:\n   - Once the inner expression is expanded, multiply the result by \\( 11 \\cdot z^3 \\).\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms**:\n   - After expansion, combine like terms to simplify the expression.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpression = 11 * z**3 * (87 * z**2 + 81 * z) * (-99 * z**3 + 45 * z**2 + 5)\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expression = expand(expression)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the expanded polynomial.",
