    "To simplify the expression \\((51 - 12*y**3)*(84*y**2 + 48*y + 89)*(-77*y**3 + 62*y**2 + 99*y - 9)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves expanding the expression by multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, and then multiplying the resulting polynomial by the third polynomial.\n\nThe expression is a product of three polynomials:\n1. \\(51 - 12*y**3\\)\n2. \\(84*y**2 + 48*y + 89\\)\n3. \\(-77*y**3 + 62*y**2 + 99*y - 9\\)\n\nThe process involves:\n1. First, multiply the first two polynomials.\n2. Then, multiply the result by the third polynomial.\n\nThis is a complex operation due to the number of terms involved, so it is efficient to use a symbolic computation tool like Python's `sympy` library to handle the expansion and simplification.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this operation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 51 - 12*y**3\npoly2 = 84*y**2 + 48*y + 89\npoly3 = -77*y**3 + 62*y**2 + 99*y - 9\n\n# Perform the multiplication and expansion\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the simplified result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis script will compute the expanded form of the given expression. Let's execute it to find the simplified expression.",
