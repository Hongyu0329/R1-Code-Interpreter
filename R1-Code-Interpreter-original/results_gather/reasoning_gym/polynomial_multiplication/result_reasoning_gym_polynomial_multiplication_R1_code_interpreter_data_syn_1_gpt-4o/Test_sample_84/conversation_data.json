    "To solve the given expression \\((62*z + 97)*(10*z**2 + 11*z + 67)*(-41*z**3 + 53*z - 74)\\), we need to expand it step by step. This involves multiplying the polynomials together.\n\n### Step-by-step Expansion:\n\n1. **First, expand the first two polynomials:**\n   \\((62*z + 97)*(10*z**2 + 11*z + 67)\\)\n\n2. **Then, multiply the result with the third polynomial:**\n   \\((Result\\ from\\ Step\\ 1)*(-41*z**3 + 53*z - 74)\\)\n\n### Detailed Calculation:\n\n1. **Expand \\((62*z + 97)*(10*z**2 + 11*z + 67)\\):**\n\n   - Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n   - Collect like terms.\n\n2. **Multiply the result with \\((-41*z**3 + 53*z - 74)\\):**\n\n   - Again, multiply each term in the result from step 1 by each term in the third polynomial.\n   - Collect like terms.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 62*z + 97\npoly2 = 10*z**2 + 11*z + 67\npoly3 = -41*z**3 + 53*z - 74\n\n# Expand the first two polynomials\nexpanded_poly1_2 = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Expand the result with the third polynomial\nfinal_expansion = expand(expanded_poly1_2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the final expanded polynomial\nprint(final_expansion)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the expanded form of the given expression. Let's execute it to find the result.",
