    "To simplify the expression \\((-101*y - 28)*(-8*y - 47)\\), we need to apply the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for binomials. This involves multiplying each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Multiply the first terms: \\((-101*y) * (-8*y) = 808*y**2\\).\n2. Multiply the outer terms: \\((-101*y) * (-47) = 4747*y\\).\n3. Multiply the inner terms: \\((-28) * (-8*y) = 224*y\\).\n4. Multiply the last terms: \\((-28) * (-47) = 1316\\).\n\nNow, combine the results:\n\n- The \\(y**2\\) term is \\(808*y**2\\).\n- The \\(y\\) terms are \\(4747*y + 224*y = 4971*y\\).\n- The constant term is \\(1316\\).\n\nThus, the simplified expression is:\n\n\\[808*y**2 + 4971*y + 1316\\]\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpression = (-101*y - 28)*(-8*y - 47)\n\n# Simplify the expression\nsimplified_expression = expand(expression)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(simplified_expression)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\n<<<808*y**2 + 4971*y + 1316>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed the simplification of the expression. The simplified expression is:\n\n<<<808*y**2 + 4971*y + 1316>>>"
