    "To solve the expression \\((99*z + 86)*(70*z**3 + 57*z**2 - 7)\\), we need to expand it by distributing each term in the first polynomial with each term in the second polynomial. This involves multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication:\n\n1. Multiply \\(99*z\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(99*z * 70*z**3 = 6930*z**4\\)\n   - \\(99*z * 57*z**2 = 5643*z**3\\)\n   - \\(99*z * (-7) = -693*z\\)\n\n2. Multiply \\(86\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(86 * 70*z**3 = 6020*z**3\\)\n   - \\(86 * 57*z**2 = 4902*z**2\\)\n   - \\(86 * (-7) = -602\\)\n\nNow, combine all these terms:\n\n- \\(6930*z**4\\)\n- \\(5643*z**3 + 6020*z**3 = 11663*z**3\\)\n- \\(4902*z**2\\)\n- \\(-693*z\\)\n- \\(-602\\)\n\nThe expanded expression is:\n\\[ 6930*z**4 + 11663*z**3 + 4902*z**2 - 693*z - 602 \\]\n\nLet's write a Python script to compute this expression for a given value of \\(z\\).\n\n```python\ndef compute_expression(z):\n    term1 = 6930 * z**4\n    term2 = 11663 * z**3\n    term3 = 4902 * z**2\n    term4 = -693 * z\n    term5 = -602\n    result = term1 + term2 + term3 + term4 + term5\n    return result\n\n# Example: Compute the expression for z = 1\nz_value = 1\nresult = compute_expression(z_value)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function to compute the expression for any given value of \\(z\\) and then calculates it for \\(z = 1\\). Let's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output for \\(z = 1\\) is 22200. This means that when we substitute \\(z = 1\\) into the expanded expression, the result is 22200.\n\n<<<22200>>>"
