    "To solve the expression \\((22*z**3 - 34)*(67*z**3 + 65*z + 94)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication step-by-step:\n\n1. Multiply \\(22*z**3\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(22*z**3 * 67*z**3 = 1474*z**6\\)\n   - \\(22*z**3 * 65*z = 1430*z**4\\)\n   - \\(22*z**3 * 94 = 2068*z**3\\)\n\n2. Multiply \\(-34\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(-34 * 67*z**3 = -2278*z**3\\)\n   - \\(-34 * 65*z = -2210*z\\)\n   - \\(-34 * 94 = -3196\\)\n\n3. Combine like terms:\n   - The \\(z**6\\) term is \\(1474*z**6\\).\n   - The \\(z**4\\) term is \\(1430*z**4\\).\n   - The \\(z**3\\) terms are \\(2068*z**3 - 2278*z**3 = -210*z**3\\).\n   - The \\(z\\) term is \\(-2210*z\\).\n   - The constant term is \\(-3196\\).\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform these calculations and verify the result.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 22*z**3 - 34\npoly2 = 67*z**3 + 65*z + 94\n\n# Perform the multiplication\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the expanded form of the polynomial multiplication and print the result. Let's execute it to verify our manual calculations.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the expanded polynomial expression. The result of the multiplication is:\n\n\\[ 1474*z**6 + 1430*z**4 - 210*z**3 - 2210*z - 3196 \\]\n\nThis matches our manual calculations. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1474*z**6 + 1430*z**4 - 210*z**3 - 2210*z - 3196>>>"
