    "To simplify the expression \\((-49*x**3 + 93*x)*(78*x**3 + 11)*(80*x**3 - 71*x)\\), we need to expand the product of these three polynomials. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial across the terms in the second and third polynomials.\n\nThe expression is a product of three polynomials:\n1. \\(-49*x**3 + 93*x\\)\n2. \\(78*x**3 + 11\\)\n3. \\(80*x**3 - 71*x\\)\n\nThe process involves:\n- First, expanding the product of the first two polynomials.\n- Then, expanding the result with the third polynomial.\n\nLet's perform the expansion using Python to handle the algebraic manipulation efficiently.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = -49*x**3 + 93*x\npoly2 = 78*x**3 + 11\npoly3 = 80*x**3 - 71*x\n\n# Expand the product of the three polynomials\nexpanded_expression = expand(poly1 * poly2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the expression and provide the simplified form. Let's execute it to find the result.",
