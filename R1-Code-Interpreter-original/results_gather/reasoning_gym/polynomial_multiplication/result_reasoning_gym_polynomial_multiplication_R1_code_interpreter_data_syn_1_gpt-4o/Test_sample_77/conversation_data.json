    "To simplify the expression \\((65*y + 15)*(-105*y**3 + 86*y**2)\\), we need to distribute each term in the first polynomial across each term in the second polynomial. This involves multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication:\n\n1. Multiply \\(65*y\\) by \\(-105*y**3\\) and \\(86*y**2\\).\n2. Multiply \\(15\\) by \\(-105*y**3\\) and \\(86*y**2\\).\n\nAfter performing these multiplications, we will combine like terms to simplify the expression.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpr = (65*y + 15)*(-105*y**3 + 86*y**2)\n\n# Expand the expression\nsimplified_expr = expand(expr)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(simplified_expr)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the simplified expression.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the simplified expression. The expression \\((65*y + 15)*(-105*y**3 + 86*y**2)\\) simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-6825*y**4 + 4015*y**3 + 1290*y**2\n\\]\n\nThus, the final simplified expression is:\n\n<<<-6825*y**4 + 4015*y**3 + 1290*y**2>>>"
