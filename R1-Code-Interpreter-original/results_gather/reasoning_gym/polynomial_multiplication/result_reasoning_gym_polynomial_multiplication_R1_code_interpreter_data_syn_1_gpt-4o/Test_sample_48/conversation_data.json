    "To simplify the expression \\((-89*y - 80)*(80*y**2 - 68)*(48*y**3 - 81*y**2)\\), we need to expand the product of these three polynomials. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial across the terms in the second and third polynomials, and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Expand the first two polynomials**: \n   \\((-89*y - 80)*(80*y**2 - 68)\\)\n\n2. **Expand the result with the third polynomial**:\n   \\((result)*(48*y**3 - 81*y**2)\\)\n\n3. **Combine like terms**: After expanding, we will combine terms with the same power of \\(y\\).\n\nTo perform these calculations efficiently, we can use Python's symbolic computation library, SymPy, which will handle the polynomial expansion and simplification for us.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the polynomials\nexpr1 = -89*y - 80\nexpr2 = 80*y**2 - 68\nexpr3 = 48*y**3 - 81*y**2\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expr = expand(expr1 * expr2 * expr3)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(expanded_expr)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the given expression and simplify it by combining like terms. Let's execute the code to get the simplified expression.",
