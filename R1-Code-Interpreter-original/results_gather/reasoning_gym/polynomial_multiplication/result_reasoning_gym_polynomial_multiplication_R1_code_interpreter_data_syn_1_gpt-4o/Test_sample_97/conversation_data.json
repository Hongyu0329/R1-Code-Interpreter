    "To simplify the given expression \\((-43*z**2 + 89*z)*(115*z**2 + 18*z)*(10*z**3 + 75*z**2 - 12*z)\\), we need to expand the product of these three polynomials. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial across the terms in the second and third polynomials, and then combining like terms.\n\nThe expression is a product of three polynomials:\n1. \\(-43*z**2 + 89*z\\)\n2. \\(115*z**2 + 18*z\\)\n3. \\(10*z**3 + 75*z**2 - 12*z\\)\n\nThe process involves:\n1. Expanding the first two polynomials: \\((-43*z**2 + 89*z)*(115*z**2 + 18*z)\\).\n2. Expanding the result with the third polynomial: \\((result)*(10*z**3 + 75*z**2 - 12*z)\\).\n3. Combining like terms to simplify the expression.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = -43*z**2 + 89*z\npoly2 = 115*z**2 + 18*z\npoly3 = 10*z**3 + 75*z**2 - 12*z\n\n# Expand the product of the first two polynomials\nexpanded_poly1_2 = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Expand the result with the third polynomial\nexpanded_expression = expand(expanded_poly1_2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the expression and combine like terms to provide the simplified polynomial. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
