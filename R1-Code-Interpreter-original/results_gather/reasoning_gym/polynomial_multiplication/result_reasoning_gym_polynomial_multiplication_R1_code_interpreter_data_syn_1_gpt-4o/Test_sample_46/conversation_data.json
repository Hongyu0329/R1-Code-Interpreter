    "To simplify the expression \\((86*x**2 + 57*x)*(44*x**3 - 31*x + 49)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication:\n\n1. Multiply each term in the first polynomial \\(86*x**2 + 57*x\\) by each term in the second polynomial \\(44*x**3 - 31*x + 49\\).\n\n2. Combine the results and simplify by combining like terms.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 86*x**2 + 57*x\npoly2 = 44*x**3 - 31*x + 49\n\n# Perform the multiplication and simplify\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the simplified expression.",
