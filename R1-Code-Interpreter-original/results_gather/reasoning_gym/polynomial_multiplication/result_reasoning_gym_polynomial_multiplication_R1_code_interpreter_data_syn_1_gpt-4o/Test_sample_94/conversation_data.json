    "To simplify the expression \\((-38*z**2 + 18*z)*(30*z**2 - 135*z)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n1. The first polynomial is \\(-38*z**2 + 18*z\\).\n2. The second polynomial is \\(30*z**2 - 135*z\\).\n\nWe will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n\n- Multiply \\(-38*z**2\\) by \\(30*z**2\\).\n- Multiply \\(-38*z**2\\) by \\(-135*z\\).\n- Multiply \\(18*z\\) by \\(30*z**2\\).\n- Multiply \\(18*z\\) by \\(-135*z\\).\n\nAfter performing these multiplications, we will combine like terms to simplify the expression.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = -38*z**2 + 18*z\npoly2 = 30*z**2 - 135*z\n\n# Perform the multiplication and simplify\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the simplified expression.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the simplified expression. The result of simplifying the expression \\((-38*z**2 + 18*z)*(30*z**2 - 135*z)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-1140*z**4 + 5670*z**3 - 2430*z**2\n\\]\n\nThus, the final simplified expression is:\n\n<<<-1140*z**4 + 5670*z**3 - 2430*z**2>>>"
