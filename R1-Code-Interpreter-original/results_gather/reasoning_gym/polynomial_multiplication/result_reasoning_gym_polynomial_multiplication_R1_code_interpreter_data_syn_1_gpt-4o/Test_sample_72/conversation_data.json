    "To solve the expression \\((-101*x - 19)*(-75*x^2 + 42*x + 48)\\), we need to expand it by distributing each term in the first polynomial with each term in the second polynomial. This involves multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication:\n\n1. Multiply \\(-101*x\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(-101*x * -75*x^2 = 7575*x^3\\)\n   - \\(-101*x * 42*x = -4242*x^2\\)\n   - \\(-101*x * 48 = -4848*x\\)\n\n2. Multiply \\(-19\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(-19 * -75*x^2 = 1425*x^2\\)\n   - \\(-19 * 42*x = -798*x\\)\n   - \\(-19 * 48 = -912\\)\n\nNow, combine all these terms:\n\n- \\(7575*x^3\\)\n- \\((-4242*x^2 + 1425*x^2) = -2817*x^2\\)\n- \\((-4848*x - 798*x) = -5646*x\\)\n- \\(-912\\)\n\nThe expanded polynomial is:\n\\[ 7575*x^3 - 2817*x^2 - 5646*x - 912 \\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\nx = symbols('x')\nexpression = (-101*x - 19) * (-75*x**2 + 42*x + 48)\nexpanded_expression = expand(expression)\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the given expression and print the result. Let's execute it to confirm our manual calculation.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The expanded form of the expression \\((-101*x - 19)*(-75*x^2 + 42*x + 48)\\) is:\n\n<<<7575*x**3 - 2817*x**2 - 5646*x - 912>>>"
