    "To simplify the expression \\(140*y^2*(y^2 - 67*y)*(-10*y^3 + 65*y^2 + 98)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand the Expression**: We will expand the expression by multiplying the terms together. This involves distributing each term in the parentheses across the other terms.\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms**: After expanding, we will combine any like terms to simplify the expression further.\n\nLet's start by expanding the expression:\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 140*y^2*(y^2 - 67*y)*(-10*y^3 + 65*y^2 + 98) \\]\n\nWe will first expand the inner terms:\n\\[ (y^2 - 67*y)*(-10*y^3 + 65*y^2 + 98) \\]\n\nThen, multiply the result by \\(140*y^2\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpression = 140*y**2 * (y**2 - 67*y) * (-10*y**3 + 65*y**2 + 98)\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expression = expand(expression)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the expression and print the simplified form. Let's execute it to see the result.",
