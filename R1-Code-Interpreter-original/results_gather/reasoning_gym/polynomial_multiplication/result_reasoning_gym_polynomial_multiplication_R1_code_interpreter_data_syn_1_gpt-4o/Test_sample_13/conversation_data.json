    "To simplify the expression \\((74 - 123*y**3)*(96 - 104*y**2)*(15*y**3 - 36)\\), we need to expand the product of these three polynomials. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial across the terms in the second and third polynomials, and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Expand the first two polynomials**: \\((74 - 123*y**3)*(96 - 104*y**2)\\).\n2. **Expand the result with the third polynomial**: \\((result)*(15*y**3 - 36)\\).\n3. **Combine like terms** to simplify the expression.\n\nTo perform these calculations efficiently, we can use Python's symbolic computation library, SymPy, which allows us to handle polynomial expansions and simplifications.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the polynomials\nexpr1 = 74 - 123*y**3\nexpr2 = 96 - 104*y**2\nexpr3 = 15*y**3 - 36\n\n# Expand the first two polynomials\nexpanded_expr1_2 = expand(expr1 * expr2)\n\n# Expand the result with the third polynomial\nfinal_expansion = expand(expanded_expr1_2 * expr3)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(final_expansion)\n```\n\nThis script will expand the given expression and simplify it by combining like terms. Let's execute the code to get the simplified expression.",
