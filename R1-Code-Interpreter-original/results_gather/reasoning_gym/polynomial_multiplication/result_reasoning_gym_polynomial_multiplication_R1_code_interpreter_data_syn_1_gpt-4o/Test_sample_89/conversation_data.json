    "To simplify the expression \\((155*x + 55)*(-55*x**2 - 86*x - 56)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication step-by-step:\n\n1. Multiply \\(155*x\\) by each term in \\(-55*x**2 - 86*x - 56\\):\n   - \\(155*x * -55*x**2 = -8525*x**3\\)\n   - \\(155*x * -86*x = -13330*x**2\\)\n   - \\(155*x * -56 = -8680*x\\)\n\n2. Multiply \\(55\\) by each term in \\(-55*x**2 - 86*x - 56\\):\n   - \\(55 * -55*x**2 = -3025*x**2\\)\n   - \\(55 * -86*x = -4730*x\\)\n   - \\(55 * -56 = -3080\\)\n\n3. Combine all the terms:\n   - Combine the \\(x**3\\) terms: \\(-8525*x**3\\)\n   - Combine the \\(x**2\\) terms: \\(-13330*x**2 - 3025*x**2 = -16355*x**2\\)\n   - Combine the \\(x\\) terms: \\(-8680*x - 4730*x = -13410*x\\)\n   - Constant term: \\(-3080\\)\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform these calculations and verify the result.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpr = (155*x + 55)*(-55*x**2 - 86*x - 56)\n\n# Expand the expression\nsimplified_expr = expand(expr)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(simplified_expr)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the simplified expression.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the simplified expression. Based on the output, the simplified form of the expression \\((155*x + 55)*(-55*x**2 - 86*x - 56)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-8525*x^3 - 16355*x^2 - 13410*x - 3080\n\\]\n\n<<<-8525*x**3 - 16355*x**2 - 13410*x - 3080>>>"
