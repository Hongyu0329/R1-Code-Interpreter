    "To simplify the expression \\((66 - 83*x**2)*(-42*x**2 + 89*x + 52)*(78*x**2 + 6*x - 70)\\), we need to expand the product of these three polynomials. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial across the terms in the second and third polynomials, and then combining like terms.\n\nThe expression is a product of three polynomials:\n1. \\(66 - 83*x**2\\)\n2. \\(-42*x**2 + 89*x + 52\\)\n3. \\(78*x**2 + 6*x - 70\\)\n\nThe process involves:\n1. Expanding the product of the first two polynomials.\n2. Expanding the result with the third polynomial.\n3. Combining like terms to simplify the expression.\n\nGiven the complexity of the expression, it is efficient to use a symbolic computation tool like Python's `sympy` library to perform the expansion and simplification.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 66 - 83*x**2\npoly2 = -42*x**2 + 89*x + 52\npoly3 = 78*x**2 + 6*x - 70\n\n# Expand the product of the three polynomials\nexpanded_expr = expand(poly1 * poly2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(expanded_expr)\n```\n\nThis script will expand the expression and combine like terms to provide the simplified form. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
