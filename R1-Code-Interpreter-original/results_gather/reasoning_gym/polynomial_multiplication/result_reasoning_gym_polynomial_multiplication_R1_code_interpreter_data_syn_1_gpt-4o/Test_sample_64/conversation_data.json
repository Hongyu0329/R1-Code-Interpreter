    "To solve the expression \\((3 - 54*y**2)*(10 - 73*y**3)*(-46*y**3 - 60*y)\\), we need to expand and simplify it. The expression involves three terms, and we will multiply them together.\n\n1. **Expression Breakdown:**\n   - The expression is \\((3 - 54*y**2)\\), \\((10 - 73*y**3)\\), and \\((-46*y**3 - 60*y)\\).\n   - We need to multiply these three expressions together.\n\n2. **Multiplication Process:**\n   - First, multiply the first two expressions: \\((3 - 54*y**2)*(10 - 73*y**3)\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by the third expression: \\((-46*y**3 - 60*y)\\).\n\n3. **Simplification:**\n   - We will expand the terms and combine like terms to simplify the expression.\n\nLet's perform the calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the expressions\nexpr1 = (3 - 54*y**2)\nexpr2 = (10 - 73*y**3)\nexpr3 = (-46*y**3 - 60*y)\n\n# Multiply and expand the expressions\nresult = expand(expr1 * expr2 * expr3)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the expanded and simplified form of the expression.",
