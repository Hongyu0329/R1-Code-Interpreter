    "To solve the expression \\((29 - 49*y^2)*(21*y^3 + 49*y)\\), we need to expand it by multiplying each term in the first parenthesis by each term in the second parenthesis. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The expression is \\((29 - 49*y^2)*(21*y^3 + 49*y)\\).\n\n2. Distribute each term in the first parenthesis across each term in the second parenthesis:\n\n   - \\(29 * 21*y^3 = 609*y^3\\)\n   - \\(29 * 49*y = 1421*y\\)\n   - \\(-49*y^2 * 21*y^3 = -1029*y^5\\)\n   - \\(-49*y^2 * 49*y = -2401*y^3\\)\n\n3. Combine like terms:\n\n   - The terms involving \\(y^5\\) are \\(-1029*y^5\\).\n   - The terms involving \\(y^3\\) are \\(609*y^3 - 2401*y^3 = -1792*y^3\\).\n   - The terms involving \\(y\\) are \\(1421*y\\).\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to compute this expression and verify the result.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpression = (29 - 49*y**2)*(21*y**3 + 49*y)\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expression = expand(expression)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the expanded expression.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the expanded expression as \\(-1029*y^5 - 1792*y^3 + 1421*y\\). This matches our manual calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final expanded expression is:\n\n<<<-1029*y**5 - 1792*y**3 + 1421*y>>>"
