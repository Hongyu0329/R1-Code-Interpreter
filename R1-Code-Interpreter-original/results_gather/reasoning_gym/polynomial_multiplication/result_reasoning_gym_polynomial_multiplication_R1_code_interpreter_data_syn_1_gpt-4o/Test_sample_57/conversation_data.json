    "To simplify the expression \\((54*x**2 - 45)*(72*x**2 - 12)*(22*x**3 - 89*x**2 + 29*x)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves expanding the expression by multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, and then multiplying the resulting polynomial by the third polynomial.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Multiply the first two polynomials**: \\((54*x**2 - 45)\\) and \\((72*x**2 - 12)\\).\n   - Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n   - Combine like terms.\n\n2. **Multiply the result by the third polynomial**: \\((22*x**3 - 89*x**2 + 29*x)\\).\n   - Again, multiply each term in the resulting polynomial by each term in the third polynomial.\n   - Combine like terms to get the final simplified expression.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 54*x**2 - 45\npoly2 = 72*x**2 - 12\npoly3 = 22*x**3 - 89*x**2 + 29*x\n\n# Multiply the first two polynomials\nresult1 = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Multiply the result by the third polynomial\nfinal_result = expand(result1 * poly3)\n\n# Print the final simplified expression\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the expanded form of the given expression. Let's execute it to find the simplified expression.",
