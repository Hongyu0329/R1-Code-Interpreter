    "To simplify the expression \\(-588*y**3 - 903*y**2 - 2835\\), we need to look for common factors in the terms. The expression is a polynomial in \\(y\\), and we can factor out the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients.\n\nThe coefficients are:\n- \\(-588\\) for \\(y**3\\)\n- \\(-903\\) for \\(y**2\\)\n- \\(-2835\\) for the constant term\n\nFirst, we need to find the GCD of these coefficients. Once we have the GCD, we can factor it out from the expression.\n\nLet's calculate the GCD of these numbers using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients\ncoeff1 = -588\ncoeff2 = -903\ncoeff3 = -2835\n\n# Calculate GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(math.gcd(abs(coeff1), abs(coeff2)), abs(coeff3))\n\nprint(gcd)\n```\n\nOnce we have the GCD, we can factor it out from the expression. Let's execute the code to find the GCD.",
    "The GCD of the coefficients \\(-588\\), \\(-903\\), and \\(-2835\\) is \\(21\\). We can factor this GCD out of the expression:\n\n1. Divide each coefficient by the GCD:\n   - \\(-588 / 21 = -28\\)\n   - \\(-903 / 21 = -43\\)\n   - \\(-2835 / 21 = -135\\)\n\n2. Rewrite the expression by factoring out the GCD:\n   \\[\n   -588*y**3 - 903*y**2 - 2835 = 21*(-28*y**3 - 43*y**2 - 135)\n   \\]\n\nThus, the simplified expression is:\n\\[\n21*(-28*y**3 - 43*y**2 - 135)\n\\]\n\n<<<21*(-28*y**3 - 43*y**2 - 135)>>>"
