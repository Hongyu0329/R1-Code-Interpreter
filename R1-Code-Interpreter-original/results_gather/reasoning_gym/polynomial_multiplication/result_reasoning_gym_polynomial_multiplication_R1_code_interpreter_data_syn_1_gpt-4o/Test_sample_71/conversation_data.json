    "To simplify the given expression \\((-85*z**2 - 51*z)*(14*z**2 - 75)*(60*z**3 + 90*z**2 - 16*z + 78)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves expanding the expression by multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, and then multiplying the resulting polynomial by the third polynomial.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **First Multiplication**: Multiply \\((-85*z**2 - 51*z)\\) by \\((14*z**2 - 75)\\).\n2. **Second Multiplication**: Multiply the result from the first multiplication by \\((60*z**3 + 90*z**2 - 16*z + 78)\\).\n\nThis process can be quite complex due to the number of terms involved, so using a symbolic computation tool like Python's `sympy` library can help automate the expansion and simplification.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = -85*z**2 - 51*z\npoly2 = 14*z**2 - 75\npoly3 = 60*z**3 + 90*z**2 - 16*z + 78\n\n# Perform the multiplications\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the simplified result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis script will expand and simplify the expression, providing us with the final simplified polynomial. Let's execute this code to find the result.",
