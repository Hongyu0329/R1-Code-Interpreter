    "To solve the expression \\((-95*z**2 - 58*z)*(54*z**3 + 34*z - 14)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication step-by-step:\n\n1. **Distribute \\(-95*z**2\\) across each term in the second polynomial:**\n   - \\(-95*z**2 * 54*z**3 = -5130*z**5\\)\n   - \\(-95*z**2 * 34*z = -3230*z**3\\)\n   - \\(-95*z**2 * (-14) = 1330*z**2\\)\n\n2. **Distribute \\(-58*z\\) across each term in the second polynomial:**\n   - \\(-58*z * 54*z**3 = -3132*z**4\\)\n   - \\(-58*z * 34*z = -1972*z**2\\)\n   - \\(-58*z * (-14) = 812*z\\)\n\n3. **Combine all the terms:**\n   - \\(-5130*z**5\\)\n   - \\(-3132*z**4\\)\n   - \\(-3230*z**3\\)\n   - \\(1330*z**2 - 1972*z**2 = -642*z**2\\)\n   - \\(812*z\\)\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform these calculations and combine the terms:\n\n```python\n# Define the coefficients for each term\ncoefficients = {\n    'z**5': -95 * 54,\n    'z**4': -58 * 54,\n    'z**3': -95 * 34,\n    'z**2': -95 * (-14) - 58 * 34,\n    'z': -58 * (-14)\n}\n\n# Calculate each term\nz5 = coefficients['z**5']\nz4 = coefficients['z**4']\nz3 = coefficients['z**3']\nz2 = coefficients['z**2']\nz1 = coefficients['z']\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"{z5}*z**5 + {z4}*z**4 + {z3}*z**3 + {z2}*z**2 + {z1}*z\")\n```\n\nThis script calculates the coefficients for each term in the resulting polynomial and prints the final expression. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output provides the expanded polynomial expression. The final expression after multiplying the given polynomials is:\n\n\\[\n-5130*z**5 - 3132*z**4 - 3230*z**3 - 642*z**2 + 812*z\n\\]\n\nThis expression represents the result of the multiplication of the two polynomials.\n\n<<<-5130*z**5 - 3132*z**4 - 3230*z**3 - 642*z**2 + 812*z>>>"
