    "To simplify the expression \\((71 - 8*z**3)*(-13*z**3 + z**2)*(50*z**3 + 4*z**2 + 9*z + 44)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves expanding the expression by distributing each term in the first polynomial across the terms in the second and third polynomials.\n\nThe expression is a product of three polynomials:\n1. \\(71 - 8*z**3\\)\n2. \\(-13*z**3 + z**2\\)\n3. \\(50*z**3 + 4*z**2 + 9*z + 44\\)\n\nThe process involves:\n1. First, multiply the first two polynomials: \\((71 - 8*z**3)*(-13*z**3 + z**2)\\).\n2. Then, multiply the result by the third polynomial: \\((result)* (50*z**3 + 4*z**2 + 9*z + 44)\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 71 - 8*z**3\npoly2 = -13*z**3 + z**2\npoly3 = 50*z**3 + 4*z**2 + 9*z + 44\n\n# Perform the multiplication and expansion\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the expanded form of the given expression. Let's execute it to find the simplified polynomial.",
