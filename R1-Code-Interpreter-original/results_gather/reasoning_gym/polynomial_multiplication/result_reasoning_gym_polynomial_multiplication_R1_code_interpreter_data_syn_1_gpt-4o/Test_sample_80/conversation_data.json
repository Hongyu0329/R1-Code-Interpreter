    "To simplify the expression \\((50 - 87*y**2)*(-67*y**3 + 112*y**2)*(-21*y**3 + 29*y - 59)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves expanding the expression by multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, and then multiplying the resulting polynomial by the third polynomial.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Multiply the first two polynomials**: \\((50 - 87*y**2)\\) and \\((-67*y**3 + 112*y**2)\\).\n   - Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n   - Combine like terms.\n\n2. **Multiply the resulting polynomial by the third polynomial**: \\((-21*y**3 + 29*y - 59)\\).\n   - Again, multiply each term in the resulting polynomial by each term in the third polynomial.\n   - Combine like terms to get the final simplified expression.\n\nThis process can be quite complex due to the number of terms involved, so using a computational approach with Python will help ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these polynomial multiplications and simplify the expression.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 50 - 87*y**2\npoly2 = -67*y**3 + 112*y**2\npoly3 = -21*y**3 + 29*y - 59\n\n# Multiply the first two polynomials\nresult1 = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Multiply the result with the third polynomial\nfinal_result = expand(result1 * poly3)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nThis script will compute the expanded and simplified form of the given expression. Let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
