    "To simplify the expression \\((51*x**3 + 30*x**2)*(47*x**3 + 64*x**2 + 52)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication:\n\n1. Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(51*x**3 * 47*x**3\\)\n   - \\(51*x**3 * 64*x**2\\)\n   - \\(51*x**3 * 52\\)\n   - \\(30*x**2 * 47*x**3\\)\n   - \\(30*x**2 * 64*x**2\\)\n   - \\(30*x**2 * 52\\)\n\n2. Combine the results:\n   - \\(51*47*x**6\\)\n   - \\(51*64*x**5\\)\n   - \\(51*52*x**3\\)\n   - \\(30*47*x**5\\)\n   - \\(30*64*x**4\\)\n   - \\(30*52*x**2\\)\n\n3. Combine like terms:\n   - Combine terms with the same power of \\(x\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 51*x**3 + 30*x**2\npoly2 = 47*x**3 + 64*x**2 + 52\n\n# Perform the multiplication and simplify\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Print the simplified result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the simplified polynomial expression.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the simplified polynomial expression. The expression \\((51*x**3 + 30*x**2)*(47*x**3 + 64*x**2 + 52)\\) simplifies to:\n\n<<<2397*x**6 + 4674*x**5 + 1920*x**4 + 2652*x**3 + 1560*x**2>>>"
