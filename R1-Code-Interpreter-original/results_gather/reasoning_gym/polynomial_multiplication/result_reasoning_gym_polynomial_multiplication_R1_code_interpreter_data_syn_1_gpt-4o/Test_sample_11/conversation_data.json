    "To simplify the expression \\((74*x**2 + 98*x + 16)*(77*x**2 + 8*x - 49)*(-163*x**3 - 49*x + 8)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves expanding the expression by multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, and then multiplying the resulting polynomial by each term in the third polynomial.\n\nGiven the complexity of the expression, it is efficient to use a symbolic computation tool like Python's `sympy` library to handle the expansion and simplification. Let's write a Python script to perform this operation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 74*x**2 + 98*x + 16\npoly2 = 77*x**2 + 8*x - 49\npoly3 = -163*x**3 - 49*x + 8\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expr = expand(poly1 * poly2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(expanded_expr)\n```\n\nThis script will expand the given expression and simplify it to its most reduced form. Let's execute the code to find the simplified expression.",
