    "To solve the expression \\((3*y^2 + 26*y)*(45*y^3 - 37*y^2)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Expand the Expression**: We will distribute each term in the first polynomial across each term in the second polynomial.\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms**: After expanding, we will combine any like terms to simplify the expression.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Expand the Expression\n\nThe expression is \\((3*y^2 + 26*y)*(45*y^3 - 37*y^2)\\).\n\n- Multiply \\(3*y^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n  - \\(3*y^2 * 45*y^3 = 135*y^5\\)\n  - \\(3*y^2 * -37*y^2 = -111*y^4\\)\n\n- Multiply \\(26*y\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n  - \\(26*y * 45*y^3 = 1170*y^4\\)\n  - \\(26*y * -37*y^2 = -962*y^3\\)\n\n### Step 2: Combine Like Terms\n\nNow, let's combine the like terms from the expanded expression:\n\n- \\(135*y^5\\) (no like terms)\n- Combine \\( -111*y^4\\) and \\(1170*y^4\\) to get \\(1059*y^4\\)\n- \\(-962*y^3\\) (no like terms)\n\nThe expanded and simplified expression is:\n\\[ 135*y^5 + 1059*y^4 - 962*y^3 \\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpression = (3*y**2 + 26*y) * (45*y**3 - 37*y**2)\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expression = expand(expression)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will confirm the result and provide the final answer.",
