    "To solve the expression \\((25 - 87*x**2)*(14*x**2 + 50*x + 89)\\), we need to expand the product of these two polynomials. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Distribute each term in the first polynomial**:\n   - Multiply \\(25\\) by each term in the second polynomial: \n     - \\(25 * 14*x**2\\)\n     - \\(25 * 50*x\\)\n     - \\(25 * 89\\)\n\n2. **Distribute \\(-87*x**2\\) by each term in the second polynomial**:\n   - \\(-87*x**2 * 14*x**2\\)\n   - \\(-87*x**2 * 50*x\\)\n   - \\(-87*x**2 * 89\\)\n\n3. **Combine all the terms**:\n   - Add all the results from the above steps together.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 25 - 87*x**2\npoly2 = 14*x**2 + 50*x + 89\n\n# Expand the product of the two polynomials\nexpanded_poly = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Print the expanded polynomial\nprint(expanded_poly)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the expanded form of the polynomial.",
    "The code has successfully expanded the polynomial expression \\((25 - 87*x**2)*(14*x**2 + 50*x + 89)\\). The expanded form of the polynomial is:\n\n\\[\n-1218*x**4 - 4350*x**3 - 7393*x**2 + 1250*x + 2225\n\\]\n\nThis result is obtained by distributing each term in the first polynomial across each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\n<<<-1218*x**4 - 4350*x**3 - 7393*x**2 + 1250*x + 2225>>>"
