    "To simplify the expression \\((-34*y - 9)*(-15*y**3 + 31*y**2)*(-79*y**2 - 29*y + 81)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves expanding the expression by multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, and then multiplying the resulting polynomial by the third polynomial.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Multiply the first two polynomials**: \n   \\((-34*y - 9)\\) and \\((-15*y**3 + 31*y**2)\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the result by the third polynomial**: \n   \\((-79*y**2 - 29*y + 81)\\).\n\nThis is a straightforward but potentially lengthy process due to the number of terms involved. We will use Python to handle the polynomial multiplication efficiently.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = -34*y - 9\npoly2 = -15*y**3 + 31*y**2\npoly3 = -79*y**2 - 29*y + 81\n\n# Perform the multiplication\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the expanded form of the given expression. Let's execute it to get the simplified polynomial.",
