    "To solve the given expression \\((107*x**3 + 16)*(88*x**3 + 99*x**2 - 25*x)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication step-by-step:\n\n1. Multiply \\(107*x**3\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(107*x**3 * 88*x**3 = 9416*x**6\\)\n   - \\(107*x**3 * 99*x**2 = 10593*x**5\\)\n   - \\(107*x**3 * -25*x = -2675*x**4\\)\n\n2. Multiply \\(16\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(16 * 88*x**3 = 1408*x**3\\)\n   - \\(16 * 99*x**2 = 1584*x**2\\)\n   - \\(16 * -25*x = -400*x\\)\n\nNow, we combine all these terms to form the resulting polynomial:\n\n\\[ 9416*x**6 + 10593*x**5 - 2675*x**4 + 1408*x**3 + 1584*x**2 - 400*x \\]\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation and verify the result.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 107*x**3 + 16\npoly2 = 88*x**3 + 99*x**2 - 25*x\n\n# Perform the multiplication\nresult = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches our manual calculations. The expanded polynomial is:\n\n\\[ 9416*x**6 + 10593*x**5 - 2675*x**4 + 1408*x**3 + 1584*x**2 - 400*x \\]\n\nThis is the final result of the multiplication of the given polynomials.\n\n<<<9416*x**6 + 10593*x**5 - 2675*x**4 + 1408*x**3 + 1584*x**2 - 400*x>>>"
