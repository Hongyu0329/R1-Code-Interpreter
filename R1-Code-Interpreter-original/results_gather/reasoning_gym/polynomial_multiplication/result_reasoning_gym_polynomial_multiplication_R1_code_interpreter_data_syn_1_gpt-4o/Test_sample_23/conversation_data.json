    "To simplify the expression \\((95*x**2 - 96*x)*(43*x**3 + 55)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication:\n\n1. Multiply \\(95*x**2\\) by each term in \\(43*x**3 + 55\\):\n   - \\(95*x**2 * 43*x**3 = 95*43*x**(2+3) = 4085*x**5\\)\n   - \\(95*x**2 * 55 = 95*55*x**2 = 5225*x**2\\)\n\n2. Multiply \\(-96*x\\) by each term in \\(43*x**3 + 55\\):\n   - \\(-96*x * 43*x**3 = -96*43*x**(1+3) = -4128*x**4\\)\n   - \\(-96*x * 55 = -96*55*x = -5280*x\\)\n\nNow, let's combine all these terms:\n\n- \\(4085*x**5\\)\n- \\(-4128*x**4\\)\n- \\(5225*x**2\\)\n- \\(-5280*x\\)\n\nSince there are no like terms to combine further, the simplified expression is:\n\n\\[ 4085*x**5 - 4128*x**4 + 5225*x**2 - 5280*x \\]\n\nLet's verify this by writing a Python script to perform the multiplication and simplification:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpr = (95*x**2 - 96*x)*(43*x**3 + 55)\n\n# Expand the expression\nsimplified_expr = expand(expr)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(simplified_expr)\n```\n\nThis code will confirm the simplification by expanding the expression using symbolic computation.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed the simplification of the expression. The simplified expression is:\n\n<<<4085*x**5 - 4128*x**4 + 5225*x**2 - 5280*x>>>"
