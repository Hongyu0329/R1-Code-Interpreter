    "To simplify the expression \\((-16*z**3 + 4*z)*(49*z**3 + 117*z**2 + 88)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n1. The first polynomial is \\(-16*z**3 + 4*z\\).\n2. The second polynomial is \\(49*z**3 + 117*z**2 + 88\\).\n\nWe will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n\n- \\(-16*z**3 * 49*z**3\\)\n- \\(-16*z**3 * 117*z**2\\)\n- \\(-16*z**3 * 88\\)\n- \\(4*z * 49*z**3\\)\n- \\(4*z * 117*z**2\\)\n- \\(4*z * 88\\)\n\nAfter calculating these products, we will combine like terms to simplify the expression. Let's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = -16*z**3 + 4*z\npoly2 = 49*z**3 + 117*z**2 + 88\n\n# Expand the product of the two polynomials\nsimplified_expression = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(simplified_expression)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the simplified expression.",
