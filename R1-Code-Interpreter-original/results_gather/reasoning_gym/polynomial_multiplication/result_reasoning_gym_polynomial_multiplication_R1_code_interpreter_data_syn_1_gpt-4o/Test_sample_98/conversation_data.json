    "To simplify the given expression, we need to multiply the three polynomials together. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n(71*z**2 + 29*z + 51)*(-3*z**3 + 44*z**2 + 95*z)*(-97*z**3 + 84*z**2 - 3*z + 68)\n\\]\n\nThis is a complex polynomial multiplication problem. The best approach is to multiply the polynomials step by step. First, we multiply the first two polynomials, and then multiply the result by the third polynomial.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Multiply the first two polynomials: \\( (71*z**2 + 29*z + 51) \\) and \\( (-3*z**3 + 44*z**2 + 95*z) \\).\n2. Multiply the result from step 1 with the third polynomial: \\( (-97*z**3 + 84*z**2 - 3*z + 68) \\).\n\nTo perform these multiplications, we can use Python to handle the polynomial arithmetic efficiently. Let's write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nz = symbols('z')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 71*z**2 + 29*z + 51\npoly2 = -3*z**3 + 44*z**2 + 95*z\npoly3 = -97*z**3 + 84*z**2 - 3*z + 68\n\n# Multiply the first two polynomials\nresult1 = expand(poly1 * poly2)\n\n# Multiply the result with the third polynomial\nfinal_result = expand(result1 * poly3)\n\n# Print the simplified expression\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nThis script will compute the expanded form of the given expression. Let's execute the code to get the simplified expression.",
