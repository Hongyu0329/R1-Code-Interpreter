    "To simplify the expression \\(-127*x*(13 - 35*x**2)*(57*x**3 + 24*x**2 - 28*x)\\), we need to expand it by distributing the terms. This involves multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, and then multiplying the result by \\(-127*x\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Expand the inner expression**: Multiply \\((13 - 35*x**2)\\) by \\((57*x**3 + 24*x**2 - 28*x)\\).\n2. **Distribute \\(-127*x\\)**: Once the inner expression is expanded, multiply each term by \\(-127*x\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the expression\nexpr = -127 * x * (13 - 35 * x**2) * (57 * x**3 + 24 * x**2 - 28 * x)\n\n# Expand the expression\nexpanded_expr = expand(expr)\n\n# Print the expanded expression\nprint(expanded_expr)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the expression and provide the simplified form. Let's execute it to get the result.",
