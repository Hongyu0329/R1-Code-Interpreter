Use ** instead of ^ to represent exponents. For example, write 7*X**2 instead of 7*X^2.\n2. Always include the * symbol for all multiplication operations in your reasoning steps. For example, write `-3*X**3*sin(X) - 9*X**2*cos(X) + 18*X*sin(X) + 18*cos(X) + C` instead of `-3x3sin(x) - 9x2cos(x) + 18xsin(x) + 18cos(x) + C`.\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To simplify the given expression, we need to multiply the three polynomials:\n\n1. \\((-26*y**3 + 33*y - 50)\\)\n2. \\((-17*y**3 - 77*y**2 + 37)\\)\n3. \\((44*y**3 - 25*y - 14)\\)\n\nThe process involves expanding the product of these polynomials, which can be quite complex due to the number of terms involved. The degree of the resulting polynomial will be the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. Here, each polynomial is of degree 3, so the resulting polynomial will be of degree \\(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\\).\n\nTo perform this multiplication efficiently, we can use Python's symbolic computation library, SymPy, which can handle polynomial expansion and simplification.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this operation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = -26*y**3 + 33*y - 50\npoly2 = -17*y**3 - 77*y**2 + 37\npoly3 = 44*y**3 - 25*y - 14\n\n# Expand the product of the polynomials\nexpanded_poly = expand(poly1 * poly2 * poly3)\n\n# Print the expanded polynomial\nprint(expanded_poly)\n```\n\nThis script will expand the product of the three polynomials and print the simplified result. Let's execute this code to find the simplified expression.",
