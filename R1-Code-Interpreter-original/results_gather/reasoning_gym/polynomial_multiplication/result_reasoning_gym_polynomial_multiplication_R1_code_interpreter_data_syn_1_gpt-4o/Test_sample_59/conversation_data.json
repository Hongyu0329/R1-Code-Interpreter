    "To solve the expression \\((-107*x**3 - 120*x)*(12*x**3 + 50)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.\n\nLet's break down the multiplication step-by-step:\n\n1. Distribute \\(-107*x**3\\) to each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(-107*x**3 * 12*x**3 = -1284*x**6\\)\n   - \\(-107*x**3 * 50 = -5350*x**3\\)\n\n2. Distribute \\(-120*x\\) to each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\(-120*x * 12*x**3 = -1440*x**4\\)\n   - \\(-120*x * 50 = -6000*x\\)\n\nNow, we combine all these terms:\n- \\(-1284*x**6\\)\n- \\(-1440*x**4\\)\n- \\(-5350*x**3\\)\n- \\(-6000*x\\)\n\nThe final polynomial expression is:\n\\(-1284*x**6 - 1440*x**4 - 5350*x**3 - 6000*x\\)\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify this calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\nx = symbols('x')\nexpression = (-107*x**3 - 120*x)*(12*x**3 + 50)\nexpanded_expression = expand(expression)\nprint(expanded_expression)\n```\n\nThis code will expand the given expression and confirm our manual calculation.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The expanded polynomial expression is:\n\n\\[\n-1284*x**6 - 1440*x**4 - 5350*x**3 - 6000*x\n\\]\n\nThis matches the result we derived through the step-by-step distribution and combination of like terms.\n\n<<<-1284*x**6 - 1440*x**4 - 5350*x**3 - 6000*x>>>"
