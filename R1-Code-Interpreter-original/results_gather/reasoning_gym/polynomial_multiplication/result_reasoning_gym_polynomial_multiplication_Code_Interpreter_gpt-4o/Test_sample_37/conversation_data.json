    "\nassistant > To simplify the expression \\((22 - 42*z)*(31*z - 51)\\), we will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials). This involves multiplying each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n(22 - 42*z)*(31*z - 51)\n\\]\n\nLet's expand this step by step:\n\n1. Multiply the first term of the first binomial by the first term of the second binomial:\n   \\[\n   22 * 31*z = 682*z\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply the first term of the first binomial by the second term of the second binomial:\n   \\[\n   22 * (-51) = -1122\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the second term of the first binomial by the first term of the second binomial:\n   \\[\n   -42*z * 31*z = -1302*z**2\n   \\]\n\n4. Multiply the second term of the first binomial by the second term of the second binomial:\n   \\[\n   -42*z * (-51) = 2142*z\n   \\]\n\nNow, combine all these terms:\n\n\\[\n682*z - 1122 - 1302*z**2 + 2142*z\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- Combine the \\(z\\) terms: \\(682*z + 2142*z\\)\n- The constant term is \\(-1122\\)\n- The \\(z^2\\) term is \\(-1302*z**2\\)\n\nLet's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculating the combined terms\nz_term = 682 + 2142\nconstant_term = -1122\nz_squared_term = -1302\n\n# Forming the simplified expression\nsimplified_expression = f\"{z_squared_term}*z**2 + {z_term}*z + {constant_term}\"\nsimplified_expression\nassistant > The simplified expression is:\n\n\\[\n-1302*z**2 + 2824*z - 1122\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1302*z**2 + 2824*z - 1122>>>"
