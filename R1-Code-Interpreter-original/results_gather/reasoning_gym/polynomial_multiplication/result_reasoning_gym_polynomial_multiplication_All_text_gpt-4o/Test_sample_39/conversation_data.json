    "To solve the expression \\((91 - 20*y**2)*(30*y**2 + 47*y - 78)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the terms in each polynomial:**\n   - The first polynomial is \\(91 - 20*y**2\\), which has two terms: \\(91\\) and \\(-20*y**2\\).\n   - The second polynomial is \\(30*y**2 + 47*y - 78\\), which has three terms: \\(30*y**2\\), \\(47*y\\), and \\(-78\\).\n\n2. **Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:**\n   - Multiply \\(91\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n     - \\(91 * 30*y**2 = 2730*y**2\\)\n     - \\(91 * 47*y = 4277*y\\)\n     - \\(91 * -78 = -7098\\)\n\n   - Multiply \\(-20*y**2\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n     - \\(-20*y**2 * 30*y**2 = -600*y**4\\)\n     - \\(-20*y**2 * 47*y = -940*y**3\\)\n     - \\(-20*y**2 * -78 = 1560*y**2\\)\n\n3. **Combine all the terms:**\n   - Combine the results from the multiplication:\n     - \\(-600*y**4\\)\n     - \\(-940*y**3\\)\n     - \\(2730*y**2 + 1560*y**2 = 4290*y**2\\)\n     - \\(4277*y\\)\n     - \\(-7098\\)\n\n4. **Write the final expression:**\n   - The final expression after combining all terms is:\n     \\(-600*y**4 - 940*y**3 + 4290*y**2 + 4277*y - 7098\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-600*y**4 - 940*y**3 + 4290*y**2 + 4277*y - 7098>>>"
