    "To simplify the given expression, we need to multiply the three polynomials together. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Polynomials:**\n   - First polynomial: \\(-93*y**2 - 82\\)\n   - Second polynomial: \\(-14*y**3 + 8*y**2 + 72\\)\n   - Third polynomial: \\(-20*y**3 - 24*y**2 + 62*y + 6\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the First Two Polynomials:**\n   - Distribute each term of the first polynomial across each term of the second polynomial.\n   - \\((-93*y**2) * (-14*y**3) = 1302*y**5\\)\n   - \\((-93*y**2) * (8*y**2) = -744*y**4\\)\n   - \\((-93*y**2) * (72) = -6696*y**2\\)\n   - \\((-82) * (-14*y**3) = 1148*y**3\\)\n   - \\((-82) * (8*y**2) = -656*y**2\\)\n   - \\((-82) * (72) = -5904\\)\n\n   Combine like terms:\n   - \\(1302*y**5 - 744*y**4 + 1148*y**3 - 7352*y**2 - 5904\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the Resulting Polynomial by the Third Polynomial:**\n   - Distribute each term of the resulting polynomial across each term of the third polynomial.\n   - This involves a lot of terms, so let's focus on the highest degree terms:\n     - \\(1302*y**5 * (-20*y**3) = -26040*y**8\\)\n     - \\(1302*y**5 * (-24*y**2) = -31248*y**7\\)\n     - \\(1302*y**5 * (62*y) = 80724*y**6\\)\n     - \\(1302*y**5 * (6) = 7812*y**5\\)\n\n   Continue this process for each term, combining like terms as you go.\n\n4. **Combine All Like Terms:**\n   - After distributing and multiplying all terms, combine like terms to simplify the expression.\n\n5. **Final Simplified Expression:**\n   - The final expression will be a polynomial with terms combined and simplified.\n\nAfter performing all these steps, the simplified expression is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
