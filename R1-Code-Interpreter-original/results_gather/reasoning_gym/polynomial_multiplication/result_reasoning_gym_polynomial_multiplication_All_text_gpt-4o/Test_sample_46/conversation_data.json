    "To simplify the expression \\((86*x**2 + 57*x)*(44*x**3 - 31*x + 49)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. This involves distributing each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Distribute \\(86*x**2\\) across each term in the second polynomial:**\n   - \\(86*x**2 * 44*x**3 = 86*44*x**(2+3) = 3784*x**5\\)\n   - \\(86*x**2 * (-31*x) = 86*(-31)*x**(2+1) = -2666*x**3\\)\n   - \\(86*x**2 * 49 = 86*49*x**2 = 4214*x**2\\)\n\n2. **Distribute \\(57*x\\) across each term in the second polynomial:**\n   - \\(57*x * 44*x**3 = 57*44*x**(1+3) = 2508*x**4\\)\n   - \\(57*x * (-31*x) = 57*(-31)*x**(1+1) = -1767*x**2\\)\n   - \\(57*x * 49 = 57*49*x = 2793*x\\)\n\n3. **Combine all the terms:**\n   - \\(3784*x**5\\) (from step 1)\n   - \\(2508*x**4\\) (from step 2)\n   - \\(-2666*x**3\\) (from step 1)\n   - \\(4214*x**2 - 1767*x**2 = 2447*x**2\\) (combine like terms from steps 1 and 2)\n   - \\(2793*x\\) (from step 2)\n\n4. **Write the final simplified expression:**\n   - Combine all the terms to get the final expression.\n\nThe simplified expression is:\n<<<3784*x**5 + 2508*x**4 - 2666*x**3 + 2447*x**2 + 2793*x>>>"
