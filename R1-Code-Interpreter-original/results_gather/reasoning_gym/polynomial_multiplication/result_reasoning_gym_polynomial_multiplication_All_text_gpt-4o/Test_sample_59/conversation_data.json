    "To solve the expression \\((-107*x**3 - 120*x)*(12*x**3 + 50)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the terms in each polynomial:**\n   - The first polynomial is \\(-107*x**3 - 120*x\\), which has two terms: \\(-107*x**3\\) and \\(-120*x\\).\n   - The second polynomial is \\(12*x**3 + 50\\), which also has two terms: \\(12*x**3\\) and \\(50\\).\n\n2. **Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:**\n   - Multiply \\(-107*x**3\\) by \\(12*x**3\\):\n     \\[\n     -107*x**3 * 12*x**3 = -107*12*x**6 = -1284*x**6\n     \\]\n   - Multiply \\(-107*x**3\\) by \\(50\\):\n     \\[\n     -107*x**3 * 50 = -107*50*x**3 = -5350*x**3\n     \\]\n   - Multiply \\(-120*x\\) by \\(12*x**3\\):\n     \\[\n     -120*x * 12*x**3 = -120*12*x**4 = -1440*x**4\n     \\]\n   - Multiply \\(-120*x\\) by \\(50\\):\n     \\[\n     -120*x * 50 = -120*50*x = -6000*x\n     \\]\n\n3. **Combine all the resulting terms:**\n   - The resulting polynomial from the multiplication is:\n     \\[\n     -1284*x**6 - 1440*x**4 - 5350*x**3 - 6000*x\n     \\]\n\n4. **Write the final answer:**\n   - The expression simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     -1284*x**6 - 1440*x**4 - 5350*x**3 - 6000*x\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1284*x**6 - 1440*x**4 - 5350*x**3 - 6000*x>>>"
