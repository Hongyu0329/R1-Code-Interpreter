    "To simplify the expression \\((22 - 42*z)*(31*z - 51)\\), we will use the distributive property, which states that \\(a*(b + c) = a*b + a*c\\). In this case, we will distribute each term in the first parenthesis across each term in the second parenthesis.\n\n1. **Distribute the first term of the first parenthesis:**\n   - Multiply \\(22\\) by each term in the second parenthesis:\n     - \\(22 * 31*z = 682*z\\)\n     - \\(22 * (-51) = -1122\\)\n\n2. **Distribute the second term of the first parenthesis:**\n   - Multiply \\(-42*z\\) by each term in the second parenthesis:\n     - \\(-42*z * 31*z = -1302*z**2\\)\n     - \\(-42*z * (-51) = 2142*z\\)\n\n3. **Combine all the terms:**\n   - Combine the terms obtained from the distribution:\n     - \\(-1302*z**2\\) (from \\(-42*z * 31*z\\))\n     - \\(682*z + 2142*z = 2824*z\\) (combine the \\(z\\) terms)\n     - \\(-1122\\) (constant term)\n\n4. **Write the simplified expression:**\n   - The expression is now simplified to:\n     \\(-1302*z**2 + 2824*z - 1122\\)\n\nThus, the simplified expression is:\n\n<<<-1302*z**2 + 2824*z - 1122>>>"
