    "To solve the expression \\((39 - 126*z**2)*(93*z**2 - 20*z)\\), we will expand it step by step using the distributive property. This involves multiplying each term in the first expression by each term in the second expression.\n\n1. **Identify the terms in each expression:**\n   - The first expression is \\(39 - 126*z**2\\).\n     - Terms: \\(39\\) and \\(-126*z**2\\).\n   - The second expression is \\(93*z**2 - 20*z\\).\n     - Terms: \\(93*z**2\\) and \\(-20*z\\).\n\n2. **Distribute each term in the first expression to each term in the second expression:**\n   - Multiply \\(39\\) by each term in the second expression:\n     - \\(39 * 93*z**2 = 3627*z**2\\)\n     - \\(39 * -20*z = -780*z\\)\n\n   - Multiply \\(-126*z**2\\) by each term in the second expression:\n     - \\(-126*z**2 * 93*z**2 = -11718*z**4\\)\n     - \\(-126*z**2 * -20*z = 2520*z**3\\)\n\n3. **Combine all the terms:**\n   - The expanded expression is:\n     \\[\n     3627*z**2 - 780*z - 11718*z**4 + 2520*z**3\n     \\]\n\n4. **Rearrange the terms in descending order of the powers of \\(z\\):**\n   - \\(-11718*z**4 + 2520*z**3 + 3627*z**2 - 780*z\\)\n\nThe final expanded expression is:\n\\[\n-11718*z**4 + 2520*z**3 + 3627*z**2 - 780*z\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<<<-11718*z**4 + 2520*z**3 + 3627*z**2 - 780*z>>>"
