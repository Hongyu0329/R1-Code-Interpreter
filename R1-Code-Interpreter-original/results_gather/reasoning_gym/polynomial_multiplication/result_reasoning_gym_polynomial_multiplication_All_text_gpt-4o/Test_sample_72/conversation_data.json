    "To solve the expression \\((-101*x - 19)*(-75*x**2 + 42*x + 48)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the terms in each polynomial:**\n   - The first polynomial is \\(-101*x - 19\\).\n   - The second polynomial is \\(-75*x**2 + 42*x + 48\\).\n\n2. **Distribute each term in the first polynomial across each term in the second polynomial:**\n\n   - Multiply \\(-101*x\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n     - \\(-101*x * -75*x**2 = 7575*x**3\\)\n     - \\(-101*x * 42*x = -4242*x**2\\)\n     - \\(-101*x * 48 = -4848*x\\)\n\n   - Multiply \\(-19\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n     - \\(-19 * -75*x**2 = 1425*x**2\\)\n     - \\(-19 * 42*x = -798*x\\)\n     - \\(-19 * 48 = -912\\)\n\n3. **Combine all the terms:**\n   - \\(7575*x**3\\)\n   - \\(-4242*x**2 + 1425*x**2 = -2817*x**2\\)\n   - \\(-4848*x - 798*x = -5646*x\\)\n   - \\(-912\\)\n\n4. **Write the final expression:**\n   - Combine all the terms to get the final polynomial expression.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<7575*x**3 - 2817*x**2 - 5646*x - 912>>>"
