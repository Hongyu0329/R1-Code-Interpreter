    "To simplify the expression \\((82*z**2 + 21)*(-86*z**3 - 31*z)\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial.**\n\n   The expression is of the form \\((a + b) * (c + d)\\), which can be expanded using the distributive property as:\n   \\[\n   a*c + a*d + b*c + b*d\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the terms:**\n\n   - \\(a = 82*z**2\\)\n   - \\(b = 21\\)\n   - \\(c = -86*z**3\\)\n   - \\(d = -31*z\\)\n\n3. **Perform the distribution:**\n\n   - \\(a*c = 82*z**2 * -86*z**3 = -7052*z**5\\)\n   - \\(a*d = 82*z**2 * -31*z = -2542*z**3\\)\n   - \\(b*c = 21 * -86*z**3 = -1806*z**3\\)\n   - \\(b*d = 21 * -31*z = -651*z\\)\n\n4. **Combine like terms:**\n\n   - The terms \\(-2542*z**3\\) and \\(-1806*z**3\\) are like terms and can be combined:\n     \\[\n     -2542*z**3 - 1806*z**3 = -4348*z**3\n     \\]\n\n5. **Write the final simplified expression:**\n\n   The simplified expression is:\n   \\[\n   -7052*z**5 - 4348*z**3 - 651*z\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-7052*z**5 - 4348*z**3 - 651*z>>>"
