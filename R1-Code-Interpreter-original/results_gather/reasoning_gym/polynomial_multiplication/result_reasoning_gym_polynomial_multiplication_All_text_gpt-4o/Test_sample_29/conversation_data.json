    "To simplify the expression \\(-588*y**3 - 903*y**2 - 2835\\), we need to look for common factors in each term. Let's analyze each term step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the terms:**\n   - The expression consists of three terms: \\(-588*y**3\\), \\(-903*y**2\\), and \\(-2835\\).\n\n2. **Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF):**\n   - First, we need to find the GCF of the coefficients \\(-588\\), \\(-903\\), and \\(-2835\\).\n   - To find the GCF, we can use the prime factorization method or the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n3. **Prime factorization:**\n   - \\(-588\\) can be factored as: \\(-1 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 7 * 7\\).\n   - \\(-903\\) can be factored as: \\(-1 * 3 * 3 * 7 * 43\\).\n   - \\(-2835\\) can be factored as: \\(-1 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 7\\).\n\n4. **Identify common factors:**\n   - The common factors among the coefficients are \\(-1\\), \\(3\\), and \\(7\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the GCF:**\n   - The GCF of \\(-588\\), \\(-903\\), and \\(-2835\\) is \\(-1 * 3 * 7 = -21\\).\n\n6. **Factor out the GCF from the expression:**\n   - We factor \\(-21\\) out of each term:\n     - \\(-588*y**3 = -21 * 28 * y**3\\)\n     - \\(-903*y**2 = -21 * 43 * y**2\\)\n     - \\(-2835 = -21 * 135\\)\n\n7. **Rewrite the expression:**\n   - The expression can be rewritten as:\n     \\(-21 * (28*y**3 + 43*y**2 + 135)\\)\n\n8. **Check for further simplification:**\n   - The expression inside the parentheses, \\(28*y**3 + 43*y**2 + 135\\), does not have any common factors and cannot be simplified further.\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is:\n\n<<<-21 * (28*y**3 + 43*y**2 + 135)>>>"
