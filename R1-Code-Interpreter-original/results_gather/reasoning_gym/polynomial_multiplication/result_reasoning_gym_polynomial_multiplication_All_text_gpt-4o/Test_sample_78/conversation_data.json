    "To solve the expression \\(1905*y**3 + 1335\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the components of the expression:**\n   - The expression consists of two terms: \\(1905*y**3\\) and \\(1335\\).\n\n2. **Understand the operations involved:**\n   - The first term, \\(1905*y**3\\), involves multiplication and exponentiation:\n     - \\(y**3\\) means \\(y\\) raised to the power of 3.\n     - \\(1905*y**3\\) means 1905 multiplied by \\(y**3\\).\n   - The second term, \\(1335\\), is a constant.\n\n3. **Combine the terms:**\n   - The expression is a polynomial in terms of \\(y\\), specifically a cubic polynomial because the highest power of \\(y\\) is 3.\n   - The expression is already simplified as it is a sum of a cubic term and a constant.\n\n4. **Evaluate the expression:**\n   - To evaluate the expression for a specific value of \\(y\\), substitute the value of \\(y\\) into the expression and perform the arithmetic operations.\n   - Since no specific value of \\(y\\) is provided, the expression remains in its algebraic form.\n\n5. **Final expression:**\n   - The expression is already in its simplest form and represents a cubic polynomial in \\(y\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<1905*y**3 + 1335>>>"
