    "To solve the expression \\((22*z**3 - 34)*(67*z**3 + 65*z + 94)\\), we will expand it step by step using the distributive property. This involves multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n\n1. **Identify the terms in each polynomial:**\n   - First polynomial: \\(22*z**3 - 34\\)\n     - Terms: \\(22*z**3\\) and \\(-34\\)\n   - Second polynomial: \\(67*z**3 + 65*z + 94\\)\n     - Terms: \\(67*z**3\\), \\(65*z\\), and \\(94\\)\n\n2. **Distribute each term in the first polynomial across each term in the second polynomial:**\n\n   - Multiply \\(22*z**3\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n     - \\(22*z**3 * 67*z**3 = 1474*z**6\\)\n     - \\(22*z**3 * 65*z = 1430*z**4\\)\n     - \\(22*z**3 * 94 = 2068*z**3\\)\n\n   - Multiply \\(-34\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n     - \\(-34 * 67*z**3 = -2278*z**3\\)\n     - \\(-34 * 65*z = -2210*z\\)\n     - \\(-34 * 94 = -3196\\)\n\n3. **Combine all the terms:**\n\n   - \\(1474*z**6\\) (from \\(22*z**3 * 67*z**3\\))\n   - \\(1430*z**4\\) (from \\(22*z**3 * 65*z\\))\n   - \\(2068*z**3 - 2278*z**3 = -210*z**3\\) (combine like terms from \\(22*z**3 * 94\\) and \\(-34 * 67*z**3\\))\n   - \\(-2210*z\\) (from \\(-34 * 65*z\\))\n   - \\(-3196\\) (from \\(-34 * 94\\))\n\n4. **Write the final expanded expression:**\n\n   - \\(1474*z**6 + 1430*z**4 - 210*z**3 - 2210*z - 3196\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1474*z**6 + 1430*z**4 - 210*z**3 - 2210*z - 3196>>>"
