    "To solve the expression \\((18 - 95*z**3)*(-12*z**2 - 104*z + 78)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the terms in each polynomial:**\n   - The first polynomial is \\(18 - 95*z**3\\).\n   - The second polynomial is \\(-12*z**2 - 104*z + 78\\).\n\n2. **Distribute each term in the first polynomial across each term in the second polynomial:**\n\n   - **Multiply \\(18\\) by each term in the second polynomial:**\n     - \\(18 * (-12*z**2) = -216*z**2\\)\n     - \\(18 * (-104*z) = -1872*z\\)\n     - \\(18 * 78 = 1404\\)\n\n   - **Multiply \\(-95*z**3\\) by each term in the second polynomial:**\n     - \\(-95*z**3 * (-12*z**2) = 1140*z**5\\)\n     - \\(-95*z**3 * (-104*z) = 9880*z**4\\)\n     - \\(-95*z**3 * 78 = -7410*z**3\\)\n\n3. **Combine all the terms:**\n   - \\(1140*z**5 + 9880*z**4 - 7410*z**3 - 216*z**2 - 1872*z + 1404\\)\n\n4. **Write the final expression:**\n   - The expression is already simplified as there are no like terms to combine further.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1140*z**5 + 9880*z**4 - 7410*z**3 - 216*z**2 - 1872*z + 1404>>>"
