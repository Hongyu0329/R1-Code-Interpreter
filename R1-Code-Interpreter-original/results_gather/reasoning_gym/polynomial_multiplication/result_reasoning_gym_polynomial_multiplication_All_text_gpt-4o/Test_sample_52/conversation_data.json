    "To solve the expression \\(186*z**3*(-6*z**2 - 85*z)*(85*z**3 + 63)\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the components of the expression:**\n   - The expression is a product of three terms: \\(186*z**3\\), \\(-6*z**2 - 85*z\\), and \\(85*z**3 + 63\\).\n\n2. **Expand the expression:**\n   - We need to expand the expression by multiplying these three terms together. We will do this in two stages: first multiply the second and third terms, and then multiply the result by the first term.\n\n3. **Multiply the second and third terms:**\n   - The second term is \\(-6*z**2 - 85*z\\).\n   - The third term is \\(85*z**3 + 63\\).\n   - Multiply each term in the second expression by each term in the third expression:\n     - \\((-6*z**2) * (85*z**3) = -6*85*z**5 = -510*z**5\\)\n     - \\((-6*z**2) * 63 = -6*63*z**2 = -378*z**2\\)\n     - \\((-85*z) * (85*z**3) = -85*85*z**4 = -7225*z**4\\)\n     - \\((-85*z) * 63 = -85*63*z = -5355*z\\)\n\n4. **Combine the results from step 3:**\n   - Combine the terms obtained from multiplying the second and third terms:\n     - \\(-510*z**5 - 7225*z**4 - 378*z**2 - 5355*z\\)\n\n5. **Multiply the result from step 4 by the first term:**\n   - The first term is \\(186*z**3\\).\n   - Multiply each term in the combined expression by \\(186*z**3\\):\n     - \\(186*z**3 * (-510*z**5) = 186*(-510)*z**8 = -94860*z**8\\)\n     - \\(186*z**3 * (-7225*z**4) = 186*(-7225)*z**7 = -1343850*z**7\\)\n     - \\(186*z**3 * (-378*z**2) = 186*(-378)*z**5 = -70308*z**5\\)\n     - \\(186*z**3 * (-5355*z) = 186*(-5355)*z**4 = -996030*z**4\\)\n\n6. **Combine the results from step 5:**\n   - Combine all the terms to get the final expanded expression:\n     - \\(-94860*z**8 - 1343850*z**7 - 70308*z**5 - 996030*z**4\\)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-94860*z**8 - 1343850*z**7 - 70308*z**5 - 996030*z**4>>>"
