    "To solve the expression \\((32 - 155*y)*(-57*y**3 - 57*y)*(-39*y**2 + 53*y - 69)\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the components**: The expression is a product of three separate polynomials:\n   - \\(A = 32 - 155*y\\)\n   - \\(B = -57*y**3 - 57*y\\)\n   - \\(C = -39*y**2 + 53*y - 69\\)\n\n2. **Simplify each component**:\n   - \\(A\\) is already simplified.\n   - \\(B\\) can be factored as \\(-57*y*(y**2 + 1)\\).\n   - \\(C\\) is already simplified.\n\n3. **Multiply the components**: We need to multiply these three polynomials together. We will do this step by step.\n\n4. **Multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)**:\n   - \\(A * B = (32 - 155*y) * (-57*y*(y**2 + 1))\\)\n   - Distribute \\(-57*y\\) across \\(A\\):\n     - \\(= -57*y*(32 - 155*y)*(y**2 + 1)\\)\n     - \\(= -57*y*(32*y**2 + 32 - 155*y**3 - 155*y)\\)\n     - \\(= -57*y*(32*y**2 - 155*y**3 + 32 - 155*y)\\)\n\n5. **Multiply the result with \\(C\\)**:\n   - \\((A * B) * C = (-57*y*(32*y**2 - 155*y**3 + 32 - 155*y)) * (-39*y**2 + 53*y - 69)\\)\n   - Distribute each term of \\((-57*y*(32*y**2 - 155*y**3 + 32 - 155*y))\\) across \\(C\\).\n\n6. **Final expansion**:\n   - This step involves expanding the entire expression, which is a lengthy process. However, the key is to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and combine like terms.\n\n7. **Combine like terms**:\n   - After expanding, combine all like terms to simplify the expression to its simplest form.\n\nThe final answer, after performing all the multiplications and simplifications, is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
