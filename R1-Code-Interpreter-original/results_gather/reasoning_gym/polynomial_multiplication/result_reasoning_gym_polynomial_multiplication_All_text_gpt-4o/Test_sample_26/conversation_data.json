    "To solve the expression \\((-95*z**2 - 58*z)*(54*z**3 + 34*z - 14)\\), we need to perform polynomial multiplication. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the terms in each polynomial:**\n   - The first polynomial is \\(-95*z**2 - 58*z\\).\n   - The second polynomial is \\(54*z**3 + 34*z - 14\\).\n\n2. **Distribute each term in the first polynomial across each term in the second polynomial:**\n\n   - **First term of the first polynomial: \\(-95*z**2\\)**\n     - Multiply by the first term of the second polynomial: \\(-95*z**2 * 54*z**3 = -5130*z**5\\).\n     - Multiply by the second term of the second polynomial: \\(-95*z**2 * 34*z = -3230*z**3\\).\n     - Multiply by the third term of the second polynomial: \\(-95*z**2 * (-14) = 1330*z**2\\).\n\n   - **Second term of the first polynomial: \\(-58*z\\)**\n     - Multiply by the first term of the second polynomial: \\(-58*z * 54*z**3 = -3132*z**4\\).\n     - Multiply by the second term of the second polynomial: \\(-58*z * 34*z = -1972*z**2\\).\n     - Multiply by the third term of the second polynomial: \\(-58*z * (-14) = 812*z\\).\n\n3. **Combine all the terms:**\n   - Combine the terms obtained from the distribution:\n     - \\(-5130*z**5\\)\n     - \\(-3132*z**4\\)\n     - \\(-3230*z**3\\)\n     - \\(1330*z**2 - 1972*z**2 = -642*z**2\\)\n     - \\(812*z\\)\n\n4. **Write the final expression:**\n   - Combine all the terms to form the final polynomial expression:\n     \\(-5130*z**5 - 3132*z**4 - 3230*z**3 - 642*z**2 + 812*z\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-5130*z**5 - 3132*z**4 - 3230*z**3 - 642*z**2 + 812*z>>>"
