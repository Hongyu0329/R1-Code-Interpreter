    "To solve the expression \\((99*z + 86)*(70*z**3 + 57*z**2 - 7)\\), we will expand it step by step using the distributive property. This involves multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n\n1. **Identify the terms in each polynomial:**\n   - First polynomial: \\(99*z + 86\\)\n     - Terms: \\(99*z\\) and \\(86\\)\n   - Second polynomial: \\(70*z**3 + 57*z**2 - 7\\)\n     - Terms: \\(70*z**3\\), \\(57*z**2\\), and \\(-7\\)\n\n2. **Distribute each term in the first polynomial across each term in the second polynomial:**\n\n   - Multiply \\(99*z\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n     - \\(99*z * 70*z**3 = 6930*z**4\\)\n     - \\(99*z * 57*z**2 = 5643*z**3\\)\n     - \\(99*z * -7 = -693*z\\)\n\n   - Multiply \\(86\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n     - \\(86 * 70*z**3 = 6020*z**3\\)\n     - \\(86 * 57*z**2 = 4902*z**2\\)\n     - \\(86 * -7 = -602\\)\n\n3. **Combine all the terms:**\n   - \\(6930*z**4\\)\n   - \\(5643*z**3 + 6020*z**3 = 11663*z**3\\)\n   - \\(4902*z**2\\)\n   - \\(-693*z\\)\n   - \\(-602\\)\n\n4. **Write the final expanded expression:**\n   - \\(6930*z**4 + 11663*z**3 + 4902*z**2 - 693*z - 602\\)\n\nThus, the expanded form of the given expression is:\n\n<<<6930*z**4 + 11663*z**3 + 4902*z**2 - 693*z - 602>>>"
