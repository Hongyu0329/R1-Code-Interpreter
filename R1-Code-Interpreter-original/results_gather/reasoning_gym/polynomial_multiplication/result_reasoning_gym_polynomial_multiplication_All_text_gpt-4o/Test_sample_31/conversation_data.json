    "To simplify the expression \\((-26*y**3 + 33*y - 50)*(-17*y**3 - 77*y**2 + 37)*(44*y**3 - 25*y - 14)\\), we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Terms**: \n   - The expression is a product of three polynomials: \n     - \\(A = -26*y**3 + 33*y - 50\\)\n     - \\(B = -17*y**3 - 77*y**2 + 37\\)\n     - \\(C = 44*y**3 - 25*y - 14\\)\n\n2. **Multiply Two Polynomials at a Time**:\n   - First, multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n     - Distribute each term of \\(A\\) across each term of \\(B\\).\n     - This involves multiplying each term in \\(A\\) by each term in \\(B\\) and combining like terms.\n\n3. **Calculate the Product of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)**:\n   - Multiply \\(-26*y**3\\) by each term in \\(B\\):\n     - \\(-26*y**3 * -17*y**3 = 442*y**6\\)\n     - \\(-26*y**3 * -77*y**2 = 2002*y**5\\)\n     - \\(-26*y**3 * 37 = -962*y**3\\)\n   - Multiply \\(33*y\\) by each term in \\(B\\):\n     - \\(33*y * -17*y**3 = -561*y**4\\)\n     - \\(33*y * -77*y**2 = -2541*y**3\\)\n     - \\(33*y * 37 = 1221*y\\)\n   - Multiply \\(-50\\) by each term in \\(B\\):\n     - \\(-50 * -17*y**3 = 850*y**3\\)\n     - \\(-50 * -77*y**2 = 3850*y**2\\)\n     - \\(-50 * 37 = -1850\\)\n\n4. **Combine Like Terms for \\(A*B\\)**:\n   - Combine all the terms obtained from the multiplication:\n     - \\(442*y**6 + 2002*y**5 - 561*y**4 + (-962*y**3 - 2541*y**3 + 850*y**3) + 3850*y**2 + 1221*y - 1850\\)\n     - Simplify the \\(y**3\\) terms: \\(-962 - 2541 + 850 = -2653*y**3\\)\n     - The result is: \\(442*y**6 + 2002*y**5 - 561*y**4 - 2653*y**3 + 3850*y**2 + 1221*y - 1850\\)\n\n5. **Multiply the Result with \\(C\\)**:\n   - Now, multiply the resulting polynomial from \\(A*B\\) with \\(C\\).\n   - Distribute each term of the resulting polynomial across each term of \\(C\\).\n   - This involves multiplying each term in the resulting polynomial by each term in \\(C\\) and combining like terms.\n\n6. **Calculate the Final Product**:\n   - This step involves a lot of multiplications and combining like terms, which is a lengthy process.\n   - The final expression will be a polynomial with terms up to \\(y**9\\) since the highest degree terms are \\(y**6\\) from \\(A*B\\) and \\(y**3\\) from \\(C\\).\n\n7. **Simplify the Final Expression**:\n   - After performing all the multiplications and combining like terms, the final simplified expression is obtained.\n\nGiven the complexity of the expression, the final simplified form is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
