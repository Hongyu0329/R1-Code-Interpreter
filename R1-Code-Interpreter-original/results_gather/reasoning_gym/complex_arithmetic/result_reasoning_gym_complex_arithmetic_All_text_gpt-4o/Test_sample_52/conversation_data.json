    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-9.0 + 5.0i)\\) and \\((-10.0 + 6.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Components of Complex Numbers**: \n   - A complex number is in the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts**:\n   - For the first complex number \\((-9.0 + 5.0i)\\), the real part is \\(-9.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(5.0\\).\n   - For the second complex number \\((-10.0 + 6.0i)\\), the real part is \\(-10.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(6.0\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the Real Parts**:\n   - Subtract the real part of the second complex number from the real part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     -9.0 - (-10.0) = -9.0 + 10.0 = 1.0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Subtract the imaginary part of the second complex number from the imaginary part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     5.0 - 6.0 = -1.0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the results from the subtraction of the real parts and the imaginary parts to form the final complex number:\n     \\[\n     1.0 - 1.0i\n     \\]\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully subtracted the two complex numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1.0 - 1.0i>>>."
