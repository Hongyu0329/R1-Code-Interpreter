    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers \\((9.0 - 7.0i) + (-4.00i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is \\(9.0 - 7.0i\\).\n     - Real part: \\(9.0\\)\n     - Imaginary part: \\(-7.0i\\)\n   - The second complex number is \\(-4.00i\\).\n     - Real part: \\(0\\) (since there is no explicit real part, it is zero)\n     - Imaginary part: \\(-4.00i\\)\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real parts of both complex numbers.\n   - Real part of the first number: \\(9.0\\)\n   - Real part of the second number: \\(0\\)\n   - Sum of real parts: \\(9.0 + 0 = 9.0\\)\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary parts of both complex numbers.\n   - Imaginary part of the first number: \\(-7.0i\\)\n   - Imaginary part of the second number: \\(-4.00i\\)\n   - Sum of imaginary parts: \\(-7.0i + (-4.00i) = -11.0i\\)\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the sum of the real parts and the sum of the imaginary parts to form the final complex number.\n   - The resulting complex number is \\(9.0 - 11.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the addition of the complex numbers \\((9.0 - 7.0i) + (-4.00i)\\) is:\n\n<<<9.0 - 11.0i>>>"
