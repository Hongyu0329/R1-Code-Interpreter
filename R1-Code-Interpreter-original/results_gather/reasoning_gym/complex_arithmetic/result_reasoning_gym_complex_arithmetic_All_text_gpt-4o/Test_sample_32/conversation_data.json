    "To subtract two complex numbers, we need to subtract their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the complex numbers:**\n   - The first complex number is \\( (10.0 + 9.0i) \\).\n   - The second complex number is \\( (2.0 + 7.0i) \\).\n\n2. **Separate the real and imaginary parts:**\n   - For the first complex number \\( (10.0 + 9.0i) \\):\n     - Real part: 10.0\n     - Imaginary part: 9.0i\n   - For the second complex number \\( (2.0 + 7.0i) \\):\n     - Real part: 2.0\n     - Imaginary part: 7.0i\n\n3. **Subtract the real parts:**\n   - Subtract the real part of the second complex number from the real part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     10.0 - 2.0 = 8.0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the imaginary parts:**\n   - Subtract the imaginary part of the second complex number from the imaginary part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     9.0i - 7.0i = 2.0i\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combine the results:**\n   - The result of the subtraction is the combination of the subtracted real and imaginary parts:\n     \\[\n     8.0 + 2.0i\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the subtraction of the complex numbers \\( (10.0 + 9.0i) - (2.0 + 7.0i) \\) is:\n\n<<<8.0 + 2.0i>>>"
