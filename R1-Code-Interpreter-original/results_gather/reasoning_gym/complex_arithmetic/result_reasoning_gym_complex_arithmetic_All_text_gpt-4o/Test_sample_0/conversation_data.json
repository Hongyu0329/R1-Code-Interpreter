    "To add the complex numbers \\((-4.0 - 6.0i)\\) and \\((-1.0 - 3.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real Parts**: \n   - The real part of the first complex number \\((-4.0 - 6.0i)\\) is \\(-4.0\\).\n   - The real part of the second complex number \\((-1.0 - 3.0i)\\) is \\(-1.0\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number \\((-4.0 - 6.0i)\\) is \\(-6.0i\\).\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number \\((-1.0 - 3.0i)\\) is \\(-3.0i\\).\n\n3. **Add the Real Parts**:\n   - Add the real parts: \\(-4.0 + (-1.0) = -5.0\\).\n\n4. **Add the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Add the imaginary parts: \\(-6.0i + (-3.0i) = -9.0i\\).\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the sum of the real parts and the sum of the imaginary parts to form the final complex number: \\(-5.0 - 9.0i\\).\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully added the two complex numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-5.0 - 9.0i>>>."
