    "To add the complex numbers \\((-4.0 - 6.0i)\\) and \\((-1.0 - 8.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is \\((-4.0 - 6.0i)\\), where \\(-4.0\\) is the real part and \\(-6.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is \\((-1.0 - 8.0i)\\), where \\(-1.0\\) is the real part and \\(-8.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real parts of the two complex numbers: \\(-4.0 + (-1.0) = -4.0 - 1.0 = -5.0\\).\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers: \\(-6.0i + (-8.0i) = -6.0i - 8.0i = -14.0i\\).\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the addition of the real parts and the imaginary parts to form the final complex number: \\(-5.0 - 14.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the complex numbers \\((-4.0 - 6.0i)\\) and \\((-1.0 - 8.0i)\\) is:\n\n<<<-5.0 - 14.0i>>>"
