    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers (8.0 + 7.0i) and (7.0 + 8.0i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Complex Numbers:**\n   - The first complex number is \\( (8.0 + 7.0i) \\).\n   - The second complex number is \\( (7.0 + 8.0i) \\).\n\n2. **Understand the Subtraction of Complex Numbers:**\n   - When subtracting complex numbers, we subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\n\n3. **Subtract the Real Parts:**\n   - The real part of the first complex number is 8.0.\n   - The real part of the second complex number is 7.0.\n   - Subtract the real parts: \\( 8.0 - 7.0 = 1.0 \\).\n\n4. **Subtract the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number is 7.0i.\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number is 8.0i.\n   - Subtract the imaginary parts: \\( 7.0i - 8.0i = -1.0i \\).\n\n5. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the subtraction of the real and imaginary parts to form the final complex number: \\( 1.0 - 1.0i \\).\n\nTherefore, the result of subtracting the complex numbers \\( (8.0 + 7.0i) - (7.0 + 8.0i) \\) is:\n\n<<<1.0 - 1.0i>>>"
