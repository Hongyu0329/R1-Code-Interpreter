    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((10.0 - 3.0i) - (-2.0 + 5.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Complex Numbers**: \n   - A complex number is in the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n   - In this problem, the first complex number is \\(10.0 - 3.0i\\) and the second complex number is \\(-2.0 + 5.0i\\).\n\n2. **Set Up the Subtraction**:\n   - We need to subtract the second complex number from the first: \\((10.0 - 3.0i) - (-2.0 + 5.0i)\\).\n\n3. **Distribute the Negative Sign**:\n   - Distribute the negative sign across the second complex number: \n     \\[\n     (10.0 - 3.0i) - (-2.0 + 5.0i) = (10.0 - 3.0i) + (2.0 - 5.0i)\n     \\]\n   - This changes the subtraction into an addition by changing the signs of the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number.\n\n4. **Add the Real Parts**:\n   - Add the real parts of the complex numbers: \n     \\[\n     10.0 + 2.0 = 12.0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Add the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Add the imaginary parts of the complex numbers:\n     \\[\n     -3.0i - 5.0i = -8.0i\n     \\]\n\n6. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the results from steps 4 and 5 to form the final complex number:\n     \\[\n     12.0 - 8.0i\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the result of the subtraction is the complex number \\(12.0 - 8.0i\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<12.0 - 8.0i>>>."
