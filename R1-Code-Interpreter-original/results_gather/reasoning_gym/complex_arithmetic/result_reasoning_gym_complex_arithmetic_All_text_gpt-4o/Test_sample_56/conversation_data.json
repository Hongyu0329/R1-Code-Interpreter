    "To add the complex numbers \\((-4.00)\\) and \\((-5.0 + 10.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is \\((-4.00)\\), which can be expressed as \\((-4.00 + 0.0i)\\). Here, the real part is \\(-4.00\\) and the imaginary part is \\(0.0i\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\((-5.0 + 10.0i)\\). Here, the real part is \\(-5.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(10.0i\\).\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real parts of both complex numbers: \\(-4.00 + (-5.0) = -9.00\\).\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary parts of both complex numbers: \\(0.0i + 10.0i = 10.0i\\).\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the real and imaginary parts to form the final complex number: \\(-9.00 + 10.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the complex numbers \\((-4.00)\\) and \\((-5.0 + 10.0i)\\) is:\n\n<<<-9.00 + 10.0i>>>"
