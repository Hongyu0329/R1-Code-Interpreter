    "To subtract the complex numbers \\((-6.0 + 7.0i)\\) and \\((7.0 - 1.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is \\((-6.0 + 7.0i)\\), where \\(-6.0\\) is the real part and \\(7.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is \\((7.0 - 1.0i)\\), where \\(7.0\\) is the real part and \\(-1.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Subtract the Real Parts:**\n   - Subtract the real part of the second complex number from the real part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     -6.0 - 7.0 = -13.0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Subtract the imaginary part of the second complex number from the imaginary part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     7.0i - (-1.0i) = 7.0i + 1.0i = 8.0i\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the subtraction of the real parts and the imaginary parts to form the final complex number:\n     \\[\n     -13.0 + 8.0i\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the result of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-6.0 + 7.0i)\\) and \\((7.0 - 1.0i)\\) is \\(-13.0 + 8.0i\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-13.0 + 8.0i>>>."
