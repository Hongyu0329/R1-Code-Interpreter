    "To add the complex numbers \\((-8.0 + 2.0i)\\) and \\((-2.0 + 2.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is \\((-8.0 + 2.0i)\\), where \\(-8.0\\) is the real part and \\(2.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is \\((-2.0 + 2.0i)\\), where \\(-2.0\\) is the real part and \\(2.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real parts of the two complex numbers: \\(-8.0 + (-2.0) = -10.0\\).\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers: \\(2.0i + 2.0i = 4.0i\\).\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the addition of the real parts and the imaginary parts to form the new complex number: \\(-10.0 + 4.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the complex numbers \\((-8.0 + 2.0i)\\) and \\((-2.0 + 2.0i)\\) is \\(-10.0 + 4.0i\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-10.0 + 4.0i>>>."
