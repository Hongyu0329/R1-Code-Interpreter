    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers (3.0 + 4.0i) and (3.0 - 2.0i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is (3.0 + 4.0i), where 3.0 is the real part and 4.0i is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is (3.0 - 2.0i), where 3.0 is the real part and -2.0i is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real part of the first complex number (3.0) to the real part of the second complex number (3.0).\n   - Calculation: 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary part of the first complex number (4.0i) to the imaginary part of the second complex number (-2.0i).\n   - Calculation: 4.0i + (-2.0i) = 2.0i\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the addition of the real parts and the imaginary parts to form the final complex number.\n   - The real part is 6.0 and the imaginary part is 2.0i.\n\n5. **Formulate the Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of adding the two complex numbers is (6.0 + 2.0i).\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully added the two complex numbers.\n\n<<<6.0 + 2.0i>>>"
