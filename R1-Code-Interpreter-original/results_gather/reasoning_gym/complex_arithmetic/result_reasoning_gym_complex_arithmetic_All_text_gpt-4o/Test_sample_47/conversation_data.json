    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers (1.0 + 9.0i) and (-5.0 - 3.0i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is (1.0 + 9.0i), where 1.0 is the real part and 9.0i is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is (-5.0 - 3.0i), where -5.0 is the real part and -3.0i is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real part of the first complex number (1.0) to the real part of the second complex number (-5.0).\n   - Calculation: 1.0 + (-5.0) = -4.0\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary part of the first complex number (9.0i) to the imaginary part of the second complex number (-3.0i).\n   - Calculation: 9.0i + (-3.0i) = 6.0i\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the addition of the real parts and the imaginary parts to form the final complex number.\n   - The real part is -4.0 and the imaginary part is 6.0i.\n\n5. **Write the Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of adding the two complex numbers is (-4.0 + 6.0i).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-4.0 + 6.0i>>>"
