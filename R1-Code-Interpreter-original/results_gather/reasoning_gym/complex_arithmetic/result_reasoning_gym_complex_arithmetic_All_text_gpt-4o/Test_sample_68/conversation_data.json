    "To add the complex numbers (4.0 - 5.0i) and (2.0 + 1.0i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real Parts**: \n   - The real part of the first complex number (4.0 - 5.0i) is 4.0.\n   - The real part of the second complex number (2.0 + 1.0i) is 2.0.\n\n2. **Identify the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number (4.0 - 5.0i) is -5.0.\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number (2.0 + 1.0i) is 1.0.\n\n3. **Add the Real Parts**:\n   - Add the real parts together: 4.0 + 2.0 = 6.0.\n\n4. **Add the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Add the imaginary parts together: -5.0 + 1.0 = -4.0.\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - The sum of the real parts is 6.0.\n   - The sum of the imaginary parts is -4.0.\n   - Therefore, the sum of the complex numbers is 6.0 - 4.0i.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully added the two complex numbers.\n\nFinal answer: <<<6.0 - 4.0i>>>."
