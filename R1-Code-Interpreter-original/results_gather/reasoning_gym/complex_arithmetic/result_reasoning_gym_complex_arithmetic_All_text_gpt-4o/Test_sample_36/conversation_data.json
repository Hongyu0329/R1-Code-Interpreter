    "To subtract the complex numbers (6.0 - 7.0i) and (9.0 + 8.0i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is (6.0 - 7.0i), where 6.0 is the real part and -7.0 is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is (9.0 + 8.0i), where 9.0 is the real part and 8.0 is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Subtract the Real Parts:**\n   - Subtract the real part of the second complex number from the real part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     6.0 - 9.0 = -3.0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Subtract the imaginary part of the second complex number from the imaginary part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     -7.0 - 8.0 = -15.0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the subtraction of the real and imaginary parts to form the resulting complex number:\n     \\[\n     (-3.0) + (-15.0)i = -3.0 - 15.0i\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The result of subtracting the complex numbers (6.0 - 7.0i) and (9.0 + 8.0i) is:\n     \\[\n     -3.0 - 15.0i\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-3.0 - 15.0i>>>"
