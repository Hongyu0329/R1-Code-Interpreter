    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((3.0 + 4.0i) - (-9.0 + 6.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Components of Complex Numbers**: \n   - A complex number is in the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n   - In this problem, the first complex number is \\(3.0 + 4.0i\\) and the second complex number is \\(-9.0 + 6.0i\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts**:\n   - For the first complex number \\(3.0 + 4.0i\\):\n     - Real part: \\(3.0\\)\n     - Imaginary part: \\(4.0\\)\n   - For the second complex number \\(-9.0 + 6.0i\\):\n     - Real part: \\(-9.0\\)\n     - Imaginary part: \\(6.0\\)\n\n3. **Subtract the Real Parts**:\n   - Subtract the real part of the second complex number from the real part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     3.0 - (-9.0) = 3.0 + 9.0 = 12.0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Subtract the imaginary part of the second complex number from the imaginary part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     4.0 - 6.0 = -2.0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - The result of the subtraction is the combination of the results from steps 3 and 4:\n     \\[\n     12.0 - 2.0i\n     \\]\n\n6. **Format the Final Answer**:\n   - The final answer should be presented in the format specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<12.0 - 2.0i>>>"
