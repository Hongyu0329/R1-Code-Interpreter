    "To add the complex numbers (9.0 - 2.0i) and (-6.0 + 1.0i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is (9.0 - 2.0i), where 9.0 is the real part and -2.0i is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is (-6.0 + 1.0i), where -6.0 is the real part and 1.0i is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real parts of both complex numbers: 9.0 + (-6.0).\n   - Calculation: 9.0 - 6.0 = 3.0.\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary parts of both complex numbers: -2.0i + 1.0i.\n   - Calculation: -2.0 + 1.0 = -1.0i.\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the real and imaginary parts to form the final complex number.\n   - The real part is 3.0 and the imaginary part is -1.0i.\n\n5. **Write the Final Answer:**\n   - The sum of the complex numbers is (3.0 - 1.0i).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3.0 - 1.0i>>>"
