    "To add the complex numbers \\((5.0 - 2.0i)\\) and \\((-8.0 - 1.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real Parts**: \n   - The real part of the first complex number is \\(5.0\\).\n   - The real part of the second complex number is \\(-8.0\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number is \\(-2.0i\\).\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number is \\(-1.0i\\).\n\n3. **Add the Real Parts**:\n   - Add the real parts together: \\(5.0 + (-8.0) = 5.0 - 8.0 = -3.0\\).\n\n4. **Add the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Add the imaginary parts together: \\(-2.0i + (-1.0i) = -2.0i - 1.0i = -3.0i\\).\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the results from the real and imaginary parts: \\(-3.0 - 3.0i\\).\n\nThus, the sum of the complex numbers \\((5.0 - 2.0i)\\) and \\((-8.0 - 1.0i)\\) is \\(-3.0 - 3.0i\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<-3.0 - 3.0i>>>."
