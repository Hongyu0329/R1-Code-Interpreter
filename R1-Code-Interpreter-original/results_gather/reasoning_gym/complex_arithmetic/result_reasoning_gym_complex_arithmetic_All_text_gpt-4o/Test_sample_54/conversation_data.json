    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-10.0 + 7.0i)\\) and \\((-10.00i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Complex Numbers:**\n   - The first complex number is \\((-10.0 + 7.0i)\\), which can be broken down into:\n     - Real part: \\(-10.0\\)\n     - Imaginary part: \\(7.0i\\)\n   - The second complex number is \\((-10.00i)\\), which can be broken down into:\n     - Real part: \\(0\\) (since there is no explicit real part)\n     - Imaginary part: \\(-10.00i\\)\n\n2. **Subtract the Real Parts:**\n   - The real part of the first complex number is \\(-10.0\\).\n   - The real part of the second complex number is \\(0\\).\n   - Subtract the real parts: \\(-10.0 - 0 = -10.0\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number is \\(7.0i\\).\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number is \\(-10.00i\\).\n   - Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(7.0i - (-10.00i) = 7.0i + 10.00i = 17.0i\\).\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the subtraction of the real and imaginary parts to form the final complex number: \\(-10.0 + 17.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-10.0 + 7.0i)\\) and \\((-10.00i)\\) is:\n\n<<<-10.0 + 17.0i>>>"
