    "To divide the complex number \\((-8.0 - 6.0i)\\) by the real number \\(2.00\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Division of Complex Numbers by a Real Number:**\n   - When dividing a complex number by a real number, you divide both the real and imaginary parts of the complex number by the real number.\n\n2. **Identify the Components:**\n   - The complex number is \\(-8.0 - 6.0i\\).\n   - The real number is \\(2.00\\).\n\n3. **Divide the Real Part:**\n   - The real part of the complex number is \\(-8.0\\).\n   - Divide \\(-8.0\\) by \\(2.00\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-8.0}{2.00} = -4.0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Divide the Imaginary Part:**\n   - The imaginary part of the complex number is \\(-6.0i\\).\n   - Divide \\(-6.0\\) by \\(2.00\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-6.0}{2.00} = -3.0\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the imaginary part becomes \\(-3.0i\\).\n\n5. **Combine the Results:**\n   - The result of the division is the combination of the divided real and imaginary parts:\n     \\[\n     -4.0 - 3.0i\n     \\]\n\n6. **Format the Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer is a complex number in the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully divided the complex number by the real number.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-4.0 - 3.0i>>>"
