    "To divide the complex numbers (4.0 + 68.0i) by (-8.0 + 9.0i), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Complex Numbers:**\n   - The dividend is \\( z_1 = 4.0 + 68.0i \\).\n   - The divisor is \\( z_2 = -8.0 + 9.0i \\).\n\n2. **Find the Conjugate of the Divisor:**\n   - The conjugate of \\( z_2 = -8.0 + 9.0i \\) is \\( \\overline{z_2} = -8.0 - 9.0i \\).\n\n3. **Multiply the Numerator and Denominator by the Conjugate of the Denominator:**\n   - This step is necessary to eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator.\n   - Numerator: \\( (4.0 + 68.0i) \\times (-8.0 - 9.0i) \\).\n   - Denominator: \\( (-8.0 + 9.0i) \\times (-8.0 - 9.0i) \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Denominator:**\n   - Use the formula for the product of a complex number and its conjugate: \\( a^2 + b^2 \\).\n   - Here, \\( a = -8.0 \\) and \\( b = 9.0 \\).\n   - Denominator = \\((-8.0)^2 + (9.0)^2 = 64.0 + 81.0 = 145.0\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Numerator:**\n   - Distribute the terms: \n     \\[\n     (4.0 + 68.0i) \\times (-8.0 - 9.0i) = 4.0 \\times (-8.0) + 4.0 \\times (-9.0i) + 68.0i \\times (-8.0) + 68.0i \\times (-9.0i)\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\( 4.0 \\times (-8.0) = -32.0 \\)\n     - \\( 4.0 \\times (-9.0i) = -36.0i \\)\n     - \\( 68.0i \\times (-8.0) = -544.0i \\)\n     - \\( 68.0i \\times (-9.0i) = -612.0i^2 \\)\n   - Since \\( i^2 = -1 \\), \\( -612.0i^2 = 612.0 \\).\n   - Combine the real and imaginary parts:\n     - Real part: \\(-32.0 + 612.0 = 580.0\\)\n     - Imaginary part: \\(-36.0i - 544.0i = -580.0i\\)\n\n6. **Form the Resulting Complex Number:**\n   - The result of the division is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{580.0 - 580.0i}{145.0}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify by dividing both the real and imaginary parts by 145.0:\n     - Real part: \\(\\frac{580.0}{145.0} = 4.0\\)\n     - Imaginary part: \\(\\frac{-580.0}{145.0} = -4.0\\)\n\n7. **Write the Final Answer:**\n   - The result of the division is \\( 4.0 - 4.0i \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4.0 - 4.0i>>>"
