    "To multiply two complex numbers, we use the distributive property, similar to multiplying two binomials. The complex numbers given are (9.0 + 7.0i) and (-1.0 - 10.0i). Let's break down the multiplication step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the components**: \n   - The first complex number is (9.0 + 7.0i), where 9.0 is the real part and 7.0i is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is (-1.0 - 10.0i), where -1.0 is the real part and -10.0i is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Apply the distributive property**:\n   - Multiply each part of the first complex number by each part of the second complex number:\n     - (9.0) × (-1.0) = -9.0\n     - (9.0) × (-10.0i) = -90.0i\n     - (7.0i) × (-1.0) = -7.0i\n     - (7.0i) × (-10.0i) = -70.0i²\n\n3. **Simplify the expression**:\n   - Combine the real parts: -9.0\n   - Combine the imaginary parts: -90.0i - 7.0i = -97.0i\n   - Simplify the i² term: Since i² = -1, -70.0i² becomes 70.0 (because -70.0 × -1 = 70.0).\n\n4. **Combine all parts**:\n   - Add the real parts: -9.0 + 70.0 = 61.0\n   - The imaginary part remains: -97.0i\n\n5. **Write the final result**:\n   - The result of the multiplication is a complex number with a real part of 61.0 and an imaginary part of -97.0i.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<61.0 - 97.0i>>>"
