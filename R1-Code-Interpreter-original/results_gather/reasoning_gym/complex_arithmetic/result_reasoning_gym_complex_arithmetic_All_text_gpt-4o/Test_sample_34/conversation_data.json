    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers (3.0 - 3.0i) and (4.0 - 1.0i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is (3.0 - 3.0i), where 3.0 is the real part and -3.0 is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is (4.0 - 1.0i), where 4.0 is the real part and -1.0 is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real part of the first complex number (3.0) to the real part of the second complex number (4.0).\n   - Calculation: 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary part of the first complex number (-3.0) to the imaginary part of the second complex number (-1.0).\n   - Calculation: -3.0 + (-1.0) = -4.0\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - The sum of the real parts is 7.0.\n   - The sum of the imaginary parts is -4.0.\n   - Therefore, the resulting complex number is (7.0 - 4.0i).\n\n5. **Format the Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer should be presented in the format specified.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<7.0 - 4.0i>>>"
