    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((6.0 - 2.0i) - (-9.0 + 2.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Complex Numbers**: \n   - The first complex number is \\(6.0 - 2.0i\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\(-9.0 + 2.0i\\).\n\n2. **Apply the Subtraction Operation**:\n   - Subtracting complex numbers involves subtracting their real parts and their imaginary parts separately.\n\n3. **Subtract the Real Parts**:\n   - The real part of the first complex number is \\(6.0\\).\n   - The real part of the second complex number is \\(-9.0\\).\n   - Subtract the real parts: \\(6.0 - (-9.0) = 6.0 + 9.0 = 15.0\\).\n\n4. **Subtract the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number is \\(-2.0i\\).\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number is \\(2.0i\\).\n   - Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(-2.0i - 2.0i = -2.0i - 2.0i = -4.0i\\).\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the results from the real and imaginary parts: \\(15.0 - 4.0i\\).\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The result of the subtraction is the complex number \\(15.0 - 4.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<15.0 - 4.0i>>>"
