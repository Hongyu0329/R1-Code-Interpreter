    "To multiply two complex numbers, we use the distributive property, similar to multiplying binomials. The complex numbers given are \\((-7.0 - 1.0i)\\) and \\((-2.0 + 3.0i)\\).\n\nLet's break down the multiplication step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the components**: \n   - The first complex number is \\((-7.0 - 1.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(-7.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(-1.0i\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\((-2.0 + 3.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(-2.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(3.0i\\).\n\n2. **Apply the distributive property**:\n   \\[\n   (-7.0 - 1.0i) \\times (-2.0 + 3.0i) = (-7.0) \\times (-2.0) + (-7.0) \\times (3.0i) + (-1.0i) \\times (-2.0) + (-1.0i) \\times (3.0i)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate each term**:\n   - \\((-7.0) \\times (-2.0) = 14.0\\)\n   - \\((-7.0) \\times (3.0i) = -21.0i\\)\n   - \\((-1.0i) \\times (-2.0) = 2.0i\\)\n   - \\((-1.0i) \\times (3.0i) = -3.0i^2\\)\n\n4. **Simplify using \\(i^2 = -1\\)**:\n   - The term \\(-3.0i^2\\) becomes \\(-3.0 \\times (-1) = 3.0\\).\n\n5. **Combine the real and imaginary parts**:\n   - Real parts: \\(14.0 + 3.0 = 17.0\\)\n   - Imaginary parts: \\(-21.0i + 2.0i = -19.0i\\)\n\n6. **Write the final result**:\n   - The product of the complex numbers is \\(17.0 - 19.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<17.0 - 19.0i>>>"
