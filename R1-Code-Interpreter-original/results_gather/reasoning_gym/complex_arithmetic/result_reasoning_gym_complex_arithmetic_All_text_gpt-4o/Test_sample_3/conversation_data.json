    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-6.00)\\) and \\((-6.0 - 1.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Complex Numbers**: \n   - The first complex number is \\(-6.00\\), which is a real number with no imaginary part. It can be expressed as \\(-6.00 + 0i\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\(-6.0 - 1.0i\\), which has a real part of \\(-6.0\\) and an imaginary part of \\(-1.0i\\).\n\n2. **Set Up the Subtraction**:\n   - We need to subtract the second complex number from the first: \n     \\[\n     (-6.00 + 0i) - (-6.0 - 1.0i)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Distribute the Negative Sign**:\n   - Distribute the negative sign across the second complex number:\n     \\[\n     -(-6.0) - (-1.0i) = 6.0 + 1.0i\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Subtraction**:\n   - Now, add the result from the distribution to the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     (-6.00 + 0i) + (6.0 + 1.0i)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combine Like Terms**:\n   - Combine the real parts: \\(-6.00 + 6.0 = 0.0\\)\n   - Combine the imaginary parts: \\(0i + 1.0i = 1.0i\\)\n\n6. **Write the Final Result**:\n   - The result of the subtraction is \\(0.0 + 1.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.0 + 1.0i>>>"
