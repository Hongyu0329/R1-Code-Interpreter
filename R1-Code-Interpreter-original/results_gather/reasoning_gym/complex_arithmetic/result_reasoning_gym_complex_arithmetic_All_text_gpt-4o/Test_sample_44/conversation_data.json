    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers (2.0 - 4.0i) and (-1.0 - 9.0i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is (2.0 - 4.0i), where 2.0 is the real part and -4.0 is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is (-1.0 - 9.0i), where -1.0 is the real part and -9.0 is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real parts of the two complex numbers: 2.0 + (-1.0).\n   - Calculation: 2.0 - 1.0 = 1.0.\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers: -4.0 + (-9.0).\n   - Calculation: -4.0 - 9.0 = -13.0.\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - The sum of the complex numbers is the combination of the sum of the real parts and the sum of the imaginary parts.\n   - Therefore, the resulting complex number is (1.0 - 13.0i).\n\n5. **Format the Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer should be presented in the format specified: <<<answer>>>.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<1.0 - 13.0i>>>"
