    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers \\((-10.0 - 1.0i)\\) and \\((-8.0 - 10.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is \\((-10.0 - 1.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(-10.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(-1.0i\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\((-8.0 - 10.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(-8.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(-10.0i\\).\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real parts of the two complex numbers: \n     \\[\n     -10.0 + (-8.0) = -18.0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers:\n     \\[\n     -1.0i + (-10.0i) = -11.0i\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the addition of the real and imaginary parts to form the final complex number:\n     \\[\n     -18.0 - 11.0i\n     \\]\n\n5. **Format the Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer should be presented in the format specified.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the complex numbers \\((-10.0 - 1.0i)\\) and \\((-8.0 - 10.0i)\\) is:\n\n<<<-18.0 - 11.0i>>>"
