    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers (2.0 - 4.0i) and (-7.00), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Components of Each Complex Number:**\n   - The first complex number is (2.0 - 4.0i), which has a real part of 2.0 and an imaginary part of -4.0i.\n   - The second number is (-7.00), which is a real number with no imaginary part. It can be considered as (-7.00 + 0i).\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - The real part of the first complex number is 2.0.\n   - The real part of the second number is -7.00.\n   - Add these real parts together: 2.0 + (-7.00) = -5.0.\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number is -4.0i.\n   - The imaginary part of the second number is 0i.\n   - Add these imaginary parts together: -4.0i + 0i = -4.0i.\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - The sum of the real parts is -5.0.\n   - The sum of the imaginary parts is -4.0i.\n   - Therefore, the sum of the complex numbers is (-5.0 - 4.0i).\n\n5. **Format the Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer should be presented in the format specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-5.0 - 4.0i>>>"
