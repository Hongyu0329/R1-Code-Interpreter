    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((4.0 - 8.0i) - (-6.0 + 2.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Complex Numbers**: \n   - A complex number is in the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n   - In this problem, the first complex number is \\(4.0 - 8.0i\\) and the second complex number is \\(-6.0 + 2.0i\\).\n\n2. **Set Up the Subtraction**:\n   - We need to subtract the second complex number from the first: \\((4.0 - 8.0i) - (-6.0 + 2.0i)\\).\n\n3. **Distribute the Negative Sign**:\n   - Subtracting a complex number is equivalent to adding its additive inverse. Therefore, distribute the negative sign across the second complex number:\n   \\[\n   (4.0 - 8.0i) + (6.0 - 2.0i)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine Like Terms**:\n   - Combine the real parts: \\(4.0 + 6.0 = 10.0\\).\n   - Combine the imaginary parts: \\(-8.0i - 2.0i = -10.0i\\).\n\n5. **Form the Resulting Complex Number**:\n   - The result of the subtraction is the complex number formed by the combined real and imaginary parts: \\(10.0 - 10.0i\\).\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The final answer is the complex number obtained from the subtraction.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10.0 - 10.0i>>>"
