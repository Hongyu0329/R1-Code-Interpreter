    "To add the complex numbers \\((-4.0 + 7.0i)\\) and \\((-7.0 - 2.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real Parts**: \n   - The real part of the first complex number is \\(-4.0\\).\n   - The real part of the second complex number is \\(-7.0\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number is \\(7.0i\\).\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number is \\(-2.0i\\).\n\n3. **Add the Real Parts**:\n   - Add the real parts together: \\(-4.0 + (-7.0) = -11.0\\).\n\n4. **Add the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Add the imaginary parts together: \\(7.0i + (-2.0i) = 5.0i\\).\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the sum of the real parts and the sum of the imaginary parts to form the final complex number: \\(-11.0 + 5.0i\\).\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully added the two complex numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-11.0 + 5.0i>>>."
