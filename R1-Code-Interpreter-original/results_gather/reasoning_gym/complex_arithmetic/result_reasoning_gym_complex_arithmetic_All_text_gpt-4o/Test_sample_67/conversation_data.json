    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-4.0 + 9.0i)\\) and \\((-5.0 - 3.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given two complex numbers and we need to subtract the second one from the first one. A complex number is in the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Identify the Components**:\n   - The first complex number is \\((-4.0 + 9.0i)\\), where \\(-4.0\\) is the real part and \\(9.0\\) is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is \\((-5.0 - 3.0i)\\), where \\(-5.0\\) is the real part and \\(-3.0\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n3. **Apply the Subtraction**: Subtract the second complex number from the first by subtracting their respective real parts and their respective imaginary parts separately.\n   - Subtract the real parts: \\(-4.0 - (-5.0)\\)\n   - Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(9.0 - (-3.0)\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the Real Part**:\n   - \\(-4.0 - (-5.0) = -4.0 + 5.0 = 1.0\\)\n\n5. **Calculate the Imaginary Part**:\n   - \\(9.0 - (-3.0) = 9.0 + 3.0 = 12.0\\)\n\n6. **Combine the Results**: The result of the subtraction is the complex number formed by the calculated real and imaginary parts.\n   - The resulting complex number is \\(1.0 + 12.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the subtraction of the complex numbers \\((-4.0 + 9.0i) - (-5.0 - 3.0i)\\) is:\n\n<<<1.0 + 12.0i>>>"
