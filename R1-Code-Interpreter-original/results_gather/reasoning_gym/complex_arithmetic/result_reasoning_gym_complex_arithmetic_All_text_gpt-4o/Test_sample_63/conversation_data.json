    "To subtract the complex numbers (6.0 + 7.0i) and (-6.0 + 5.0i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is (6.0 + 7.0i), where 6.0 is the real part and 7.0 is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is (-6.0 + 5.0i), where -6.0 is the real part and 5.0 is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Subtract the Real Parts:**\n   - Subtract the real part of the second complex number from the real part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     6.0 - (-6.0) = 6.0 + 6.0 = 12.0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Subtract the imaginary part of the second complex number from the imaginary part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     7.0 - 5.0 = 2.0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the subtraction of the real and imaginary parts to form the final complex number:\n     \\[\n     12.0 + 2.0i\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the result of subtracting the complex numbers (6.0 + 7.0i) and (-6.0 + 5.0i) is:\n\n<<<12.0 + 2.0i>>>"
