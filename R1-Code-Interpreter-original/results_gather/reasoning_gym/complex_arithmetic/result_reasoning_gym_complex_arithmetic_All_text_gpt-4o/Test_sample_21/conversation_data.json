    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-4.0 + 4.0i)\\) and \\((6.0 + 5.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is \\((-4.0 + 4.0i)\\), where \\(-4.0\\) is the real part and \\(4.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is \\((6.0 + 5.0i)\\), where \\(6.0\\) is the real part and \\(5.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Subtract the Real Parts:**\n   - Subtract the real part of the second complex number from the real part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     -4.0 - 6.0 = -10.0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Subtract the imaginary part of the second complex number from the imaginary part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     4.0i - 5.0i = -1.0i\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the subtraction of the real parts and the imaginary parts to form the final complex number:\n     \\[\n     -10.0 - 1.0i\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the result of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-4.0 + 4.0i)\\) and \\((6.0 + 5.0i)\\) is:\n\n<<<-10.0 - 1.0i>>>"
