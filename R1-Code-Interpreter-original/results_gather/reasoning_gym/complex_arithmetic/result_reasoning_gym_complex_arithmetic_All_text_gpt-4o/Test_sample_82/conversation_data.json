    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers \\((-7.00)\\) and \\((-3.0 + 10.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Components**: \n   - The first number is \\(-7.00\\), which is a real number. It can be expressed as \\(-7.00 + 0i\\) in complex form.\n   - The second number is \\(-3.0 + 10.0i\\), which is already in complex form with a real part of \\(-3.0\\) and an imaginary part of \\(10.0i\\).\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts**:\n   - The real part of the first number is \\(-7.00\\).\n   - The real part of the second number is \\(-3.0\\).\n   - Add these real parts together: \\(-7.00 + (-3.0) = -10.00\\).\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - The imaginary part of the first number is \\(0i\\).\n   - The imaginary part of the second number is \\(10.0i\\).\n   - Add these imaginary parts together: \\(0i + 10.0i = 10.0i\\).\n\n4. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the sum of the real parts and the sum of the imaginary parts to form the final complex number: \\(-10.00 + 10.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the complex numbers \\((-7.00)\\) and \\((-3.0 + 10.0i)\\) is:\n\n<<<-10.00 + 10.0i>>>"
