    "To multiply two complex numbers, we use the distributive property, similar to multiplying two binomials. The complex numbers given are \\( (1.0 + 8.0i) \\) and \\( (-7.0 - 10.0i) \\).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the components:**\n   - First complex number: \\( a + bi = 1.0 + 8.0i \\)\n     - \\( a = 1.0 \\)\n     - \\( b = 8.0 \\)\n   - Second complex number: \\( c + di = -7.0 - 10.0i \\)\n     - \\( c = -7.0 \\)\n     - \\( d = -10.0 \\)\n\n2. **Apply the distributive property:**\n   - The product of two complex numbers \\( (a + bi) \\) and \\( (c + di) \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     (a + bi)(c + di) = ac + adi + bci + bdi^2\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate each term:**\n   - \\( ac = 1.0 \\times (-7.0) = -7.0 \\)\n   - \\( adi = 1.0 \\times (-10.0)i = -10.0i \\)\n   - \\( bci = 8.0 \\times (-7.0)i = -56.0i \\)\n   - \\( bdi^2 = 8.0 \\times (-10.0)i^2 = -80.0i^2 \\)\n\n4. **Simplify using \\( i^2 = -1 \\):**\n   - Since \\( i^2 = -1 \\), the term \\( bdi^2 \\) becomes:\n     \\[\n     -80.0i^2 = -80.0 \\times (-1) = 80.0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combine the real and imaginary parts:**\n   - Real part: \\( ac + bdi^2 = -7.0 + 80.0 = 73.0 \\)\n   - Imaginary part: \\( adi + bci = -10.0i - 56.0i = -66.0i \\)\n\n6. **Form the final complex number:**\n   - The product of the two complex numbers is:\n     \\[\n     73.0 - 66.0i\n     \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe product of the complex numbers \\( (1.0 + 8.0i) \\) and \\( (-7.0 - 10.0i) \\) is:\n\n<<<73.0 - 66.0i>>>"
