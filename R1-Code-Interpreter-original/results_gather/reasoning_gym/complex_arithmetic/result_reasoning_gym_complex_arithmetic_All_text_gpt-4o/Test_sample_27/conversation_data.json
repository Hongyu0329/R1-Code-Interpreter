    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers (10.0 + 4.0i) and (-10.0 - 6.0i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is (10.0 + 4.0i), where 10.0 is the real part and 4.0i is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is (-10.0 - 6.0i), where -10.0 is the real part and -6.0i is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real part of the first complex number (10.0) to the real part of the second complex number (-10.0).\n   - Calculation: 10.0 + (-10.0) = 0.0\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary part of the first complex number (4.0i) to the imaginary part of the second complex number (-6.0i).\n   - Calculation: 4.0i + (-6.0i) = -2.0i\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the addition of the real parts and the imaginary parts to form the final complex number.\n   - The real part is 0.0 and the imaginary part is -2.0i.\n\n5. **Formulate the Final Answer:**\n   - The final result of adding the two complex numbers is (0.0 - 2.0i).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.0 - 2.0i>>>"
