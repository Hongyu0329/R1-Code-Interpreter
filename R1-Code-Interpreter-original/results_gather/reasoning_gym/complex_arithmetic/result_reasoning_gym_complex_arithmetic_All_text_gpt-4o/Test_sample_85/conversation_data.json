    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers \\((-5.0 - 4.0i)\\) and \\((2.0 - 5.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is \\((-5.0 - 4.0i)\\), where \\(-5.0\\) is the real part and \\(-4.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is \\((2.0 - 5.0i)\\), where \\(2.0\\) is the real part and \\(-5.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real parts of the two complex numbers: \\(-5.0 + 2.0\\).\n   - Calculation: \\(-5.0 + 2.0 = -3.0\\).\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers: \\(-4.0i + (-5.0i)\\).\n   - Calculation: \\(-4.0i - 5.0i = -9.0i\\).\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the addition of the real parts and the imaginary parts to form the final complex number.\n   - The resulting complex number is \\(-3.0 - 9.0i\\).\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully added the two complex numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-3.0 - 9.0i>>>."
