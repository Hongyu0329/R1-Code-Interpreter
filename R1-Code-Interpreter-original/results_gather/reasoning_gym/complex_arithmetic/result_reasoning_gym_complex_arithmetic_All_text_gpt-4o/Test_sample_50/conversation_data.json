    "To add the complex numbers (5.0 + 6.0i) and (-1.0 - 5.0i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real Parts**: \n   - The real part of the first complex number (5.0 + 6.0i) is 5.0.\n   - The real part of the second complex number (-1.0 - 5.0i) is -1.0.\n\n2. **Identify the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number (5.0 + 6.0i) is 6.0i.\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number (-1.0 - 5.0i) is -5.0i.\n\n3. **Add the Real Parts**:\n   - Add the real parts together: 5.0 + (-1.0) = 4.0.\n\n4. **Add the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Add the imaginary parts together: 6.0i + (-5.0i) = 1.0i.\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the sum of the real parts and the sum of the imaginary parts to form the final complex number: 4.0 + 1.0i.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the complex numbers (5.0 + 6.0i) and (-1.0 - 5.0i) is:\n\n<<<4.0 + 1.0i>>>"
