    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers (7.0 + 3.0i) and (1.0 + 1.0i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real Parts**: \n   - The real part of the first complex number (7.0 + 3.0i) is 7.0.\n   - The real part of the second complex number (1.0 + 1.0i) is 1.0.\n\n2. **Identify the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number (7.0 + 3.0i) is 3.0i.\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number (1.0 + 1.0i) is 1.0i.\n\n3. **Add the Real Parts**:\n   - Add the real parts together: 7.0 + 1.0 = 8.0.\n\n4. **Add the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Add the imaginary parts together: 3.0i + 1.0i = 4.0i.\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the sum of the real parts and the sum of the imaginary parts to form the final complex number: 8.0 + 4.0i.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully added the two complex numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<8.0 + 4.0i>>>."
