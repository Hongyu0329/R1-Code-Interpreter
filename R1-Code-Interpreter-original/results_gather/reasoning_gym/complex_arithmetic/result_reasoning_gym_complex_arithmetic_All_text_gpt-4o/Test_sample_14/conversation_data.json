    "To multiply two complex numbers, we use the distributive property, similar to multiplying two binomials. The complex numbers given are (2.0 - 9.0i) and (8.0 + 8.0i). Let's break down the multiplication step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the components**: \n   - The first complex number is (2.0 - 9.0i), where the real part is 2.0 and the imaginary part is -9.0i.\n   - The second complex number is (8.0 + 8.0i), where the real part is 8.0 and the imaginary part is 8.0i.\n\n2. **Apply the distributive property**:\n   - Multiply each term in the first complex number by each term in the second complex number.\n   - This results in four products:\n     - \\(2.0 \\times 8.0\\)\n     - \\(2.0 \\times 8.0i\\)\n     - \\(-9.0i \\times 8.0\\)\n     - \\(-9.0i \\times 8.0i\\)\n\n3. **Calculate each product**:\n   - \\(2.0 \\times 8.0 = 16.0\\)\n   - \\(2.0 \\times 8.0i = 16.0i\\)\n   - \\(-9.0i \\times 8.0 = -72.0i\\)\n   - \\(-9.0i \\times 8.0i = -72.0i^2\\)\n\n4. **Simplify using \\(i^2 = -1\\)**:\n   - The term \\(-72.0i^2\\) simplifies to \\(72.0\\) because \\(i^2 = -1\\), so \\(-72.0 \\times -1 = 72.0\\).\n\n5. **Combine the real and imaginary parts**:\n   - Real parts: \\(16.0 + 72.0 = 88.0\\)\n   - Imaginary parts: \\(16.0i - 72.0i = -56.0i\\)\n\n6. **Form the final complex number**:\n   - Combine the real and imaginary parts to get the final result: \\(88.0 - 56.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the product of the complex numbers (2.0 - 9.0i) and (8.0 + 8.0i) is:\n\n<<<88.0 - 56.0i>>>"
