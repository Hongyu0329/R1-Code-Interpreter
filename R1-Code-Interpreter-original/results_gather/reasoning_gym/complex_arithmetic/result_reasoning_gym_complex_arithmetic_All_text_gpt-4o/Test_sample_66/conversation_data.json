    "To add the complex numbers \\((-9.0 + 1.0i)\\) and \\((3.0 - 9.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real Parts**: \n   - The real part of the first complex number is \\(-9.0\\).\n   - The real part of the second complex number is \\(3.0\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number is \\(1.0i\\).\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number is \\(-9.0i\\).\n\n3. **Add the Real Parts**:\n   - Add the real parts together: \\(-9.0 + 3.0\\).\n   - Calculate the result: \\(-9.0 + 3.0 = -6.0\\).\n\n4. **Add the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Add the imaginary parts together: \\(1.0i + (-9.0i)\\).\n   - Calculate the result: \\(1.0i - 9.0i = -8.0i\\).\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the results from the real and imaginary parts to form the final complex number: \\(-6.0 - 8.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the complex numbers \\((-9.0 + 1.0i)\\) and \\((3.0 - 9.0i)\\) is \\(-6.0 - 8.0i\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<-6.0 - 8.0i>>>."
