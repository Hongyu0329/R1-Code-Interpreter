    "To multiply the complex numbers \\((-4.00)\\) and \\((5.0 - 4.0i)\\), we need to follow the rules of complex number multiplication. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Components**: \n   - The first complex number is \\((-4.00)\\), which is purely real.\n   - The second complex number is \\((5.0 - 4.0i)\\), which has a real part of \\(5.0\\) and an imaginary part of \\(-4.0i\\).\n\n2. **Apply the Distributive Property**:\n   - Multiply \\(-4.00\\) by each part of the second complex number separately.\n   - This involves two multiplications:\n     - Multiply \\(-4.00\\) by the real part \\(5.0\\).\n     - Multiply \\(-4.00\\) by the imaginary part \\(-4.0i\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Multiplications**:\n   - \\(-4.00 \\times 5.0 = -20.00\\)\n   - \\(-4.00 \\times -4.0i = 16.0i\\)\n\n4. **Combine the Results**:\n   - The result of the multiplication is the sum of the two products obtained:\n   - The real part is \\(-20.00\\).\n   - The imaginary part is \\(16.0i\\).\n\n5. **Write the Final Answer**:\n   - Combine the real and imaginary parts to express the result as a complex number.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<-20.00 + 16.0i>>>"
