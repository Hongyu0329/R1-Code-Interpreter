    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((8.0 - 10.0i) - (-3.0 - 10.0i)\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Complex Numbers:**\n   - The first complex number is \\(8.0 - 10.0i\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\(-3.0 - 10.0i\\).\n\n2. **Understand the Subtraction of Complex Numbers:**\n   - Subtracting complex numbers involves subtracting their real parts and their imaginary parts separately.\n\n3. **Break Down the Subtraction:**\n   - Real parts: \\(8.0 - (-3.0)\\)\n   - Imaginary parts: \\(-10.0i - (-10.0i)\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the Real Part:**\n   - \\(8.0 - (-3.0) = 8.0 + 3.0 = 11.0\\)\n\n5. **Calculate the Imaginary Part:**\n   - \\(-10.0i - (-10.0i) = -10.0i + 10.0i = 0.0i\\)\n\n6. **Combine the Results:**\n   - The result of the subtraction is \\(11.0 + 0.0i\\).\n\n7. **Simplify the Result:**\n   - Since the imaginary part is \\(0.0i\\), the complex number simplifies to just the real part, which is \\(11.0\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the subtraction of the complex numbers is:\n\n<<<11.0>>>"
