    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-7.0 - 2.0i)\\) and \\((-1.0 + 3.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given two complex numbers and we need to subtract the second one from the first one. A complex number is in the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Identify the Components**:\n   - The first complex number is \\((-7.0 - 2.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(-7.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(-2.0\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\((-1.0 + 3.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(-1.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(3.0\\).\n\n3. **Apply the Subtraction**: Subtract the second complex number from the first by subtracting their respective real and imaginary parts separately.\n   - **Real Part Calculation**: Subtract the real part of the second number from the real part of the first number:\n     \\[\n     -7.0 - (-1.0) = -7.0 + 1.0 = -6.0\n     \\]\n   - **Imaginary Part Calculation**: Subtract the imaginary part of the second number from the imaginary part of the first number:\n     \\[\n     -2.0 - 3.0 = -2.0 - 3.0 = -5.0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Results**: Combine the results of the real and imaginary parts to form the final complex number:\n   \\[\n   -6.0 - 5.0i\n   \\]\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: Present the final answer in the required format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-6.0 - 5.0i>>>"
