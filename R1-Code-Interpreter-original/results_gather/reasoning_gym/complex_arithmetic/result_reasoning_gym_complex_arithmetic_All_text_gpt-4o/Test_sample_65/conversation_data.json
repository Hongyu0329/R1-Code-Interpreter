    "To add the complex numbers (1.0 - 9.0i) and (8.0 - 10.0i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real Parts**: \n   - The real part of the first complex number (1.0 - 9.0i) is 1.0.\n   - The real part of the second complex number (8.0 - 10.0i) is 8.0.\n\n2. **Identify the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number (1.0 - 9.0i) is -9.0i.\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number (8.0 - 10.0i) is -10.0i.\n\n3. **Add the Real Parts**:\n   - Add the real parts together: 1.0 + 8.0 = 9.0.\n\n4. **Add the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Add the imaginary parts together: -9.0i + (-10.0i) = -19.0i.\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the sum of the real parts and the sum of the imaginary parts to form the final complex number: 9.0 - 19.0i.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the complex numbers (1.0 - 9.0i) and (8.0 - 10.0i) is:\n\n<<<9.0 - 19.0i>>>"
