    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-4.00i)\\) and \\((-3.0 - 4.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Complex Numbers**: \n   - The first complex number is \\(-4.00i\\), which can be written as \\(0 - 4.00i\\). This means the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \\(-4.00\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\(-3.0 - 4.0i\\), which means the real part is \\(-3.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(-4.0\\).\n\n2. **Set Up the Subtraction**:\n   - We need to subtract the second complex number from the first: \n     \\[\n     (0 - 4.00i) - (-3.0 - 4.0i)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Distribute the Negative Sign**:\n   - Distribute the negative sign across the second complex number:\n     \\[\n     (0 - 4.00i) + (3.0 + 4.0i)\n     \\]\n   - This changes the signs of both the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number.\n\n4. **Combine Like Terms**:\n   - Combine the real parts: \\(0 + 3.0 = 3.0\\)\n   - Combine the imaginary parts: \\(-4.00i + 4.0i = 0i\\)\n\n5. **Form the Resulting Complex Number**:\n   - The resulting complex number is \\(3.0 + 0i\\), which simplifies to just \\(3.0\\) since the imaginary part is zero.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the subtraction of the complex numbers is:\n\n<<<3.0>>>"
