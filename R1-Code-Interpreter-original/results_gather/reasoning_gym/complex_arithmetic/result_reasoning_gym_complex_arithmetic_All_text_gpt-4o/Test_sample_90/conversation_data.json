    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((9.0 - 1.0i) - (-8.0 + 1.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Complex Numbers**: \n   - The first complex number is \\(9.0 - 1.0i\\), where \\(9.0\\) is the real part and \\(-1.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is \\(-8.0 + 1.0i\\), where \\(-8.0\\) is the real part and \\(1.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Apply the Subtraction**:\n   - When subtracting complex numbers, subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\n\n3. **Subtract the Real Parts**:\n   - Real part of the first complex number: \\(9.0\\)\n   - Real part of the second complex number: \\(-8.0\\)\n   - Subtract the real parts: \\(9.0 - (-8.0) = 9.0 + 8.0 = 17.0\\)\n\n4. **Subtract the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Imaginary part of the first complex number: \\(-1.0i\\)\n   - Imaginary part of the second complex number: \\(1.0i\\)\n   - Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(-1.0i - 1.0i = -1.0i - 1.0i = -2.0i\\)\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the results from the real and imaginary parts: \\(17.0 - 2.0i\\)\n\nTherefore, the result of the subtraction is the complex number \\(17.0 - 2.0i\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<17.0 - 2.0i>>>"
