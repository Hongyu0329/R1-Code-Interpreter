    "To add the complex numbers \\((9.0 - 10.0i)\\) and \\((-2.0 - 6.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real Parts**: \n   - The real part of the first complex number is \\(9.0\\).\n   - The real part of the second complex number is \\(-2.0\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number is \\(-10.0i\\).\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number is \\(-6.0i\\).\n\n3. **Add the Real Parts**:\n   - Add the real parts together: \\(9.0 + (-2.0) = 7.0\\).\n\n4. **Add the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Add the imaginary parts together: \\(-10.0i + (-6.0i) = -16.0i\\).\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the sum of the real parts and the sum of the imaginary parts to form the final complex number: \\(7.0 - 16.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the complex numbers \\((9.0 - 10.0i)\\) and \\((-2.0 - 6.0i)\\) is:\n\n<<<7.0 - 16.0i>>>"
