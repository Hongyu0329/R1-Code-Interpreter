    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-5.0 - 1.0i)\\) and \\((-7.0 + 1.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given two complex numbers and need to perform subtraction. A complex number is of the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Identify the Complex Numbers**:\n   - The first complex number is \\((-5.0 - 1.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(-5.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(-1.0\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\((-7.0 + 1.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(-7.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(1.0\\).\n\n3. **Apply the Subtraction Formula**: \n   - When subtracting two complex numbers \\((a + bi)\\) and \\((c + di)\\), the result is \\((a - c) + (b - d)i\\).\n\n4. **Subtract the Real Parts**:\n   - Real part of the first number: \\(-5.0\\)\n   - Real part of the second number: \\(-7.0\\)\n   - Subtract the real parts: \\(-5.0 - (-7.0) = -5.0 + 7.0 = 2.0\\)\n\n5. **Subtract the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Imaginary part of the first number: \\(-1.0\\)\n   - Imaginary part of the second number: \\(1.0\\)\n   - Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(-1.0 - 1.0 = -2.0\\)\n\n6. **Combine the Results**:\n   - The result of the subtraction is the combination of the real and imaginary parts: \\(2.0 - 2.0i\\).\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The final result of the subtraction is the complex number \\(2.0 - 2.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the subtraction of the complex numbers \\((-5.0 - 1.0i)\\) and \\((-7.0 + 1.0i)\\) is:\n\n<<<2.0 - 2.0i>>>"
