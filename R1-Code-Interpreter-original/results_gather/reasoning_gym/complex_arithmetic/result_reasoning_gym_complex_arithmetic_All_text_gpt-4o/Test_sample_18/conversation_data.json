    "To subtract the complex numbers \\((-2.0 + 1.0i)\\) and \\((10.0 - 3.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is \\((-2.0 + 1.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(-2.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(1.0i\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\((10.0 - 3.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(10.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(-3.0i\\).\n\n2. **Subtract the Real Parts:**\n   - Subtract the real part of the second complex number from the real part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     -2.0 - 10.0 = -12.0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Subtract the imaginary part of the second complex number from the imaginary part of the first complex number:\n     \\[\n     1.0i - (-3.0i) = 1.0i + 3.0i = 4.0i\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the subtraction of the real parts and the imaginary parts to form the final complex number:\n     \\[\n     -12.0 + 4.0i\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the result of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-2.0 + 1.0i)\\) and \\((10.0 - 3.0i)\\) is \\(-12.0 + 4.0i\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-12.0 + 4.0i>>>"
