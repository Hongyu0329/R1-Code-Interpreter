    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers \\((-5.0 - 5.0i)\\) and \\((2.0 + 4.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is \\((-5.0 - 5.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(-5.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(-5.0i\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\((2.0 + 4.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(2.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(4.0i\\).\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real part of the first complex number to the real part of the second complex number:\n     \\[\n     -5.0 + 2.0 = -3.0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary part of the first complex number to the imaginary part of the second complex number:\n     \\[\n     -5.0i + 4.0i = -1.0i\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the addition of the real parts and the imaginary parts to form the final complex number:\n     \\[\n     (-3.0) + (-1.0i) = -3.0 - 1.0i\n     \\]\n\n5. **Format the Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer should be presented in the format specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-3.0 - 1.0i>>>"
