    "To add the complex numbers \\((-8.0 + 3.0i)\\) and \\((-2.0 - 7.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real Parts**: \n   - The real part of the first complex number \\((-8.0 + 3.0i)\\) is \\(-8.0\\).\n   - The real part of the second complex number \\((-2.0 - 7.0i)\\) is \\(-2.0\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number \\((-8.0 + 3.0i)\\) is \\(3.0i\\).\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number \\((-2.0 - 7.0i)\\) is \\(-7.0i\\).\n\n3. **Add the Real Parts**:\n   - Add the real parts: \\(-8.0 + (-2.0) = -10.0\\).\n\n4. **Add the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Add the imaginary parts: \\(3.0i + (-7.0i) = -4.0i\\).\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the results from the addition of the real and imaginary parts to form the final complex number: \\(-10.0 - 4.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the complex numbers \\((-8.0 + 3.0i)\\) and \\((-2.0 - 7.0i)\\) is \\(-10.0 - 4.0i\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-10.0 - 4.0i>>>."
