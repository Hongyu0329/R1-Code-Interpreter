    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers (3.0 - 7.0i) and (7.00i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Components of Each Complex Number:**\n   - The first complex number is (3.0 - 7.0i).\n     - Real part: 3.0\n     - Imaginary part: -7.0i\n   - The second complex number is (7.00i).\n     - Real part: 0 (since there is no explicit real part, it is 0)\n     - Imaginary part: 7.00i\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Real part of the first complex number: 3.0\n   - Real part of the second complex number: 0\n   - Sum of the real parts: 3.0 + 0 = 3.0\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Imaginary part of the first complex number: -7.0i\n   - Imaginary part of the second complex number: 7.00i\n   - Sum of the imaginary parts: -7.0i + 7.00i = 0i\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - The sum of the real parts is 3.0.\n   - The sum of the imaginary parts is 0i.\n   - Therefore, the resulting complex number is 3.0 + 0i.\n\n5. **Simplify the Result:**\n   - Since the imaginary part is 0, the complex number simplifies to just the real part.\n   - Therefore, the final answer is 3.0.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the sum of the given complex numbers.\n\n<<<3.0>>>"
