    "To add the complex numbers (8.0 + 9.0i) and (-10.0 - 3.0i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real Parts**: \n   - The real part of the first complex number is 8.0.\n   - The real part of the second complex number is -10.0.\n\n2. **Identify the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number is 9.0i.\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number is -3.0i.\n\n3. **Add the Real Parts**:\n   - Add the real parts together: 8.0 + (-10.0) = -2.0.\n\n4. **Add the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Add the imaginary parts together: 9.0i + (-3.0i) = 6.0i.\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the sum of the real parts and the sum of the imaginary parts to form the final complex number: -2.0 + 6.0i.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the complex numbers (8.0 + 9.0i) and (-10.0 - 3.0i) is:\n\n<<<-2.0 + 6.0i>>>"
