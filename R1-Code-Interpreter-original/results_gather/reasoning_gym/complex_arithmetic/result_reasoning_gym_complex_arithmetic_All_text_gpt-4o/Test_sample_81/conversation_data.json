    "To add the complex numbers \\((-2.0 - 10.0i)\\) and \\((5.0 + 7.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is \\((-2.0 - 10.0i)\\), where \\(-2.0\\) is the real part and \\(-10.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is \\((5.0 + 7.0i)\\), where \\(5.0\\) is the real part and \\(7.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real parts of the two complex numbers: \\(-2.0 + 5.0\\).\n   - Calculation: \\(-2.0 + 5.0 = 3.0\\).\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers: \\(-10.0i + 7.0i\\).\n   - Calculation: \\(-10.0 + 7.0 = -3.0\\).\n   - Therefore, the imaginary part is \\(-3.0i\\).\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the addition of the real and imaginary parts to form the final complex number.\n   - The result is \\(3.0 - 3.0i\\).\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully added the two complex numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3.0 - 3.0i>>>."
