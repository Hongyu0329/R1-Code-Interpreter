    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers (6.0 + 5.0i) and (8.0 - 5.0i), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is (6.0 + 5.0i), where 6.0 is the real part and 5.0i is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is (8.0 - 5.0i), where 8.0 is the real part and -5.0i is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real parts of both complex numbers: 6.0 (from the first number) and 8.0 (from the second number).\n   - Calculation: 6.0 + 8.0 = 14.0\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary parts of both complex numbers: 5.0i (from the first number) and -5.0i (from the second number).\n   - Calculation: 5.0i + (-5.0i) = 0.0i\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the addition of the real parts and the imaginary parts to form the final complex number.\n   - The real part is 14.0 and the imaginary part is 0.0i.\n\n5. **Formulate the Final Answer:**\n   - The final complex number after addition is (14.0 + 0.0i).\n   - Since the imaginary part is 0.0i, it can be omitted in the final answer, simplifying it to just the real part.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the addition of the complex numbers (6.0 + 5.0i) and (8.0 - 5.0i) is:\n\n<<<14.0>>>"
