    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((3.0 - 7.0i) - (-8.0 + 1.0i)\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Complex Numbers:**\n   - The first complex number is \\(3.0 - 7.0i\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\(-8.0 + 1.0i\\).\n\n2. **Understand the Subtraction of Complex Numbers:**\n   - Subtracting complex numbers involves subtracting their real parts and their imaginary parts separately.\n\n3. **Apply the Subtraction:**\n   - The expression is \\((3.0 - 7.0i) - (-8.0 + 1.0i)\\).\n   - This can be rewritten as: \n     \\[\n     (3.0 - 7.0i) + (8.0 - 1.0i)\n     \\]\n   - Notice that subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive.\n\n4. **Separate the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Real parts: \\(3.0\\) and \\(8.0\\).\n   - Imaginary parts: \\(-7.0i\\) and \\(-1.0i\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - Add the real parts: \\(3.0 + 8.0 = 11.0\\).\n   - Add the imaginary parts: \\(-7.0i - 1.0i = -8.0i\\).\n\n6. **Combine the Results:**\n   - The result of the subtraction is \\(11.0 - 8.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<11.0 - 8.0i>>>"
