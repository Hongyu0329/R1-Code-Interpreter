    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-7.0 - 5.0i)\\) and \\((-8.0 + 9.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given two complex numbers and we need to subtract the second one from the first one. A complex number is in the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Identify the Components**:\n   - The first complex number is \\((-7.0 - 5.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(-7.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(-5.0\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\((-8.0 + 9.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(-8.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(9.0\\).\n\n3. **Apply the Subtraction**: Subtract the second complex number from the first by subtracting their respective real parts and imaginary parts separately.\n   - Subtract the real parts: \\(-7.0 - (-8.0)\\).\n   - Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(-5.0 - 9.0\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Real Part**:\n   - \\(-7.0 - (-8.0) = -7.0 + 8.0 = 1.0\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Imaginary Part**:\n   - \\(-5.0 - 9.0 = -5.0 - 9.0 = -14.0\\).\n\n6. **Combine the Results**: Combine the calculated real and imaginary parts to form the resulting complex number.\n   - The result is \\(1.0 - 14.0i\\).\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: Present the final answer in the required format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1.0 - 14.0i>>>"
