    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers \\((-8.0 + 5.0i)\\) and \\((8.0 + 8.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is \\((-8.0 + 5.0i)\\), where \\(-8.0\\) is the real part and \\(5.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is \\((8.0 + 8.0i)\\), where \\(8.0\\) is the real part and \\(8.0i\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real parts of the two complex numbers: \\(-8.0 + 8.0\\).\n   - Calculation: \\(-8.0 + 8.0 = 0.0\\).\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers: \\(5.0i + 8.0i\\).\n   - Calculation: \\(5.0i + 8.0i = 13.0i\\).\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the addition of the real parts and the imaginary parts to form the final complex number.\n   - The resulting complex number is \\(0.0 + 13.0i\\).\n\n5. **Format the Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer should be presented in the format specified: <<<answer>>>.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<0.0 + 13.0i>>>"
