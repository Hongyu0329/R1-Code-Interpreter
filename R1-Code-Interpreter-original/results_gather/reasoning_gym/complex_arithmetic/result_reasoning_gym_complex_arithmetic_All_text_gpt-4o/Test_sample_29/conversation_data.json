    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((7.0 - 4.0i) - (-1.00i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Complex Numbers:**\n   - The first complex number is \\(7.0 - 4.0i\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\(-1.00i\\).\n\n2. **Understand the Subtraction of Complex Numbers:**\n   - Subtracting a complex number is equivalent to adding its additive inverse. Therefore, subtracting \\(-1.00i\\) is the same as adding \\(1.00i\\).\n\n3. **Rewrite the Expression:**\n   - The expression \\((7.0 - 4.0i) - (-1.00i)\\) can be rewritten as \\((7.0 - 4.0i) + 1.00i\\).\n\n4. **Separate Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The real part of the first complex number is \\(7.0\\).\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number is \\(-4.0i\\).\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number is \\(1.00i\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - Add the real parts: \\(7.0\\) (since the second complex number has no real part).\n   - Add the imaginary parts: \\(-4.0i + 1.00i = -3.0i\\).\n\n6. **Combine the Results:**\n   - The result of the addition is \\(7.0 - 3.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the subtraction of the complex numbers is:\n\n<<<7.0 - 3.0i>>>"
