    "To multiply the complex numbers (6.0 - 7.0i) and (-7.00i), we need to follow the rules of complex number multiplication. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Components**: \n   - The first complex number is (6.0 - 7.0i), which has a real part of 6.0 and an imaginary part of -7.0i.\n   - The second complex number is (-7.00i), which has a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of -7.00i.\n\n2. **Apply the Distributive Property**:\n   - Multiply each part of the first complex number by each part of the second complex number.\n   - (6.0 - 7.0i) × (-7.00i) = 6.0 × (-7.00i) + (-7.0i) × (-7.00i).\n\n3. **Calculate Each Term**:\n   - **First Term**: 6.0 × (-7.00i) = -42.0i.\n   - **Second Term**: (-7.0i) × (-7.00i) = 49.0i².\n\n4. **Simplify Using i² = -1**:\n   - The imaginary unit i has the property that i² = -1.\n   - Therefore, 49.0i² = 49.0 × (-1) = -49.0.\n\n5. **Combine the Real and Imaginary Parts**:\n   - The real part is -49.0.\n   - The imaginary part is -42.0i.\n\n6. **Write the Final Result**:\n   - Combine the real and imaginary parts to form the final complex number: -49.0 - 42.0i.\n\nThus, the product of the complex numbers (6.0 - 7.0i) and (-7.00i) is:\n\n<<<-49.0 - 42.0i>>>"
