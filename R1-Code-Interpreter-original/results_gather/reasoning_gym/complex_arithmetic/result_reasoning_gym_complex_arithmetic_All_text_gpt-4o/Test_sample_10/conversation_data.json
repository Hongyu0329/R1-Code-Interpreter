    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-10.0 - 2.0i)\\) and \\((-3.0 - 3.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given two complex numbers and need to perform subtraction. A complex number is of the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Identify the Components**:\n   - The first complex number is \\((-10.0 - 2.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(-10.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(-2.0\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\((-3.0 - 3.0i)\\), where the real part is \\(-3.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(-3.0\\).\n\n3. **Apply the Subtraction Formula**: \n   - When subtracting two complex numbers \\((a + bi) - (c + di)\\), the result is \\((a - c) + (b - d)i\\).\n\n4. **Subtract the Real Parts**:\n   - Real part of the result: \\(-10.0 - (-3.0) = -10.0 + 3.0 = -7.0\\).\n\n5. **Subtract the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Imaginary part of the result: \\(-2.0 - (-3.0) = -2.0 + 3.0 = 1.0\\).\n\n6. **Combine the Results**:\n   - The result of the subtraction is \\((-7.0 + 1.0i)\\).\n\n7. **Format the Final Answer**: \n   - The final answer should be presented in the format specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<-7.0 + 1.0i>>>"
