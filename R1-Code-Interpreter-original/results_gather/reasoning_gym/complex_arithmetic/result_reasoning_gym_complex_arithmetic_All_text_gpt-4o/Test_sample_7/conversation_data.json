    "To add the complex numbers (2.0 - 10.0i) and (-4.0 - 3.0i), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - The first complex number is (2.0 - 10.0i), where 2.0 is the real part and -10.0 is the imaginary part.\n   - The second complex number is (-4.0 - 3.0i), where -4.0 is the real part and -3.0 is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Add the Real Parts:**\n   - Add the real parts of the two complex numbers: 2.0 + (-4.0).\n   - Calculation: 2.0 + (-4.0) = 2.0 - 4.0 = -2.0.\n\n3. **Add the Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Add the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers: -10.0 + (-3.0).\n   - Calculation: -10.0 + (-3.0) = -10.0 - 3.0 = -13.0.\n\n4. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the addition of the real parts and the imaginary parts to form the final complex number.\n   - The resulting complex number is (-2.0 - 13.0i).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the complex numbers (2.0 - 10.0i) and (-4.0 - 3.0i) is:\n\n<<<-2.0 - 13.0i>>>"
