    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((8.0 + 9.0i) - (-1.0 + 4.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Components of Complex Numbers**: \n   - A complex number is in the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Identify the Complex Numbers**:\n   - The first complex number is \\(8.0 + 9.0i\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\(-1.0 + 4.0i\\).\n\n3. **Apply the Subtraction**:\n   - Subtract the real parts: \\(8.0 - (-1.0)\\).\n   - Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(9.0i - 4.0i\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Real Part**:\n   - \\(8.0 - (-1.0) = 8.0 + 1.0 = 9.0\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Imaginary Part**:\n   - \\(9.0i - 4.0i = (9.0 - 4.0)i = 5.0i\\).\n\n6. **Combine the Results**:\n   - The result of the subtraction is \\(9.0 + 5.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the subtraction of the complex numbers is:\n\n<<<9.0 + 5.0i>>>"
