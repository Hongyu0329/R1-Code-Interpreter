    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-4.0 + 10.0i)\\) and \\((-4.0 - 9.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Complex Numbers**: \n   - A complex number is in the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n   - In this problem, the first complex number is \\((-4.0 + 10.0i)\\) and the second complex number is \\((-4.0 - 9.0i)\\).\n\n2. **Set Up the Subtraction**:\n   - We need to subtract the second complex number from the first: \n     \\[\n     (-4.0 + 10.0i) - (-4.0 - 9.0i)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Distribute the Negative Sign**:\n   - Distribute the negative sign across the second complex number:\n     \\[\n     (-4.0 + 10.0i) + (4.0 + 9.0i)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine Like Terms**:\n   - Combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately:\n     - Real parts: \\(-4.0 + 4.0 = 0.0\\)\n     - Imaginary parts: \\(10.0i + 9.0i = 19.0i\\)\n\n5. **Form the Resulting Complex Number**:\n   - The resulting complex number after subtraction is:\n     \\[\n     0.0 + 19.0i\n     \\]\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The final answer, in the format requested, is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{<<<0.0 + 19.0i>>>}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer to the subtraction of the complex numbers is:\n\n<<<0.0 + 19.0i>>>"
