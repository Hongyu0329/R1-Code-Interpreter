    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((7.0 - 7.0i) - (-5.0 + 2.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Components of Complex Numbers**: \n   - A complex number is in the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n   - In this problem, the first complex number is \\(7.0 - 7.0i\\) and the second complex number is \\(-5.0 + 2.0i\\).\n\n2. **Apply the Subtraction of Complex Numbers**:\n   - When subtracting complex numbers, subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\n   - The formula for subtraction is: \\((a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts**:\n   - For the first complex number \\(7.0 - 7.0i\\):\n     - Real part \\(a = 7.0\\)\n     - Imaginary part \\(b = -7.0\\)\n   - For the second complex number \\(-5.0 + 2.0i\\):\n     - Real part \\(c = -5.0\\)\n     - Imaginary part \\(d = 2.0\\)\n\n4. **Subtract the Real Parts**:\n   - Subtract the real part of the second complex number from the real part of the first complex number:\n   \\[\n   7.0 - (-5.0) = 7.0 + 5.0 = 12.0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Subtract the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Subtract the imaginary part of the second complex number from the imaginary part of the first complex number:\n   \\[\n   -7.0 - 2.0 = -9.0\n   \\]\n\n6. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the results from the subtraction of the real and imaginary parts to form the final complex number:\n   \\[\n   12.0 - 9.0i\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the result of the subtraction is:\n\n<<<12.0 - 9.0i>>>"
