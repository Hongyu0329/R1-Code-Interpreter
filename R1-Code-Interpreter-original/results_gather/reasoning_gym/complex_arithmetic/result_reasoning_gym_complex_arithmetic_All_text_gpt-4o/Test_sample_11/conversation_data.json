    "To add the complex numbers \\((-6.0 + 4.0i)\\) and \\((1.0 - 7.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Real Parts**: \n   - The real part of the first complex number \\((-6.0 + 4.0i)\\) is \\(-6.0\\).\n   - The real part of the second complex number \\((1.0 - 7.0i)\\) is \\(1.0\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - The imaginary part of the first complex number \\((-6.0 + 4.0i)\\) is \\(4.0i\\).\n   - The imaginary part of the second complex number \\((1.0 - 7.0i)\\) is \\(-7.0i\\).\n\n3. **Add the Real Parts**:\n   - Add the real parts: \\(-6.0 + 1.0 = -5.0\\).\n\n4. **Add the Imaginary Parts**:\n   - Add the imaginary parts: \\(4.0i + (-7.0i) = -3.0i\\).\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - Combine the results from the addition of the real and imaginary parts to form the final complex number: \\(-5.0 - 3.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the complex numbers \\((-6.0 + 4.0i)\\) and \\((1.0 - 7.0i)\\) is \\(-5.0 - 3.0i\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<-5.0 - 3.0i>>>."
