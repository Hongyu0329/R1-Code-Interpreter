    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((6.0 - 9.0i) - (-3.0 - 1.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Complex Numbers**: \n   - A complex number is in the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n   - In this problem, the first complex number is \\(6.0 - 9.0i\\) and the second complex number is \\(-3.0 - 1.0i\\).\n\n2. **Apply the Subtraction**:\n   - Subtracting complex numbers involves subtracting their real parts and their imaginary parts separately.\n   - The subtraction of two complex numbers \\((a + bi) - (c + di)\\) results in \\((a - c) + (b - d)i\\).\n\n3. **Identify the Real and Imaginary Parts**:\n   - For the first complex number \\(6.0 - 9.0i\\):\n     - Real part \\(a = 6.0\\)\n     - Imaginary part \\(b = -9.0\\)\n   - For the second complex number \\(-3.0 - 1.0i\\):\n     - Real part \\(c = -3.0\\)\n     - Imaginary part \\(d = -1.0\\)\n\n4. **Perform the Subtraction**:\n   - Subtract the real parts: \\(6.0 - (-3.0) = 6.0 + 3.0 = 9.0\\)\n   - Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(-9.0 - (-1.0) = -9.0 + 1.0 = -8.0\\)\n\n5. **Combine the Results**:\n   - The result of the subtraction is \\(9.0 - 8.0i\\).\n\n6. **Format the Final Answer**:\n   - The final answer should be presented in the format specified.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9.0 - 8.0i>>>"
