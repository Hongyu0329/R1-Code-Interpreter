    "To subtract the complex numbers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Complex Numbers:**\n   - The first complex number is given as \\(4.00\\). This can be interpreted as \\(4.00 + 0.00i\\) since it has no imaginary part explicitly mentioned.\n   - The second complex number is \\(7.0 + 7.0i\\).\n\n2. **Write the Subtraction Expression:**\n   - We need to subtract the second complex number from the first: \n     \\[\n     (4.00 + 0.00i) - (7.0 + 7.0i)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Distribute the Negative Sign:**\n   - Distribute the negative sign across the second complex number:\n     \\[\n     4.00 + 0.00i - 7.0 - 7.0i\n     \\]\n\n4. **Separate Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Real parts: \\(4.00 - 7.0\\)\n   - Imaginary parts: \\(0.00i - 7.0i\\)\n\n5. **Perform the Subtraction:**\n   - Subtract the real parts:\n     \\[\n     4.00 - 7.0 = -3.00\n     \\]\n   - Subtract the imaginary parts:\n     \\[\n     0.00i - 7.0i = -7.0i\n     \\]\n\n6. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from the real and imaginary parts:\n     \\[\n     -3.00 - 7.0i\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer, in the required format, is:\n\n<<<-3.00 - 7.0i>>>"
