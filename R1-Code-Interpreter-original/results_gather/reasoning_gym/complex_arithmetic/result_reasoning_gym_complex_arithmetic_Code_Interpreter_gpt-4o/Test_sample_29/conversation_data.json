    "\nassistant > To subtract the complex numbers \\((7.0 - 4.0i) - (-1.00i)\\), we need to subtract the real and imaginary parts separately.\n\nThe real part of the first complex number is \\(7.0\\), and the imaginary part is \\(-4.0i\\). The second complex number is purely imaginary, \\(-1.00i\\), which means its real part is \\(0\\) and its imaginary part is \\(-1.00i\\).\n\nSubtracting the real parts:\n\\[ 7.0 - 0 = 7.0 \\]\n\nSubtracting the imaginary parts:\n\\[ -4.0i - (-1.00i) = -4.0i + 1.00i = -3.0i \\]\n\nThus, the result of the subtraction is:\n\\[ 7.0 - 3.0i \\]\n\nThe final answer is in the format:\n\\[ \\text{<<<7.0 - 3.0i>>>} \\]"
