    "\nassistant > To divide the complex numbers \\((61.0 - 27.0i)\\) by \\((1.0 - 7.0i)\\), we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\((1.0 - 7.0i)\\) is \\((1.0 + 7.0i)\\).\n\nThe division can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{61.0 - 27.0i}{1.0 - 7.0i} \\times \\frac{1.0 + 7.0i}{1.0 + 7.0i}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import I\n\n# Define the complex numbers\nnumerator = 61.0 - 27.0 * I\ndenominator = 1.0 - 7.0 * I\n\n# Calculate the division\nresult = numerator / denominator\nresult\nassistant > It seems there was a mistake in the calculation.
