    "To divide two complex numbers, we can use the formula for dividing complex numbers. Given two complex numbers \\( a + bi \\) and \\( c + di \\), their division is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \\frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i}{c^2 + d^2}\n\\]\n\nFor the given complex numbers \\((-33.0 - 21.0i)\\) and \\((-3.0 + 3.0i)\\), we can identify:\n\n- \\( a = -33.0 \\)\n- \\( b = -21.0 \\)\n- \\( c = -3.0 \\)\n- \\( d = 3.0 \\)\n\nNow, let's compute the division using the formula:\n\n1. Compute the real part: \\( ac + bd \\)\n2. Compute the imaginary part: \\( bc - ad \\)\n3. Compute the denominator: \\( c^2 + d^2 \\)\n4. Divide the real and imaginary parts by the denominator.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the components of the complex numbers\na, b = -33.0, -21.0\nc, d = -3.0, 3.0\n\n# Calculate the real part of the result\nreal_part = (a * c + b * d)\n\n# Calculate the imaginary part of the result\nimaginary_part = (b * c - a * d)\n\n# Calculate the denominator\ndenominator = (c ** 2 + d ** 2)\n\n# Calculate the real and imaginary parts of the division\nreal_result = real_part / denominator\nimaginary_result = imaginary_part / denominator\n\n# Print the result as a complex number\nprint(f\"{real_result} + {imaginary_result}i\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result of the division.",
    "The division of the complex numbers \\((-33.0 - 21.0i)\\) by \\((-3.0 + 3.0i)\\) results in the complex number \\(2.0 + 9.0i\\).\n\n<<<2.0 + 9.0i>>>"
