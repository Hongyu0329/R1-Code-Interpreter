    "To divide two complex numbers, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \\frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i}{c^2 + d^2}\n\\]\n\nGiven the complex numbers \\((-56.0 + 34.0i)\\) and \\((7.0 + 3.0i)\\), we can identify:\n- \\(a = -56.0\\)\n- \\(b = 34.0\\)\n- \\(c = 7.0\\)\n- \\(d = 3.0\\)\n\nLet's calculate the division using the formula:\n\n1. Calculate the real part: \\(ac + bd\\)\n2. Calculate the imaginary part: \\(bc - ad\\)\n3. Calculate the denominator: \\(c^2 + d^2\\)\n4. Divide the real and imaginary parts by the denominator.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\n# Given complex numbers\na, b = -56.0, 34.0\nc, d = 7.0, 3.0\n\n# Calculate the real part\nreal_part = (a * c + b * d)\n\n# Calculate the imaginary part\nimaginary_part = (b * c - a * d)\n\n# Calculate the denominator\ndenominator = (c ** 2 + d ** 2)\n\n# Divide the real and imaginary parts by the denominator\nreal_result = real_part / denominator\nimaginary_result = imaginary_part / denominator\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"({real_result}) + ({imaginary_result})i\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result of the division.",
    "The division of the complex numbers \\((-56.0 + 34.0i)\\) by \\((7.0 + 3.0i)\\) results in the complex number \\((-5.0 + 7.0i)\\).\n\n<<<(-5.0 + 7.0i)>>>"
