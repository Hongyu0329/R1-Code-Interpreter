    "To solve the problem of multiplying the complex numbers \\((-4.00)\\) and \\((5.0 - 4.0i)\\), we need to apply the distributive property of multiplication over addition, which is applicable to complex numbers.\n\nThe multiplication of two complex numbers \\((a + bi)\\) and \\((c + di)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n(a + bi) \\times (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the first complex number is \\((-4.00 + 0i)\\) and the second complex number is \\((5.0 - 4.0i)\\).\n\nLet's identify the components:\n- \\(a = -4.00\\), \\(b = 0\\)\n- \\(c = 5.0\\), \\(d = -4.0\\)\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n(-4.00 + 0i) \\times (5.0 - 4.0i) = (-4.00 \\times 5.0 - 0 \\times -4.0) + (-4.00 \\times -4.0 + 0 \\times 5.0)i\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(-20.00) + (16.00)i\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\na, b = -4.00, 0\nc, d = 5.0, -4.0\n\n# Calculate the real and imaginary parts\nreal_part = a * c - b * d\nimaginary_part = a * d + b * c\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"({real_part}) + ({imaginary_part})i\")\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the calculation.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The multiplication of the complex numbers \\((-4.00)\\) and \\((5.0 - 4.0i)\\) results in:\n\n<<<(-20.0) + (16.0)i>>>"
