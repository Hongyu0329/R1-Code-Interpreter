    "To divide two complex numbers, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \\frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)}\n\\]\n\nThis formula involves multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of a complex number \\(c + di\\) is \\(c - di\\).\n\nGiven the complex numbers:\n- Numerator: \\(-51.0 + 21.0i\\)\n- Denominator: \\(5.0 + 1.0i\\)\n\nLet's calculate the division step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the conjugate of the denominator: \\(5.0 - 1.0i\\).\n2. Multiply the numerator by the conjugate of the denominator.\n3. Multiply the denominator by its conjugate to get a real number.\n4. Divide the result from step 2 by the result from step 3.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\nnumerator = complex(-51.0, 21.0)\ndenominator = complex(5.0, 1.0)\n\n# Calculate the conjugate of the denominator\nconjugate_denominator = complex(denominator.real, -denominator.imag)\n\n# Multiply the numerator by the conjugate of the denominator\nnumerator_conjugate_product = numerator * conjugate_denominator\n\n# Multiply the denominator by its conjugate\ndenominator_conjugate_product = denominator * conjugate_denominator\n\n# Perform the division\nresult = numerator_conjugate_product / denominator_conjugate_product\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result of the division.",
    "The division of the complex numbers \\((-51.0 + 21.0i)\\) by \\((5.0 + 1.0i)\\) results in the complex number \\((-9 + 6i)\\).\n\n<<<(-9 + 6i)>>>"
