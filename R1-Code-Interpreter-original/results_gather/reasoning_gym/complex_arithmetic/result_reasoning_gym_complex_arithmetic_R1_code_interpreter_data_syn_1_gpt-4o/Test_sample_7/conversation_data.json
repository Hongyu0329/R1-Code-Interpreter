    "To solve the problem of adding two complex numbers, we need to add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. The given complex numbers are:\n\n1. \\(2.0 - 10.0i\\)\n2. \\(-4.0 - 3.0i\\)\n\nThe addition of these complex numbers can be broken down into:\n\n- Real part: \\(2.0 + (-4.0)\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(-10.0 + (-3.0)\\)\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers\nreal1, imag1 = 2.0, -10.0\nreal2, imag2 = -4.0, -3.0\n\n# Calculate the sum of the real parts and the imaginary parts\nreal_sum = real1 + real2\nimag_sum = imag1 + imag2\n\n# Print the result in the form of a complex number\nprint(f\"{real_sum} + {imag_sum}i\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is \\(-2.0 + -13.0i\\). This means the sum of the complex numbers \\( (2.0 - 10.0i) + (-4.0 - 3.0i) \\) is:\n\n- Real part: \\(2.0 + (-4.0) = -2.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(-10.0 + (-3.0) = -13.0\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-2.0 - 13.0i>>>"
