    "To solve the problem of adding two complex numbers, we need to add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. The given complex numbers are:\n\n1. \\((-10.0 - 1.0i)\\)\n2. \\((-8.0 - 10.0i)\\)\n\nThe addition of these two complex numbers can be broken down as follows:\n\n- Real part: \\(-10.0 + (-8.0)\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(-1.0i + (-10.0i)\\)\n\nLet's calculate these separately using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(-10.0, -1.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(-8.0, -10.0)\n\n# Add the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 + complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the addition of the two complex numbers.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the result of adding the two complex numbers. The output is \\((-18 - 11j)\\), which represents the sum of the real parts and the sum of the imaginary parts.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(-18 - 11i)>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
