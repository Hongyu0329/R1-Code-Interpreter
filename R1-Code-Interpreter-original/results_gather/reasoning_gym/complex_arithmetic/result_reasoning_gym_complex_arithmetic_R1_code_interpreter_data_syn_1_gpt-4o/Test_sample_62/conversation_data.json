    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-7.0 - 2.0i)\\) and \\((-1.0 + 3.0i)\\), we need to follow the rules of complex number arithmetic. \n\nThe subtraction of two complex numbers \\((a + bi)\\) and \\((c + di)\\) is given by:\n\\[\n(a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i\n\\]\n\nApplying this to our problem:\n- The first complex number is \\((-7.0 - 2.0i)\\), where \\(a = -7.0\\) and \\(b = -2.0\\).\n- The second complex number is \\((-1.0 + 3.0i)\\), where \\(c = -1.0\\) and \\(d = 3.0\\).\n\nNow, we perform the subtraction:\n- Real part: \\((-7.0) - (-1.0) = -7.0 + 1.0 = -6.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\((-2.0) - 3.0 = -2.0 - 3.0 = -5.0\\)\n\nThus, the result of the subtraction is \\((-6.0 - 5.0i)\\).\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\nz1 = complex(-7.0, -2.0)\nz2 = complex(-1.0, 3.0)\n\n# Subtract the complex numbers\nresult = z1 - z2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The result of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-7.0 - 2.0i)\\) and \\((-1.0 + 3.0i)\\) is \\((-6.0 - 5.0i)\\).\n\n<<<(-6.0 - 5.0i)>>>"
