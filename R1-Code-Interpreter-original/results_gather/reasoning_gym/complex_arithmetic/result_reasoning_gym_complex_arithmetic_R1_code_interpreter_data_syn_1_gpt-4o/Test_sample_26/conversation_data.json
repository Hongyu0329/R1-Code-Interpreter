    "To solve the problem of subtracting two complex numbers, we need to understand the basic operation of subtraction with complex numbers. A complex number is generally represented as \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\nGiven two complex numbers \\(z_1 = -4.0 + 10.0i\\) and \\(z_2 = -4.0 - 9.0i\\), the subtraction operation is performed as follows:\n\n\\[\nz_1 - z_2 = (-4.0 + 10.0i) - (-4.0 - 9.0i)\n\\]\n\nThis can be broken down into:\n\n1. Subtract the real parts: \\(-4.0 - (-4.0)\\)\n2. Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(10.0 - (-9.0)\\)\n\nLet's compute these values using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\nz1_real = -4.0\nz1_imag = 10.0\nz2_real = -4.0\nz2_imag = -9.0\n\n# Subtract the real parts\nreal_part = z1_real - z2_real\n\n# Subtract the imaginary parts\nimaginary_part = z1_imag - z2_imag\n\n# Form the resulting complex number\nresult = complex(real_part, imaginary_part)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result of the subtraction.",
    "The code execution output indicates that the result of the subtraction is a purely imaginary number, \\(19j\\). This means that the real part of the result is zero, and the imaginary part is 19.\n\nBreaking down the calculation:\n\n1. Subtracting the real parts: \\(-4.0 - (-4.0) = 0.0\\)\n2. Subtracting the imaginary parts: \\(10.0 - (-9.0) = 19.0\\)\n\nThus, the result of the subtraction is \\(0.0 + 19.0i\\), which simplifies to \\(19i\\).\n\n<<<19j>>>"
