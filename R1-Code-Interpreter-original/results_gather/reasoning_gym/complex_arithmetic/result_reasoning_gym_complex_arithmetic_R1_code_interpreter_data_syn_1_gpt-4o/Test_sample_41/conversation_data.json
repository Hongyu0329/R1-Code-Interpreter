    "To solve the problem of adding two complex numbers, we need to add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. The given complex numbers are:\n\n1. \\(6.0 + 5.0i\\)\n2. \\(8.0 - 5.0i\\)\n\nThe addition of these complex numbers can be broken down as follows:\n\n- Real part: \\(6.0 + 8.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(5.0i - 5.0i\\)\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers\nreal_part1 = 6.0\nimaginary_part1 = 5.0\n\nreal_part2 = 8.0\nimaginary_part2 = -5.0\n\n# Calculate the sum of the real parts and the imaginary parts\nreal_sum = real_part1 + real_part2\nimaginary_sum = imaginary_part1 + imaginary_part2\n\n# Print the result as a complex number\nprint(f\"{real_sum} + {imaginary_sum}i\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is \\(14.0 + 0.0i\\). This means that when you add the complex numbers \\((6.0 + 5.0i)\\) and \\((8.0 - 5.0i)\\), the result is a purely real number with no imaginary part.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<14.0>>>"
