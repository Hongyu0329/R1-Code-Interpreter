    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((6.0 - 9.0i) - (-3.0 - 1.0i)\\), we need to follow the rules of complex number arithmetic. \n\nThe subtraction of two complex numbers \\((a + bi) - (c + di)\\) is performed by subtracting the real parts and the imaginary parts separately:\n\n1. Subtract the real parts: \\(a - c\\).\n2. Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(b - d\\).\n\nFor the given complex numbers:\n- The first complex number is \\(6.0 - 9.0i\\), where \\(a = 6.0\\) and \\(b = -9.0\\).\n- The second complex number is \\(-3.0 - 1.0i\\), where \\(c = -3.0\\) and \\(d = -1.0\\).\n\nNow, let's perform the subtraction:\n\n1. Real part: \\(6.0 - (-3.0) = 6.0 + 3.0 = 9.0\\).\n2. Imaginary part: \\(-9.0 - (-1.0) = -9.0 + 1.0 = -8.0\\).\n\nThus, the result of the subtraction is \\(9.0 - 8.0i\\).\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(6.0, -9.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(-3.0, -1.0)\n\n# Perform the subtraction\nresult = complex1 - complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will confirm the result of the subtraction.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output \\((9-8j)\\) confirms our manual calculation. The subtraction of the complex numbers \\((6.0 - 9.0i) - (-3.0 - 1.0i)\\) results in \\(9.0 - 8.0i\\).\n\n<<<9.0 - 8.0i>>>"
