    "To multiply two complex numbers, we use the distributive property and the fact that \\(i^2 = -1\\). The multiplication of two complex numbers \\((a + bi)\\) and \\((c + di)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n(a + bi) \\times (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i\n\\]\n\nFor the given complex numbers \\((-7.0 - 1.0i)\\) and \\((-2.0 + 3.0i)\\), we can identify:\n- \\(a = -7.0\\)\n- \\(b = -1.0\\)\n- \\(c = -2.0\\)\n- \\(d = 3.0\\)\n\nNow, let's compute the real and imaginary parts separately:\n\n1. Real part: \\(ac - bd\\)\n2. Imaginary part: \\(ad + bc\\)\n\nLet's calculate these using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the components of the complex numbers\na, b = -7.0, -1.0\nc, d = -2.0, 3.0\n\n# Calculate the real part\nreal_part = a * c - b * d\n\n# Calculate the imaginary part\nimaginary_part = a * d + b * c\n\n# Print the result in the form of a complex number\nprint(f\"{real_part} + {imaginary_part}i\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the result of multiplying the two complex numbers. The real part is \\(17.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(-19.0\\).\n\nTherefore, the product of the complex numbers \\((-7.0 - 1.0i)\\) and \\((-2.0 + 3.0i)\\) is:\n\n<<<17.0 - 19.0i>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Multiply the complex numbers: (-7.0 - 1.0i) × (-2.0 + 3.0i)\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
