    "To solve the problem of subtracting two complex numbers, we need to understand the basic operation of complex number subtraction. \n\nA complex number is generally represented as \\( a + bi \\), where \\( a \\) is the real part and \\( b \\) is the imaginary part. When subtracting two complex numbers, we subtract their real parts and their imaginary parts separately.\n\nGiven the complex numbers:\n- \\( z_1 = -1.0 - 2.0i \\)\n- \\( z_2 = 5.0 - 8.0i \\)\n\nThe subtraction \\( z_1 - z_2 \\) can be calculated as follows:\n- Real part: \\( -1.0 - 5.0 \\)\n- Imaginary part: \\( -2.0 - (-8.0) \\)\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\nz1_real = -1.0\nz1_imag = -2.0\nz2_real = 5.0\nz2_imag = -8.0\n\n# Subtract the real parts\nreal_part = z1_real - z2_real\n\n# Subtract the imaginary parts\nimaginary_part = z1_imag - z2_imag\n\n# Form the resulting complex number\nresult = complex(real_part, imaginary_part)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the subtraction.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is the result of the subtraction of the two complex numbers.\n\nThe subtraction of the complex numbers \\((-1.0 - 2.0i) - (5.0 - 8.0i)\\) results in the complex number \\((-6 + 6i)\\).\n\n<<<(-6 + 6i)>>>"
