    "To solve the problem of adding two complex numbers, we need to add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. \n\nGiven the complex numbers:\n- First complex number: \\(8.0 + 2.0i\\)\n- Second complex number: \\(10.0 - 5.0i\\)\n\nThe addition of these two complex numbers can be broken down as follows:\n- Real part: \\(8.0 + 10.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(2.0 + (-5.0)\\)\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers\nreal_part1 = 8.0\nimaginary_part1 = 2.0\nreal_part2 = 10.0\nimaginary_part2 = -5.0\n\n# Calculate the sum of the real parts and the imaginary parts\nreal_sum = real_part1 + real_part2\nimaginary_sum = imaginary_part1 + imaginary_part2\n\n# Print the result in the form of a complex number\nprint(f\"{real_sum} + {imaginary_sum}i\")\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the addition of the two complex numbers.",
    "The code executed correctly and provided the output for the addition of the two complex numbers. The result of adding the complex numbers \\((8.0 + 2.0i)\\) and \\((10.0 - 5.0i)\\) is:\n\nReal part: \\(8.0 + 10.0 = 18.0\\)\n\nImaginary part: \\(2.0 + (-5.0) = -3.0\\)\n\nThus, the sum of the complex numbers is \\(18.0 - 3.0i\\).\n\n<<<18.0 - 3.0i>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
