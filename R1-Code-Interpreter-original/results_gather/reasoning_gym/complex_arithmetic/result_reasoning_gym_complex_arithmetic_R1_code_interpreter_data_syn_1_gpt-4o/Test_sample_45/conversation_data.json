    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-4.00i) - (-3.0 - 4.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Complex Numbers**: \n   - The first complex number is \\(0 - 4.00i\\) (since there is no real part, it is 0).\n   - The second complex number is \\(-3.0 - 4.0i\\).\n\n2. **Apply the Subtraction**:\n   - Subtract the real parts: \\(0 - (-3.0) = 3.0\\).\n   - Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(-4.00i - (-4.0i) = 0i\\).\n\n3. **Combine the Results**:\n   - The result of the subtraction is \\(3.0 + 0i\\), which simplifies to \\(3.0\\).\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(0, -4.00)\ncomplex2 = complex(-3.0, -4.0)\n\n# Perform the subtraction\nresult = complex1 - complex2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the result of the subtraction.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculation. The result of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-4.00i) - (-3.0 - 4.0i)\\) is indeed \\(3.0\\).\n\n<<<3.0>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Subtract the complex numbers: (-4.00i) - (-3.0 - 4.0i)\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
