    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-5.0 - 1.0i)\\) and \\((-7.0 + 1.0i)\\), we need to follow the rules of complex number arithmetic. \n\nThe subtraction of two complex numbers \\((a + bi)\\) and \\((c + di)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n(a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the complex numbers are:\n- First complex number: \\((-5.0 - 1.0i)\\) where \\(a = -5.0\\) and \\(b = -1.0\\)\n- Second complex number: \\((-7.0 + 1.0i)\\) where \\(c = -7.0\\) and \\(d = 1.0\\)\n\nNow, let's perform the subtraction:\n\n1. Subtract the real parts: \\(-5.0 - (-7.0) = -5.0 + 7.0 = 2.0\\)\n2. Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(-1.0 - 1.0 = -2.0\\)\n\nThus, the result of the subtraction is \\(2.0 - 2.0i\\).\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(-5.0, -1.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(-7.0, 1.0)\n\n# Perform the subtraction\nresult = complex1 - complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output \\((2-2j)\\) confirms our manual calculation. The subtraction of the complex numbers \\((-5.0 - 1.0i)\\) and \\((-7.0 + 1.0i)\\) results in \\(2.0 - 2.0i\\).\n\n<<<2.0 - 2.0i>>>"
