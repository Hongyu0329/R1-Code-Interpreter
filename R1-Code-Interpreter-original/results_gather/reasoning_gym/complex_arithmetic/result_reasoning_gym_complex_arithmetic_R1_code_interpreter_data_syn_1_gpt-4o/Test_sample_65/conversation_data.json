    "To solve the problem of adding two complex numbers, we need to add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. The given complex numbers are:\n\n1. \\( (1.0 - 9.0i) \\)\n2. \\( (8.0 - 10.0i) \\)\n\nThe addition of these two complex numbers can be broken down as follows:\n\n- Real part: \\( 1.0 + 8.0 = 9.0 \\)\n- Imaginary part: \\( -9.0 + (-10.0) = -19.0 \\)\n\nThus, the result of the addition is \\( 9.0 - 19.0i \\).\n\nLet's verify this by writing a simple Python script to perform the addition of these complex numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(1.0, -9.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(8.0, -10.0)\n\n# Add the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 + complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The result of adding the complex numbers \\( (1.0 - 9.0i) \\) and \\( (8.0 - 10.0i) \\) is \\( 9.0 - 19.0i \\).\n\n<<<9.0 - 19.0i>>>"
