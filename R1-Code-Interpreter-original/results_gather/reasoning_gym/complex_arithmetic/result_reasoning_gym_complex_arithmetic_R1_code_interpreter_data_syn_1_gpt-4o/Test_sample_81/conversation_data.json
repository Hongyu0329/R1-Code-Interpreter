    "To solve the problem of adding two complex numbers, we need to add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. \n\nGiven the complex numbers:\n1. \\((-2.0 - 10.0i)\\)\n2. \\((5.0 + 7.0i)\\)\n\nThe real parts are \\(-2.0\\) and \\(5.0\\). The imaginary parts are \\(-10.0\\) and \\(7.0\\).\n\nThe sum of the real parts is:\n\\[\n-2.0 + 5.0 = 3.0\n\\]\n\nThe sum of the imaginary parts is:\n\\[\n-10.0 + 7.0 = -3.0\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the complex numbers is:\n\\[\n3.0 - 3.0i\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(-2.0, -10.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(5.0, 7.0)\n\n# Add the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 + complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will confirm the calculation.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output confirms our manual calculation. The sum of the complex numbers \\((-2.0 - 10.0i)\\) and \\((5.0 + 7.0i)\\) is indeed \\((3.0 - 3.0i)\\).\n\n<<<3.0 - 3.0i>>>"
