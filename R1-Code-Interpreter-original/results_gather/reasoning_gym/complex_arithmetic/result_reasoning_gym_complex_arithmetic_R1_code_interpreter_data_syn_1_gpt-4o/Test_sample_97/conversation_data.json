    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((6.0 - 2.0i) - (-9.0 + 2.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the components of the complex numbers**:\n   - The first complex number is \\(6.0 - 2.0i\\), which has a real part of 6.0 and an imaginary part of -2.0.\n   - The second complex number is \\(-9.0 + 2.0i\\), which has a real part of -9.0 and an imaginary part of 2.0.\n\n2. **Subtract the real parts**:\n   - Real part of the result = \\(6.0 - (-9.0) = 6.0 + 9.0 = 15.0\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the imaginary parts**:\n   - Imaginary part of the result = \\(-2.0 - 2.0 = -4.0\\).\n\n4. **Combine the results**:\n   - The resulting complex number is \\(15.0 - 4.0i\\).\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(6.0, -2.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(-9.0, 2.0)\n\n# Subtract the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 - complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm our manual calculation.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculation. The result of subtracting the complex numbers \\((6.0 - 2.0i) - (-9.0 + 2.0i)\\) is indeed \\(15.0 - 4.0i\\).\n\n<<<15.0 - 4.0i>>>"
