    "To solve the problem of adding two complex numbers, we need to add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. \n\nGiven the complex numbers:\n1. \\(6.0 + 7.0i\\)\n2. \\(-5.0 - 3.0i\\)\n\nThe real parts are \\(6.0\\) and \\(-5.0\\), and the imaginary parts are \\(7.0\\) and \\(-3.0\\).\n\nThe sum of the real parts is:\n\\[6.0 + (-5.0) = 1.0\\]\n\nThe sum of the imaginary parts is:\n\\[7.0 + (-3.0) = 4.0\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the complex numbers is:\n\\[1.0 + 4.0i\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(6.0, 7.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(-5.0, -3.0)\n\n# Add the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 + complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculation. The sum of the complex numbers \\((6.0 + 7.0i)\\) and \\((-5.0 - 3.0i)\\) is indeed \\((1.0 + 4.0i)\\).\n\n<<<1.0 + 4.0i>>>"
