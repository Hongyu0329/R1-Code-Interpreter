    "To multiply two complex numbers, we use the distributive property and the fact that \\(i^2 = -1\\). Given two complex numbers \\(a + bi\\) and \\(c + di\\), their product is:\n\n\\[\n(a + bi) \\times (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i\n\\]\n\nFor the given complex numbers \\( (1.0 + 8.0i) \\) and \\( (-7.0 - 10.0i) \\), we can identify:\n\n- \\(a = 1.0\\), \\(b = 8.0\\)\n- \\(c = -7.0\\), \\(d = -10.0\\)\n\nNow, we can calculate the real and imaginary parts separately:\n\n- Real part: \\(ac - bd = (1.0 \\times -7.0) - (8.0 \\times -10.0)\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(ad + bc = (1.0 \\times -10.0) + (8.0 \\times -7.0)\\)\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the components of the complex numbers\na, b = 1.0, 8.0\nc, d = -7.0, -10.0\n\n# Calculate the real and imaginary parts\nreal_part = (a * c) - (b * d)\nimaginary_part = (a * d) + (b * c)\n\n# Output the result as a complex number\nresult = f\"{real_part} + {imaginary_part}i\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the multiplication.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the result of multiplying the two complex numbers. The real part is 73.0, and the imaginary part is -66.0. Therefore, the product of the complex numbers \\((1.0 + 8.0i)\\) and \\((-7.0 - 10.0i)\\) is:\n\n<<<73.0 - 66.0i>>>"
