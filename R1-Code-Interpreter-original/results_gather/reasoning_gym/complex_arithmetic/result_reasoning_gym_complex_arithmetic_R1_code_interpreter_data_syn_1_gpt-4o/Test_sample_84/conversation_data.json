    "To multiply two complex numbers, we use the distributive property and the fact that \\(i^2 = -1\\). Given two complex numbers \\(a + bi\\) and \\(c + di\\), their product is:\n\n\\[\n(a + bi) \\times (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i\n\\]\n\nFor the given complex numbers \\(9.0 + 7.0i\\) and \\(-1.0 - 10.0i\\), we can identify:\n\n- \\(a = 9.0\\), \\(b = 7.0\\)\n- \\(c = -1.0\\), \\(d = -10.0\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n- Real part: \\(ac - bd = (9.0 \\times -1.0) - (7.0 \\times -10.0)\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(ad + bc = (9.0 \\times -10.0) + (7.0 \\times -1.0)\\)\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the components of the complex numbers\na, b = 9.0, 7.0\nc, d = -1.0, -10.0\n\n# Calculate the real and imaginary parts\nreal_part = (a * c) - (b * d)\nimaginary_part = (a * d) + (b * c)\n\n# Print the result as a complex number\nprint(f\"{real_part} + {imaginary_part}i\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is \\(61.0 + -97.0i\\). This means the result of multiplying the complex numbers \\(9.0 + 7.0i\\) and \\(-1.0 - 10.0i\\) is \\(61.0 - 97.0i\\).\n\n<<<61.0 - 97.0i>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
