    "To solve the problem of adding two complex numbers, we need to add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately.\n\nGiven the complex numbers:\n1. \\(5.0 - 2.0i\\)\n2. \\(-8.0 - 1.0i\\)\n\nThe real parts are \\(5.0\\) and \\(-8.0\\).\nThe imaginary parts are \\(-2.0\\) and \\(-1.0\\).\n\nThe sum of the real parts is:\n\\[5.0 + (-8.0) = -3.0\\]\n\nThe sum of the imaginary parts is:\n\\[-2.0 + (-1.0) = -3.0\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the complex numbers is:\n\\(-3.0 - 3.0i\\)\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(5.0, -2.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(-8.0, -1.0)\n\n# Add the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 + complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The sum of the complex numbers \\( (5.0 - 2.0i) + (-8.0 - 1.0i) \\) is indeed \\(-3.0 - 3.0i\\).\n\n<<<-3.0 - 3.0i>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
