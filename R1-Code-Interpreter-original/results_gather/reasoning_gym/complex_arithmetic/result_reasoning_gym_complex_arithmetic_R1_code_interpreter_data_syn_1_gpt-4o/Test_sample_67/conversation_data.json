    "To solve the problem of subtracting two complex numbers, we need to understand the basic operation of subtraction with complex numbers. A complex number is generally represented as \\( a + bi \\), where \\( a \\) is the real part and \\( b \\) is the imaginary part.\n\nGiven two complex numbers:\n1. \\( z_1 = -4.0 + 9.0i \\)\n2. \\( z_2 = -5.0 - 3.0i \\)\n\nThe subtraction of two complex numbers \\( z_1 - z_2 \\) is performed by subtracting their corresponding real and imaginary parts:\n\n- Real part: \\( -4.0 - (-5.0) = -4.0 + 5.0 \\)\n- Imaginary part: \\( 9.0 - (-3.0) = 9.0 + 3.0 \\)\n\nNow, let's calculate these values using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\nz1_real = -4.0\nz1_imag = 9.0\nz2_real = -5.0\nz2_imag = -3.0\n\n# Subtract the real parts\nreal_part = z1_real - z2_real\n\n# Subtract the imaginary parts\nimaginary_part = z1_imag - z2_imag\n\n# Form the resulting complex number\nresult = complex(real_part, imaginary_part)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result of the subtraction.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the subtraction of the complex numbers is \\( 1 + 12i \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1 + 12i>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Subtract the complex numbers: (-4.0 + 9.0i) - (-5.0 - 3.0i)\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
