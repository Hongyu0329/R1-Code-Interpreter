    "To divide two complex numbers, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \\frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)}\n\\]\n\nThis formula involves multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of a complex number \\(c + di\\) is \\(c - di\\).\n\nGiven the complex numbers:\n- Numerator: \\(-125.0 - 13.0i\\)\n- Denominator: \\(-5.0 - 9.0i\\)\n\nLet's calculate the division step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the conjugate of the denominator**: The conjugate of \\(-5.0 - 9.0i\\) is \\(-5.0 + 9.0i\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the numerator and the conjugate of the denominator**: \n   \\((-125.0 - 13.0i)(-5.0 + 9.0i)\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the denominator and its conjugate**: \n   \\((-5.0 - 9.0i)(-5.0 + 9.0i)\\)\n\n4. **Simplify the expression**: \n   - The denominator will become a real number since it is the product of a complex number and its conjugate.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\nnumerator = complex(-125.0, -13.0)\ndenominator = complex(-5.0, -9.0)\n\n# Calculate the division\nresult = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the division is approximately \\(7 - 10i\\). The slight discrepancies in the decimal places are due to floating-point precision limitations in computing.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7 - 10i>>>"
