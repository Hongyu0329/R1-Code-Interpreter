    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((6.0 - 7.0i) - (9.0 + 8.0i)\\), we need to perform the subtraction operation on both the real and imaginary parts separately.\n\n1. **Real Part Calculation**: Subtract the real part of the second complex number from the real part of the first complex number.\n   - Real part of the first complex number: 6.0\n   - Real part of the second complex number: 9.0\n   - Subtraction: \\(6.0 - 9.0 = -3.0\\)\n\n2. **Imaginary Part Calculation**: Subtract the imaginary part of the second complex number from the imaginary part of the first complex number.\n   - Imaginary part of the first complex number: -7.0\n   - Imaginary part of the second complex number: 8.0\n   - Subtraction: \\(-7.0 - 8.0 = -15.0\\)\n\nThus, the result of the subtraction is \\(-3.0 - 15.0i\\).\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(6.0, -7.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(9.0, 8.0)\n\n# Perform the subtraction\nresult = complex1 - complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will confirm the result of the subtraction.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculation. The result of subtracting the complex numbers \\((6.0 - 7.0i) - (9.0 + 8.0i)\\) is \\(-3.0 - 15.0i\\).\n\n<<<-3.0 - 15.0i>>>"
