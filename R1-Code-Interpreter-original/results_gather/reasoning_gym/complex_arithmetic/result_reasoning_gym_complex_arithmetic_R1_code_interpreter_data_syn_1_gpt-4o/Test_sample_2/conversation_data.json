    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((8.0 - 10.0i) - (-3.0 - 10.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the real and imaginary parts of each complex number.\n   - The first complex number is \\(8.0 - 10.0i\\), where the real part is 8.0 and the imaginary part is -10.0.\n   - The second complex number is \\(-3.0 - 10.0i\\), where the real part is -3.0 and the imaginary part is -10.0.\n\n2. Subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately:\n   - Real part: \\(8.0 - (-3.0) = 8.0 + 3.0 = 11.0\\)\n   - Imaginary part: \\(-10.0 - (-10.0) = -10.0 + 10.0 = 0.0\\)\n\n3. Combine the results to form the final complex number.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = (8.0, -10.0)  # (real, imaginary)\ncomplex2 = (-3.0, -10.0) # (real, imaginary)\n\n# Subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts\nreal_part = complex1[0] - complex2[0]\nimaginary_part = complex1[1] - complex2[1]\n\n# Form the resulting complex number\nresult = (real_part, imaginary_part)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is \\((11.0, 0.0)\\). This means that the result of subtracting the complex numbers \\((8.0 - 10.0i) - (-3.0 - 10.0i)\\) is \\(11.0 + 0.0i\\), which simplifies to just \\(11.0\\).\n\n<<<11.0>>>"
