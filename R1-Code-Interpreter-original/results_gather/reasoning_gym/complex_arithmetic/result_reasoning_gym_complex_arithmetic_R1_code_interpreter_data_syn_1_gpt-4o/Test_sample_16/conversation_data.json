    "To solve the problem of subtracting two complex numbers, we need to understand the basic operation of complex number subtraction. A complex number is generally represented as \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\nGiven two complex numbers:\n1. \\((-6.0 + 7.0i)\\)\n2. \\((7.0 - 1.0i)\\)\n\nThe subtraction of these two complex numbers is performed by subtracting their respective real parts and their respective imaginary parts:\n\n\\[\n(-6.0 + 7.0i) - (7.0 - 1.0i) = (-6.0 - 7.0) + (7.0 - (-1.0))i\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\nz1 = complex(-6.0, 7.0)\nz2 = complex(7.0, -1.0)\n\n# Subtract the complex numbers\nresult = z1 - z2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the subtraction of the complex numbers \\((-6.0 + 7.0i)\\) and \\((7.0 - 1.0i)\\) is \\((-13 + 8i)\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(-13 + 8i)>>>"
