    "To solve the problem of adding two complex numbers, we need to add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. The given complex numbers are:\n\n1. \\(8.0 + 9.0i\\)\n2. \\(-10.0 - 3.0i\\)\n\nThe addition of these complex numbers can be broken down as follows:\n\n- Real part: \\(8.0 + (-10.0) = -2.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(9.0 + (-3.0) = 6.0\\)\n\nThus, the result of the addition is \\(-2.0 + 6.0i\\).\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a simple Python script to perform the addition of these complex numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(8.0, 9.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(-10.0, -3.0)\n\n# Add the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 + complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output confirms our manual calculation. The result of adding the complex numbers \\( (8.0 + 9.0i) + (-10.0 - 3.0i) \\) is \\(-2.0 + 6.0i\\).\n\n<<<-2.0 + 6.0i>>>"
