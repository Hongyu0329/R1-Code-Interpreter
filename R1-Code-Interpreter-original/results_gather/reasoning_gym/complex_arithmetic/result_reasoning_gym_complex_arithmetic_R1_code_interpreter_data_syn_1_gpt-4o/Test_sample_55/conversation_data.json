    "To solve the problem of adding two complex numbers, we need to add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. The given complex numbers are:\n\n1. \\((-4.0 + 7.0i)\\)\n2. \\((-7.0 - 2.0i)\\)\n\nThe addition of these two complex numbers can be broken down as follows:\n\n- Real part: \\(-4.0 + (-7.0) = -11.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(7.0 + (-2.0) = 5.0\\)\n\nThus, the sum of the two complex numbers is \\((-11.0 + 5.0i)\\).\n\nLet's verify this calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(-4.0, 7.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(-7.0, -2.0)\n\n# Add the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 + complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The sum of the complex numbers \\((-4.0 + 7.0i)\\) and \\((-7.0 - 2.0i)\\) is indeed \\((-11.0 + 5.0i)\\).\n\n<<<(-11.0 + 5.0i)>>>"
