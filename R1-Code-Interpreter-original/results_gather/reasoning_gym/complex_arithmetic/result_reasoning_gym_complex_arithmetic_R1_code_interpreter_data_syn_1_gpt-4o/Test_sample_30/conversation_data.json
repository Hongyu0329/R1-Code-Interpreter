    "To divide complex numbers, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \\frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i}{c^2 + d^2}\n\\]\n\nGiven the complex numbers \\( (47.0 + 4.0i) \\) and \\( (-3.0 + 4.0i) \\), we can identify:\n\n- \\( a = 47.0 \\)\n- \\( b = 4.0 \\)\n- \\( c = -3.0 \\)\n- \\( d = 4.0 \\)\n\nWe will calculate the real and imaginary parts of the result using the formula above.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Given complex numbers\na, b = 47.0, 4.0\nc, d = -3.0, 4.0\n\n# Calculate the real part\nreal_part = (a * c + b * d) / (c**2 + d**2)\n\n# Calculate the imaginary part\nimaginary_part = (b * c - a * d) / (c**2 + d**2)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(real_part, imaginary_part)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
