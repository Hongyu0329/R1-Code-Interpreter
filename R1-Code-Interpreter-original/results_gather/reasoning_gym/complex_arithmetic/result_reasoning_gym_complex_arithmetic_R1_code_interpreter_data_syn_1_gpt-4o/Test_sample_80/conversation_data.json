    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((8.0 + 9.0i) - (-1.0 + 4.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the real and imaginary parts of each complex number.\n   - The first complex number is \\(8.0 + 9.0i\\), where the real part is 8.0 and the imaginary part is 9.0.\n   - The second complex number is \\(-1.0 + 4.0i\\), where the real part is -1.0 and the imaginary part is 4.0.\n\n2. Subtract the real parts of the complex numbers.\n   - Real part of the result = \\(8.0 - (-1.0)\\)\n\n3. Subtract the imaginary parts of the complex numbers.\n   - Imaginary part of the result = \\(9.0 - 4.0\\)\n\n4. Combine the results to form the final complex number.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = (8.0, 9.0)  # (real, imaginary)\ncomplex2 = (-1.0, 4.0) # (real, imaginary)\n\n# Subtract the real parts\nreal_part = complex1[0] - complex2[0]\n\n# Subtract the imaginary parts\nimaginary_part = complex1[1] - complex2[1]\n\n# Form the resulting complex number\nresult = (real_part, imaginary_part)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Result: {result[0]} + {result[1]}i\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the result of the subtraction is \\(9.0 + 5.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9.0 + 5.0i>>>"
