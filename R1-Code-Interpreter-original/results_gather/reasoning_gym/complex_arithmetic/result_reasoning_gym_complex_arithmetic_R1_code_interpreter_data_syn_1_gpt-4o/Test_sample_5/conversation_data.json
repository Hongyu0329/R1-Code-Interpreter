    "To solve the problem of subtracting two complex numbers, we need to understand the basic operation of complex number subtraction. Complex numbers are in the form of \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part. \n\nWhen subtracting two complex numbers, \\((a + bi) - (c + di)\\), the result is \\((a - c) + (b - d)i\\).\n\nGiven the complex numbers:\n- First complex number: \\(-8.0 + 9.0i\\)\n- Second complex number: \\(10.0 + 6.0i\\)\n\nWe can perform the subtraction as follows:\n- Subtract the real parts: \\(-8.0 - 10.0\\)\n- Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(9.0 - 6.0\\)\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers\nreal1, imag1 = -8.0, 9.0\nreal2, imag2 = 10.0, 6.0\n\n# Perform the subtraction\nreal_result = real1 - real2\nimag_result = imag1 - imag2\n\n# Print the result in the form of a complex number\nprint(f\"({real_result}) + ({imag_result})i\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is \\((-18.0) + (3.0)i\\). This means that when you subtract the complex number \\((10.0 + 6.0i)\\) from \\((-8.0 + 9.0i)\\), the result is \\((-18.0) + (3.0)i\\).\n\n<<<(-18.0) + (3.0)i>>>"
