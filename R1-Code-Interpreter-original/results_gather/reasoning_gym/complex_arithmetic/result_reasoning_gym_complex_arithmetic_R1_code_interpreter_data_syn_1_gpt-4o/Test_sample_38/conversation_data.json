    "To divide two complex numbers, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \\frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)}\n\\]\n\nThis formula involves multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of a complex number \\(c + di\\) is \\(c - di\\).\n\nGiven the complex numbers \\(20.0 + 22.0i\\) and \\(4.0 - 6.0i\\), we can apply this formula:\n\n1. **Numerator**: Multiply the numerator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n   \\((20.0 + 22.0i) \\times (4.0 + 6.0i)\\)\n\n2. **Denominator**: Multiply the denominator by its conjugate:\n   \\((4.0 - 6.0i) \\times (4.0 + 6.0i)\\)\n\n3. **Simplify**: Calculate the real and imaginary parts separately.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\nnumerator = complex(20.0, 22.0)\ndenominator = complex(4.0, -6.0)\n\n# Perform the division\nresult = numerator / denominator\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the result of the division.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of dividing the complex numbers \\((20.0 + 22.0i)\\) by \\((4.0 - 6.0i)\\) is \\(-1.0000000000000002 + 4.0i\\). The slight discrepancy in the real part is due to floating-point precision limitations in computing.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(-1.0 + 4.0i)>>>"
