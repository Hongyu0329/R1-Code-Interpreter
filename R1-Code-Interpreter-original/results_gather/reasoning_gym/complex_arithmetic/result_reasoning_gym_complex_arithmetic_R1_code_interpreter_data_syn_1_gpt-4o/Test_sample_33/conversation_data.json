    "To solve the problem of subtracting two complex numbers, we need to understand the basic operation of subtraction with complex numbers. A complex number is generally represented as \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\nGiven two complex numbers:\n1. \\((-1.0 + 6.0i)\\)\n2. \\((-3.0 + 4.0i)\\)\n\nThe subtraction of these two complex numbers is performed by subtracting their respective real parts and their respective imaginary parts separately.\n\nLet's break it down:\n- Real part: \\(-1.0 - (-3.0) = -1.0 + 3.0 = 2.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(6.0 - 4.0 = 2.0\\)\n\nThus, the result of the subtraction is \\(2.0 + 2.0i\\).\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\nz1 = complex(-1.0, 6.0)\nz2 = complex(-3.0, 4.0)\n\n# Subtract the complex numbers\nresult = z1 - z2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The subtraction of the complex numbers \\((-1.0 + 6.0i)\\) and \\((-3.0 + 4.0i)\\) results in \\(2.0 + 2.0i\\).\n\n<<<2.0 + 2.0i>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Subtract the complex numbers: (-1.0 + 6.0i) - (-3.0 + 4.0i)\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
