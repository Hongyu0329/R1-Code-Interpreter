    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((7.0 - 4.0i) - (-1.00i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the real and imaginary parts of each complex number.\n2. Perform the subtraction operation separately for the real and imaginary parts.\n\nGiven:\n- First complex number: \\(7.0 - 4.0i\\)\n- Second complex number: \\(0 - (-1.00i)\\) which simplifies to \\(0 + 1.00i\\)\n\nNow, let's perform the subtraction:\n- Real part: \\(7.0 - 0 = 7.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(-4.0 - 1.00 = -5.0\\)\n\nThus, the result of the subtraction is \\(7.0 - 5.0i\\).\n\nLet's verify this with a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(7.0, -4.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(0, -1.00)\n\n# Perform the subtraction\nresult = complex1 - complex2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the result of the subtraction.",
    "The code output indicates that the subtraction of the complex numbers \\((7.0 - 4.0i) - (-1.00i)\\) results in \\((7 - 3j)\\). \n\nThis means there was a mistake in my initial manual calculation of the imaginary part. Let's correct the reasoning:\n\n1. The first complex number is \\(7.0 - 4.0i\\).\n2. The second complex number is \\(0 - (-1.00i)\\), which simplifies to \\(0 + 1.00i\\).\n\nSubtracting these:\n- Real part: \\(7.0 - 0 = 7.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(-4.0 - (-1.00) = -4.0 + 1.00 = -3.0\\)\n\nThus, the correct result of the subtraction is \\(7.0 - 3.0i\\).\n\n<<<7.0 - 3.0i>>>"
