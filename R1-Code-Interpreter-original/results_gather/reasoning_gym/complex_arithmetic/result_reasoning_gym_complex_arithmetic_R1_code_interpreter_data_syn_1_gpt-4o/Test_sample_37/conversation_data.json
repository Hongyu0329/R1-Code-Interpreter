    "To solve the problem of subtracting two complex numbers, we need to understand the basic operation of subtraction with complex numbers. A complex number is generally represented as \\( a + bi \\), where \\( a \\) is the real part and \\( b \\) is the imaginary part.\n\nGiven two complex numbers \\( z_1 = -7.0 - 5.0i \\) and \\( z_2 = -8.0 + 9.0i \\), the subtraction operation is performed as follows:\n\n\\[ z_1 - z_2 = (-7.0 - 5.0i) - (-8.0 + 9.0i) \\]\n\nThis can be broken down into:\n\n1. Subtract the real parts: \\(-7.0 - (-8.0)\\)\n2. Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(-5.0 - 9.0\\)\n\nLet's compute these values using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers\nreal_part_1 = -7.0\nimaginary_part_1 = -5.0\nreal_part_2 = -8.0\nimaginary_part_2 = 9.0\n\n# Perform the subtraction\nreal_result = real_part_1 - real_part_2\nimaginary_result = imaginary_part_1 - imaginary_part_2\n\n# Print the result in the form of a complex number\nprint(f\"{real_result} + {imaginary_result}i\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result of the subtraction.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the subtraction is \\(1.0 + (-14.0)i\\). This means the real part of the result is 1.0, and the imaginary part is -14.0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the subtraction of the complex numbers \\((-7.0 - 5.0i) - (-8.0 + 9.0i)\\) is:\n\n<<<1.0 - 14.0i>>>"
