    "To divide two complex numbers, we can use the formula for dividing complex numbers. Given two complex numbers \\( z_1 = a + bi \\) and \\( z_2 = c + di \\), the division \\( \\frac{z_1}{z_2} \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \\frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \\frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i}{c^2 + d^2}\n\\]\n\nFor the given problem, \\( z_1 = 135.0 + 20.0i \\) and \\( z_2 = 5.0 + 10.0i \\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\na, b = 135.0, 20.0\nc, d = 5.0, 10.0\n\n# Calculate the real and imaginary parts of the result\nreal_part = (a * c + b * d) / (c**2 + d**2)\nimaginary_part = (b * c - a * d) / (c**2 + d**2)\n\n# Print the result as a complex number\nprint(f\"{real_part} + {imaginary_part}i\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
