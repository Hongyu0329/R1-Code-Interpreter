    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers (2.0 - 4.0i) and (-7.00), we need to understand the components of each complex number. \n\nThe first complex number is (2.0 - 4.0i), which has a real part of 2.0 and an imaginary part of -4.0i. The second number is -7.00, which is purely real with no imaginary component.\n\nWhen adding complex numbers, we add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together separately. \n\nLet's break it down:\n- Real part: 2.0 (from the first number) + (-7.00) (from the second number)\n- Imaginary part: -4.0i (from the first number) + 0i (since the second number has no imaginary part)\n\nNow, let's compute these values using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(2.0, -4.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(-7.00, 0)\n\n# Add the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 + complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the addition.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is (-5-4j). This result represents the sum of the two complex numbers.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the result:\n- The real part of the sum is 2.0 + (-7.00) = -5.0.\n- The imaginary part of the sum is -4.0i + 0i = -4.0i.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the complex numbers (2.0 - 4.0i) and (-7.00) is (-5 - 4i).\n\n<<<(-5 - 4i)>>>"
