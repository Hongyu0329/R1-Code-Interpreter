    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-6.00)\\) and \\((-6.0 - 1.0i)\\), we need to follow the rules of complex number arithmetic. \n\nThe subtraction of two complex numbers \\(a + bi\\) and \\(c + di\\) is given by:\n\\[\n(a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the first complex number is \\((-6.00 + 0i)\\) and the second complex number is \\((-6.0 - 1.0i)\\).\n\nLet's apply the formula:\n- Real part: \\(-6.00 - (-6.0) = -6.00 + 6.0 = 0.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(0 - (-1.0) = 0 + 1.0 = 1.0\\)\n\nThus, the result of the subtraction is \\(0.0 + 1.0i\\).\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\nz1 = complex(-6.00, 0)\nz2 = complex(-6.0, -1.0)\n\n# Perform the subtraction\nresult = z1 - z2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The result of the subtraction is \\(1j\\), which is equivalent to \\(0.0 + 1.0i\\) in standard complex number notation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.0 + 1.0i>>>"
