    "To solve the problem of adding two complex numbers, we need to add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. \n\nGiven the complex numbers:\n- First complex number: \\(1.0 + 9.0i\\)\n- Second complex number: \\(-5.0 - 3.0i\\)\n\nThe addition of these two complex numbers can be broken down as follows:\n- Real part: \\(1.0 + (-5.0) = -4.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(9.0 + (-3.0) = 6.0\\)\n\nThus, the result of the addition is \\(-4.0 + 6.0i\\).\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's verify this calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(1.0, 9.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(-5.0, -3.0)\n\n# Add the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 + complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed the calculation. The result of adding the complex numbers \\((1.0 + 9.0i)\\) and \\((-5.0 - 3.0i)\\) is \\(-4.0 + 6.0i\\).\n\n<<<-4.0 + 6.0i>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Add the complex numbers: (1.0 + 9.0i) + (-5.0 - 3.0i)\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
