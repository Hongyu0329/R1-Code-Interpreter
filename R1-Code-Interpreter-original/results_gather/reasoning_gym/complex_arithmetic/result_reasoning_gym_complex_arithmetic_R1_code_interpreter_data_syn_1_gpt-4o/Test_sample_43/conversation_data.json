    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((3.0 + 4.0i) - (-9.0 + 6.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the components of the complex numbers:**\n   - The first complex number is \\(3.0 + 4.0i\\), where the real part is 3.0 and the imaginary part is 4.0.\n   - The second complex number is \\(-9.0 + 6.0i\\), where the real part is -9.0 and the imaginary part is 6.0.\n\n2. **Subtract the real parts:**\n   - Real part of the result = \\(3.0 - (-9.0) = 3.0 + 9.0 = 12.0\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the imaginary parts:**\n   - Imaginary part of the result = \\(4.0 - 6.0 = -2.0\\).\n\n4. **Combine the results:**\n   - The result of the subtraction is \\(12.0 - 2.0i\\).\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(3.0, 4.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(-9.0, 6.0)\n\n# Subtract the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 - complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to confirm the result.",
