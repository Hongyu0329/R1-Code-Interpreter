    "To solve the problem of adding two complex numbers, we need to add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. The given complex numbers are:\n\n1. \\(5.0 + 6.0i\\)\n2. \\(-1.0 - 5.0i\\)\n\nThe addition of these two complex numbers can be broken down as follows:\n\n- Real part: \\(5.0 + (-1.0) = 4.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(6.0 + (-5.0) = 1.0\\)\n\nThus, the result of the addition is \\(4.0 + 1.0i\\).\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a simple Python script to perform the addition of these complex numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(5.0, 6.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(-1.0, -5.0)\n\n# Add the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 + complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output confirms our manual calculation. The result of adding the complex numbers \\( (5.0 + 6.0i) + (-1.0 - 5.0i) \\) is \\( 4.0 + 1.0i \\).\n\n<<<4.0 + 1.0i>>>"
