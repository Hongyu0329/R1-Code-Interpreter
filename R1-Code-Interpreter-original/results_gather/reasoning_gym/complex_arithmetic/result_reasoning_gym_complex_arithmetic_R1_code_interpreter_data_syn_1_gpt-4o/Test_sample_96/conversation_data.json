    "To divide two complex numbers, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \\frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)}\n\\]\n\nThis formula involves multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of a complex number \\(c + di\\) is \\(c - di\\).\n\nGiven the complex numbers \\((-20.0 + 9.0i)\\) and \\((6.0 + 1.0i)\\), we can apply this formula:\n\n1. Calculate the conjugate of the denominator: \\(6.0 - 1.0i\\).\n2. Multiply the numerator and the denominator by this conjugate.\n3. Simplify the expression to get the result in the form of \\(x + yi\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\nnumerator = complex(-20.0, 9.0)\ndenominator = complex(6.0, 1.0)\n\n# Calculate the division\nresult = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The division of the complex numbers \\((-20.0 + 9.0i)\\) by \\((6.0 + 1.0i)\\) results in the complex number \\((-3 + 2i)\\).\n\n<<<(-3 + 2i)>>>"
