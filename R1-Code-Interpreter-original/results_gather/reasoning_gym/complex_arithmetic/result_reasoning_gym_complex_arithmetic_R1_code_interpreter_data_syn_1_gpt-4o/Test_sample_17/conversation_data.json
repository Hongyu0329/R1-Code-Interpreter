    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers \\((3.0 - 7.0i) + (7.00i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the real and imaginary parts of each complex number.\n2. Add the real parts together.\n3. Add the imaginary parts together.\n4. Combine the results to form the final complex number.\n\nLet's break down the given complex numbers:\n- The first complex number is \\(3.0 - 7.0i\\), which has a real part of 3.0 and an imaginary part of -7.0.\n- The second complex number is \\(7.00i\\), which has a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 7.0.\n\nNow, let's perform the addition:\n- Real part: \\(3.0 + 0 = 3.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(-7.0 + 7.0 = 0.0\\)\n\nThus, the result of the addition is \\(3.0 + 0.0i\\).\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(3.0, -7.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(0, 7.0)\n\n# Add the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 + complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculation. The result of adding the complex numbers \\((3.0 - 7.0i) + (7.00i)\\) is \\((3+0j)\\), which is equivalent to \\(3.0 + 0.0i\\).\n\n<<<3.0 + 0.0i>>>"
