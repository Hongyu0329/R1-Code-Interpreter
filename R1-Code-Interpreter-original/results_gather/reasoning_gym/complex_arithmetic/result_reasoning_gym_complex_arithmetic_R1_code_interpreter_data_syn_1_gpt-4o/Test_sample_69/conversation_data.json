    "To solve the problem of subtracting two complex numbers, we need to understand the basic operation of complex number subtraction. A complex number is generally represented as \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part. \n\nWhen subtracting two complex numbers, \\((a + bi) - (c + di)\\), the operation is performed as follows:\n- Subtract the real parts: \\(a - c\\)\n- Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(b - d\\)\n\nGiven the complex numbers \\((-4.0 + 7.0i)\\) and \\((1.0 + 4.0i)\\), we can identify:\n- \\(a = -4.0\\), \\(b = 7.0\\)\n- \\(c = 1.0\\), \\(d = 4.0\\)\n\nNow, let's perform the subtraction:\n- Real part: \\(-4.0 - 1.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(7.0 - 4.0\\)\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers\na, b = -4.0, 7.0\nc, d = 1.0, 4.0\n\n# Perform the subtraction\nreal_part = a - c\nimaginary_part = b - d\n\n# Output the result as a complex number\nresult = complex(real_part, imaginary_part)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the subtraction of the complex numbers \\((-4.0 + 7.0i)\\) and \\((1.0 + 4.0i)\\) is \\((-5 + 3i)\\).\n\n<<<(-5 + 3i)>>>"
