    "To divide complex numbers, we use the formula for dividing two complex numbers \\( \\frac{a + bi}{c + di} \\). The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \\frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i}{c^2 + d^2}\n\\]\n\nGiven the complex numbers \\((-69.0 - 33.0i)\\) and \\((-1.0 + 8.0i)\\), we can identify:\n\n- \\(a = -69.0\\)\n- \\(b = -33.0\\)\n- \\(c = -1.0\\)\n- \\(d = 8.0\\)\n\nWe will calculate the division using the formula above. Let's compute this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\na, b = -69.0, -33.0\nc, d = -1.0, 8.0\n\n# Calculate the real and imaginary parts of the result\nreal_part = (a * c + b * d) / (c**2 + d**2)\nimaginary_part = (b * c - a * d) / (c**2 + d**2)\n\n# Print the result as a complex number\nprint(f\"{real_part} + {imaginary_part}i\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result of the division.",
    "The division of the complex numbers \\((-69.0 - 33.0i)\\) by \\((-1.0 + 8.0i)\\) results in the complex number \\(-3.0 + 9.0i\\).\n\n<<<-3.0 + 9.0i>>>"
