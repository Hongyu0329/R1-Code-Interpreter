    "To solve the problem of adding two complex numbers, we need to add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. \n\nGiven the complex numbers:\n- First complex number: \\(9.0 + 8.0i\\)\n- Second complex number: \\(8.0 - 7.0i\\)\n\nThe addition of these two complex numbers can be broken down as follows:\n- Real part: \\(9.0 + 8.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(8.0i - 7.0i\\)\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(9.0, 8.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(8.0, -7.0)\n\n# Add the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 + complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the addition of the two complex numbers.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of adding the two complex numbers \\((9.0 + 8.0i)\\) and \\((8.0 - 7.0i)\\) is \\((17 + 1i)\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(17 + 1i)>>>"
