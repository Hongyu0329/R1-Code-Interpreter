    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((10.0 - 3.0i) - (-2.0 + 5.0i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the real and imaginary parts of each complex number.\n   - The first complex number is \\(10.0 - 3.0i\\), where the real part is 10.0 and the imaginary part is -3.0.\n   - The second complex number is \\(-2.0 + 5.0i\\), where the real part is -2.0 and the imaginary part is 5.0.\n\n2. Subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately:\n   - Real part: \\(10.0 - (-2.0) = 10.0 + 2.0 = 12.0\\)\n   - Imaginary part: \\(-3.0 - 5.0 = -3.0 - 5.0 = -8.0\\)\n\n3. Combine the results to form the final complex number.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = (10.0, -3.0)  # (real, imaginary)\ncomplex2 = (-2.0, 5.0)   # (real, imaginary)\n\n# Subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts\nreal_part = complex1[0] - complex2[0]\nimaginary_part = complex1[1] - complex2[1]\n\n# Form the resulting complex number\nresult = (real_part, imaginary_part)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Result: {result[0]} {'+' if result[1] >= 0 else '-'} {abs(result[1])}i\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final result of the subtraction.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is as expected. The subtraction of the complex numbers \\((10.0 - 3.0i) - (-2.0 + 5.0i)\\) results in the complex number \\(12.0 - 8.0i\\).\n\n<<<12.0 - 8.0i>>>"
