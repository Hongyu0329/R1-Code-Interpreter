    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers \\((9.0 - 7.0i) + (-4.00i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the real and imaginary parts of each complex number.\n2. Add the real parts together.\n3. Add the imaginary parts together.\n\nThe first complex number is \\(9.0 - 7.0i\\), which has a real part of 9.0 and an imaginary part of -7.0i.\n\nThe second complex number is \\(-4.00i\\), which has a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of -4.00i.\n\nNow, let's perform the addition:\n\n- Real part: \\(9.0 + 0 = 9.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(-7.0 + (-4.00) = -11.0\\)\n\nThus, the result of the addition is \\(9.0 - 11.0i\\).\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(9.0, -7.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(0, -4.0)\n\n# Add the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 + complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the result of the addition.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output \\((9-11j)\\) confirms our manual calculation. The complex number addition was performed accurately, resulting in a real part of 9 and an imaginary part of -11.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9.0 - 11.0i>>>"
