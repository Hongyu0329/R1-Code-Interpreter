    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers, we need to perform the operation:\n\n\\[ (4.00) - (7.0 + 7.0i) \\]\n\nThis involves subtracting the real and imaginary parts separately. The real part of the first complex number is 4.00, and the real part of the second complex number is 7.0. The imaginary part of the second complex number is 7.0i. The first complex number has no imaginary part, which can be considered as 0.0i.\n\nThe subtraction can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Subtract the real parts: \\( 4.00 - 7.0 \\)\n2. Subtract the imaginary parts: \\( 0.0i - 7.0i \\)\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\nreal_part_1 = 4.00\nreal_part_2 = 7.0\nimaginary_part_1 = 0.0\nimaginary_part_2 = 7.0\n\n# Perform the subtraction\nresult_real = real_part_1 - real_part_2\nresult_imaginary = imaginary_part_1 - imaginary_part_2\n\n# Print the result as a complex number\nprint(f\"{result_real} + {result_imaginary}i\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the subtraction of the complex numbers. The real part of the result is \\(-3.0\\) and the imaginary part is \\(-7.0i\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the subtraction of the complex numbers \\((4.00) - (7.0 + 7.0i)\\) is:\n\n<<<-3.0 - 7.0i>>>"
