    "To solve the problem of subtracting two complex numbers, we need to understand the basic operation of complex number subtraction. A complex number is generally represented as \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part. \n\nWhen subtracting two complex numbers, \\((a + bi) - (c + di)\\), the result is \\((a - c) + (b - d)i\\). \n\nGiven the complex numbers \\((10.0 + 9.0i)\\) and \\((2.0 + 7.0i)\\), we can apply the subtraction operation as follows:\n\n1. Subtract the real parts: \\(10.0 - 2.0\\).\n2. Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(9.0 - 7.0\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(10.0, 9.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(2.0, 7.0)\n\n# Subtract the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 - complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of subtracting the complex numbers \\((10.0 + 9.0i)\\) and \\((2.0 + 7.0i)\\) is \\((8.0 + 2.0i)\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(8.0 + 2.0i)>>>"
