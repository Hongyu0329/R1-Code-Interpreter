    "To solve the problem of subtracting two complex numbers, we need to understand the basic operation of complex number subtraction. A complex number is generally represented as \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\nGiven two complex numbers:\n1. \\(z_1 = 8.0 + 9.0i\\)\n2. \\(z_2 = 4.0 - 3.0i\\)\n\nThe subtraction of these two complex numbers is performed by subtracting their respective real parts and their respective imaginary parts:\n\n\\[\nz_1 - z_2 = (8.0 - 4.0) + (9.0 - (-3.0))i\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\nz1_real = 8.0\nz1_imag = 9.0\nz2_real = 4.0\nz2_imag = -3.0\n\n# Subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts\nresult_real = z1_real - z2_real\nresult_imag = z1_imag - z2_imag\n\n# Print the result in the form of a complex number\nprint(f\"{result_real} + {result_imag}i\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the subtraction of the complex numbers \\((8.0 + 9.0i) - (4.0 - 3.0i)\\) is \\(4.0 + 12.0i\\).\n\n<<<4.0 + 12.0i>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
