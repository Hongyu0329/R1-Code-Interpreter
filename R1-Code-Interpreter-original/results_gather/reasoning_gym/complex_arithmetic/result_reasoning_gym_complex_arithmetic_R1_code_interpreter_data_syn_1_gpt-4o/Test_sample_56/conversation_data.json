    "To solve the problem of adding the complex numbers \\((-4.00)\\) and \\((-5.0 + 10.0i)\\), we need to follow the rules of complex number addition. \n\nComplex numbers are added by separately adding their real parts and their imaginary parts. The given complex numbers are:\n\n1. \\((-4.00)\\) which can be represented as \\((-4.00 + 0.0i)\\)\n2. \\((-5.0 + 10.0i)\\)\n\nNow, let's add these two complex numbers:\n\n- Real part: \\(-4.00 + (-5.0) = -9.0\\)\n- Imaginary part: \\(0.0i + 10.0i = 10.0i\\)\n\nThus, the sum of the complex numbers is \\((-9.0 + 10.0i)\\).\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(-4.00, 0.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(-5.0, 10.0)\n\n# Add the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 + complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The sum of the complex numbers \\((-4.00)\\) and \\((-5.0 + 10.0i)\\) is \\((-9.0 + 10.0i)\\).\n\n<<<(-9.0 + 10.0i)>>>"
