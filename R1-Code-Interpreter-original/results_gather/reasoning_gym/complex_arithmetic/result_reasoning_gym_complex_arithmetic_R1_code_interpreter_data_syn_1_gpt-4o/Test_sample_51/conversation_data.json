    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((4.0 - 8.0i) - (-6.0 + 2.0i)\\), we need to follow the rules of complex number arithmetic. \n\nThe subtraction of two complex numbers \\((a + bi) - (c + di)\\) is performed by subtracting the real parts and the imaginary parts separately:\n\n1. Subtract the real parts: \\(a - c\\).\n2. Subtract the imaginary parts: \\(b - d\\).\n\nFor the given complex numbers:\n- The first complex number is \\(4.0 - 8.0i\\), where \\(a = 4.0\\) and \\(b = -8.0\\).\n- The second complex number is \\(-6.0 + 2.0i\\), where \\(c = -6.0\\) and \\(d = 2.0\\).\n\nNow, let's perform the subtraction:\n\n1. Real part: \\(4.0 - (-6.0) = 4.0 + 6.0 = 10.0\\).\n2. Imaginary part: \\(-8.0 - 2.0 = -8.0 - 2.0 = -10.0\\).\n\nThus, the result of the subtraction is \\(10.0 - 10.0i\\).\n\nLet's confirm this calculation using a Python script:\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\na, b = 4.0, -8.0\nc, d = -6.0, 2.0\n\n# Perform the subtraction\nreal_part = a - c\nimaginary_part = b - d\n\n# Output the result\nresult = f\"{real_part} + {imaginary_part}i\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the subtraction.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The subtraction of the complex numbers \\((4.0 - 8.0i) - (-6.0 + 2.0i)\\) results in \\(10.0 - 10.0i\\).\n\nThe output format \"10.0 + -10.0i\" can be simplified to \"10.0 - 10.0i\" for clarity.\n\n<<<10.0 - 10.0i>>>"
