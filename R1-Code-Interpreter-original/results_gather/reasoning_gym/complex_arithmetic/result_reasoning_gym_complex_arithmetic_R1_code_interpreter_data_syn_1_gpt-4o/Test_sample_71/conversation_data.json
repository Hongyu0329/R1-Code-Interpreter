    "To divide two complex numbers, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \\frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)}\n\\]\n\nThis formula involves multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of a complex number \\(c + di\\) is \\(c - di\\).\n\nGiven the complex numbers \\(4.0 + 68.0i\\) and \\(-8.0 + 9.0i\\), we can apply this formula:\n\n1. **Numerator**: Multiply \\((4.0 + 68.0i)\\) by the conjugate of the denominator \\((-8.0 - 9.0i)\\).\n2. **Denominator**: Multiply \\((-8.0 + 9.0i)\\) by its conjugate \\((-8.0 - 9.0i)\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\nnumerator = complex(4.0, 68.0)\ndenominator = complex(-8.0, 9.0)\n\n# Calculate the conjugate of the denominator\nconjugate_denominator = complex(denominator.real, -denominator.imag)\n\n# Perform the division\nresult = numerator * conjugate_denominator / (denominator * conjugate_denominator)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result of the division.",
    "The division of the complex numbers \\((4.0 + 68.0i)\\) by \\((-8.0 + 9.0i)\\) results in the complex number \\((4 - 4i)\\).\n\n<<<(4 - 4i)>>>"
