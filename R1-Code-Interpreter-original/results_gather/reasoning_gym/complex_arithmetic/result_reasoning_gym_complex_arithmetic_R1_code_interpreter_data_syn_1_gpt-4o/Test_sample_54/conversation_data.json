    "To solve the problem of subtracting the complex numbers \\((-10.0 + 7.0i) - (-10.00i)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the real and imaginary parts of each complex number.\n   - The first complex number is \\(-10.0 + 7.0i\\), which has a real part of \\(-10.0\\) and an imaginary part of \\(7.0\\).\n   - The second complex number is \\(-10.00i\\), which has a real part of \\(0\\) and an imaginary part of \\(-10.0\\).\n\n2. Subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately:\n   - Real part: \\(-10.0 - 0 = -10.0\\)\n   - Imaginary part: \\(7.0 - (-10.0) = 7.0 + 10.0 = 17.0\\)\n\n3. Combine the results to form the final complex number.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(-10.0, 7.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(0, -10.0)\n\n# Subtract the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 - complex2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the subtraction is \\((-10 + 17j)\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-10 + 17i>>>"
