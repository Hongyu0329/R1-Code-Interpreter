    "To multiply two complex numbers, we use the distributive property and the fact that \\(i^2 = -1\\). The complex numbers given are \\((-4.0 - 7.0i)\\) and \\((7.0 - 7.0i)\\).\n\nThe multiplication of two complex numbers \\((a + bi)\\) and \\((c + di)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n(a + bi) \\times (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i\n\\]\n\nFor the given complex numbers:\n- \\(a = -4.0\\), \\(b = -7.0\\)\n- \\(c = 7.0\\), \\(d = -7.0\\)\n\nLet's calculate the real and imaginary parts separately:\n\n1. Real part: \\(ac - bd\\)\n2. Imaginary part: \\(ad + bc\\)\n\nNow, let's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers\na, b = -4.0, -7.0\nc, d = 7.0, -7.0\n\n# Calculate the real part\nreal_part = a * c - b * d\n\n# Calculate the imaginary part\nimaginary_part = a * d + b * c\n\n# Print the result as a complex number\nprint(f\"{real_part} + {imaginary_part}i\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result of the multiplication.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is \\(-77.0 + -21.0i\\). This means the result of multiplying the complex numbers \\((-4.0 - 7.0i)\\) and \\((7.0 - 7.0i)\\) is \\(-77.0 - 21.0i\\).\n\n<<<-77.0 - 21.0i>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
