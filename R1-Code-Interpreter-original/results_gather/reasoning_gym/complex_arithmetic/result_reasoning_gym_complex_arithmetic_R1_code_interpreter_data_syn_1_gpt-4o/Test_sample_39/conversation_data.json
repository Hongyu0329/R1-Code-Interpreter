    "To solve the problem of adding two complex numbers, we need to add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. \n\nGiven the complex numbers:\n1. \\( (9.0 - 10.0i) \\)\n2. \\( (-2.0 - 6.0i) \\)\n\nThe real parts are 9.0 and -2.0, and the imaginary parts are -10.0 and -6.0.\n\nThe sum of the real parts is:\n\\[ 9.0 + (-2.0) = 7.0 \\]\n\nThe sum of the imaginary parts is:\n\\[ -10.0 + (-6.0) = -16.0 \\]\n\nThus, the sum of the complex numbers is:\n\\[ 7.0 - 16.0i \\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\ncomplex1 = complex(9.0, -10.0)\ncomplex2 = complex(-2.0, -6.0)\n\n# Add the complex numbers\nresult = complex1 + complex2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
