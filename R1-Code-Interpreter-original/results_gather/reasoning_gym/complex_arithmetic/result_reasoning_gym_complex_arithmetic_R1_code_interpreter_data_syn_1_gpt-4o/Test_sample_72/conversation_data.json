    "To solve the division of complex numbers, we need to divide each part of the complex number by the real number. The complex number given is \\((-8.0 - 6.0i)\\) and we need to divide it by \\(2.00\\).\n\nThe division of a complex number \\(a + bi\\) by a real number \\(c\\) is done by dividing both the real part \\(a\\) and the imaginary part \\(b\\) by \\(c\\). Therefore, the division can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{-8.0}{2.00}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{-6.0}{2.00}\\right)i\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex number and the divisor\nreal_part = -8.0\nimaginary_part = -6.0\ndivisor = 2.00\n\n# Perform the division\nreal_result = real_part / divisor\nimaginary_result = imaginary_part / divisor\n\n# Print the result as a complex number\nprint(f\"{real_result} + {imaginary_result}i\")\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the division.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output for the division of the complex number. The result of dividing \\((-8.0 - 6.0i)\\) by \\(2.00\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-4.0 + (-3.0)i\n\\]\n\nThis can also be written as:\n\n\\[\n-4.0 - 3.0i\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-4.0 - 3.0i>>>"
