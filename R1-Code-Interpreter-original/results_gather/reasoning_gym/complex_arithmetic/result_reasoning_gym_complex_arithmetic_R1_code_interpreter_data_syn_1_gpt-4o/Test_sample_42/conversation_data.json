    "To multiply two complex numbers, we use the distributive property and the fact that \\(i^2 = -1\\). The given complex numbers are \\( (6.0 - 7.0i) \\) and \\( (-7.00i) \\).\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( a = 6.0 \\)\n- \\( b = -7.0 \\)\n- \\( c = 0 \\) (since the real part of the second complex number is 0)\n- \\( d = -7.0 \\)\n\nThe multiplication of two complex numbers \\((a + bi)\\) and \\((c + di)\\) is given by:\n\\[ (a + bi) \\times (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n- \\( ac = 6.0 \\times 0 = 0 \\)\n- \\( bd = -7.0 \\times -7.0 = 49.0 \\)\n- \\( ad = 6.0 \\times -7.0 = -42.0 \\)\n- \\( bc = -7.0 \\times 0 = 0 \\)\n\nThus, the result is:\n\\[ (0 - 49.0) + (-42.0 + 0)i = -49.0 - 42.0i \\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the complex numbers\na, b = 6.0, -7.0\nc, d = 0, -7.0\n\n# Calculate the real and imaginary parts of the product\nreal_part = a * c - b * d\nimaginary_part = a * d + b * c\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"{real_part} + {imaginary_part}i\")\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will confirm the result.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The product of the complex numbers \\((6.0 - 7.0i)\\) and \\((-7.00i)\\) is \\(-49.0 - 42.0i\\).\n\n<<<-49.0 - 42.0i>>>"
