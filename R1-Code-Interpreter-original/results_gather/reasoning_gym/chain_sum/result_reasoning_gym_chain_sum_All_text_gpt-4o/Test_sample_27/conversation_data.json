    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(7 - 0 + 2\\), we will analyze and solve it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the operations**: The expression involves subtraction and addition. The operations are:\n   - Subtraction: \\(7 - 0\\)\n   - Addition: Result of the subtraction + 2\n\n2. **Perform the subtraction**:\n   - Calculate \\(7 - 0\\).\n   - Subtracting zero from any number does not change the value of the number.\n   - Therefore, \\(7 - 0 = 7\\).\n\n3. **Perform the addition**:\n   - Take the result from the subtraction, which is 7, and add 2 to it.\n   - Calculate \\(7 + 2\\).\n   - Adding 2 to 7 gives us 9.\n\n4. **Final result**:\n   - The result of the entire expression \\(7 - 0 + 2\\) is 9.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
