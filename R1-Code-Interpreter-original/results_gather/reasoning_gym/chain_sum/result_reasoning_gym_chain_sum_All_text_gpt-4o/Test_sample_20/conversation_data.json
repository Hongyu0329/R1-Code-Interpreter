    "To solve the arithmetic problem 8 + 7 + 5 + 6, we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers involved**: The numbers to be added are 8, 7, 5, and 6.\n\n2. **Choose a method for addition**: We can add these numbers sequentially from left to right.\n\n3. **Perform the addition step by step**:\n   - First, add the first two numbers: 8 + 7 = 15.\n   - Next, add the result to the third number: 15 + 5 = 20.\n   - Finally, add the last number to the result: 20 + 6 = 26.\n\n4. **Verify the calculation**: Double-check each step to ensure accuracy:\n   - 8 + 7 = 15 is correct.\n   - 15 + 5 = 20 is correct.\n   - 20 + 6 = 26 is correct.\n\n5. **State the final answer**: After verifying each step, we conclude that the sum of 8 + 7 + 5 + 6 is 26.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<26>>>"
