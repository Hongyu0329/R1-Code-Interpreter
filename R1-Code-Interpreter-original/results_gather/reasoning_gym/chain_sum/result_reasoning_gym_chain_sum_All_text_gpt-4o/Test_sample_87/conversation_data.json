    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(78 + 95 + 80 - 65\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Addition of the first two numbers:**\n   - Start with the first two numbers: \\(78 + 95\\).\n   - Add them together: \n     \\[\n     78 + 95 = 173\n     \\]\n\n2. **Addition of the next number:**\n   - Take the result from the first step and add the next number: \\(173 + 80\\).\n   - Add them together:\n     \\[\n     173 + 80 = 253\n     \\]\n\n3. **Subtraction of the last number:**\n   - Take the result from the second step and subtract the last number: \\(253 - 65\\).\n   - Subtract them:\n     \\[\n     253 - 65 = 188\n     \\]\n\nBy following these steps, we have carefully calculated the result of the arithmetic problem.\n\nThe final answer to the problem \\(78 + 95 + 80 - 65\\) is:\n\n<<<188>>>"
