    "To solve the arithmetic problem 41 - 39 - 80, we will break it down into steps and analyze each part carefully.\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The expression given is 41 - 39 - 80. This involves two subtraction operations.\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: In arithmetic, operations are typically performed from left to right when they are of the same precedence level. Here, subtraction is the only operation, so we will proceed from left to right.\n\n3. **First Operation (41 - 39)**:\n   - Start with the first two numbers: 41 and 39.\n   - Subtract 39 from 41.\n   - Calculation: 41 - 39 = 2.\n\n4. **Second Operation (Result - 80)**:\n   - Take the result from the first operation, which is 2.\n   - Subtract 80 from this result.\n   - Calculation: 2 - 80 = -78.\n\n5. **Final Result**: The result of the entire expression 41 - 39 - 80 is -78.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<-78>>>"
