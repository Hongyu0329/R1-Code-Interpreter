    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(8905 - 6062 + 3257\\), we will break it down into steps and carefully analyze each part.\n\n1. **Subtraction Step**: \n   - Start with the first two numbers: \\(8905 - 6062\\).\n   - Align the numbers by their place values and subtract:\n     - Units place: \\(5 - 2 = 3\\)\n     - Tens place: \\(0 - 6\\). Since 0 is less than 6, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place.\n     - Hundreds place: \\(9 - 1 = 8\\) (after borrowing) and \\(8 - 0 = 8\\).\n     - Thousands place: \\(8 - 6 = 2\\).\n   - The result of \\(8905 - 6062\\) is \\(2843\\).\n\n2. **Addition Step**:\n   - Now add the result from the subtraction to the third number: \\(2843 + 3257\\).\n   - Align the numbers by their place values and add:\n     - Units place: \\(3 + 7 = 10\\). Write 0 and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n     - Tens place: \\(4 + 5 = 9\\), plus the carry over 1 gives \\(10\\). Write 0 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.\n     - Hundreds place: \\(8 + 2 = 10\\), plus the carry over 1 gives \\(11\\). Write 1 and carry over 1 to the thousands place.\n     - Thousands place: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\), plus the carry over 1 gives \\(6\\).\n   - The result of \\(2843 + 3257\\) is \\(6100\\).\n\n3. **Final Result**:\n   - The final answer to the arithmetic problem \\(8905 - 6062 + 3257\\) is \\(6100\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6100>>>"
