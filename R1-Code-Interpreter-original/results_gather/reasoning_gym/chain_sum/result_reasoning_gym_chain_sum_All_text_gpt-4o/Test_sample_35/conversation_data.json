    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(6 - 7\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Operation**: The operation here is subtraction, which involves taking one number away from another.\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers involved in this operation are 6 and 7.\n\n3. **Understand the Concept of Subtraction**: Subtraction is the process of finding the difference between two numbers. When the number being subtracted (the subtrahend) is larger than the number from which it is being subtracted (the minuend), the result will be a negative number.\n\n4. **Perform the Subtraction**: \n   - Start with the minuend, which is 6.\n   - Subtract the subtrahend, which is 7, from the minuend.\n   - Since 7 is greater than 6, the result will be negative.\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference**: \n   - Subtract 7 from 6: \\(6 - 7 = -1\\).\n\n6. **Verify the Result**: \n   - To verify, consider the number line. Starting at 6 and moving 7 units to the left (since subtraction moves left on the number line), you land at -1.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the result of the subtraction.\n\nThe final answer to the arithmetic problem \\(6 - 7\\) is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"
