    "To solve the arithmetic problem step by step, we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward as it involves only addition and subtraction. We will perform the operations from left to right:\n\n1. Start with the initial expression: 9 - 9 + 7 + 3 + 2 - 7.\n\n2. Perform the first operation: 9 - 9 = 0.\n\n3. Update the expression: 0 + 7 + 3 + 2 - 7.\n\n4. Perform the next operation: 0 + 7 = 7.\n\n5. Update the expression: 7 + 3 + 2 - 7.\n\n6. Perform the next operation: 7 + 3 = 10.\n\n7. Update the expression: 10 + 2 - 7.\n\n8. Perform the next operation: 10 + 2 = 12.\n\n9. Update the expression: 12 - 7.\n\n10. Perform the final operation: 12 - 7 = 5.\n\nAfter carefully performing each step, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<5>>>"
