    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(201 - 819 + 470\\), we will break it down into steps and carefully analyze each part:\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: The expression given is \\(201 - 819 + 470\\).\n\n2. **First Operation (Subtraction)**: \n   - Start with the first two numbers: \\(201 - 819\\).\n   - Since 819 is larger than 201, the result will be negative.\n   - Calculate: \\(201 - 819 = -618\\).\n\n3. **Second Operation (Addition)**:\n   - Now take the result from the first operation and add 470 to it: \\(-618 + 470\\).\n   - Since we are adding a positive number to a negative number, we will subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and keep the sign of the number with the larger absolute value.\n   - Calculate: \\(-618 + 470 = -148\\).\n\n4. **Final Result**: The result of the entire expression \\(201 - 819 + 470\\) is \\(-148\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<-148>>>"
