    "To solve the arithmetic problem 812 + 880, we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers involved**: The two numbers we need to add are 812 and 880.\n\n2. **Align the numbers for addition**: \n   - Write the numbers one below the other, aligning them by their rightmost digits (units place).\n   ```\n     812\n   + 880\n   ```\n\n3. **Add the digits starting from the rightmost column (units place)**:\n   - Units place: 2 + 0 = 2\n   - Write 2 in the units place of the result.\n\n4. **Move to the next column to the left (tens place)**:\n   - Tens place: 1 + 8 = 9\n   - Write 9 in the tens place of the result.\n\n5. **Move to the next column to the left (hundreds place)**:\n   - Hundreds place: 8 + 8 = 16\n   - Since the sum is 16, write 6 in the hundreds place and carry over 1 to the next column (thousands place).\n\n6. **Add the carry to the next column (thousands place)**:\n   - Thousands place: 0 (since there are no thousands in the original numbers) + 1 (carry) = 1\n   - Write 1 in the thousands place of the result.\n\n7. **Combine the results from each column**:\n   - The final result is 1692.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem 812 + 880 is:\n\n<<<1692>>>"
