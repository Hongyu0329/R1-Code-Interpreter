    "To solve the arithmetic problem step by step, we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward addition and subtraction from left to right. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: 6539 + 9708 - 7295 + 8846 - 1284 - 3611\n\n2. **Step 1: Add 6539 and 9708**\n   - 6539 + 9708 = 16247\n\n3. **Step 2: Subtract 7295 from the result of Step 1**\n   - 16247 - 7295 = 8952\n\n4. **Step 3: Add 8846 to the result of Step 2**\n   - 8952 + 8846 = 17798\n\n5. **Step 4: Subtract 1284 from the result of Step 3**\n   - 17798 - 1284 = 16514\n\n6. **Step 5: Subtract 3611 from the result of Step 4**\n   - 16514 - 3611 = 12903\n\nAfter performing all the operations step by step, we arrive at the final answer.\n\nThe final answer to the arithmetic problem is: <<<12903>>>"
