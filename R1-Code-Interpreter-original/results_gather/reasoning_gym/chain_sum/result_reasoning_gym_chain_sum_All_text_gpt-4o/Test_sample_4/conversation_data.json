    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(0 + 4 + 1 - 0\\), we will analyze and compute it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the operation sequence**: The expression consists of addition and subtraction operations. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), addition and subtraction are performed from left to right.\n\n2. **Perform the first operation**: \n   - Start with the first two numbers: \\(0 + 4\\).\n   - Calculate: \\(0 + 4 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Proceed to the next operation**:\n   - Take the result from the first operation and add the next number: \\(4 + 1\\).\n   - Calculate: \\(4 + 1 = 5\\).\n\n4. **Perform the final operation**:\n   - Take the result from the second operation and subtract the last number: \\(5 - 0\\).\n   - Calculate: \\(5 - 0 = 5\\).\n\n5. **Conclude the calculation**: The final result of the expression \\(0 + 4 + 1 - 0\\) is 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
