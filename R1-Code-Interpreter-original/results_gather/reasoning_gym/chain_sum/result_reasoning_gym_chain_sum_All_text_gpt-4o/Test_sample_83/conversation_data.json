    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(24 - 78 - 24 - 52\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: \n   \\[\n   24 - 78 - 24 - 52\n   \\]\n\n2. **First Operation (24 - 78)**:\n   - Subtract 78 from 24.\n   - Since 78 is greater than 24, the result will be negative.\n   - Calculate: \\(24 - 78 = -54\\).\n\n3. **Second Operation (-54 - 24)**:\n   - Subtract 24 from -54.\n   - Since both numbers are negative, add their absolute values and keep the negative sign.\n   - Calculate: \\(-54 - 24 = -78\\).\n\n4. **Third Operation (-78 - 52)**:\n   - Subtract 52 from -78.\n   - Again, both numbers are negative, so add their absolute values and keep the negative sign.\n   - Calculate: \\(-78 - 52 = -130\\).\n\n5. **Final Result**:\n   - The result of the expression \\(24 - 78 - 24 - 52\\) is \\(-130\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<-130>>>}\n\\]"
