    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(0 - 0\\), we will analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Operation**: The operation involved here is subtraction, which is denoted by the minus sign (-).\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers involved in this operation are both zero (0).\n\n3. **Understand Subtraction with Zero**: \n   - Subtracting zero from any number does not change the value of that number. \n   - Mathematically, for any number \\(a\\), \\(a - 0 = a\\).\n\n4. **Apply the Rule**: \n   - In this specific problem, we have \\(0 - 0\\).\n   - According to the rule, subtracting zero from zero will result in zero.\n\n5. **Calculate the Result**: \n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(0 - 0 = 0\\).\n\n6. **Verify the Result**: \n   - Double-checking the operation confirms that subtracting zero from zero indeed results in zero.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently state the final answer to the arithmetic problem.\n\n<<<0>>>"
