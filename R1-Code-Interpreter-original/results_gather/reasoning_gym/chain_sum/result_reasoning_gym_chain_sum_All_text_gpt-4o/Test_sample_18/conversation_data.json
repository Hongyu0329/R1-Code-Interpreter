    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(472 - 752 + 348 - 809 + 584\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: \n   \\[\n   472 - 752 + 348 - 809 + 584\n   \\]\n\n2. **First Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   - Calculate \\(472 - 752\\).\n   - Since 752 is greater than 472, the result will be negative.\n   - \\(472 - 752 = -280\\).\n\n3. **Second Operation (Addition)**:\n   - Add 348 to the result from the first operation.\n   - \\(-280 + 348 = 68\\).\n\n4. **Third Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   - Subtract 809 from the result of the second operation.\n   - \\(68 - 809 = -741\\).\n\n5. **Fourth Operation (Addition)**:\n   - Add 584 to the result from the third operation.\n   - \\(-741 + 584 = -157\\).\n\nAfter performing all the operations step by step, the final result of the arithmetic problem is \\(-157\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<-157>>>}\n\\]"
