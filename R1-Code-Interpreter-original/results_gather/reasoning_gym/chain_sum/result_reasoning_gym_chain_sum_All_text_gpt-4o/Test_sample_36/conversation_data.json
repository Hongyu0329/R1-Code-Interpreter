    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(9 - 9 - 3 - 6 - 7\\), we will proceed step by step, carefully considering each subtraction operation in sequence:\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: \\(9 - 9 - 3 - 6 - 7\\)\n\n2. **First Operation**: \n   - Subtract the first 9 from 9: \n   - \\(9 - 9 = 0\\)\n\n3. **Second Operation**:\n   - Subtract 3 from the result of the first operation:\n   - \\(0 - 3 = -3\\)\n\n4. **Third Operation**:\n   - Subtract 6 from the result of the second operation:\n   - \\(-3 - 6 = -9\\)\n\n5. **Fourth Operation**:\n   - Subtract 7 from the result of the third operation:\n   - \\(-9 - 7 = -16\\)\n\nAfter performing all the operations step by step, the final result of the arithmetic problem is \\(-16\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the problem \\(9 - 9 - 3 - 6 - 7\\) is:\n\n<<<-16>>>"
