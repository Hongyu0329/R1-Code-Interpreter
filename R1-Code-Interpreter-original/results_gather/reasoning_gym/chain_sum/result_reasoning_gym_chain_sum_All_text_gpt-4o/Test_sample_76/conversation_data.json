    "To solve the arithmetic problem 6 + 4 + 6, we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers involved**: The numbers we need to add are 6, 4, and 6.\n\n2. **Understand the operation**: The operation required is addition, which means we need to find the sum of these numbers.\n\n3. **Perform the addition step by step**:\n   - First, add the first two numbers: 6 + 4.\n     - 6 + 4 = 10.\n   - Next, add the result to the third number: 10 + 6.\n     - 10 + 6 = 16.\n\n4. **Verify the calculation**: Double-check each step to ensure accuracy.\n   - 6 + 4 = 10 is correct.\n   - 10 + 6 = 16 is correct.\n\n5. **State the final answer**: After verifying the calculations, the final sum of 6 + 4 + 6 is 16.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<16>>>"
