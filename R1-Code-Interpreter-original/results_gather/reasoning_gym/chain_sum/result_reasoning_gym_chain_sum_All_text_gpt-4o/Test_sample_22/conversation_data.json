    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\( 5881 - 8913 + 8987 \\), we will break it down into smaller steps and carefully analyze each part.\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: \n   \\[\n   5881 - 8913 + 8987\n   \\]\n\n2. **First Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   - Calculate \\( 5881 - 8913 \\).\n   - Since 5881 is less than 8913, the result will be negative.\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     \\[\n     8913 - 5881 = 3032\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\( 5881 - 8913 = -3032 \\).\n\n3. **Second Operation (Addition)**:\n   - Now, add 8987 to the result from the first operation:\n     \\[\n     -3032 + 8987\n     \\]\n   - Since we are adding a positive number to a negative number, we subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value:\n     \\[\n     8987 - 3032 = 5955\n     \\]\n   - The result is positive because 8987 is greater than 3032.\n\n4. **Final Result**:\n   - The final result of the expression \\( 5881 - 8913 + 8987 \\) is 5955.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<5955>>>}\n\\]"
