    "To solve the arithmetic problem 189 - 887, we need to perform a subtraction operation. Let's break down the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the Operation**: The problem requires us to subtract 887 from 189.\n\n2. **Understand the Numbers**:\n   - The first number is 189.\n   - The second number is 887.\n\n3. **Determine the Order**: Since subtraction is not commutative, the order matters. We are subtracting 887 from 189.\n\n4. **Perform the Subtraction**:\n   - Since 189 is smaller than 887, the result will be negative.\n   - To find the difference, we can subtract 189 from 887 and then apply the negative sign to the result.\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - Subtract 189 from 887:\n     - 887 - 189 = 698\n\n6. **Apply the Negative Sign**: Since we are subtracting a larger number from a smaller number, the result is negative.\n   - Therefore, the result is -698.\n\n7. **Verify the Calculation**: Double-check the subtraction to ensure accuracy:\n   - 887 - 189 = 698, and since 189 - 887 is the original problem, the result is indeed -698.\n\n8. **State the Final Answer**: The final answer to the problem 189 - 887 is -698.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-698>>>"
