    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(6 - 8 - 7 - 9\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward as it involves only subtraction. We will perform the operations from left to right:\n\n1. **Start with the first two numbers:**\n   - \\(6 - 8\\)\n   - Subtract 8 from 6, which results in \\(-2\\).\n\n2. **Subtract the next number:**\n   - \\(-2 - 7\\)\n   - Subtract 7 from \\(-2\\), which results in \\(-9\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the final number:**\n   - \\(-9 - 9\\)\n   - Subtract 9 from \\(-9\\), which results in \\(-18\\).\n\nThus, the final answer to the arithmetic problem \\(6 - 8 - 7 - 9\\) is \\(-18\\).\n\n<<<-18>>>"
