    "To solve the arithmetic problem 97 + 96, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: We have two numbers to add: 97 and 96.\n\n2. **Understand the Operation**: The operation required is addition.\n\n3. **Align the Numbers**: \n   - Write the numbers vertically, aligning them by their rightmost digits:\n     ```\n     97\n   + 96\n     ```\n\n4. **Add the Units Place**:\n   - Add the digits in the units place: 7 (from 97) + 6 (from 96) = 13.\n   - Since 13 is greater than 9, we write down 3 in the units place and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n\n5. **Add the Tens Place**:\n   - Add the digits in the tens place along with the carry-over: 9 (from 97) + 9 (from 96) + 1 (carry-over) = 19.\n   - Write down 19 as there are no more digits to add.\n\n6. **Combine the Results**:\n   - The result from the tens place is 19, and from the units place is 3.\n   - Combine these to get the final result: 193.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem 97 + 96 is:\n\n<<<193>>>"
