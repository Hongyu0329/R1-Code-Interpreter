    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(336 - 270 - 494 - 691 + 806\\), we will proceed step by step, carefully considering each operation:\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: \n   \\[\n   336 - 270 - 494 - 691 + 806\n   \\]\n\n2. **First Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   - Subtract 270 from 336:\n   \\[\n   336 - 270 = 66\n   \\]\n\n3. **Second Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   - Subtract 494 from the result of the first operation:\n   \\[\n   66 - 494 = -428\n   \\]\n\n4. **Third Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   - Subtract 691 from the result of the second operation:\n   \\[\n   -428 - 691 = -1119\n   \\]\n\n5. **Fourth Operation (Addition)**:\n   - Add 806 to the result of the third operation:\n   \\[\n   -1119 + 806 = -313\n   \\]\n\nAfter performing all the operations step by step, the final result of the arithmetic problem is \\(-313\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-313>>>"
