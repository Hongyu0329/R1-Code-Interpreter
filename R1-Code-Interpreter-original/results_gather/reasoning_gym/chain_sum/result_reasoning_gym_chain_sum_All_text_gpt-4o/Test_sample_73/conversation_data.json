    "To solve the arithmetic problem 694 - 909 - 211 + 102 - 419 + 636, we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: 694 - 909 - 211 + 102 - 419 + 636\n\n2. **First Operation (Subtraction)**: \n   - Calculate 694 - 909\n   - 694 - 909 = -215\n\n3. **Second Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   - Take the result from the first operation and subtract 211\n   - -215 - 211 = -426\n\n4. **Third Operation (Addition)**:\n   - Add 102 to the result from the second operation\n   - -426 + 102 = -324\n\n5. **Fourth Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   - Subtract 419 from the result of the third operation\n   - -324 - 419 = -743\n\n6. **Fifth Operation (Addition)**:\n   - Add 636 to the result from the fourth operation\n   - -743 + 636 = -107\n\nAfter performing all the operations step by step, the final result of the arithmetic problem is -107.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-107>>>"
