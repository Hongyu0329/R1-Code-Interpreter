    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(36 - 92 - 35 - 15 - 34 - 67\\), we will proceed step by step, carefully considering each subtraction operation.\n\n1. **Initial Value**: Start with the first number, which is 36.\n\n2. **First Subtraction**: Subtract 92 from 36.\n   \\[\n   36 - 92 = -56\n   \\]\n   The result is \\(-56\\).\n\n3. **Second Subtraction**: Subtract 35 from the result \\(-56\\).\n   \\[\n   -56 - 35 = -91\n   \\]\n   The result is \\(-91\\).\n\n4. **Third Subtraction**: Subtract 15 from the result \\(-91\\).\n   \\[\n   -91 - 15 = -106\n   \\]\n   The result is \\(-106\\).\n\n5. **Fourth Subtraction**: Subtract 34 from the result \\(-106\\).\n   \\[\n   -106 - 34 = -140\n   \\]\n   The result is \\(-140\\).\n\n6. **Fifth Subtraction**: Subtract 67 from the result \\(-140\\).\n   \\[\n   -140 - 67 = -207\n   \\]\n   The result is \\(-207\\).\n\nAfter performing all the subtractions step by step, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<-207>>>"
