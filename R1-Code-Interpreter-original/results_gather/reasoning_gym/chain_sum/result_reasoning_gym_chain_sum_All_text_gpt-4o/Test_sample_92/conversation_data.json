    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(2 - 0 + 6 - 4\\), we will analyze and calculate it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the operations**: The problem involves basic arithmetic operations: subtraction and addition.\n\n2. **Order of operations**: Since the operations involved are only addition and subtraction, we can proceed from left to right as they appear in the expression.\n\n3. **Step-by-step calculation**:\n   - Start with the first operation: \\(2 - 0\\).\n     - Calculate \\(2 - 0 = 2\\).\n   - Move to the next operation: \\(2 + 6\\).\n     - Calculate \\(2 + 6 = 8\\).\n   - Finally, perform the last operation: \\(8 - 4\\).\n     - Calculate \\(8 - 4 = 4\\).\n\n4. **Final result**: After performing all the operations in sequence, the final result of the expression \\(2 - 0 + 6 - 4\\) is 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
