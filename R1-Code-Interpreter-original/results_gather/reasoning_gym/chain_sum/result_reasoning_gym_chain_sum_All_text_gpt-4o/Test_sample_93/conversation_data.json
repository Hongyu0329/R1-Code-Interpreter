    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(86 + 48 - 82\\), we will break it down into steps and analyze each part carefully.\n\n1. **Identify the operations**: The problem involves addition and subtraction. The expression is \\(86 + 48 - 82\\).\n\n2. **Perform the addition first**: \n   - Add 86 and 48.\n   - \\(86 + 48 = 134\\).\n\n3. **Perform the subtraction**:\n   - Subtract 82 from the result of the addition.\n   - \\(134 - 82 = 52\\).\n\n4. **Verify each step**:\n   - Double-check the addition: \\(86 + 48 = 134\\).\n   - Double-check the subtraction: \\(134 - 82 = 52\\).\n\n5. **Conclude with the final answer**: After verifying each step, the final result of the arithmetic problem is 52.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the problem \\(86 + 48 - 82\\) is:\n\n<<<52>>>"
