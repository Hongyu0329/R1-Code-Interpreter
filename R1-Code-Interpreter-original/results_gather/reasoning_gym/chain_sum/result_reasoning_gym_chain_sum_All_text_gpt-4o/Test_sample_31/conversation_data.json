    "To solve the arithmetic problem step by step, we need to carefully perform each operation in the correct order. The problem is:\n\n5818 + 5144 + 8934 + 2426 - 7335\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Addition of the first two numbers:**\n   - 5818 + 5144 = 10962\n\n2. **Add the next number to the result:**\n   - 10962 + 8934 = 19896\n\n3. **Add the next number to the result:**\n   - 19896 + 2426 = 22322\n\n4. **Subtraction of the last number:**\n   - 22322 - 7335 = 14987\n\nAfter performing these operations step by step, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<14987>>>"
