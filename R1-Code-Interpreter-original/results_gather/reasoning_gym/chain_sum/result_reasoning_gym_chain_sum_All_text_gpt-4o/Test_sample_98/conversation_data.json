    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(5478 - 8211 + 8518 - 1359 + 6871 + 4932\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: \n   \\[\n   5478 - 8211 + 8518 - 1359 + 6871 + 4932\n   \\]\n\n2. **First Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   \\[\n   5478 - 8211 = -2733\n   \\]\n   This is because 5478 is less than 8211, resulting in a negative number.\n\n3. **Second Operation (Addition)**:\n   \\[\n   -2733 + 8518 = 5785\n   \\]\n   Adding 8518 to -2733 results in a positive number.\n\n4. **Third Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   \\[\n   5785 - 1359 = 4426\n   \\]\n   Subtracting 1359 from 5785 results in 4426.\n\n5. **Fourth Operation (Addition)**:\n   \\[\n   4426 + 6871 = 11297\n   \\]\n   Adding 6871 to 4426 results in 11297.\n\n6. **Fifth Operation (Addition)**:\n   \\[\n   11297 + 4932 = 16229\n   \\]\n   Adding 4932 to 11297 results in 16229.\n\nAfter performing all the operations step by step, the final result of the arithmetic problem is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{16229}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<16229>>>"
