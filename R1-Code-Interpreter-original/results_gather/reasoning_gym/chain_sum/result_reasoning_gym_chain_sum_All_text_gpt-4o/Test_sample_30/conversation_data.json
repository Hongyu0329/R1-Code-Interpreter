    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward addition and subtraction from left to right. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Start with the first two numbers:**\n   - 18 + 40 = 58\n\n2. **Add the next number to the result:**\n   - 58 + 69 = 127\n\n3. **Add the next number to the result:**\n   - 127 + 49 = 176\n\n4. **Add the next number to the result:**\n   - 176 + 95 = 271\n\n5. **Subtract the last number from the result:**\n   - 271 - 55 = 216\n\nAfter performing these operations step by step, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<216>>>"
