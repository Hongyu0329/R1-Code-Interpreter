    "To solve the arithmetic problem 920 + 923 - 998 + 788 + 880, we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Addition of the first two numbers:**\n   - Start with 920 and add 923.\n   - 920 + 923 = 1843.\n\n2. **Subtraction of the next number:**\n   - Take the result from step 1, which is 1843, and subtract 998.\n   - 1843 - 998 = 845.\n\n3. **Addition of the next number:**\n   - Take the result from step 2, which is 845, and add 788.\n   - 845 + 788 = 1633.\n\n4. **Addition of the final number:**\n   - Take the result from step 3, which is 1633, and add 880.\n   - 1633 + 880 = 2513.\n\nAfter following these steps, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<2513>>>"
