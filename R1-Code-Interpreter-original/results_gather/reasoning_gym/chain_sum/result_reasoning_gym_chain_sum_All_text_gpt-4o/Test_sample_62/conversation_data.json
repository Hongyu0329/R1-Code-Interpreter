    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\( 25 - 45 - 48 - 65 - 12 - 97 \\), we will proceed step by step, carefully considering each subtraction operation.\n\n1. **Initial Value**: Start with the first number, which is 25.\n\n2. **First Subtraction**: Subtract 45 from 25.\n   \\[\n   25 - 45 = -20\n   \\]\n   The result is \\(-20\\).\n\n3. **Second Subtraction**: Subtract 48 from \\(-20\\).\n   \\[\n   -20 - 48 = -68\n   \\]\n   The result is \\(-68\\).\n\n4. **Third Subtraction**: Subtract 65 from \\(-68\\).\n   \\[\n   -68 - 65 = -133\n   \\]\n   The result is \\(-133\\).\n\n5. **Fourth Subtraction**: Subtract 12 from \\(-133\\).\n   \\[\n   -133 - 12 = -145\n   \\]\n   The result is \\(-145\\).\n\n6. **Fifth Subtraction**: Subtract 97 from \\(-145\\).\n   \\[\n   -145 - 97 = -242\n   \\]\n   The result is \\(-242\\).\n\nAfter performing all the subtractions step by step, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<-242>>>"
