    "To solve the arithmetic problem 7095 + 1834 + 1360, we will add the numbers step by step. Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Add the first two numbers:**\n   - Start with 7095 and 1834.\n   - Add the units place: 5 + 4 = 9.\n   - Add the tens place: 9 + 3 = 12. Write down 2 and carry over 1.\n   - Add the hundreds place: 0 + 8 = 8. Add the carry over 1, resulting in 9.\n   - Add the thousands place: 7 + 1 = 8.\n   - The sum of 7095 and 1834 is 8929.\n\n2. **Add the result to the third number:**\n   - Now add 8929 and 1360.\n   - Add the units place: 9 + 0 = 9.\n   - Add the tens place: 2 + 6 = 8.\n   - Add the hundreds place: 9 + 3 = 12. Write down 2 and carry over 1.\n   - Add the thousands place: 8 + 1 = 9. Add the carry over 1, resulting in 10. Write down 0 and carry over 1.\n   - Since there is a carry over, add it to the next place, resulting in 1.\n   - The sum of 8929 and 1360 is 10289.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem 7095 + 1834 + 1360 is:\n\n<<<10289>>>"
