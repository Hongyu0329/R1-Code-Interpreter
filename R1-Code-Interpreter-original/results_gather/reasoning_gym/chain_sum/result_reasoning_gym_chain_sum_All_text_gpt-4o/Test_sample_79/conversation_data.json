    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\( 605 - 298 + 507 \\), we will break it down into steps and carefully analyze each part.\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: The expression given is \\( 605 - 298 + 507 \\).\n\n2. **Order of Operations**: According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we perform addition and subtraction from left to right as they appear in the expression.\n\n3. **First Operation (Subtraction)**: \n   - Calculate \\( 605 - 298 \\).\n   - Align the numbers vertically for subtraction:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{array}{c}\n     \\phantom{0}605 \\\\\n     -298 \\\\\n     \\hline\n     \\end{array}\n     \\]\n   - Subtract from right to left:\n     - Units place: \\( 5 - 8 \\) requires borrowing. Borrow 1 from the tens place, making it \\( 15 - 8 = 7 \\).\n     - Tens place: After borrowing, \\( 0 \\) becomes \\( 9 \\). So, \\( 9 - 9 = 0 \\).\n     - Hundreds place: \\( 6 - 2 = 4 \\).\n   - Result of \\( 605 - 298 \\) is \\( 307 \\).\n\n4. **Second Operation (Addition)**:\n   - Now add the result from the first operation to 507: \\( 307 + 507 \\).\n   - Align the numbers vertically for addition:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{array}{c}\n     \\phantom{0}307 \\\\\n     +507 \\\\\n     \\hline\n     \\end{array}\n     \\]\n   - Add from right to left:\n     - Units place: \\( 7 + 7 = 14 \\). Write 4 and carry over 1.\n     - Tens place: \\( 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \\).\n     - Hundreds place: \\( 3 + 5 = 8 \\).\n   - Result of \\( 307 + 507 \\) is \\( 814 \\).\n\n5. **Final Result**: The final result of the expression \\( 605 - 298 + 507 \\) is \\( 814 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<814>>>"
