    "To solve the arithmetic problem step by step, we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward addition and subtraction from left to right. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: 816 + 576 - 531 + 869 - 779\n\n2. **Step 1: Add 816 and 576**\n   - 816 + 576 = 1392\n\n3. **Step 2: Subtract 531 from the result of Step 1**\n   - 1392 - 531 = 861\n\n4. **Step 3: Add 869 to the result of Step 2**\n   - 861 + 869 = 1730\n\n5. **Step 4: Subtract 779 from the result of Step 3**\n   - 1730 - 779 = 951\n\nAfter performing these operations step by step, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<951>>>"
