    "To solve the arithmetic problem step by step, we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\n1. Start with the initial number: 52\n2. Add 33 to 52:\n   - 52 + 33 = 85\n3. Subtract 90 from the result:\n   - 85 - 90 = -5\n4. Subtract 11 from the result:\n   - -5 - 11 = -16\n5. Add 77 to the result:\n   - -16 + 77 = 61\n\nAfter performing all the operations step by step, the final result of the arithmetic problem is 61.\n\n<<<61>>>"
