    "To solve the arithmetic problem 703 + 719, we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to add two numbers, 703 and 719.\n\n2. **Align the Numbers**: Write the numbers one below the other, aligning them by their place values (hundreds, tens, and units).\n\n   ```\n     703\n   + 719\n   ```\n\n3. **Add the Units Place**: Start by adding the digits in the units place (rightmost digits).\n   - 3 (from 703) + 9 (from 719) = 12\n   - Write down 2 in the units place and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n\n4. **Add the Tens Place**: Move to the tens place.\n   - 0 (from 703) + 1 (from 719) + 1 (carried over) = 2\n   - Write down 2 in the tens place.\n\n5. **Add the Hundreds Place**: Finally, add the digits in the hundreds place.\n   - 7 (from 703) + 7 (from 719) = 14\n   - Write down 4 in the hundreds place and carry over 1 to the next place (thousands place).\n\n6. **Handle the Carry in the Thousands Place**: Since there is a carry of 1 from the hundreds place addition, write down 1 in the thousands place.\n\n7. **Combine the Results**: The final result of the addition is 1422.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem 703 + 719 is:\n\n<<<1422>>>"
