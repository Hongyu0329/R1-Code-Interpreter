    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(9275 + 5786 - 3942\\), we will break it down into steps and carefully analyze each part.\n\n1. **Addition Step**: \n   - First, add the numbers 9275 and 5786.\n   - Align the numbers by their place values and add them column by column starting from the rightmost digit (units place).\n\n   ```\n     9275\n   + 5786\n   ------\n   ```\n\n   - Units place: \\(5 + 6 = 11\\). Write 1 and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n   - Tens place: \\(7 + 8 = 15\\), plus the carry over 1 makes 16. Write 6 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.\n   - Hundreds place: \\(2 + 7 = 9\\), plus the carry over 1 makes 10. Write 0 and carry over 1 to the thousands place.\n   - Thousands place: \\(9 + 5 = 14\\), plus the carry over 1 makes 15. Write 5 and carry over 1 to the ten-thousands place.\n   - Ten-thousands place: Since there is no digit in the ten-thousands place for 5786, just bring down the carry over 1.\n\n   The result of the addition is 15061.\n\n2. **Subtraction Step**:\n   - Now, subtract 3942 from the result of the addition (15061).\n   - Align the numbers by their place values and subtract them column by column starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n   ```\n     15061\n   -  3942\n   ------\n   ```\n\n   - Units place: \\(1 - 2\\) is not possible, so borrow 1 from the tens place. The units place becomes 11, and the tens place becomes 5.\n   - Units place: \\(11 - 2 = 9\\).\n   - Tens place: \\(5 - 4 = 1\\).\n   - Hundreds place: \\(0 - 9\\) is not possible, so borrow 1 from the thousands place. The hundreds place becomes 10, and the thousands place becomes 4.\n   - Hundreds place: \\(10 - 9 = 1\\).\n   - Thousands place: \\(4 - 3 = 1\\).\n   - Ten-thousands place: Bring down the 1.\n\n   The result of the subtraction is 11119.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem \\(9275 + 5786 - 3942\\) is:\n\n<<<11119>>>"
