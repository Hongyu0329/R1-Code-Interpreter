    "To solve the arithmetic problem step by step, we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward as it involves only addition and subtraction. We will perform the operations from left to right:\n\n1. Start with the initial number: 34\n2. Subtract 91 from 34:\n   - 34 - 91 = -57\n3. Add 85 to the result:\n   - -57 + 85 = 28\n4. Add 95 to the result:\n   - 28 + 95 = 123\n5. Subtract 69 from the result:\n   - 123 - 69 = 54\n6. Subtract 21 from the result:\n   - 54 - 21 = 33\n\nAfter performing all the operations step by step, the final result of the arithmetic problem is 33.\n\n<<<33>>>"
