    "To solve the arithmetic problem 545 - 352, we will perform a step-by-step subtraction:\n\n1. **Align the Numbers:**\n   - Write the numbers one below the other, aligning them by their place values (hundreds, tens, and units).\n   ```\n     545\n   - 352\n   ```\n\n2. **Subtract the Units Place:**\n   - Subtract the units digit of the second number from the units digit of the first number.\n   - Units: 5 - 2 = 3\n\n3. **Subtract the Tens Place:**\n   - Subtract the tens digit of the second number from the tens digit of the first number.\n   - Tens: 4 - 5\n   - Since 4 is less than 5, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place of the first number.\n   - After borrowing, the tens place becomes 14 (since 4 + 10 = 14) and the hundreds place becomes 4 (since 5 - 1 = 4).\n   - Now, subtract: 14 - 5 = 9\n\n4. **Subtract the Hundreds Place:**\n   - Subtract the hundreds digit of the second number from the hundreds digit of the first number.\n   - Hundreds: 4 - 3 = 1\n\n5. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine the results from each place value to get the final answer.\n   - Hundreds: 1, Tens: 9, Units: 3\n   - Therefore, the result is 193.\n\nThe final answer to the arithmetic problem 545 - 352 is:\n\n<<<193>>>"
