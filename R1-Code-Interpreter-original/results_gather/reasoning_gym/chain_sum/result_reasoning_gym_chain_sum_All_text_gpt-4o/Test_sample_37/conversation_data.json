    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(2 - 1\\), we will analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Operation**: The operation involved here is subtraction, which is the process of taking one quantity away from another.\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers involved in this problem are 2 and 1.\n\n3. **Understand the Subtraction**: Subtraction is performed by taking the second number (the subtrahend) away from the first number (the minuend).\n\n4. **Perform the Subtraction**: \n   - Start with the minuend, which is 2.\n   - Subtract the subtrahend, which is 1, from the minuend.\n   - Calculate: \\(2 - 1 = 1\\).\n\n5. **Verify the Result**: \n   - To ensure the subtraction is correct, you can add the result to the subtrahend and check if it equals the minuend: \n   - \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), which matches the original minuend.\n\n6. **Conclude the Answer**: The result of the subtraction is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem \\(2 - 1\\) is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
