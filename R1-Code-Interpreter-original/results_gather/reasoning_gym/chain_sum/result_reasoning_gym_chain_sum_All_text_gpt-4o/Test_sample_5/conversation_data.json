    "To solve the arithmetic problem step by step, we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward as it involves only addition and subtraction. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: 9 + 8 - 0 - 5 - 7 - 8\n\n2. **Step 1**: Start with the first two numbers:\n   - 9 + 8 = 17\n\n3. **Step 2**: Subtract the next number:\n   - 17 - 0 = 17\n\n4. **Step 3**: Subtract the next number:\n   - 17 - 5 = 12\n\n5. **Step 4**: Subtract the next number:\n   - 12 - 7 = 5\n\n6. **Step 5**: Subtract the final number:\n   - 5 - 8 = -3\n\nAfter performing each step carefully, we arrive at the final result.\n\n<<<-3>>>"
