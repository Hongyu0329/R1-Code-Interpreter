    "To solve the arithmetic problem 29 + 48, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: We have two numbers to add: 29 and 48.\n\n2. **Understand the Addition Process**: Addition involves combining the values of the two numbers to get a total sum.\n\n3. **Align the Numbers**: \n   - Write the numbers vertically, aligning them by their rightmost digits (units place).\n   - 29\n   - +48\n\n4. **Add the Units Place**:\n   - Add the digits in the units place: 9 (from 29) + 8 (from 48) = 17.\n   - Since 17 is greater than 9, we write down 7 in the units place and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n\n5. **Add the Tens Place**:\n   - Add the digits in the tens place: 2 (from 29) + 4 (from 48) = 6.\n   - Don't forget to add the carry-over 1 from the previous step: 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n6. **Combine the Results**:\n   - The result from the tens place is 7, and from the units place is 7.\n   - Therefore, the total sum is 77.\n\n7. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - Double-check each step to ensure no mistakes were made in the addition process.\n\nBy following these steps, we have accurately calculated the sum of 29 and 48.\n\nThe final answer to the arithmetic problem 29 + 48 is:\n\n<<<77>>>"
