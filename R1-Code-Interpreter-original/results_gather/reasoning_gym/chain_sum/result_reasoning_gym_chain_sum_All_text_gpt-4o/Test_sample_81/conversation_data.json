    "To solve the arithmetic problem 118 - 589, we need to perform a subtraction operation. Let's break down the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the Operation**: The problem requires us to subtract 589 from 118.\n\n2. **Understand the Numbers**: \n   - 118 is a positive integer.\n   - 589 is a positive integer that is larger than 118.\n\n3. **Recognize the Result**: Since we are subtracting a larger number (589) from a smaller number (118), the result will be a negative number.\n\n4. **Perform the Subtraction**:\n   - Align the numbers by their place values:\n     ```\n       118\n     - 589\n     ```\n   - Start subtracting from the rightmost digit (units place):\n     - We cannot subtract 9 from 8, so we need to borrow from the tens place.\n     - Borrow 1 from the tens place of 118, making it 0, and add 10 to the units place, making it 18.\n     - Now, subtract 9 from 18, which equals 9.\n   - Move to the tens place:\n     - We have 0 in the tens place of 118 after borrowing, and we need to subtract 8.\n     - Borrow 1 from the hundreds place of 118, making it 0, and add 10 to the tens place, making it 10.\n     - Now, subtract 8 from 10, which equals 2.\n   - Move to the hundreds place:\n     - We have 0 in the hundreds place of 118 after borrowing, and we need to subtract 5.\n     - Since there is nothing left to borrow, the result is negative.\n     - Subtract 5 from 0, which equals -5.\n\n5. **Combine the Results**: The subtraction results in -471.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem 118 - 589 is:\n\n<<<-471>>>"
