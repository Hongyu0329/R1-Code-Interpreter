    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(2453 + 3098 + 7200 + 1563 - 1805\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and carefully analyze each part.\n\n1. **Addition of the first two numbers:**\n   - Start with \\(2453 + 3098\\).\n   - Add the units: \\(3 + 8 = 11\\). Write down 1 and carry over 1.\n   - Add the tens: \\(5 + 9 = 14\\), plus the carry-over 1 gives 15. Write down 5 and carry over 1.\n   - Add the hundreds: \\(4 + 0 = 4\\), plus the carry-over 1 gives 5. Write down 5.\n   - Add the thousands: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\). Write down 5.\n   - Result: \\(2453 + 3098 = 5551\\).\n\n2. **Add the next number:**\n   - Add \\(5551 + 7200\\).\n   - Add the units: \\(1 + 0 = 1\\).\n   - Add the tens: \\(5 + 0 = 5\\).\n   - Add the hundreds: \\(5 + 2 = 7\\).\n   - Add the thousands: \\(5 + 7 = 12\\). Write down 2 and carry over 1.\n   - Result: \\(5551 + 7200 = 12751\\).\n\n3. **Add the next number:**\n   - Add \\(12751 + 1563\\).\n   - Add the units: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n   - Add the tens: \\(5 + 6 = 11\\). Write down 1 and carry over 1.\n   - Add the hundreds: \\(7 + 5 = 12\\), plus the carry-over 1 gives 13. Write down 3 and carry over 1.\n   - Add the thousands: \\(2 + 1 = 3\\), plus the carry-over 1 gives 4.\n   - Add the ten-thousands: \\(1 + 0 = 1\\).\n   - Result: \\(12751 + 1563 = 14314\\).\n\n4. **Subtraction of the last number:**\n   - Subtract \\(14314 - 1805\\).\n   - Subtract the units: \\(4 - 5\\). Since 4 is less than 5, borrow 1 from the tens.\n   - Subtract the tens: \\(0 - 0 = 0\\) (after borrowing).\n   - Subtract the hundreds: \\(3 - 8\\). Since 3 is less than 8, borrow 1 from the thousands.\n   - Subtract the thousands: \\(3 - 1 = 2\\) (after borrowing).\n   - Subtract the ten-thousands: \\(1 - 0 = 1\\).\n   - Result: \\(14314 - 1805 = 12509\\).\n\nAfter performing all these steps, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<12509>>>"
