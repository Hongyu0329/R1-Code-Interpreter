    "To solve the arithmetic problem step by step, we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\n1. Start with the first two numbers:  \n   \\(86 + 48 = 134\\)\n\n2. Add the next number to the result:  \n   \\(134 + 19 = 153\\)\n\n3. Subtract the next number:  \n   \\(153 - 56 = 97\\)\n\n4. Subtract the next number:  \n   \\(97 - 38 = 59\\)\n\n5. Finally, add the last number:  \n   \\(59 + 68 = 127\\)\n\nAfter performing all the operations step by step, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<127>>>"
