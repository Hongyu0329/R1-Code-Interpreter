    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(5 - 6 + 0 - 7\\), we will analyze and compute it step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: \\(5 - 6 + 0 - 7\\)\n\n2. **First Operation (Subtraction)**: \n   - Start with the first two numbers: \\(5 - 6\\).\n   - Calculate \\(5 - 6 = -1\\).\n\n3. **Second Operation (Addition)**:\n   - Take the result from the first operation and add 0: \\(-1 + 0\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-1 + 0 = -1\\).\n\n4. **Third Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   - Take the result from the second operation and subtract 7: \\(-1 - 7\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-1 - 7 = -8\\).\n\n5. **Final Result**:\n   - The result of the entire expression \\(5 - 6 + 0 - 7\\) is \\(-8\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<-8>>>"
