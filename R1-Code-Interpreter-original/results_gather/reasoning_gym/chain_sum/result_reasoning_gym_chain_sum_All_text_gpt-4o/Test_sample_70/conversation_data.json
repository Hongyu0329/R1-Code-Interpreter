    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(273 + 667 - 829\\), we will break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Addition Step**: \n   - First, add the numbers 273 and 667.\n   - Calculate \\(273 + 667\\).\n   - Align the numbers vertically and add each column starting from the rightmost digit:\n     - Units place: \\(3 + 7 = 10\\). Write 0 and carry over 1.\n     - Tens place: \\(7 + 6 = 13\\). Add the carry over 1 to get 14. Write 4 and carry over 1.\n     - Hundreds place: \\(2 + 6 = 8\\). Add the carry over 1 to get 9.\n   - The result of the addition is 940.\n\n2. **Subtraction Step**:\n   - Now, subtract 829 from the result of the addition.\n   - Calculate \\(940 - 829\\).\n   - Align the numbers vertically and subtract each column starting from the rightmost digit:\n     - Units place: \\(0 - 9\\). Since 0 is less than 9, borrow 1 from the tens place.\n     - Tens place: After borrowing, the tens place becomes 3. Now, \\(10 - 9 = 1\\).\n     - Tens place: \\(3 - 2 = 1\\).\n     - Hundreds place: \\(9 - 8 = 1\\).\n   - The result of the subtraction is 111.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem \\(273 + 667 - 829\\) is:\n\n<<<111>>>"
