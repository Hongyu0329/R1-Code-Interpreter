    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(68 + 67 + 80 - 17\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and carefully analyze each part.\n\n1. **Addition of the first two numbers:**\n   - Start with the first two numbers: \\(68\\) and \\(67\\).\n   - Add them together: \n     \\[\n     68 + 67 = 135\n     \\]\n\n2. **Addition of the next number:**\n   - Take the result from the first step, which is \\(135\\), and add the next number, \\(80\\):\n     \\[\n     135 + 80 = 215\n     \\]\n\n3. **Subtraction of the last number:**\n   - Now, take the result from the second step, which is \\(215\\), and subtract the last number, \\(17\\):\n     \\[\n     215 - 17 = 198\n     \\]\n\nBy following these steps, we have carefully calculated the result of the arithmetic problem.\n\nThe final answer to the problem \\(68 + 67 + 80 - 17\\) is:\n\n<<<198>>>"
