    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(394 - 626 - 964 - 325 - 554\\), we need to perform the subtraction step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Start with the initial number:**\n   - Begin with 394.\n\n2. **Subtract the first number:**\n   - Subtract 626 from 394.\n   - \\(394 - 626 = -232\\)\n\n3. **Subtract the second number:**\n   - Subtract 964 from the result of the previous step.\n   - \\(-232 - 964 = -1196\\)\n\n4. **Subtract the third number:**\n   - Subtract 325 from the result of the previous step.\n   - \\(-1196 - 325 = -1521\\)\n\n5. **Subtract the fourth number:**\n   - Subtract 554 from the result of the previous step.\n   - \\(-1521 - 554 = -2075\\)\n\nAfter performing all the subtractions step by step, the final result of the arithmetic problem is \\(-2075\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-2075>>>"
