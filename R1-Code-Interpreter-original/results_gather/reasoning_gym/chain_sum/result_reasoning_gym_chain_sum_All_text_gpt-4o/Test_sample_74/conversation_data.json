    "To solve the arithmetic problem step by step, we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward as it involves only addition and subtraction. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: 8 + 8 + 7 - 0 - 4\n\n2. **First Operation (Addition)**: \n   - Add the first two numbers: 8 + 8 = 16\n\n3. **Second Operation (Addition)**:\n   - Add the result from the first operation to the next number: 16 + 7 = 23\n\n4. **Third Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   - Subtract the next number: 23 - 0 = 23\n\n5. **Fourth Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   - Subtract the last number: 23 - 4 = 19\n\nAfter performing all the operations step by step, we arrive at the final result.\n\n<<<19>>>"
