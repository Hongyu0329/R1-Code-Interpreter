    "To solve the arithmetic problem 819 - 570, we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to subtract 570 from 819.\n\n2. **Align the Numbers**: Write the numbers in a column format to ensure proper subtraction:\n   ```\n     819\n   - 570\n   ```\n\n3. **Subtract the Units Place**: \n   - The units digit of 819 is 9.\n   - The units digit of 570 is 0.\n   - Subtract: 9 - 0 = 9.\n\n4. **Subtract the Tens Place**:\n   - The tens digit of 819 is 1.\n   - The tens digit of 570 is 7.\n   - Since 1 is less than 7, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place of 819.\n   - After borrowing, the tens digit of 819 becomes 11 (since 1 becomes 11 after borrowing 10 from the hundreds place).\n   - Subtract: 11 - 7 = 4.\n\n5. **Subtract the Hundreds Place**:\n   - After borrowing, the hundreds digit of 819 is reduced from 8 to 7.\n   - The hundreds digit of 570 is 5.\n   - Subtract: 7 - 5 = 2.\n\n6. **Combine the Results**: \n   - The result from the hundreds place is 2.\n   - The result from the tens place is 4.\n   - The result from the units place is 9.\n   - Combine these results to get the final answer: 249.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem 819 - 570 is:\n\n<<<249>>>"
