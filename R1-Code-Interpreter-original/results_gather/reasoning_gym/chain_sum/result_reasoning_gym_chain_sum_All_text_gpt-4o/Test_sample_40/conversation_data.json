    "To solve the arithmetic problem 54 - 99, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are asked to subtract 99 from 54. This is a basic subtraction problem where the minuend (the number from which another number is subtracted) is smaller than the subtrahend (the number that is to be subtracted).\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**: \n   - Minuend: 54\n   - Subtrahend: 99\n\n3. **Perform the Subtraction**: \n   - Since 54 is less than 99, the result will be a negative number.\n   - To find the difference, we can think of it as finding how much more 99 is than 54.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - Subtract 54 from 99: \n     - 99 - 54 = 45\n   - Since 54 is less than 99, the result of 54 - 99 will be negative.\n\n5. **Determine the Sign**:\n   - The result of 54 - 99 is the negative of the difference calculated above.\n   - Therefore, 54 - 99 = -45.\n\n6. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - Double-check the subtraction: \n     - 99 - 54 = 45\n   - Confirm the sign: Since 54 is less than 99, the result is negative.\n\n7. **State the Final Answer**:\n   - The final answer to the problem 54 - 99 is -45.\n\n<<<-45>>>"
