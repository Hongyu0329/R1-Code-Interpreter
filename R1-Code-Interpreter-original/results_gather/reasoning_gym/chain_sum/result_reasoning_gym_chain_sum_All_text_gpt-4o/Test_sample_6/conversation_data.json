    "To solve the arithmetic problem step by step, we need to carefully follow the order of operations and ensure that each calculation is performed accurately. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers involved:**\n   - We have two addition operations: 2664 + 2085 + 7003\n   - We have two subtraction operations: - 8591 - 7142\n\n2. **Perform the addition operations first:**\n   - Add 2664 and 2085:\n     - 2664 + 2085 = 4749\n   - Add the result to 7003:\n     - 4749 + 7003 = 11752\n\n3. **Perform the subtraction operations:**\n   - Subtract 8591 from the result of the addition:\n     - 11752 - 8591 = 3161\n   - Subtract 7142 from the result of the previous subtraction:\n     - 3161 - 7142 = -3981\n\n4. **Final result:**\n   - The final result of the arithmetic problem is -3981.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<-3981>>>"
