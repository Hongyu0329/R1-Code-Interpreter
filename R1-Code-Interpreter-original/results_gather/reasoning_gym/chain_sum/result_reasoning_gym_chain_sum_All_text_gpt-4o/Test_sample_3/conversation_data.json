    "To solve the arithmetic problem step by step, we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward as it involves only addition and subtraction. We will perform the operations from left to right:\n\n1. Start with the initial number: 868\n\n2. Subtract 234 from 868:\n   - 868 - 234 = 634\n\n3. Subtract 865 from the result:\n   - 634 - 865 = -231\n\n4. Subtract 448 from the result:\n   - -231 - 448 = -679\n\n5. Add 985 to the result:\n   - -679 + 985 = 306\n\n6. Finally, subtract 257 from the result:\n   - 306 - 257 = 49\n\nAfter performing all the operations step by step, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<49>>>"
