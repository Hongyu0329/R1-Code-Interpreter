    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(7 - 9 - 9\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward as it involves only subtraction. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: \\(7 - 9 - 9\\)\n\n2. **First Operation**: Subtract 9 from 7.\n   - \\(7 - 9 = -2\\)\n   - After this operation, the expression becomes \\(-2 - 9\\).\n\n3. **Second Operation**: Subtract 9 from \\(-2\\).\n   - \\(-2 - 9 = -11\\)\n\nBy following these steps, we have evaluated the expression completely.\n\nThe final answer to the arithmetic problem \\(7 - 9 - 9\\) is \\(-11\\).\n\n<<<-11>>>"
