    "To solve the arithmetic problem step by step, we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward as it involves only addition and subtraction. We will perform the operations from left to right.\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: 699 - 128 + 963 - 334 - 130 - 498\n\n2. **First Operation (Subtraction)**: \n   - 699 - 128 = 571\n\n3. **Second Operation (Addition)**:\n   - 571 + 963 = 1534\n\n4. **Third Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   - 1534 - 334 = 1200\n\n5. **Fourth Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   - 1200 - 130 = 1070\n\n6. **Fifth Operation (Subtraction)**:\n   - 1070 - 498 = 572\n\nAfter performing all the operations step by step, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<572>>>"
