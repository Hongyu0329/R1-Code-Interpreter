    "To solve the arithmetic problem 84 + 60, we will break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The two numbers involved in the addition are 84 and 60.\n\n2. **Understand the Operation**: The operation to be performed is addition.\n\n3. **Align the Numbers**: Write the numbers in a column format to ensure proper alignment for addition:\n   ```\n     84\n   + 60\n   ```\n\n4. **Add the Units Place**: Start by adding the digits in the units place (rightmost digits):\n   - 4 (from 84) + 0 (from 60) = 4\n\n5. **Add the Tens Place**: Move to the tens place:\n   - 8 (from 84) + 6 (from 60) = 14\n\n6. **Handle Carry Over**: Since the sum of the tens place is 14, which is greater than 9, we need to carry over:\n   - Write down 4 in the tens place and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.\n\n7. **Add the Hundreds Place**: Since there is no digit in the hundreds place for 60, we only add the carry over:\n   - 0 (from 84) + 0 (from 60) + 1 (carry over) = 1\n\n8. **Combine the Results**: Combine the results from each place:\n   - Hundreds place: 1\n   - Tens place: 4\n   - Units place: 4\n\n9. **Final Result**: The final result of the addition is 144.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem 84 + 60 is:\n\n<<<144>>>"
