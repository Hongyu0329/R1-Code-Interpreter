    "To solve the arithmetic problem 39 - 60, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Operation**: The problem involves subtraction, where 60 is subtracted from 39.\n\n2. **Understand the Numbers**: \n   - 39 is a positive integer.\n   - 60 is a positive integer.\n\n3. **Perform the Subtraction**:\n   - When subtracting a larger number (60) from a smaller number (39), the result will be negative.\n   - Subtract 60 from 39: \n     - Start by subtracting the tens: 3 (from 39) - 6 (from 60) = -3.\n     - Since 39 is less than 60, the result is negative.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - The difference between 39 and 60 is 21.\n   - Since 39 is less than 60, the result is -21.\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - Double-check the subtraction: 39 - 60 = -21.\n\n6. **State the Final Answer**:\n   - The final answer to the arithmetic problem is -21.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-21>>>"
