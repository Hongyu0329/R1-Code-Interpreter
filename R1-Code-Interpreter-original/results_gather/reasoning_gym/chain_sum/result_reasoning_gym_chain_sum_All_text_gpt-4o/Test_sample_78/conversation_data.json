    "To solve the arithmetic problem 62 + 71 - 45 - 91 + 79, we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Expression**: 62 + 71 - 45 - 91 + 79\n\n2. **Step 1: Addition of the first two numbers**:\n   - Calculate 62 + 71\n   - 62 + 71 = 133\n\n3. **Step 2: Subtract the next number**:\n   - Subtract 45 from the result of Step 1\n   - 133 - 45 = 88\n\n4. **Step 3: Subtract the next number**:\n   - Subtract 91 from the result of Step 2\n   - 88 - 91 = -3\n\n5. **Step 4: Add the last number**:\n   - Add 79 to the result of Step 3\n   - -3 + 79 = 76\n\nAfter following these steps, the final result of the arithmetic problem is 76.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<76>>>"
