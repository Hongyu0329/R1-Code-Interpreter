    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(31 + 36 - 61\\), we will break it down into steps and carefully analyze each part:\n\n1. **Identify the operation sequence**: The expression involves addition and subtraction. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), addition and subtraction are performed from left to right.\n\n2. **Perform the first operation (addition)**:\n   - Start with the first two numbers: \\(31 + 36\\).\n   - Calculate \\(31 + 36\\):\n     - Add the units: \\(1 + 6 = 7\\).\n     - Add the tens: \\(3 + 3 = 6\\).\n     - Combine the results: \\(67\\).\n\n3. **Perform the second operation (subtraction)**:\n   - Now take the result from the addition and subtract the next number: \\(67 - 61\\).\n   - Calculate \\(67 - 61\\):\n     - Subtract the units: \\(7 - 1 = 6\\).\n     - Subtract the tens: \\(6 - 6 = 0\\).\n     - Combine the results: \\(6\\).\n\n4. **Verify the calculation**:\n   - Double-check each step to ensure accuracy.\n   - Re-evaluate \\(31 + 36 = 67\\) and \\(67 - 61 = 6\\).\n\n5. **State the final answer**:\n   - After verifying the calculations, the final result of the expression \\(31 + 36 - 61\\) is \\(6\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
