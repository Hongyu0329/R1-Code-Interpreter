    "To solve the arithmetic problem step by step, we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward as it involves only addition and subtraction. We will perform the operations from left to right:\n\n1. Start with the first number: 7\n2. Add the second number: 7 + 8 = 15\n3. Subtract the third number: 15 - 4 = 11\n4. Add the fourth number: 11 + 8 = 19\n5. Subtract the fifth number: 19 - 6 = 13\n6. Subtract the sixth number: 13 - 3 = 10\n\nAfter performing all the operations step by step, we arrive at the final result.\n\n<<<10>>>"
