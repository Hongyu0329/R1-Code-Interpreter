    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(6726 + 3669 - 4947\\), we will break it down into steps and carefully analyze each part.\n\n1. **Addition Step**: \n   - First, add the numbers 6726 and 3669.\n   - Align the numbers by their place values and add them column by column starting from the rightmost digit (units place).\n\n   ```\n     6726\n   + 3669\n   ------\n   ```\n\n   - Units place: \\(6 + 9 = 15\\). Write 5 and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n   - Tens place: \\(2 + 6 = 8\\), plus the carry over 1 gives 9.\n   - Hundreds place: \\(7 + 6 = 13\\). Write 3 and carry over 1 to the thousands place.\n   - Thousands place: \\(6 + 3 = 9\\), plus the carry over 1 gives 10.\n\n   The result of the addition is 10395.\n\n2. **Subtraction Step**:\n   - Now, subtract 4947 from the result of the addition (10395).\n   - Align the numbers by their place values and subtract them column by column starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n   ```\n     10395\n   -  4947\n   ------\n   ```\n\n   - Units place: \\(5 - 7\\) is not possible, so borrow 1 from the tens place. The units place becomes 15, and the tens place becomes 8.\n   - Units place: \\(15 - 7 = 8\\).\n   - Tens place: \\(8 - 4 = 4\\).\n   - Hundreds place: \\(3 - 9\\) is not possible, so borrow 1 from the thousands place. The hundreds place becomes 13, and the thousands place becomes 9.\n   - Hundreds place: \\(13 - 9 = 4\\).\n   - Thousands place: \\(9 - 4 = 5\\).\n\n   The result of the subtraction is 5448.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem \\(6726 + 3669 - 4947\\) is:\n\n<<<5448>>>"
