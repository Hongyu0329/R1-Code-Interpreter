    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\( 9380 - 6963 + 3196 \\), we will break it down into steps and carefully analyze each part.\n\n1. **Subtraction Step**: \n   - Start with the first two numbers: \\( 9380 - 6963 \\).\n   - Align the numbers by their place values and subtract:\n     - Units place: \\( 0 - 3 \\) requires borrowing, so it becomes \\( 10 - 3 = 7 \\).\n     - Tens place: After borrowing, \\( 7 - 6 = 1 \\).\n     - Hundreds place: \\( 3 - 9 \\) requires borrowing, so it becomes \\( 13 - 9 = 4 \\).\n     - Thousands place: After borrowing, \\( 8 - 6 = 2 \\).\n   - The result of \\( 9380 - 6963 \\) is \\( 2417 \\).\n\n2. **Addition Step**:\n   - Now add the result from the subtraction to the third number: \\( 2417 + 3196 \\).\n   - Align the numbers by their place values and add:\n     - Units place: \\( 7 + 6 = 13 \\), write down 3 and carry over 1.\n     - Tens place: \\( 1 + 9 + 1 = 11 \\), write down 1 and carry over 1.\n     - Hundreds place: \\( 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \\).\n     - Thousands place: \\( 2 + 3 = 5 \\).\n   - The result of \\( 2417 + 3196 \\) is \\( 5613 \\).\n\n3. **Final Result**:\n   - The final answer to the arithmetic problem \\( 9380 - 6963 + 3196 \\) is \\( 5613 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5613>>>"
