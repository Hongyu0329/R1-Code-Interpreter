    "To solve the arithmetic problem 4 + 4 + 6, we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers involved**: The numbers we need to add are 4, 4, and 6.\n\n2. **Perform the first addition**: \n   - Add the first two numbers: 4 + 4 = 8.\n\n3. **Perform the second addition**:\n   - Take the result from the first addition and add the third number: 8 + 6.\n\n4. **Calculate the final result**:\n   - 8 + 6 = 14.\n\n5. **Verify the calculation**:\n   - Double-check each step to ensure accuracy:\n     - 4 + 4 = 8 is correct.\n     - 8 + 6 = 14 is correct.\n\nBy following these steps, we have carefully calculated the sum of the numbers.\n\nThe final answer to the arithmetic problem 4 + 4 + 6 is:\n\n<<<14>>>"
