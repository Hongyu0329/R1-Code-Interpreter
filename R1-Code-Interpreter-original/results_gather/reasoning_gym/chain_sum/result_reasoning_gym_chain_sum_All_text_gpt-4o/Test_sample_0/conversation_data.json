    "To solve the arithmetic problem 28 + 48, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The two numbers involved in the addition are 28 and 48.\n\n2. **Align the Numbers**: When adding, it's often helpful to align the numbers vertically by their place values (units, tens, hundreds, etc.). Here, we have:\n\n   ```\n     28\n   + 48\n   ```\n\n3. **Add the Units Place**: Start by adding the digits in the units place (rightmost digits). Here, we have 8 (from 28) and 8 (from 48).\n\n   - 8 + 8 = 16\n\n   Since 16 is a two-digit number, we write down the 6 in the units place and carry over the 1 to the tens place.\n\n4. **Add the Tens Place**: Next, add the digits in the tens place, including any carry-over from the previous step. Here, we have 2 (from 28), 4 (from 48), and the carry-over 1.\n\n   - 2 + 4 + 1 = 7\n\n5. **Combine the Results**: Write down the result from the tens place next to the result from the units place. This gives us:\n\n   ```\n     76\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify the Calculation**: Double-check each step to ensure accuracy. The addition of the units place (8 + 8 = 16) and the tens place (2 + 4 + 1 = 7) confirms the result.\n\nThe final answer to the arithmetic problem 28 + 48 is:\n\n<<<76>>>"
