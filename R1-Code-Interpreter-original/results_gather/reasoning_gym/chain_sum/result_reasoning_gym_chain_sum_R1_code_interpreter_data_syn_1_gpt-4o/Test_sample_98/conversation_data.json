    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the operations in the order they appear. The expression given is:\n\n5478 - 8211 + 8518 - 1359 + 6871 + 4932\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first operation: 5478 - 8211\n2. Add the result to 8518\n3. Subtract 1359 from the result\n4. Add 6871 to the result\n5. Finally, add 4932 to the result\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I will write a Python script to compute the result of this expression.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers in the expression\nnumbers = [5478, -8211, 8518, -1359, 6871, 4932]\n\n# Calculate the result by summing the numbers\nresult = sum(numbers)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 5478 - 8211 + 8518 - 1359 + 6871 + 4932 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
