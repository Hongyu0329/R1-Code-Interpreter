    "To solve the arithmetic problem 812 + 880, we need to perform a simple addition operation. \n\nLet's break down the addition:\n\n- Add the units: 2 + 0 = 2\n- Add the tens: 1 + 8 = 9\n- Add the hundreds: 8 + 8 = 16\n\nSince there is no carryover from the units or tens, we can directly add these results together to get the final sum.\n\nNow, let's use a Python script to perform this addition and confirm the result.\n\n```python\n# Perform the addition\nresult = 812 + 880\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sum of 812 and 880.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 812 + 880 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
