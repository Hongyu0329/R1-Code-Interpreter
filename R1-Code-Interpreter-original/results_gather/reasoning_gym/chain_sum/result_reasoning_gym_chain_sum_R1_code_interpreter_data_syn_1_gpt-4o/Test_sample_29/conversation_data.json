    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(81 + 37 - 51 - 47 - 51\\), we need to perform the operations step by step:\n\n1. Start with the initial number: 81\n2. Add 37 to 81\n3. Subtract 51 from the result\n4. Subtract 47 from the new result\n5. Finally, subtract 51 from the last result\n\nLet's calculate this step by step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial number\nresult = 81\n\n# Add 37\nresult += 37\n\n# Subtract 51\nresult -= 51\n\n# Subtract 47\nresult -= 47\n\n# Subtract 51\nresult -= 51\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
