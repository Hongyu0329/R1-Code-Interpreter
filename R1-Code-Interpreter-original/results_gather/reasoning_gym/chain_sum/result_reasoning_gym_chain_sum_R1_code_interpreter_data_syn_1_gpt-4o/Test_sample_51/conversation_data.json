    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the addition and subtraction operations in the given expression: 2453 + 3098 + 7200 + 1563 - 1805.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. First, add the numbers: 2453, 3098, 7200, and 1563.\n2. Then, subtract 1805 from the result of the addition.\n\nWe can use Python to perform these calculations efficiently.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers_to_add = [2453, 3098, 7200, 1563]\nnumber_to_subtract = 1805\n\n# Calculate the sum of the numbers to add\nsum_of_numbers = sum(numbers_to_add)\n\n# Subtract the specified number\nresult = sum_of_numbers - number_to_subtract\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the arithmetic operation is 12,509. Therefore, the final answer to the problem is:\n\n<<<12509>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 2453 + 3098 + 7200 + 1563 - 1805 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
