    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(68 + 67 + 80 - 17\\), we need to perform the operations step by step:\n\n1. Add 68 and 67.\n2. Add the result to 80.\n3. Subtract 17 from the result of step 2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Add 68 and 67\nresult = 68 + 67\n\n# Step 2: Add the result to 80\nresult += 80\n\n# Step 3: Subtract 17 from the result\nresult -= 17\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
