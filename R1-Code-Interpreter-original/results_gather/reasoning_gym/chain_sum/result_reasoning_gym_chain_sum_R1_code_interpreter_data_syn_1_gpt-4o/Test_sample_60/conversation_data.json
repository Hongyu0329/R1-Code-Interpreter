    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(920 + 923 - 998 + 788 + 880\\), we need to perform the operations step by step. \n\n1. Start by adding the first two numbers: \\(920 + 923\\).\n2. Subtract 998 from the result of step 1.\n3. Add 788 to the result of step 2.\n4. Finally, add 880 to the result of step 3.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step-by-step calculation\nresult = 920 + 923 - 998 + 788 + 880\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The calculation of the arithmetic expression \\(920 + 923 - 998 + 788 + 880\\) results in 2513. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2513>>>"
