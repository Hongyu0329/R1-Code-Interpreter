    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the operations in the order they appear since they are all addition and subtraction, which have the same precedence. \n\nThe expression given is: 9 - 6 + 8 + 0 + 3\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first operation: 9 - 6 = 3\n2. Add the next number: 3 + 8 = 11\n3. Add the next number: 11 + 0 = 11\n4. Add the last number: 11 + 3 = 14\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using a simple Python script.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of the arithmetic expression\nresult = 9 - 6 + 8 + 0 + 3\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the arithmetic expression. \n\nNow, let's provide the final answer.\n\n<<<14>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output confirms the result of the arithmetic expression. Therefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<14>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 9 - 6 + 8 + 0 + 3 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
