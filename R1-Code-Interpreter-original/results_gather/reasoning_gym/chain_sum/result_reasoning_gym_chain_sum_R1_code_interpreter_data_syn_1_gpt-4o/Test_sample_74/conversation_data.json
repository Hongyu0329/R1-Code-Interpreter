    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the operations in the order they appear since they are all addition and subtraction, which have the same precedence. \n\nThe expression given is: \n\n8 + 8 + 7 - 0 - 4\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first two numbers: 8 + 8 = 16\n2. Add the next number: 16 + 7 = 23\n3. Subtract the next number: 23 - 0 = 23 (subtracting zero does not change the value)\n4. Subtract the last number: 23 - 4 = 19\n\nThus, the final result of the arithmetic expression is 19.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of the arithmetic expression\nresult = 8 + 8 + 7 - 0 - 4\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result. \n\n<<<19>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output confirms that the result of the arithmetic expression is indeed 19.\n\n<<<19>>>"
