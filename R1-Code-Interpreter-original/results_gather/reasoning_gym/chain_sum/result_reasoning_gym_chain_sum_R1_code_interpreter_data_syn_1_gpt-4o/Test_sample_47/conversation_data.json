    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(6726 + 3669 - 4947\\), we can break it down into two steps:\n\n1. First, add 6726 and 3669.\n2. Then, subtract 4947 from the result of the first step.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Add 6726 and 3669\nsum_result = 6726 + 3669\n\n# Step 2: Subtract 4947 from the sum_result\nfinal_result = sum_result - 4947\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 6726 + 3669 - 4947 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
