Subtract the next number: \\((62 + 71) - 45\\).\n3. Subtract the next number: \\(((62 + 71) - 45) - 91\\).\n4. Finally, add the last number: \\((((62 + 71) - 45) - 91) + 79\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Perform the arithmetic operations step by step\nresult = 62 + 71 - 45 - 91 + 79\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the arithmetic expression.",
