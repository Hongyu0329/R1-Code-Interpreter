    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform a series of subtractions starting from the number 36. The sequence of operations is as follows:\n\n1. Start with 36.\n2. Subtract 92 from 36.\n3. Subtract 35 from the result of step 2.\n4. Subtract 15 from the result of step 3.\n5. Subtract 34 from the result of step 4.\n6. Subtract 67 from the result of step 5.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial value\nresult = 36\n\n# Perform the subtractions\nresult -= 92\nresult -= 35\nresult -= 15\nresult -= 34\nresult -= 67\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the final result of the arithmetic problem is -207. \n\nTherefore, the final answer to the problem 36 - 92 - 35 - 15 - 34 - 67 is:\n\n<<<-207>>>"
