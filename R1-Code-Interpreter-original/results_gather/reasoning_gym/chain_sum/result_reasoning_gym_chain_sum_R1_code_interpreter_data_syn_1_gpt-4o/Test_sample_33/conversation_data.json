    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform a series of subtractions starting from the initial number 394. The sequence of operations is as follows:\n\n1. Start with 394.\n2. Subtract 626 from 394.\n3. Subtract 964 from the result of step 2.\n4. Subtract 325 from the result of step 3.\n5. Subtract 554 from the result of step 4.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial number\nresult = 394\n\n# Perform the subtractions\nresult -= 626\nresult -= 964\nresult -= 325\nresult -= 554\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
