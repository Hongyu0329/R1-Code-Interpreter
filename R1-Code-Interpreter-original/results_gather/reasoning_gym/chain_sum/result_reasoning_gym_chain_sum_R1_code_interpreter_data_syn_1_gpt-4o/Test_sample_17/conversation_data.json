    "To solve the arithmetic problem 523 - 213, we need to perform a simple subtraction operation. \n\nLet's break down the subtraction:\n\n1. Start from the rightmost digit:\n   - Subtract the units: 3 - 3 = 0\n2. Move to the tens digit:\n   - Subtract the tens: 2 - 1 = 1\n3. Finally, move to the hundreds digit:\n   - Subtract the hundreds: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nPutting it all together, the result of 523 - 213 is 310.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's verify this calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Python code to perform the subtraction\nresult = 523 - 213\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the subtraction. \n\nNow, let's provide the final answer.\n\n<<<310>>>",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 523 - 213 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
