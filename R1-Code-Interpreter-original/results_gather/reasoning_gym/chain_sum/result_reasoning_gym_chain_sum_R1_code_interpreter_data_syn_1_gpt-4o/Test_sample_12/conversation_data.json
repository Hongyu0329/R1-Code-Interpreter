    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to add the numbers 2, 6, 3, 4, and 0 together. The process involves simple addition:\n\n1. Start with the first number: 2\n2. Add the second number: 2 + 6 = 8\n3. Add the third number: 8 + 3 = 11\n4. Add the fourth number: 11 + 4 = 15\n5. Add the fifth number: 15 + 0 = 15\n\nThe final result of the addition is 15. \n\nLet's confirm this by writing a simple Python script to perform the addition:\n\n```python\n# Python code to add the numbers\nresult = 2 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 0\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the addition. \n\nNow, let's provide the final answer:\n\n<<<15>>>",
