    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the operations in the order they appear, as they are all simple addition and subtraction operations. The expression given is:\n\n336 - 270 - 494 - 691 + 806\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first number: 336\n2. Subtract 270 from 336\n3. Subtract 494 from the result of step 2\n4. Subtract 691 from the result of step 3\n5. Add 806 to the result of step 4\n\nWe can write a Python script to perform these calculations efficiently.\n\n```python\n# Define the initial number\nresult = 336\n\n# Perform the operations step by step\nresult -= 270\nresult -= 494\nresult -= 691\nresult += 806\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the arithmetic operations. Based on the calculations, the final answer to the expression 336 - 270 - 494 - 691 + 806 is:\n\n<<<-313>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 336 - 270 - 494 - 691 + 806 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
