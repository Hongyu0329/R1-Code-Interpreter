    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(302 + 346 - 297 - 942\\), we need to perform the operations step by step:\n\n1. Start with the addition: \\(302 + 346\\).\n2. Subtract 297 from the result of step 1.\n3. Finally, subtract 942 from the result of step 2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Add 302 and 346\nresult = 302 + 346\n\n# Step 2: Subtract 297\nresult -= 297\n\n# Step 3: Subtract 942\nresult -= 942\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final answer.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the arithmetic operation. Based on the calculation:\n\n1. \\(302 + 346 = 648\\)\n2. \\(648 - 297 = 351\\)\n3. \\(351 - 942 = -591\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem \\(302 + 346 - 297 - 942\\) is:\n\n<<<-591>>>"
