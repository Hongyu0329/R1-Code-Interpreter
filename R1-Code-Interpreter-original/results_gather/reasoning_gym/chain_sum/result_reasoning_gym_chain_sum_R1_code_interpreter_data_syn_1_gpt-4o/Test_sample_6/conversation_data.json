    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the operations in the order they are presented. The expression is:\n\n2664 + 2085 + 7003 - 8591 - 7142\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Add the first three numbers: 2664 + 2085 + 7003\n2. Subtract the next two numbers from the result: - 8591 - 7142\n\nWe can use Python to perform these calculations efficiently.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnum1 = 2664\nnum2 = 2085\nnum3 = 7003\nnum4 = 8591\nnum5 = 7142\n\n# Perform the arithmetic operations\nresult = num1 + num2 + num3 - num4 - num5\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the arithmetic operation is -3981. \n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<-3981>>>"
