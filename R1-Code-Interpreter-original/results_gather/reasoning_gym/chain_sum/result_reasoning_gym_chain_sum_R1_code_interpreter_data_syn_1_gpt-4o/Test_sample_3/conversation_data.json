    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the operations in the order they appear, as they are all simple addition and subtraction operations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first number: 868\n2. Subtract the second number: 868 - 234\n3. Subtract the third number: (result from step 2) - 865\n4. Subtract the fourth number: (result from step 3) - 448\n5. Add the fifth number: (result from step 4) + 985\n6. Subtract the sixth number: (result from step 5) - 257\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial number\nresult = 868\n\n# Perform the operations step by step\nresult -= 234\nresult -= 865\nresult -= 448\nresult += 985\nresult -= 257\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final result of the arithmetic problem is 49. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<49>>>"
