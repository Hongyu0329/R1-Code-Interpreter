    "To solve the arithmetic problem 29 + 48, we need to perform a simple addition operation. \n\nLet's break down the addition:\n\n1. Add the units place: 9 (from 29) + 8 (from 48) = 17. Write down 7 and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n2. Add the tens place: 2 (from 29) + 4 (from 48) + 1 (carried over) = 7.\n\nThus, the sum of 29 and 48 is 77.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's verify this using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Python code to add two numbers\nresult = 29 + 48\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the addition.\n\n<<<77>>>",

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 29 + 48 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
