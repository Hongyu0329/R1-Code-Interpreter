    "To solve the arithmetic problem 7383 - 4277 + 5865 - 1864, we need to perform the operations step by step. \n\n1. Start with the first operation: 7383 - 4277.\n2. Add the result to 5865.\n3. Subtract 1864 from the result of step 2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtract 4277 from 7383\nresult1 = 7383 - 4277\n\n# Step 2: Add 5865 to the result of step 1\nresult2 = result1 + 5865\n\n# Step 3: Subtract 1864 from the result of step 2\nfinal_result = result2 - 1864\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
