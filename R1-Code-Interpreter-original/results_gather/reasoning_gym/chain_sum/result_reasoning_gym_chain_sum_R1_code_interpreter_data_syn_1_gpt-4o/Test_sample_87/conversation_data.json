    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the operations in the order they appear, as they are all addition and subtraction. The expression given is:\n\n78 + 95 + 80 - 65\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Add 78 and 95.\n2. Add the result to 80.\n3. Subtract 65 from the result of step 2.\n\nWe can use Python to compute this efficiently.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Add 78 and 95\nresult = 78 + 95\n\n# Step 2: Add 80 to the result\nresult += 80\n\n# Step 3: Subtract 65 from the result\nresult -= 65\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
