    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(3 - 4 - 3 + 2 + 5\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward as it involves only addition and subtraction. We can solve it step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first operation: \\(3 - 4\\).\n2. Subtract 3 from the result of the first operation.\n3. Add 2 to the result of the second operation.\n4. Finally, add 5 to the result of the third operation.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step-by-step calculation\nresult = 3 - 4\nresult -= 3\nresult += 2\nresult += 5\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code execution confirms that the arithmetic problem \\(3 - 4 - 3 + 2 + 5\\) evaluates to 3. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
