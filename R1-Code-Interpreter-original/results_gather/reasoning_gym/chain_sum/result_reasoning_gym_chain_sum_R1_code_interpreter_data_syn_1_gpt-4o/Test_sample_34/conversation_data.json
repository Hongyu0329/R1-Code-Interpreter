    "To solve the arithmetic problem 545 - 352, we need to perform a simple subtraction operation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Align the numbers vertically by their place values (hundreds, tens, and units).\n2. Subtract each column starting from the rightmost digit (units) to the leftmost digit (hundreds).\n3. If necessary, borrow from the next left column if the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit.\n\nLet's perform the subtraction:\n\n```\n  545\n- 352\n------\n```\n\n- Units place: 5 - 2 = 3\n- Tens place: 4 - 5 = -1 (since 4 is smaller than 5, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place)\n- After borrowing, the tens place becomes 14 - 5 = 9\n- Hundreds place: 4 (after borrowing) - 3 = 1\n\nSo, the result of the subtraction is 193.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Python code to perform the subtraction\nresult = 545 - 352\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will confirm the result of the subtraction.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output confirms the result of the subtraction. Therefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem 545 - 352 is:\n\n<<<193>>>"
