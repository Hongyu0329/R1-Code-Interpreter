    "To solve the arithmetic problem 243 + 452, we need to perform a simple addition operation. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. Align the numbers by their place values:\n   ```\n     243\n   + 452\n   ```\n\n2. Add the digits in each column starting from the rightmost column (units place):\n   - Units place: 3 + 2 = 5\n   - Tens place: 4 + 5 = 9\n   - Hundreds place: 2 + 4 = 6\n\n3. Combine the results from each column to get the final sum: 695.\n\nTo verify this calculation, we can use a simple Python script to perform the addition and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Python code to add two numbers\nresult = 243 + 452\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the addition. \n\nNow, let's provide the final answer:\n\n<<<695>>>",
