    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(9 + 8 - 0 - 5 - 7 - 8\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward as it involves only addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the initial value: \\(9\\).\n2. Add \\(8\\): \\(9 + 8 = 17\\).\n3. Subtract \\(0\\): \\(17 - 0 = 17\\).\n4. Subtract \\(5\\): \\(17 - 5 = 12\\).\n5. Subtract \\(7\\): \\(12 - 7 = 5\\).\n6. Subtract \\(8\\): \\(5 - 8 = -3\\).\n\nThe final result of the arithmetic operation is \\(-3\\).\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nresult = 9 + 8 - 0 - 5 - 7 - 8\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will confirm the result.",
