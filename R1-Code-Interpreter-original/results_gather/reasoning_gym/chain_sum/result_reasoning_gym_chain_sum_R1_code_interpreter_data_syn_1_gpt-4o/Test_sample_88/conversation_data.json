    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the operations in the order they appear, as they are all addition and subtraction operations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first number: 34\n2. Subtract 91 from 34\n3. Add 85 to the result\n4. Add 95 to the result\n5. Subtract 69 from the result\n6. Subtract 21 from the result\n\nLet's calculate this step by step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial number\nresult = 34\n\n# Perform the operations\nresult -= 91\nresult += 85\nresult += 95\nresult -= 69\nresult -= 21\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the final result of the arithmetic problem is 33. \n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem \\(34 - 91 + 85 + 95 - 69 - 21\\) is:\n\n<<<33>>>"
