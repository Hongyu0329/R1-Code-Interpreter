    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(9878 - 7894 - 7046 + 6982\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward as it involves only addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\n1. Start with the first operation: \\(9878 - 7894\\).\n2. Subtract the result of the first operation from 7046.\n3. Finally, add 6982 to the result of the second operation.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtract 7894 from 9878\nresult1 = 9878 - 7894\n\n# Step 2: Subtract 7046 from the result of step 1\nresult2 = result1 - 7046\n\n# Step 3: Add 6982 to the result of step 2\nfinal_result = result2 + 6982\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final result of the arithmetic operation \\(9878 - 7894 - 7046 + 6982\\) is 1920.\n\n<<<1920>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 9878 - 7894 - 7046 + 6982 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
