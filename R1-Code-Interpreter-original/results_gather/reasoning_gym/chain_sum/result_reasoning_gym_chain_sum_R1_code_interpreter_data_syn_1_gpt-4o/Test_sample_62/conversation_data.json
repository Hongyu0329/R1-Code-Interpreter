    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform a series of subtractions starting from the initial number 25. The sequence of operations is as follows:\n\n1. Start with 25.\n2. Subtract 45 from 25.\n3. Subtract 48 from the result of step 2.\n4. Subtract 65 from the result of step 3.\n5. Subtract 12 from the result of step 4.\n6. Subtract 97 from the result of step 5.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial number\nresult = 25\n\n# Perform the subtractions\nresult -= 45\nresult -= 48\nresult -= 65\nresult -= 12\nresult -= 97\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed correctly without any errors, and the result of the arithmetic operation is -242. \n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem 25 - 45 - 48 - 65 - 12 - 97 is:\n\n<<<-242>>>"
