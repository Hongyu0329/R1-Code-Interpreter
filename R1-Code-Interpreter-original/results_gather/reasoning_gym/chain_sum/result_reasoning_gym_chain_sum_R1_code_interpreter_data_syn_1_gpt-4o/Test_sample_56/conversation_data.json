    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the operations in the order they appear, as they are all addition and subtraction operations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first number: 52\n2. Add 33 to 52\n3. Subtract 90 from the result\n4. Subtract 11 from the result\n5. Add 77 to the result\n\nLet's calculate this step by step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial number\nresult = 52\n\n# Perform the operations\nresult += 33\nresult -= 90\nresult -= 11\nresult += 77\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final result of the arithmetic problem is 61. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the arithmetic problem 52 + 33 - 90 - 11 + 77 is:\n\n<<<61>>>"
