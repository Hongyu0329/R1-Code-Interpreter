    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the addition and subtraction operations in the given expression: \n\n\\[ 18 + 40 + 69 + 49 + 95 - 55 \\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Add the first two numbers: \\( 18 + 40 = 58 \\)\n2. Add the result to the next number: \\( 58 + 69 = 127 \\)\n3. Add the result to the next number: \\( 127 + 49 = 176 \\)\n4. Add the result to the next number: \\( 176 + 95 = 271 \\)\n5. Finally, subtract the last number: \\( 271 - 55 = 216 \\)\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's verify this calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [18, 40, 69, 49, 95]\nsubtract = 55\n\n# Calculate the sum of the numbers\ntotal_sum = sum(numbers)\n\n# Subtract the last number\nresult = total_sum - subtract\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms the calculation. The final result of the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<216>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 18 + 40 + 69 + 49 + 95 - 55 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
