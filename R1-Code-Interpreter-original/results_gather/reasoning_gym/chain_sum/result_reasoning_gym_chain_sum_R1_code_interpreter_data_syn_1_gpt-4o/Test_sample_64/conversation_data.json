    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(789 - 505 + 310 + 198\\), we need to perform the operations in the correct order. The operations involved are subtraction and addition, and since they are of the same precedence, we can perform them from left to right.\n\n1. Start with the first operation: \\(789 - 505\\).\n2. Add the result to 310.\n3. Finally, add 198 to the result from step 2.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step-by-step calculation\nresult = 789 - 505\nresult += 310\nresult += 198\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
