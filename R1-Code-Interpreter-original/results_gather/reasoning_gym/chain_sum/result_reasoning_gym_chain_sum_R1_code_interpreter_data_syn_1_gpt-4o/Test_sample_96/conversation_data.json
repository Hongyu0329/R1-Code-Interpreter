    "To solve the arithmetic problem 9380 - 6963 + 3196, we need to perform the operations in the order they appear, as they are all addition and subtraction, which have the same precedence.\n\n1. First, subtract 6963 from 9380.\n2. Then, add 3196 to the result of the first operation.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step:\n\n- Step 1: 9380 - 6963\n- Step 2: Result from Step 1 + 3196\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I will write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtract 6963 from 9380\nresult_step_1 = 9380 - 6963\n\n# Step 2: Add 3196 to the result of Step 1\nfinal_result = result_step_1 + 3196\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the result of the arithmetic operation. Based on the calculation:\n\n1. Subtracting 6963 from 9380 gives us 2417.\n2. Adding 3196 to 2417 results in 5613.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem 9380 - 6963 + 3196 is:\n\n<<<5613>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 9380 - 6963 + 3196 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
