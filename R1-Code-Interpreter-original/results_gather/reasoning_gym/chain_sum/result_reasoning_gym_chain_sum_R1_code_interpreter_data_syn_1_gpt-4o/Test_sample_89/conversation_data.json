    "To solve the arithmetic problem 84 + 60, we need to perform a simple addition operation. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. Identify the numbers to be added: 84 and 60.\n2. Perform the addition operation: 84 + 60.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a Python script to compute the sum.\n\n```python\n# Python code to compute the sum of 84 and 60\nresult = 84 + 60\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 84 + 60 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
