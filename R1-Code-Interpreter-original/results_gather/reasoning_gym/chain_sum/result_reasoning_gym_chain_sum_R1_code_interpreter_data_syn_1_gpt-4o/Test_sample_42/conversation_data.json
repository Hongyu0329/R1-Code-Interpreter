    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the operations in the order they appear, as they are all addition and subtraction operations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the initial number: 5\n2. Add 1: \\(5 + 1 = 6\\)\n3. Subtract 4: \\(6 - 4 = 2\\)\n4. Subtract 2: \\(2 - 2 = 0\\)\n5. Subtract 3: \\(0 - 3 = -3\\)\n6. Subtract 5: \\(-3 - 5 = -8\\)\n\nThe final result of the arithmetic operation is -8.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nresult = 5 + 1 - 4 - 2 - 3 - 5\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result.\n\n<<<-8>>>",
