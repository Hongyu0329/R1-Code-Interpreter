    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to add the numbers 8, 7, 5, and 6 together. The process involves simple addition:\n\n1. Start with the first two numbers: 8 + 7 = 15\n2. Add the next number to the result: 15 + 5 = 20\n3. Finally, add the last number: 20 + 6 = 26\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's verify this calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Python code to calculate the sum of the numbers\nresult = 8 + 7 + 5 + 6\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the addition.",
    "The calculation has been verified, and the sum of the numbers 8, 7, 5, and 6 is indeed 26.\n\n<<<26>>>"
