    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(8905 - 6062 + 3257\\), we need to perform the operations step by step:\n\n1. Subtract 6062 from 8905.\n2. Add 3257 to the result from step 1.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtract 6062 from 8905\nresult_step1 = 8905 - 6062\n\n# Step 2: Add 3257 to the result from step 1\nfinal_result = result_step1 + 3257\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final answer.",
