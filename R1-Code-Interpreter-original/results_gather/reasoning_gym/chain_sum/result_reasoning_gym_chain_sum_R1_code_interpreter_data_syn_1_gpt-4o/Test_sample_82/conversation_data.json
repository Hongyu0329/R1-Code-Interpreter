    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to add the numbers 5, 3, and 9 together. The process involves simple addition:\n\n1. Start with the first two numbers: 5 + 3 = 8.\n2. Add the result to the third number: 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's verify this calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Python code to calculate the sum of 5, 3, and 9\nresult = 5 + 3 + 9\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the addition.",
