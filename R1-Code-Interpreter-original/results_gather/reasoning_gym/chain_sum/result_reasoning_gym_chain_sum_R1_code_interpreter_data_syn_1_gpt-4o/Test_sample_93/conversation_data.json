    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(86 + 48 - 82\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward as it involves only addition and subtraction.\n\n1. Start with the first two numbers: \\(86 + 48\\).\n2. Subtract the third number from the result: \\((86 + 48) - 82\\).\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step:\n\n- First, calculate \\(86 + 48\\).\n- Then, subtract 82 from the result of the first calculation.\n\nI will write a simple Python script to perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of the arithmetic expression\nresult = 86 + 48 - 82\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
