    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the operations in the order they appear, which is straightforward since they are all addition and subtraction. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first number: 472\n2. Subtract the second number: 472 - 752\n3. Add the third number: (result from step 2) + 348\n4. Subtract the fourth number: (result from step 3) - 809\n5. Add the fifth number: (result from step 4) + 584\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [472, -752, 348, -809, 584]\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = sum(numbers)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the result of the arithmetic operation is -157. \n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem 472 - 752 + 348 - 809 + 584 is:\n\n<<<-157>>>"
