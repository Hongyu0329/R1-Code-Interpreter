    "To solve the arithmetic problem 703 + 719, we need to perform a simple addition operation. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. We have two numbers: 703 and 719.\n2. We need to add these two numbers together to get the result.\n\nTo ensure accuracy and efficiency, I will write a small Python script to perform this addition.\n\n```python\n# Adding the two numbers\nresult = 703 + 719\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 703 + 719 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
