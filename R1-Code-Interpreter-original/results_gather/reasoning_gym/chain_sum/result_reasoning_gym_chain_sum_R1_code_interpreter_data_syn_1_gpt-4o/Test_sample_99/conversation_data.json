    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(888 - 620 + 189 - 502\\), we need to perform the operations in the order they appear, as they are all addition and subtraction.\n\n1. Start with the first operation: \\(888 - 620\\).\n2. Add the result to 189.\n3. Subtract 502 from the result of the previous step.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step-by-step calculation\nresult = 888 - 620\nresult += 189\nresult -= 502\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
