    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\( 8453 - 3863 - 7439 \\), we need to perform the subtraction operations step by step.\n\n1. First, subtract 3863 from 8453.\n2. Then, subtract 7439 from the result of the first subtraction.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtract 3863 from 8453\nresult_after_first_subtraction = 8453 - 3863\n\n# Step 2: Subtract 7439 from the result of the first subtraction\nfinal_result = result_after_first_subtraction - 7439\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final answer.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the arithmetic operation. The calculation steps were as follows:\n\n1. Subtract 3863 from 8453, which gives 4590.\n2. Subtract 7439 from 4590, which results in -2849.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem \\( 8453 - 3863 - 7439 \\) is:\n\n<<<-2849>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 8453 - 3863 - 7439 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
