    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(5 - 6 + 0 - 7\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which in this case is straightforward as it involves only addition and subtraction. We can solve it step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first operation: \\(5 - 6\\).\n2. Then, add \\(0\\) to the result.\n3. Finally, subtract \\(7\\) from the result of the previous step.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = 5 - 6 + 0 - 7\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the arithmetic expression.",
    "The calculation of the arithmetic expression \\(5 - 6 + 0 - 7\\) results in \\(-8\\). The steps are as follows:\n\n1. \\(5 - 6 = -1\\)\n2. \\(-1 + 0 = -1\\)\n3. \\(-1 - 7 = -8\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-8>>>"
