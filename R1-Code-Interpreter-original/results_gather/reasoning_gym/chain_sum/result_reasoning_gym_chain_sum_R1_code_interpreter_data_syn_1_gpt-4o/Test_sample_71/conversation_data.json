    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(98 - 19 - 87 - 25 + 93\\), we need to perform the operations in the order they appear, as they are all addition and subtraction operations.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the initial value: \\(98\\).\n2. Subtract \\(19\\) from \\(98\\).\n3. Subtract \\(87\\) from the result of step 2.\n4. Subtract \\(25\\) from the result of step 3.\n5. Add \\(93\\) to the result of step 4.\n\nWe can write a simple Python script to perform these calculations and get the final result.\n\n```python\n# Initial value\nresult = 98\n\n# Perform the operations\nresult -= 19\nresult -= 87\nresult -= 25\nresult += 93\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
