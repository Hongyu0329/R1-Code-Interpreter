    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the operations in the order they appear, as they are all addition and subtraction. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first number: 68\n2. Add the second number: 68 + 74\n3. Add the third number: (68 + 74) + 71\n4. Add the fourth number: ((68 + 74) + 71) + 76\n5. Subtract the fifth number: (((68 + 74) + 71) + 76) - 56\n6. Add the sixth number: ((((68 + 74) + 71) + 76) - 56) + 68\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the result of the arithmetic expression\nresult = 68 + 74 + 71 + 76 - 56 + 68\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the arithmetic expression.",
