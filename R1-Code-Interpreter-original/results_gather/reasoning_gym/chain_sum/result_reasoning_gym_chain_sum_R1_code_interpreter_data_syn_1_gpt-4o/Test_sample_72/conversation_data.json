    "To solve the arithmetic problem 39 - 60, we need to perform a simple subtraction operation. The number 39 is smaller than 60, so the result will be a negative number. Let's calculate it step by step:\n\n1. Start with the number 39.\n2. Subtract 60 from 39.\n\nWe can use Python to perform this calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nresult = 39 - 60\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the subtraction. Let's proceed with the calculation.",
