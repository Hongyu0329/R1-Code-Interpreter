    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the operations in the order they appear, as they are all addition and subtraction. The operations are straightforward, and we can compute them step by step.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n\n1. Start with the first number: 816\n2. Add the second number: 816 + 576\n3. Subtract the third number: (816 + 576) - 531\n4. Add the fourth number: ((816 + 576) - 531) + 869\n5. Subtract the fifth number: (((816 + 576) - 531) + 869) - 779\n\nWe can write a simple Python script to compute this step by step.\n\n```python\n# Initial number\nresult = 816\n\n# Perform the operations\nresult += 576\nresult -= 531\nresult += 869\nresult -= 779\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final result of the arithmetic operations is 951. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the arithmetic problem 816 + 576 - 531 + 869 - 779 is:\n\n<<<951>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 816 + 576 - 531 + 869 - 779 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
