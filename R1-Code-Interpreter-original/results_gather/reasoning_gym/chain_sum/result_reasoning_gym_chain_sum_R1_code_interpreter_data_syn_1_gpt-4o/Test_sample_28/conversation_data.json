    "To solve the arithmetic problem \\(691 - 257 - 371 - 335\\), we need to perform the subtraction operations in sequence. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the initial number: 691.\n2. Subtract 257 from 691.\n3. Subtract 371 from the result of step 2.\n4. Subtract 335 from the result of step 3.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial number\ninitial_value = 691\n\n# Subtracting the numbers in sequence\nresult = initial_value - 257 - 371 - 335\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
