    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to add the three numbers: 7095, 1834, and 1360. \n\nLet's break down the addition step-by-step:\n\n1. Add the first two numbers: 7095 + 1834.\n2. Take the result from step 1 and add the third number: 1360.\n\nTo ensure accuracy and efficiency, I will write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnum1 = 7095\nnum2 = 1834\nnum3 = 1360\n\n# Perform the addition\nresult = num1 + num2 + num3\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the result of the addition is 10,289. Therefore, the final answer to the arithmetic problem 7095 + 1834 + 1360 is:\n\n<<<10289>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 7095 + 1834 + 1360 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
