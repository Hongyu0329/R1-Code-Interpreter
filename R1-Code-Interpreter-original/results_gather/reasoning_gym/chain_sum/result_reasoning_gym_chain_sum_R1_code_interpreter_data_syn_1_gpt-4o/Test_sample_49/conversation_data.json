    "To solve the arithmetic problem, we need to perform the operations in the order they appear, as they are all addition and subtraction. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first number: 6539\n2. Add the second number: 6539 + 9708\n3. Subtract the third number: (6539 + 9708) - 7295\n4. Add the fourth number: ((6539 + 9708) - 7295) + 8846\n5. Subtract the fifth number: (((6539 + 9708) - 7295) + 8846) - 1284\n6. Subtract the sixth number: ((((6539 + 9708) - 7295) + 8846) - 1284) - 3611\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [6539, 9708, -7295, 8846, -1284, -3611]\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = sum(numbers)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The calculation has been performed correctly using the Python code. The final result of the arithmetic problem is:\n\n<<<12903>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    State the final answer to the following arithmetic problem: 6539 + 9708 - 7295 + 8846 - 1284 - 3611 =\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
