    "\nassistant > To determine if 1976 is a leap year, we can use the following rules:\n\n1. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.\n2. However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless:\n3. The year is also divisible by 400, in which case it is a leap year.\n\nLet's apply these rules to the year 1976:\n\n- 1976 is divisible by 4 (1976 รท 4 = 494).\n- 1976 is not divisible by 100.\n\nSince 1976 meets the first condition and does not meet the second condition, it is a leap year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
