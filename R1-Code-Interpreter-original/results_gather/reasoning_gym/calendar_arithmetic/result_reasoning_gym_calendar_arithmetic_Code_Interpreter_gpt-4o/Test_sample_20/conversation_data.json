    "\nassistant > To determine the weekday of April 3rd in a year where January 1st is a Monday, we need to calculate the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd and then find the weekday corresponding to that number of days.\n\n1. January has 31 days.\n2. February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).\n3. March has 31 days.\n4. April 3rd is 3 days into April.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of days from January 1st to April 3rd:\n\n- Total days = 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 3 (April) = 93 days\n\nNow, we need to find the weekday 93 days after Monday. We can do this by finding the remainder when 93 is divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n\nLet's calculate this:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the total number of days from January 1st to April 3rd\ntotal_days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 3\n\n# Calculate the weekday by finding the remainder when total_days is divided by 7\n# Monday is represented as 0, so we add the remainder to 0\nweekday_index = total_days % 7\n\n# List of weekdays starting from Monday\nweekdays = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\"]\n\n# Determine the weekday\nweekday_of_april_3 = weekdays[weekday_index]\nweekday_of_april_3\nassistant > The weekday of April 3rd in a year where January 1st is a Monday is <<<Wednesday>>>."
