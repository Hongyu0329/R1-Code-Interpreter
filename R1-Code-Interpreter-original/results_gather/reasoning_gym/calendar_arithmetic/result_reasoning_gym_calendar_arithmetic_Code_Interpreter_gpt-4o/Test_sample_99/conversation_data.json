    "\nassistant > To determine the weekday of April 9 in a year where January 1 is a Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of days from January 1 to April 9 and then find the weekday that corresponds to that number of days.\n\n1. January has 31 days.\n2. February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).\n3. March has 31 days.\n4. April 9 is 9 days into April.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of days from January 1 to April 9:\n\n- Days in January: 31\n- Days in February: 28\n- Days in March: 31\n- Days in April: 9\n\nTotal days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 9\n\nNow, we will find the weekday by calculating the remainder when the total number of days is divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). Starting from Wednesday, we will count forward to find the weekday.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the total number of days from January 1 to April 9\ndays_in_january = 31\ndays_in_february = 28\ndays_in_march = 31\ndays_in_april = 9\n\ntotal_days = days_in_january + days_in_february + days_in_march + days_in_april\n\n# Calculate the weekday\n# 0: Wednesday, 1: Thursday, ..., 6: Tuesday\nweekday_index = (total_days - 1) % 7\n\n# List of weekdays starting from Wednesday\nweekdays = [\"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\", \"Monday\", \"Tuesday\"]\n\n# Determine the weekday of April 9\nweekday_of_april_9 = weekdays[weekday_index]\nweekday_of_april_9\nassistant > The weekday of April 9 in a year where January 1 is a Wednesday is <<<Wednesday>>>."
