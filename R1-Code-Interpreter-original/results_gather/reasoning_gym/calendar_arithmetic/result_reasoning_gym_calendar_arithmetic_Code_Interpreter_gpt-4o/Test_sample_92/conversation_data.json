    "\nassistant > To determine the day of the week for January 23, given that the first day of the year was a Friday, we need to calculate the number of days from January 1 to January 23 and then find the corresponding weekday.\n\nJanuary 1 is a Friday. We need to count the days from January 1 to January 23, which is 22 days later. We can then calculate the day of the week by taking the remainder of the division of these days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n\nLet's perform this calculation.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the day of the week for January 23\ndays_from_jan_1_to_jan_23 = 22\nfirst_day_of_year = 4  # Friday is the 5th day of the week (0=Monday, 6=Sunday)\n\n# Calculate the day of the week for January 23\nday_of_week_jan_23 = (first_day_of_year + days_from_jan_1_to_jan_23) % 7\n\n# Map the result to the corresponding weekday\nweekdays = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\"]\nweekday_jan_23 = weekdays[day_of_week_jan_23]\nweekday_jan_23\nassistant > The day of the week for January 23 is <<<Saturday>>>."
