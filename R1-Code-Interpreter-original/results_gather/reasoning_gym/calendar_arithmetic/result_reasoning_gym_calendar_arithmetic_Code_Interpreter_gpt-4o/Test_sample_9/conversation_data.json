Therefore, the first Tuesday of June 2022 was on June 7. Adding 7 days to this date gives us the second Tuesday.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Find the first day of June 2022\nfirst_day_of_june = datetime(2022, 6, 1)\n\n# Calculate the first Tuesday of June 2022\ndays_until_tuesday = (1 - first_day_of_june.weekday() + 7) % 7\nfirst_tuesday = first_day_of_june + timedelta(days=days_until_tuesday)\n\n# Calculate the second Tuesday\nsecond_tuesday = first_tuesday + timedelta(days=7)\n\n# Get the day of the month for the second Tuesday\nsecond_tuesday_day = second_tuesday.day\nsecond_tuesday_day\nassistant > The second Tuesday in June 2022 falls on the 14th.
