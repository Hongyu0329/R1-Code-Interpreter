    "\nassistant > To determine the weekday of March 11 in a year where January 1st is a Thursday, we can calculate the number of days from January 1st to March 11th and then find the corresponding weekday.\n\n1. January has 31 days.\n2. February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).\n3. March 11 is the 11th day of March.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of days from January 1st to March 11th:\n\n- Days in January: 31\n- Days in February: 28\n- Days in March up to the 11th: 11\n\nTotal days = 31 + 28 + 11\n\nNow, we will find the weekday by calculating the remainder when the total number of days is divided by 7, starting from Thursday. \n\nLet's perform the calculation.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the total number of days from January 1st to March 11th\ndays_in_january = 31\ndays_in_february = 28\ndays_in_march = 11\n\ntotal_days = days_in_january + days_in_february + days_in_march\n\n# Calculate the weekday\n# Thursday is the starting point, which is index 0\nweekdays = [\"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\", \"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\nweekday_index = total_days % 7\n\n# Find the weekday\nweekday_of_march_11 = weekdays[weekday_index]\nweekday_of_march_11\nassistant > The weekday of March 11 in a year where January 1st is a Thursday is <<<Thursday>>>."
