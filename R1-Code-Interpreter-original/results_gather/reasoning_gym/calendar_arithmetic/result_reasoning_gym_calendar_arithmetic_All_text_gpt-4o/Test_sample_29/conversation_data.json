    "To determine the date of the last Tuesday in March 2022, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Days in March 2022**: March has 31 days.\n\n2. **Determine the Day of the Week for March 31, 2022**: \n   - March 1, 2022, is a Tuesday. \n   - Therefore, March 8, 2022, is also a Tuesday (7 days later).\n   - Continuing this pattern, March 15, 2022, is a Tuesday.\n   - March 22, 2022, is a Tuesday.\n   - March 29, 2022, is a Tuesday.\n\n3. **Check the Day of the Week for March 31, 2022**:\n   - March 29, 2022, is a Tuesday.\n   - March 30, 2022, is a Wednesday.\n   - March 31, 2022, is a Thursday.\n\n4. **Identify the Last Tuesday in March 2022**:\n   - Since March 31, 2022, is a Thursday, the last Tuesday of March 2022 is March 29, 2022.\n\n5. **Verify the Existence of the Ordinal**:\n   - The last Tuesday exists in March 2022, so we do not need to return -1.\n\nBy following these steps, we determine that the last Tuesday in March 2022 is on the 29th.\n\nFinal answer: <<<29>>>"
