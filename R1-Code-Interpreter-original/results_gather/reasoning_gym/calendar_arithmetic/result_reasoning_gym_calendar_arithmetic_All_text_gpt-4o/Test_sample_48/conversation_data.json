    "To determine the weekday of March 11 in a year where January 1st is a Thursday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given that January 1st is a Thursday. We need to find out what day of the week March 11th falls on in the same year.\n\n2. **Days in Each Month**: \n   - January has 31 days.\n   - February typically has 28 days (since no leap year is mentioned, we assume it's a common year).\n   - March has 31 days.\n\n3. **Calculate Days from January 1st to March 11th**:\n   - From January 1st to January 31st: 31 days.\n   - From February 1st to February 28th: 28 days.\n   - From March 1st to March 11th: 11 days.\n\n4. **Total Days Calculation**:\n   - Total days from January 1st to March 11th = 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 11 (March) = 70 days.\n\n5. **Determine the Weekday**:\n   - January 1st is a Thursday.\n   - We need to find the weekday 70 days after January 1st.\n   - Since a week has 7 days, we calculate the remainder when 70 is divided by 7 to find how many days beyond complete weeks we have: 70 % 7 = 0.\n   - A remainder of 0 means that March 11th is exactly 10 weeks after January 1st, and thus falls on the same day of the week as January 1st.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since January 1st is a Thursday and March 11th is 70 days later, March 11th is also a Thursday.\n\nTherefore, the weekday of March 11 is:\n\n<<<Thursday>>>"
