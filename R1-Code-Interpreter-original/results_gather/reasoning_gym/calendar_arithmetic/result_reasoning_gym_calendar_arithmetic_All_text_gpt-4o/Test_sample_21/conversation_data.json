    "To determine how many times Friday occurs between Thursday, April 21, 2022, and Saturday, June 18, 2022, inclusive, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Dates:**\n   - Start Date: Thursday, April 21, 2022\n   - End Date: Saturday, June 18, 2022\n\n2. **Determine the Day of the Week for the Start Date:**\n   - April 21, 2022, is a Thursday.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Days in the Range:**\n   - From April 21, 2022, to June 18, 2022, inclusive, we need to calculate the total number of days.\n   - April 21 to April 30: 10 days (April has 30 days)\n   - May 1 to May 31: 31 days\n   - June 1 to June 18: 18 days\n   - Total days = 10 + 31 + 18 = 59 days\n\n4. **Determine the Day of the Week for the End Date:**\n   - Since April 21, 2022, is a Thursday, we can calculate the day of the week for June 18, 2022.\n   - 59 days from Thursday, April 21, 2022:\n     - 59 days = 8 weeks and 3 days (since 59 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 3)\n     - 8 weeks later, it is still Thursday, and 3 days after Thursday is Sunday.\n   - Therefore, June 18, 2022, is a Saturday.\n\n5. **Count the Number of Fridays:**\n   - The first Friday after April 21, 2022, is April 22, 2022.\n   - From April 22, 2022, to June 18, 2022, we count the Fridays.\n   - Fridays occur every 7 days.\n   - Calculate the number of Fridays from April 22 to June 18:\n     - April 22, 29\n     - May 6, 13, 20, 27\n     - June 3, 10, 17\n   - Total Fridays = 9\n\nTherefore, the number of times Friday occurs between Thursday, April 21, 2022, and Saturday, June 18, 2022, inclusive, is 9.\n\nFinal answer: <<<9>>>"
