    "To determine which weekday it was 34 days before Sunday, October 23, 2022, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Starting Day**: We are given that October 23, 2022, is a Sunday.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Weeks in 34 Days**: \n   - There are 7 days in a week.\n   - Divide 34 by 7 to find out how many full weeks are in 34 days.\n   - \\( 34 \\div 7 = 4 \\) weeks and 6 days.\n\n3. **Determine the Day of the Week 34 Days Before**:\n   - Since 34 days is equivalent to 4 weeks and 6 days, we need to go back 4 full weeks and then 6 additional days from Sunday.\n   - Going back 4 full weeks from a Sunday brings us to another Sunday (since 4 weeks is a complete cycle of the week).\n   - Now, go back 6 more days from this Sunday:\n     - 1 day back: Saturday\n     - 2 days back: Friday\n     - 3 days back: Thursday\n     - 4 days back: Wednesday\n     - 5 days back: Tuesday\n     - 6 days back: Monday\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, 34 days before Sunday, October 23, 2022, was a Monday.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Monday>>>"
