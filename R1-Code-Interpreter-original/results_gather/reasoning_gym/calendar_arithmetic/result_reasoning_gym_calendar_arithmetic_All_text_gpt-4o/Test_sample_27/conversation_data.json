    "To determine the weekday on which February 21, 2022, fell, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find out the day of the week for a specific date: February 21, 2022.\n\n2. **Identify the Year**: The year in question is 2022. We need to consider whether it is a leap year or not, as this affects the number of days in February.\n\n3. **Leap Year Check**: A year is a leap year if:\n   - It is divisible by 4,\n   - But not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.\n   - 2022 is not divisible by 4, so it is not a leap year. Therefore, February 2022 has 28 days.\n\n4. **Determine the Day of the Week**:\n   - We can use known algorithms or reference points to find the day of the week for a given date. One common method is Zeller's Congruence or using a known reference date.\n   - Alternatively, we can use a known reference date and count the days forward or backward to the target date.\n\n5. **Reference Date**: Let's use a known reference date. January 1, 2022, was a Saturday.\n\n6. **Calculate Days from Reference Date**:\n   - January 2022 has 31 days. From January 1 to January 31 is 30 days.\n   - February 21 is 21 days into February.\n   - Total days from January 1 to February 21 = 31 (January) + 21 (February) = 52 days.\n\n7. **Determine the Weekday**:\n   - Starting from Saturday, January 1, 2022, we count 52 days forward.\n   - 52 days is equivalent to 52 mod 7 = 3 days beyond a complete week cycle.\n   - Starting from Saturday, counting 3 days forward: Sunday (1), Monday (2), Tuesday (3).\n\n8. **Conclusion**: February 21, 2022, was a Monday.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Monday>>>"
