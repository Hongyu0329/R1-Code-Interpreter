    "To determine how many times Tuesday occurs between Tuesday, June 21, 2022, and Sunday, September 25, 2022, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Dates:**\n   - Start Date: Tuesday, June 21, 2022\n   - End Date: Sunday, September 25, 2022\n\n2. **Verify the Day of the Week for the Start Date:**\n   - June 21, 2022, is a Tuesday.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Days in the Range:**\n   - From June 21, 2022, to September 25, 2022, inclusive, we need to calculate the total number of days.\n   - June 21 to June 30: 10 days\n   - July: 31 days\n   - August: 31 days\n   - September 1 to September 25: 25 days\n   - Total days = 10 + 31 + 31 + 25 = 97 days\n\n4. **Determine the Frequency of Tuesdays:**\n   - Since the start date is a Tuesday, we need to find out how many Tuesdays occur in these 97 days.\n   - A week has 7 days, so Tuesdays repeat every 7 days.\n   - Divide the total number of days by 7 to find the number of complete weeks: 97 รท 7 = 13 weeks with a remainder of 6 days.\n\n5. **Count the Number of Tuesdays:**\n   - Each complete week contains exactly one Tuesday.\n   - Therefore, in 13 complete weeks, there are 13 Tuesdays.\n   - The remainder of 6 days after 13 weeks starts on a Tuesday (since the start date is a Tuesday) and ends on a Sunday.\n   - The days of the week for these 6 days are: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.\n   - There is one additional Tuesday in these 6 days.\n\n6. **Calculate the Total Number of Tuesdays:**\n   - Total Tuesdays = 13 (from complete weeks) + 1 (from the remaining days) = 14 Tuesdays.\n\nTherefore, the number of times Tuesday occurs between June 21, 2022, and September 25, 2022, is:\n\n<<<14>>>"
