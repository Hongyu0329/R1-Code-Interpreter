    "To determine the date of the last Friday in November 2022, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Days of the Week for November 2022:**\n   - November 1, 2022, is a Tuesday. We can verify this by knowing that November 1, 2021, was a Monday (since 2020 was a leap year, 2021 starts on a Friday, making November 1, 2021, a Monday). Therefore, November 1, 2022, is a Tuesday.\n\n2. **Determine the Total Number of Days in November:**\n   - November has 30 days.\n\n3. **Find the Day of the Week for November 30, 2022:**\n   - Since November 1, 2022, is a Tuesday, we can calculate the day of the week for November 30, 2022, by counting the days:\n     - November 1: Tuesday\n     - November 2: Wednesday\n     - November 3: Thursday\n     - November 4: Friday\n     - November 5: Saturday\n     - November 6: Sunday\n     - November 7: Monday\n     - November 8: Tuesday\n     - November 9: Wednesday\n     - November 10: Thursday\n     - November 11: Friday\n     - November 12: Saturday\n     - November 13: Sunday\n     - November 14: Monday\n     - November 15: Tuesday\n     - November 16: Wednesday\n     - November 17: Thursday\n     - November 18: Friday\n     - November 19: Saturday\n     - November 20: Sunday\n     - November 21: Monday\n     - November 22: Tuesday\n     - November 23: Wednesday\n     - November 24: Thursday\n     - November 25: Friday\n     - November 26: Saturday\n     - November 27: Sunday\n     - November 28: Monday\n     - November 29: Tuesday\n     - November 30: Wednesday\n\n4. **Identify the Last Friday of November 2022:**\n   - From the above list, the last Friday before November 30, 2022, is November 25, 2022.\n\n5. **Verify the Ordinal Existence:**\n   - Since November has 30 days, the ordinal for the last Friday (November 25) exists.\n\nTherefore, the date of the event that recurs on the last Friday of November 2022 is:\n\n<<<25>>>"
