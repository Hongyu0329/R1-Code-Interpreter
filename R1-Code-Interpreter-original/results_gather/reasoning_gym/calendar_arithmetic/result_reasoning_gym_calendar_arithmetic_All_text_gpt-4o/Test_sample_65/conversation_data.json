    "To determine the weekday on which July 26, 2022, fell, we can use the following step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the weekday for a specific date, July 26, 2022.\n\n2. **Choose a Method**: There are several methods to find the day of the week for a given date, such as using Zeller's Congruence, the Doomsday Algorithm, or simply counting days from a known reference date. Here, we'll use a simple counting method from a known reference date.\n\n3. **Select a Reference Date**: A common reference date is January 1, 2000, which was a Saturday.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Days from the Reference Date to the Target Date**:\n   - **From January 1, 2000, to January 1, 2022**: \n     - Count the number of years: 22 years.\n     - Calculate the number of leap years within this period. Leap years are divisible by 4, except for years divisible by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400. The leap years from 2000 to 2021 are 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020, totaling 6 leap years.\n     - Calculate the total number of days: \n       - Non-leap years: 16 years × 365 days = 5,840 days\n       - Leap years: 6 years × 366 days = 2,196 days\n       - Total days from January 1, 2000, to January 1, 2022: 5,840 + 2,196 = 8,036 days.\n\n5. **Calculate the Number of Days from January 1, 2022, to July 26, 2022**:\n   - January: 31 days\n   - February: 28 days (2022 is not a leap year)\n   - March: 31 days\n   - April: 30 days\n   - May: 31 days\n   - June: 30 days\n   - July: 26 days\n   - Total days from January 1, 2022, to July 26, 2022: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 26 = 207 days.\n\n6. **Calculate the Total Number of Days from January 1, 2000, to July 26, 2022**:\n   - Total days = 8,036 (from step 4) + 207 (from step 5) = 8,243 days.\n\n7. **Determine the Day of the Week**:\n   - Since January 1, 2000, was a Saturday, we can find the weekday by calculating the remainder of the total days divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n   - 8,243 days ÷ 7 = 1,177 weeks and 4 days remainder.\n   - Starting from Saturday, 4 days later is Wednesday.\n\nTherefore, July 26, 2022, fell on a Wednesday.\n\n<<<Wednesday>>>"
