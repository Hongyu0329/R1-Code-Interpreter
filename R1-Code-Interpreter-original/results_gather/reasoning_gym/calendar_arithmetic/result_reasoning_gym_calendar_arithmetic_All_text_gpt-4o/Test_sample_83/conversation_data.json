    "To determine what day of the week April 10 will be if the first day of the year was a Tuesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given that January 1 is a Tuesday. We need to find out what day of the week April 10 falls on.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Days from January 1 to April 10**:\n   - January has 31 days.\n   - February typically has 28 days, but since we are not given a specific year, we will assume it's not a leap year. If it were a leap year, February would have 29 days.\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - April 10 means we need to count 10 days into April.\n\n3. **Add the Days**:\n   - Days in January: 31\n   - Days in February: 28\n   - Days in March: 31\n   - Days in April up to the 10th: 10\n   - Total days from January 1 to April 10: 31 + 28 + 31 + 10 = 100 days\n\n4. **Determine the Day of the Week**:\n   - We know January 1 is a Tuesday.\n   - We need to find the day of the week 100 days after Tuesday.\n   - Days of the week cycle every 7 days. Therefore, we calculate the remainder when 100 is divided by 7 to find how many days beyond a complete week cycle April 10 is.\n   - 100 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 14 and a remainder of 2. This means April 10 is 2 days after a complete week cycle from Tuesday.\n\n5. **Find the Day**:\n   - Starting from Tuesday, count 2 days forward:\n     - 1 day after Tuesday is Wednesday.\n     - 2 days after Tuesday is Thursday.\n\nTherefore, April 10 will be a Thursday.\n\n<<<Thursday>>>"
