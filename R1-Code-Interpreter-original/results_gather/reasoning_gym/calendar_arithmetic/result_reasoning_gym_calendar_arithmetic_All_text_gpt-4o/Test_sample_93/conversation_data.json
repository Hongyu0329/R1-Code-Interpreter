    "To determine the day of the week for a given date, we can use Zeller's Congruence, a well-known algorithm for calculating the day of the week. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Date Components**: \n   - Day (d) = 27\n   - Month (m) = 4 (April)\n   - Year (y) = 2022\n\n2. **Adjust the Month and Year**:\n   - In Zeller's Congruence, January and February are considered as months 13 and 14 of the previous year. Since April is month 4, no adjustment is needed for the month or year.\n\n3. **Apply Zeller's Congruence Formula**:\n   - The formula is: \n     \\[\n     h = \\left( q + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13(m+1)}{5} \\right\\rfloor + K + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{K}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{J}{4} \\right\\rfloor - 2J \\right) \\mod 7\n     \\]\n   - Where:\n     - \\( q \\) is the day of the month.\n     - \\( m \\) is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 12 = December; January and February are 13 and 14 of the previous year).\n     - \\( K \\) is the year of the century (year \\% 100).\n     - \\( J \\) is the zero-based century (year // 100).\n\n4. **Substitute the Values**:\n   - \\( q = 27 \\)\n   - \\( m = 4 \\)\n   - \\( K = 2022 \\% 100 = 22 \\)\n   - \\( J = 2022 // 100 = 20 \\)\n\n5. **Calculate Each Component**:\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{13(m+1)}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13 \\times 5}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 13\\)\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{K}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{22}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 5\\)\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{J}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 5\\)\n\n6. **Plug into the Formula**:\n   - \\( h = (27 + 13 + 22 + 5 + 5 - 2 \\times 20) \\mod 7 \\)\n   - \\( h = (72 - 40) \\mod 7 \\)\n   - \\( h = 32 \\mod 7 \\)\n   - \\( h = 4 \\)\n\n7. **Interpret the Result**:\n   - The result \\( h \\) corresponds to the day of the week, where 0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, ..., 6 = Friday.\n   - Therefore, \\( h = 4 \\) corresponds to Wednesday.\n\nThe day of the week for 04/27/2022 is Wednesday.\n\n<<<Wednesday>>>"
