    "To determine how many times Saturday occurs between Saturday, May 7, 2022, and Tuesday, May 31, 2022, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Dates:**\n   - Start Date: Saturday, May 7, 2022\n   - End Date: Tuesday, May 31, 2022\n\n2. **Determine the Day of the Week for the Start Date:**\n   - May 7, 2022, is a Saturday.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Days in the Range:**\n   - The range includes both the start and end dates.\n   - May 7 to May 31 is 25 days (inclusive).\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Weeks in the Range:**\n   - Since May 7 is a Saturday, we can count the number of Saturdays by determining how many full weeks fit into the 25-day period.\n   - A week has 7 days, so divide 25 by 7 to find the number of full weeks: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of full weeks} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{25}{7} \\right\\rfloor = 3\n     \\]\n   - This means there are 3 full weeks from May 7 to May 28.\n\n5. **Count the Saturdays:**\n   - Each full week contains one Saturday.\n   - Therefore, there are 3 Saturdays from May 7 to May 28.\n\n6. **Check for Additional Saturdays:**\n   - After May 28, the next Saturday would be June 4, which is outside the given range.\n   - Therefore, there are no additional Saturdays beyond the 3 counted in the full weeks.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The total number of Saturdays between May 7, 2022, and May 31, 2022, is 3.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
