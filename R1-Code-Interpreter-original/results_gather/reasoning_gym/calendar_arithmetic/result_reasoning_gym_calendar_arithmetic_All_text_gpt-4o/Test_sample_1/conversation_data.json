    "To solve the problem of counting the occurrences of Tuesday from Sunday, March 27 to Wednesday, June 15, 2022, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Dates:**\n   - Start Date: Sunday, March 27, 2022\n   - End Date: Wednesday, June 15, 2022\n\n2. **Determine the Day of the Week for the Start Date:**\n   - March 27, 2022, is a Sunday.\n\n3. **Determine the Day of the Week for the End Date:**\n   - June 15, 2022, is a Wednesday.\n\n4. **Find the First Tuesday After the Start Date:**\n   - The first Tuesday after March 27, 2022, is March 29, 2022.\n\n5. **Count the Number of Tuesdays Between the Start and End Dates:**\n   - We need to count all Tuesdays from March 29, 2022, to June 15, 2022.\n\n6. **Calculate the Number of Weeks Between the First Tuesday and the End Date:**\n   - From March 29, 2022, to June 15, 2022, we calculate the number of weeks.\n   - The period from March 29 to June 15 is 11 weeks and 1 day.\n\n7. **Count the Tuesdays:**\n   - Since there are 11 full weeks between March 29 and June 15, there are 11 Tuesdays in this period.\n\n8. **Verify the Inclusion of the End Date:**\n   - Since June 15, 2022, is a Wednesday, it does not add an additional Tuesday to the count.\n\nTherefore, the total number of Tuesdays from March 27, 2022, to June 15, 2022, is 11.\n\nFinal answer: <<<11>>>"
