    "To determine which weekday February 28 falls on, given that January 1 is a Tuesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given that January 1 is a Tuesday. We need to find out which day of the week February 28 is.\n\n2. **Count the Days in January**: January has 31 days. Since January 1 is a Tuesday, we need to determine the day of the week for January 31.\n\n3. **Calculate the Day of the Week for January 31**:\n   - Start from January 1, which is a Tuesday.\n   - Count the days of the week from January 1 to January 31.\n   - There are 31 days in January, so we need to find the day of the week 30 days after Tuesday (since January 1 is already counted as the first day).\n\n4. **Determine the Day of the Week 30 Days After Tuesday**:\n   - A week has 7 days. Therefore, 30 days is equivalent to 30 mod 7 = 2 days beyond a complete number of weeks.\n   - Starting from Tuesday, count 2 days forward: \n     - Wednesday (1 day after Tuesday)\n     - Thursday (2 days after Tuesday)\n\n   So, January 31 is a Thursday.\n\n5. **Count the Days in February**: February has 28 days in a common year (not a leap year).\n\n6. **Calculate the Day of the Week for February 28**:\n   - February 1 is the day after January 31, which is a Thursday. Therefore, February 1 is a Friday.\n   - We need to find the day of the week 27 days after February 1 (since February 1 is already counted as the first day).\n\n7. **Determine the Day of the Week 27 Days After Friday**:\n   - Again, a week has 7 days. Therefore, 27 days is equivalent to 27 mod 7 = 6 days beyond a complete number of weeks.\n   - Starting from Friday, count 6 days forward:\n     - Saturday (1 day after Friday)\n     - Sunday (2 days after Friday)\n     - Monday (3 days after Friday)\n     - Tuesday (4 days after Friday)\n     - Wednesday (5 days after Friday)\n     - Thursday (6 days after Friday)\n\n   So, February 28 is a Thursday.\n\nTherefore, the day of the week on February 28 is Thursday.\n\n<<<Thursday>>>"
