We need to find out what day of the week March 4 is.\n\n2. **Count the Days in January**: January has 31 days. Since January 1 is a Thursday, we need to find out what day January 31 is.\n   - January 1: Thursday\n   - January 2: Friday\n   - January 3: Saturday\n   - January 4: Sunday\n   - January 5: Monday\n   - January 6: Tuesday\n   - January 7: Wednesday\n   - January 8: Thursday\n   - January 9: Friday\n   - January 10: Saturday\n   - January 11: Sunday\n   - January 12: Monday\n   - January 13: Tuesday\n   - January 14: Wednesday\n   - January 15: Thursday\n   - January 16: Friday\n   - January 17: Saturday\n   - January 18: Sunday\n   - January 19: Monday\n   - January 20: Tuesday\n   - January 21: Wednesday\n   - January 22: Thursday\n   - January 23: Friday\n   - January 24: Saturday\n   - January 25: Sunday\n   - January 26: Monday\n   - January 27: Tuesday\n   - January 28: Wednesday\n   - January 29: Thursday\n   - January 30: Friday\n   - January 31: Saturday\n\n   So, January 31 is a Saturday.\n\n3. **Count the Days in February**: February has 28 days in a common year and 29 days in a leap year. Since we are not given the year, we will assume it is a common year with 28 days.\n   - February 1: Sunday\n   - February 2: Monday\n   - February 3: Tuesday\n   - February 4: Wednesday\n   - February 5: Thursday\n   - February 6: Friday\n   - February 7: Saturday\n   - February 8: Sunday\n   - February 9: Monday\n   - February 10: Tuesday\n   - February 11: Wednesday\n   - February 12: Thursday\n   - February 13: Friday\n   - February 14: Saturday\n   - February 15: Sunday\n   - February 16: Monday\n   - February 17: Tuesday\n   - February 18: Wednesday\n   - February 19: Thursday\n   - February 20: Friday\n   - February 21: Saturday\n   - February 22: Sunday\n   - February 23: Monday\n   - February 24: Tuesday\n   - February 25: Wednesday\n   - February 26: Thursday\n   - February 27: Friday\n   - February 28: Saturday\n\n   So, February 28 is a Saturday.\n\n4. **Count the Days in March up to March 4**: \n   - March 1: Sunday\n   - March 2: Monday\n   - March 3: Tuesday\n   - March 4: Wednesday\n\nTherefore, March 4 falls on a Wednesday.\n\n<<<Wednesday>>>"
