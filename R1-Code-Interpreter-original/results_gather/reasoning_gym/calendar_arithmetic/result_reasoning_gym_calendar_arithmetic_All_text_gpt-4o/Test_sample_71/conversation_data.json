    "To determine the total count of business days between Monday, August 22, 2022, and Tuesday, November 22, 2022, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Dates:**\n   - Start Date: Monday, August 22, 2022\n   - End Date: Tuesday, November 22, 2022\n\n2. **Count the Total Number of Days:**\n   - Calculate the total number of days between the two dates, including both start and end dates.\n   - From August 22, 2022, to November 22, 2022, is a span of 93 days.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Complete Weeks:**\n   - A week consists of 7 days.\n   - Divide the total number of days (93) by 7 to find the number of complete weeks.\n   - 93 days รท 7 days/week = 13 complete weeks with a remainder of 2 days.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Business Days in Complete Weeks:**\n   - Each complete week has 5 business days (Monday through Friday).\n   - 13 complete weeks ร 5 business days/week = 65 business days.\n\n5. **Account for Remaining Days:**\n   - After accounting for 13 complete weeks, there are 2 remaining days.\n   - The remaining days are Monday and Tuesday (since the period starts on a Monday).\n   - Both Monday and Tuesday are business days, so add 2 more business days.\n\n6. **Calculate the Total Number of Business Days:**\n   - Total business days = Business days in complete weeks + Business days in remaining days\n   - Total business days = 65 + 2 = 67\n\nTherefore, the total count of business days between Monday, August 22, 2022, and Tuesday, November 22, 2022, is 67.\n\n<<<67>>>"
