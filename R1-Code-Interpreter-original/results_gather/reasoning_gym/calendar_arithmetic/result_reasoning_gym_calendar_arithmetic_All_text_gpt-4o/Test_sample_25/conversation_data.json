    "To determine what day of the week it was 78 days before Sunday, June 19, 2022, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the day of the week 78 days before a given date, which is Sunday, June 19, 2022.\n\n2. **Calculate the Day of the Week**:\n   - Days of the week cycle every 7 days. Therefore, we can find the equivalent day of the week by calculating the remainder when 78 is divided by 7.\n   - Calculate \\( 78 \\div 7 \\) to find the quotient and remainder.\n   - The quotient is not important for the day of the week calculation, but the remainder is. The remainder tells us how many days back we need to go from the given day (Sunday).\n\n3. **Perform the Division**:\n   - \\( 78 \\div 7 = 11 \\) with a remainder of 1.\n   - This means 78 days ago is equivalent to 1 day before the given day of the week.\n\n4. **Determine the Day of the Week**:\n   - Since today is Sunday, going back 1 day from Sunday lands on Saturday.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, 78 days before Sunday, June 19, 2022, was a Saturday.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Saturday>>>"
