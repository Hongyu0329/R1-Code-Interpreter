    "To determine the day of the week for February 19, given that the first day of the year was a Thursday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of days in January and February:**\n   - January has 31 days.\n   - February typically has 28 days, but since the problem does not specify a leap year, we will assume it is not a leap year.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of days from January 1 to February 19:**\n   - January 1 to January 31: 31 days\n   - February 1 to February 19: 19 days\n   - Total days from January 1 to February 19: 31 + 19 = 50 days\n\n3. **Determine the day of the week for February 19:**\n   - The first day of the year is a Thursday.\n   - We need to find the day of the week 50 days after Thursday.\n   - To do this, we calculate the remainder when 50 is divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n   - 50 รท 7 = 7 weeks and 1 day remainder.\n   - This means 50 days after Thursday is 1 day after Thursday, which is Friday.\n\nTherefore, February 19 will be a Friday.\n\n<<<Friday>>>"
