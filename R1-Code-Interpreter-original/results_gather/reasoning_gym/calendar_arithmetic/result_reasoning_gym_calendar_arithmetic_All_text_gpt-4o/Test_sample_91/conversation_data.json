    "To determine which weekday falls after a 99-day jump starting from Tuesday, May 3, 2022, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Starting Day**: \n   - The starting day is Tuesday, May 3, 2022.\n\n2. **Understand the Weekly Cycle**:\n   - A week consists of 7 days. Therefore, the days of the week repeat every 7 days.\n\n3. **Calculate the Remainder**:\n   - To find out which day of the week it will be after 99 days, we need to calculate the remainder when 99 is divided by 7. This is because every 7 days, the cycle of weekdays repeats.\n   - Perform the division: 99 รท 7 = 14 with a remainder of 1.\n\n4. **Determine the Day of the Week**:\n   - Since the remainder is 1, it means that 99 days from Tuesday will be 1 day after Tuesday.\n   - The day after Tuesday is Wednesday.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, after a 99-day jump from Tuesday, May 3, 2022, the weekday will be Wednesday.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Wednesday>>>"
