    "To determine the day of the week for a given date, we can use Zeller's Congruence, a well-known algorithm for calculating the day of the week. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Date Components**: \n   - The date given is 10/19/2022.\n   - Day (d) = 19\n   - Month (m) = 10 (October)\n   - Year (y) = 2022\n\n2. **Adjust the Month and Year**:\n   - In Zeller's Congruence, January and February are considered as months 13 and 14 of the previous year. Since October is month 10, no adjustment is needed for the month or year.\n\n3. **Extract Century and Year of the Century**:\n   - The year 2022 can be split into:\n     - Century (J) = 20\n     - Year of the Century (K) = 22\n\n4. **Apply Zeller's Congruence Formula**:\n   - The formula is: \n     \\[\n     h = \\left( q + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13(m + 1)}{5} \\right\\rfloor + K + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{K}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{J}{4} \\right\\rfloor - 2J \\right) \\mod 7\n     \\]\n   - Where:\n     - \\( h \\) is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n     - \\( q \\) is the day of the month\n     - \\( m \\) is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 12 = December; January and February are 13 and 14 of the previous year)\n     - \\( K \\) is the year of the century\n     - \\( J \\) is the zero-based century\n\n5. **Substitute the Values**:\n   - \\( q = 19 \\)\n   - \\( m = 10 \\)\n   - \\( K = 22 \\)\n   - \\( J = 20 \\)\n\n6. **Calculate Each Component**:\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{13(m + 1)}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13 \\times 11}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 28.6 \\right\\rfloor = 28\\)\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{K}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{22}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 5.5 \\right\\rfloor = 5\\)\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{J}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 5\\)\n\n7. **Plug into the Formula**:\n   - \\( h = (19 + 28 + 22 + 5 + 5 - 2 \\times 20) \\mod 7 \\)\n   - \\( h = (79 - 40) \\mod 7 \\)\n   - \\( h = 39 \\mod 7 \\)\n   - \\( h = 4 \\)\n\n8. **Determine the Day of the Week**:\n   - \\( h = 4 \\) corresponds to Thursday.\n\nTherefore, the day of the week for 10/19/2022 is Thursday.\n\n<<<answer>>>Thursday"
