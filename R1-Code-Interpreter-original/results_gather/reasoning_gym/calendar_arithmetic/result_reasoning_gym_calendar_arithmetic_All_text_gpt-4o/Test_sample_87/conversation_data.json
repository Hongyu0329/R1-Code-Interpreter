    "To determine the weekday of April 5 in a year where January 1st is a Tuesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given that January 1st is a Tuesday. We need to find out what day of the week April 5th falls on in the same year.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Days from January 1st to April 5th**:\n   - January has 31 days.\n   - February typically has 28 days (since no leap year is mentioned, we assume it's a common year).\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - April 5th is the 5th day of April.\n\n3. **Add the Days**:\n   - Days in January: 31\n   - Days in February: 28\n   - Days in March: 31\n   - Days in April up to the 5th: 5\n\n   Total days from January 1st to April 5th = 31 + 28 + 31 + 5 = 95 days.\n\n4. **Determine the Day of the Week**:\n   - January 1st is a Tuesday.\n   - We need to find the day of the week 95 days after Tuesday.\n\n5. **Calculate the Day of the Week**:\n   - A week has 7 days. To find the weekday, we calculate the remainder of 95 divided by 7.\n   - 95 รท 7 = 13 weeks and 4 days remainder.\n\n6. **Determine the Day**:\n   - Starting from Tuesday, count 4 days forward:\n     - Tuesday (Day 0)\n     - Wednesday (Day 1)\n     - Thursday (Day 2)\n     - Friday (Day 3)\n     - Saturday (Day 4)\n\nTherefore, April 5th falls on a Saturday.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Saturday>>>"
