    "To determine what day of the week it was 73 days ago from Wednesday, October 19, 2022, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Current Day**: We know that today is Wednesday, October 19, 2022.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Weeks and Remaining Days**: \n   - 73 days can be broken down into weeks and days. \n   - There are 7 days in a week, so we divide 73 by 7 to find out how many full weeks are in 73 days.\n   - \\( 73 \\div 7 = 10 \\) weeks and a remainder of 3 days.\n\n3. **Determine the Day of the Week 73 Days Ago**:\n   - Since 73 days is equivalent to 10 weeks and 3 days, we need to go back 10 weeks and then 3 additional days from Wednesday.\n   - Going back 10 weeks from a Wednesday lands us on another Wednesday (since 10 weeks is a multiple of 7 days, the day of the week remains the same).\n   - Now, we need to go back 3 more days from Wednesday:\n     - 1 day back from Wednesday is Tuesday.\n     - 2 days back from Wednesday is Monday.\n     - 3 days back from Wednesday is Sunday.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, 73 days ago from Wednesday, October 19, 2022, was a Sunday.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Sunday>>>"
