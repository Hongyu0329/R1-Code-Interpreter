    "To determine the day of the week 76 days before Saturday, July 2, 2022, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Starting Day**: We start from Saturday, July 2, 2022.\n\n2. **Understand the Week Cycle**: A week consists of 7 days. Therefore, counting backward by full weeks will not change the day of the week.\n\n3. **Calculate Full Weeks**: \n   - Divide 76 by 7 to find out how many full weeks are in 76 days.\n   - \\( 76 \\div 7 = 10 \\) full weeks with a remainder of 6 days.\n\n4. **Determine the Day of the Week**:\n   - Since 10 full weeks do not change the day of the week, we only need to count backward 6 additional days from Saturday.\n   - Counting backward: \n     - 1 day before Saturday is Friday.\n     - 2 days before Saturday is Thursday.\n     - 3 days before Saturday is Wednesday.\n     - 4 days before Saturday is Tuesday.\n     - 5 days before Saturday is Monday.\n     - 6 days before Saturday is Sunday.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: 76 days before Saturday, July 2, 2022, is Sunday.\n\nTherefore, the day of the week 76 days before Saturday, July 2, 2022, is:\n\n<<<Sunday>>>"
