    "To determine the weekday on which December 3, 2022, fell, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Year**: We are dealing with the year 2022.\n\n2. **Determine if the Year is a Leap Year**: \n   - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.\n   - However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.\n   - 2022 is not divisible by 4, so it is not a leap year.\n\n3. **Calculate the Day of the Week for January 1, 2022**:\n   - January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. This can be verified using known calendars or algorithms like Zeller's Congruence.\n\n4. **Count the Days from January 1, 2022, to December 3, 2022**:\n   - January has 31 days.\n   - February has 28 days (since 2022 is not a leap year).\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - April has 30 days.\n   - May has 31 days.\n   - June has 30 days.\n   - July has 31 days.\n   - August has 31 days.\n   - September has 30 days.\n   - October has 31 days.\n   - November has 30 days.\n   - Up to December 3, there are 3 days in December.\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Number of Days**:\n   - Total days from January 1 to December 3 = 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 31 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) + 31 (Oct) + 30 (Nov) + 3 (Dec) = 337 days.\n\n6. **Determine the Day of the Week**:\n   - January 1, 2022, was a Saturday.\n   - To find the day of the week for December 3, 2022, we calculate the remainder when 337 is divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n   - 337 divided by 7 gives a remainder of 1.\n\n7. **Interpret the Remainder**:\n   - A remainder of 0 would mean the same day as January 1, which is Saturday.\n   - A remainder of 1 means the next day, which is Sunday.\n\nTherefore, December 3, 2022, fell on a Sunday.\n\n<<<Sunday>>>"
