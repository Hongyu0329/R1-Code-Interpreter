    "To determine what day of the week March 21 will be if the first day of the year was a Friday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given that January 1 is a Friday. We need to find out what day of the week March 21 will be.\n\n2. **Count the Days in Each Month**:\n   - January has 31 days.\n   - February typically has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).\n   - March has 21 days up to March 21.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Days from January 1 to March 21**:\n   - Days in January: 31\n   - Days in February: 28\n   - Days in March up to the 21st: 21\n   - Total days = 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 21 (March) = 80 days\n\n4. **Determine the Day of the Week**:\n   - Since January 1 is a Friday, we need to find the day of the week 80 days later.\n   - Days of the week cycle every 7 days. Therefore, we calculate the remainder when 80 is divided by 7 to find how many days beyond a complete week cycle we have.\n   - 80 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 11 and a remainder of 3.\n\n5. **Find the Day of the Week**:\n   - Starting from Friday, count 3 days forward:\n     - Day 1: Saturday\n     - Day 2: Sunday\n     - Day 3: Monday\n\nTherefore, March 21 will be a Monday.\n\n<<<Monday>>>"
