    "To determine the day of the week 51 days before Tuesday, April 19, 2022, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Day of the Week for the Given Date:**\n   - April 19, 2022, is a Tuesday.\n\n2. **Understand the Task:**\n   - We need to count backward 51 days from this date.\n\n3. **Break Down the Days into Weeks and Extra Days:**\n   - 51 days can be broken down into full weeks and extra days. \n   - There are 7 days in a week, so divide 51 by 7 to find the number of full weeks and the remainder.\n   - \\( 51 \\div 7 = 7 \\) full weeks with a remainder of 2 days.\n\n4. **Count Backward by Full Weeks:**\n   - Counting backward 7 full weeks from a Tuesday will land on a Tuesday. This is because 7 weeks is a complete cycle of the week.\n\n5. **Count Backward the Remaining Days:**\n   - After counting back 7 weeks, we need to count back an additional 2 days.\n   - Starting from Tuesday, count backward 2 days:\n     - 1 day back from Tuesday is Monday.\n     - 2 days back from Tuesday is Sunday.\n\n6. **Determine the Day of the Week:**\n   - Therefore, 51 days before Tuesday, April 19, 2022, is a Sunday.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude the day of the week.\n\n<<<Sunday>>>"
