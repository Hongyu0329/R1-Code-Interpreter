    "To determine if 1982 is a leap year, we need to follow the rules for identifying leap years in the Gregorian calendar. Here are the steps and careful points to consider:\n\n1. **Divisibility by 4**: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4. This is the first condition to check.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 100**: If a year is divisible by 4, we then check if it is divisible by 100. If it is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless it also meets the next condition.\n\n3. **Divisibility by 400**: If a year is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be considered a leap year.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the year 1982:\n\n- **Step 1**: Check if 1982 is divisible by 4.\n  - Calculation: 1982 รท 4 = 495.5\n  - Since 1982 is not divisible by 4 (as it does not result in a whole number), it does not meet the first condition for being a leap year.\n\n- **Step 2**: Since 1982 is not divisible by 4, we do not need to check the divisibility by 100 or 400. The year 1982 cannot be a leap year.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, 1982 is not a leap year.\n\n<<<No>>>"
