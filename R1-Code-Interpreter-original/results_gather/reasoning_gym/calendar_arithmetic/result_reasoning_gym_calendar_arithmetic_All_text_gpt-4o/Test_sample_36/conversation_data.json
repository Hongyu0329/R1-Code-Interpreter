    "To determine the total count of business days between Saturday, August 27, 2022, and Wednesday, November 23, 2022, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Dates:**\n   - Start Date: Saturday, August 27, 2022\n   - End Date: Wednesday, November 23, 2022\n\n2. **Count the Total Number of Days:**\n   - Calculate the total number of days between the two dates, including both start and end dates.\n   - August 27, 2022, to November 23, 2022, is a span of 89 days.\n\n3. **Determine the Day of the Week for Each Date:**\n   - August 27, 2022, is a Saturday.\n   - November 23, 2022, is a Wednesday.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Complete Weeks:**\n   - From August 27, 2022, to November 23, 2022, there are 12 complete weeks (84 days).\n\n5. **Calculate the Number of Business Days in Complete Weeks:**\n   - Each complete week has 5 business days (Monday through Friday).\n   - Therefore, 12 complete weeks have 12 * 5 = 60 business days.\n\n6. **Calculate the Remaining Days After Complete Weeks:**\n   - After 84 days (12 weeks), there are 5 remaining days from November 20, 2022 (Sunday) to November 23, 2022 (Wednesday).\n\n7. **Count the Business Days in the Remaining Days:**\n   - The remaining days are: Sunday (Nov 20), Monday (Nov 21), Tuesday (Nov 22), and Wednesday (Nov 23).\n   - The business days in this period are Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n   - Therefore, there are 3 business days in the remaining period.\n\n8. **Calculate the Total Number of Business Days:**\n   - Total business days = Business days in complete weeks + Business days in remaining days\n   - Total business days = 60 + 3 = 63\n\nTherefore, the total count of business days between Saturday, August 27, 2022, and Wednesday, November 23, 2022, is 63.\n\n<<<63>>>"
