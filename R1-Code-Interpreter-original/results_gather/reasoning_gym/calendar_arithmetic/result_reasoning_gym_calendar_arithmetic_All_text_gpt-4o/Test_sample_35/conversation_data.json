    "To determine which weekday falls after a 53-day jump starting from Friday, February 25, 2022, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Starting Day**: The starting day is Friday, February 25, 2022.\n\n2. **Understand the Weekday Cycle**: A week consists of 7 days, cycling through Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Complete Weeks in 53 Days**: \n   - Divide 53 by 7 to find the number of complete weeks and the remainder.\n   - \\( 53 \\div 7 = 7 \\) complete weeks with a remainder of 4 days.\n\n4. **Determine the Weekday After 53 Days**:\n   - Since there are 7 complete weeks, the weekday will be the same as the starting day after 49 days (7 weeks Ã— 7 days/week = 49 days).\n   - Starting from Friday, after 49 days, it will still be a Friday.\n   - Now, account for the remaining 4 days: \n     - Day 1: Saturday\n     - Day 2: Sunday\n     - Day 3: Monday\n     - Day 4: Tuesday\n\n5. **Conclusion**: After a 53-day jump from Friday, the weekday will be Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, the weekday that falls after a 53-day jump from Friday, February 25, 2022, is:\n\n<<<Tuesday>>>"
