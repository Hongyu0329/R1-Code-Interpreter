    "To determine the weekday on which November 20, 2022, fell, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the weekday for a specific date, November 20, 2022.\n\n2. **Choose a Method**: There are several methods to find the day of the week for a given date, such as using Zeller's Congruence, the Doomsday Algorithm, or simply counting days from a known reference date. Here, we'll use a simple counting method from a known reference date.\n\n3. **Select a Reference Date**: A common reference date is January 1, 2000, which was a Saturday. This is a known date that can be used to calculate other dates.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Days**: We need to calculate the total number of days from the reference date to November 20, 2022.\n\n   - **From January 1, 2000, to January 1, 2022**: \n     - Count the number of years: 2022 - 2000 = 22 years.\n     - Calculate the number of leap years: Leap years are divisible by 4, but not every year divisible by 100 is a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400. The leap years from 2000 to 2021 are 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020, totaling 6 leap years.\n     - Calculate the total number of days: (22 years * 365 days) + 6 leap days = 8030 days.\n\n   - **From January 1, 2022, to November 20, 2022**:\n     - Count the days in each month:\n       - January: 31 days\n       - February: 28 days (2022 is not a leap year)\n       - March: 31 days\n       - April: 30 days\n       - May: 31 days\n       - June: 30 days\n       - July: 31 days\n       - August: 31 days\n       - September: 30 days\n       - October: 31 days\n       - November: 20 days\n     - Total days from January 1, 2022, to November 20, 2022: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 20 = 324 days.\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Days from the Reference Date**: \n   - Total days from January 1, 2000, to November 20, 2022: 8030 + 324 = 8354 days.\n\n6. **Determine the Weekday**: \n   - Since January 1, 2000, was a Saturday, we can find the weekday by calculating the remainder of the total days divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n   - 8354 days % 7 = 0.\n\n7. **Interpret the Result**: \n   - A remainder of 0 means that November 20, 2022, falls on the same weekday as January 1, 2000, which was a Saturday.\n\nTherefore, the weekday on which November 20, 2022, fell is Saturday.\n\n<<<Saturday>>>"
