    "To determine the day of the week for March 6, 2022, we can use Zeller's Congruence, a well-known algorithm for calculating the day of the week for any given date. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Date Components:**\n   - Day (d) = 6\n   - Month (m) = 3 (March)\n   - Year (y) = 2022\n\n2. **Adjust the Month and Year:**\n   - For Zeller's Congruence, January and February are considered as months 13 and 14 of the previous year. Since March is month 3, no adjustment is needed for the month or year.\n\n3. **Apply Zeller's Congruence Formula:**\n   - The formula is: \n     \\[\n     h = \\left( q + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13(m+1)}{5} \\right\\rfloor + K + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{K}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{J}{4} \\right\\rfloor - 2J \\right) \\mod 7\n     \\]\n   - Where:\n     - \\( q \\) is the day of the month.\n     - \\( m \\) is the month (3 for March).\n     - \\( K \\) is the year of the century (year \\% 100).\n     - \\( J \\) is the zero-based century (year // 100).\n\n4. **Substitute the Values:**\n   - \\( q = 6 \\)\n   - \\( m = 3 \\)\n   - \\( K = 2022 \\% 100 = 22 \\)\n   - \\( J = 2022 // 100 = 20 \\)\n\n5. **Calculate Each Component:**\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{13(m+1)}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13 \\times 4}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 10.4 \\right\\rfloor = 10\\)\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{K}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{22}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 5.5 \\right\\rfloor = 5\\)\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{J}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 5\\)\n\n6. **Plug into the Formula:**\n   - \\( h = (6 + 10 + 22 + 5 + 5 - 2 \\times 20) \\mod 7 \\)\n   - \\( h = (48 - 40) \\mod 7 \\)\n   - \\( h = 8 \\mod 7 \\)\n   - \\( h = 1 \\)\n\n7. **Interpret the Result:**\n   - The result \\( h = 1 \\) corresponds to Sunday, as Zeller's Congruence assigns 0 to Saturday, 1 to Sunday, 2 to Monday, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the day of the week for March 6, 2022, was Sunday.\n\n<<<Sunday>>>"
