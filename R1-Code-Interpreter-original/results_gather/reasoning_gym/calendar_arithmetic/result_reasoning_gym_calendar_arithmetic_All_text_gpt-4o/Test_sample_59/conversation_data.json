    "To determine which weekday it was 88 days before Thursday, October 6, 2022, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a specific date, Thursday, October 6, 2022, and we need to find out what day of the week it was 88 days before this date.\n\n2. **Calculate the Date 88 Days Before**: \n   - Start from October 6, 2022, and count backwards 88 days.\n   - October 6, 2022, is a Thursday.\n\n3. **Break Down the Days**:\n   - October has 31 days. From October 6, we go back 6 days to reach October 1.\n   - This accounts for 6 days. We have 88 - 6 = 82 days remaining to count backwards.\n\n4. **Move to the Previous Month (September)**:\n   - September has 30 days. Going back 30 days from October 1 takes us to September 1.\n   - This accounts for 30 days. We have 82 - 30 = 52 days remaining.\n\n5. **Move to the Previous Month (August)**:\n   - August has 31 days. Going back 31 days from September 1 takes us to July 31.\n   - This accounts for 31 days. We have 52 - 31 = 21 days remaining.\n\n6. **Move to the Previous Month (July)**:\n   - July has 31 days. Going back 21 days from July 31 takes us to July 10.\n   - This accounts for the remaining 21 days.\n\n7. **Determine the Weekday**:\n   - We know October 6, 2022, is a Thursday.\n   - Count backwards from Thursday, October 6, 2022, to find the weekday on July 10, 2022.\n   - Counting backwards 88 days, we can calculate the weekday by considering the number of weeks and extra days:\n     - 88 days is equivalent to 12 weeks and 4 days (since 88 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 4 days).\n   - Starting from Thursday and going back 4 days, we reach Sunday.\n\nTherefore, 88 days before Thursday, October 6, 2022, was a Sunday.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Sunday>>>"
