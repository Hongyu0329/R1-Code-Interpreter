    "To determine the weekday of February 25 in a year where January 1st is a Monday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given that January 1st is a Monday. We need to find out what day of the week February 25th falls on in the same year.\n\n2. **Days in January**: January has 31 days. Since January 1st is a Monday, we need to calculate the weekday for January 31st first.\n\n3. **Calculate Weekday for January 31st**:\n   - January 1st is a Monday.\n   - January has 31 days, so January 31st is 30 days after January 1st.\n   - We need to find the weekday 30 days after Monday.\n\n4. **Determine the Weekday 30 Days After Monday**:\n   - A week has 7 days. Therefore, 30 days is equivalent to 30 mod 7 = 2 days beyond a complete number of weeks.\n   - Starting from Monday, 2 days later is Wednesday.\n   - Therefore, January 31st is a Wednesday.\n\n5. **Days in February**: February has 28 days in a non-leap year. Since we are not given that it is a leap year, we will assume it is a non-leap year.\n\n6. **Calculate Weekday for February 25th**:\n   - February 1st is the day after January 31st, which is a Wednesday. Therefore, February 1st is a Thursday.\n   - February 25th is 24 days after February 1st.\n   - We need to find the weekday 24 days after Thursday.\n\n7. **Determine the Weekday 24 Days After Thursday**:\n   - 24 days is equivalent to 24 mod 7 = 3 days beyond a complete number of weeks.\n   - Starting from Thursday, 3 days later is Sunday.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: February 25th falls on a Sunday.\n\nTherefore, the weekday of February 25 in a year where January 1st is a Monday is:\n\n<<<Sunday>>>"
