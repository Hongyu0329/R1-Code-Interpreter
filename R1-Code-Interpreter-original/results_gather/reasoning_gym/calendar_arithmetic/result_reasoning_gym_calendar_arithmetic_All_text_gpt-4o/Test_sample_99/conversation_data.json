    "To determine the weekday of April 9 in a year where January 1st is a Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given that January 1st is a Wednesday. We need to find out what day of the week April 9th falls on in the same year.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Days from January 1st to April 9th**:\n   - January has 31 days.\n   - February typically has 28 days (since no leap year is mentioned, we assume it's a common year).\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - April 9th is the 9th day of April.\n\n3. **Add the Days**:\n   - Days in January: 31\n   - Days in February: 28\n   - Days in March: 31\n   - Days in April up to the 9th: 9\n\n   Total days from January 1st to April 9th = 31 + 28 + 31 + 9 = 99 days.\n\n4. **Determine the Weekday**:\n   - January 1st is a Wednesday.\n   - We need to find the weekday 99 days after Wednesday.\n   - To find the weekday, calculate the remainder when 99 is divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n\n5. **Calculate the Remainder**:\n   - 99 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 14 and a remainder of 1.\n\n6. **Determine the Day**:\n   - A remainder of 1 means that April 9th is one day after Wednesday.\n   - Therefore, April 9th is a Thursday.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude that the weekday of April 9th in a year where January 1st is a Wednesday is:\n\n<<<Thursday>>>"
