    "To determine the date of the third Friday of May 2022, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Days of the Week for May 2022:**\n   - May 1, 2022, is a Sunday. We can verify this by knowing that May 1, 2021, was a Saturday (since 2021 was not a leap year, May 1, 2022, would be one day later in the week).\n\n2. **Determine the Day of the Week for May 1, 2022:**\n   - May 1, 2022, is a Sunday.\n\n3. **Calculate the Day of the Week for the First Friday:**\n   - If May 1 is a Sunday, then May 6, 2022, is the first Friday of the month (since Friday is five days after Sunday).\n\n4. **Find the Third Friday:**\n   - The first Friday is May 6, 2022.\n   - The second Friday is May 13, 2022 (7 days after the first Friday).\n   - The third Friday is May 20, 2022 (7 days after the second Friday).\n\n5. **Verify the Existence of the Date:**\n   - May 20, 2022, is a valid date within the month of May.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The third Friday of May 2022 falls on May 20.\n\nTherefore, the date of the third Friday of May 2022 is the 20th.\n\nFinal answer: <<<20>>>"
