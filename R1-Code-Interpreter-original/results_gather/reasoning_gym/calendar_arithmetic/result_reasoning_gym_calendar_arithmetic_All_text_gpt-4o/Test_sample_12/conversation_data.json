    "To determine the date of the last Saturday in September 2022, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Days in September 2022:**\n   - September has 30 days.\n\n2. **Determine the Day of the Week for September 1, 2022:**\n   - September 1, 2022, was a Thursday.\n\n3. **Calculate the Day of the Week for September 30, 2022:**\n   - Since September 1, 2022, is a Thursday, we can calculate the day of the week for September 30, 2022, by counting the days forward.\n   - September 30 is 29 days after September 1.\n   - 29 days is equivalent to 4 weeks and 1 day (since 29 divided by 7 equals 4 with a remainder of 1).\n   - Therefore, September 30, 2022, is a Friday (Thursday + 1 day).\n\n4. **Find the Last Saturday in September 2022:**\n   - Since September 30, 2022, is a Friday, the day before, September 29, 2022, is a Thursday.\n   - Therefore, the last Saturday of September 2022 is September 24, 2022.\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Counting backwards from September 30, 2022 (Friday), we have:\n     - September 29, 2022: Thursday\n     - September 28, 2022: Wednesday\n     - September 27, 2022: Tuesday\n     - September 26, 2022: Monday\n     - September 25, 2022: Sunday\n     - September 24, 2022: Saturday\n\nThus, the last Saturday of September 2022 is on the 24th.\n\nFinal answer: <<<24>>>"
