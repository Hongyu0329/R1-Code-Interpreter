    "To determine the weekday on which August 18, 2022, fell, we can use the following step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the weekday for a specific date, August 18, 2022.\n\n2. **Choose a Method**: There are several methods to find the day of the week for a given date, such as using Zeller's Congruence, the Doomsday Algorithm, or simply using a known reference date and counting the days. Here, we'll use a simple counting method based on a known reference date.\n\n3. **Select a Reference Date**: Let's use January 1, 2022, as a reference date. We know that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday.\n\n4. **Count the Days**: We need to count the number of days from January 1, 2022, to August 18, 2022, and determine the weekday by calculating the remainder when this number is divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n\n5. **Calculate Days in Each Month**:\n   - January: 31 days\n   - February: 28 days (2022 is not a leap year)\n   - March: 31 days\n   - April: 30 days\n   - May: 31 days\n   - June: 30 days\n   - July: 31 days\n   - August: 18 days (up to the 18th)\n\n6. **Total Days Calculation**:\n   - From January 1 to July 31: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 212 days\n   - Add days in August: 212 + 18 = 230 days\n\n7. **Determine the Weekday**:\n   - Start from Saturday, January 1, 2022.\n   - Calculate the remainder of 230 divided by 7: 230 % 7 = 6.\n   - Count 6 days from Saturday: Saturday (0), Sunday (1), Monday (2), Tuesday (3), Wednesday (4), Thursday (5), Friday (6).\n\n8. **Conclusion**: August 18, 2022, was a Thursday.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Thursday>>>"
