    "To determine the number of business days between two dates, we need to consider only the weekdays (Monday through Friday) and exclude weekends (Saturday and Sunday). Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Dates:**\n   - Start Date: Thursday, May 26, 2022\n   - End Date: Friday, September 2, 2022\n\n2. **Count the Total Number of Days:**\n   - Calculate the total number of days between May 26, 2022, and September 2, 2022, inclusive of both dates.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Weeks:**\n   - Determine how many full weeks are within this period. A week consists of 7 days.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Weekends:**\n   - Each week has 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). Multiply the number of weeks by 2 to find the total number of weekend days.\n\n5. **Calculate the Number of Business Days:**\n   - Subtract the total number of weekend days from the total number of days to get the number of business days.\n\n6. **Consider Partial Weeks:**\n   - If the period does not start on a Monday or end on a Friday, adjust for any partial weeks at the beginning or end of the period.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- **Total Days Calculation:**\n  - May 26, 2022, to September 2, 2022, is 100 days inclusive.\n\n- **Weeks Calculation:**\n  - 100 days divided by 7 days per week gives approximately 14 full weeks and 2 extra days.\n\n- **Weekend Days Calculation:**\n  - 14 weeks Ã— 2 weekend days per week = 28 weekend days.\n\n- **Business Days Calculation:**\n  - Total days (100) - Weekend days (28) = 72 business days.\n\n- **Adjust for Partial Weeks:**\n  - The period starts on a Thursday and ends on a Friday, so both the start and end days are business days. The calculation of 72 business days already accounts for this, as the extra 2 days in the 14 weeks and 2 days calculation are Thursday and Friday.\n\nTherefore, the number of business days from Thursday, May 26, 2022, to Friday, September 2, 2022, inclusive, is 72.\n\n<<<72>>>"
