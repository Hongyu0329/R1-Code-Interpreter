    "To determine the day of the week for August 15, 2022, we can use the following step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Date Format**: The date given is August 15, 2022. This is in the format of Month-Day-Year.\n\n2. **Identify the Year**: The year is 2022. We need to determine if this is a leap year or not, as this affects the number of days in February and thus the total number of days in the year.\n\n3. **Leap Year Check**: A year is a leap year if:\n   - It is divisible by 4.\n   - If it is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400.\n   - 2022 is not divisible by 4, so it is not a leap year.\n\n4. **Days in Each Month for 2022**:\n   - January: 31 days\n   - February: 28 days (since 2022 is not a leap year)\n   - March: 31 days\n   - April: 30 days\n   - May: 31 days\n   - June: 30 days\n   - July: 31 days\n   - August: 15 days (up to the given date)\n\n5. **Calculate Total Days from the Start of the Year to August 15, 2022**:\n   - January: 31 days\n   - February: 28 days\n   - March: 31 days\n   - April: 30 days\n   - May: 31 days\n   - June: 30 days\n   - July: 31 days\n   - August: 15 days\n   - Total = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 15 = 228 days\n\n6. **Determine the Day of the Week for January 1, 2022**:\n   - January 1, 2022, was a Saturday.\n\n7. **Calculate the Day of the Week for August 15, 2022**:\n   - Start from January 1, 2022 (Saturday).\n   - Count forward 228 days.\n   - Days of the week cycle every 7 days, so divide 228 by 7 to find the remainder.\n   - 228 รท 7 = 32 weeks and 4 days remainder.\n   - Starting from Saturday, count 4 days forward: Saturday (0), Sunday (1), Monday (2), Tuesday (3), Wednesday (4).\n\nTherefore, August 15, 2022, was a Monday.\n\n<<<Monday>>>"
