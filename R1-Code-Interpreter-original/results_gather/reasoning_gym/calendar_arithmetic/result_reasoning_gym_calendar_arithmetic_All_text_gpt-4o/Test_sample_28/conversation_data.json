    "To determine the day of the week for March 15, given that the first day of the year was a Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of days in each month leading up to March:**\n   - January has 31 days.\n   - February typically has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of days from January 1 to March 15:**\n   - From January 1 to January 31: 31 days\n   - From February 1 to February 28: 28 days\n   - From March 1 to March 15: 15 days\n\n3. **Add these days together:**\n   - Total days = 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 15 (March) = 74 days\n\n4. **Determine the day of the week for March 15:**\n   - Since January 1 is a Wednesday, we need to find the day of the week 74 days later.\n   - To do this, calculate the remainder when 74 is divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n   - 74 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 10 and a remainder of 4.\n\n5. **Count 4 days forward from Wednesday:**\n   - Wednesday + 1 day = Thursday\n   - Thursday + 1 day = Friday\n   - Friday + 1 day = Saturday\n   - Saturday + 1 day = Sunday\n\nTherefore, March 15 will be a Sunday.\n\n<<<Sunday>>>"
