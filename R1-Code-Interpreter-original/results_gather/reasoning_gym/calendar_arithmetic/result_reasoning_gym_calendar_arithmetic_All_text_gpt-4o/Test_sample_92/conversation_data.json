    "To determine the day of the week for January 23, given that the first day of the year was a Friday, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Starting Point**: \n   - The first day of the year is a Friday.\n\n2. **Count the Days in January up to the 23rd**:\n   - January has 31 days. We need to find the day of the week for January 23.\n   - Count the days from January 1 to January 23. This includes January 1, so there are 23 days in total.\n\n3. **Calculate the Day of the Week**:\n   - Since January 1 is a Friday, we need to determine the day of the week 22 days after January 1 (since January 1 is already counted as the first day).\n   - Days of the week cycle every 7 days. Therefore, we calculate the remainder when 22 is divided by 7 to find how many days forward from Friday we need to move.\n   - \\( 22 \\div 7 = 3 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\).\n   - This means we move 1 day forward from Friday.\n\n4. **Determine the Day**:\n   - Moving 1 day forward from Friday lands on Saturday.\n\nTherefore, January 23 will be a Saturday.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Saturday>>>"
