    "To determine what day of the week it will be in 95 days from Tuesday, April 5, 2022, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the day of the week 95 days after a given date, which is Tuesday, April 5, 2022.\n\n2. **Days of the Week Cycle**: The days of the week cycle every 7 days. This means that every 7 days, the same day of the week repeats.\n\n3. **Calculate Full Weeks**: First, determine how many full weeks are in 95 days. This is done by dividing 95 by 7.\n   \\[\n   95 \\div 7 = 13 \\text{ full weeks with a remainder of } 4 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Day of the Week**: Since 95 days is 13 full weeks plus 4 additional days, we need to find the day of the week 4 days after Tuesday.\n\n5. **Count Forward from Tuesday**:\n   - 1 day after Tuesday is Wednesday.\n   - 2 days after Tuesday is Thursday.\n   - 3 days after Tuesday is Friday.\n   - 4 days after Tuesday is Saturday.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, 95 days from Tuesday, April 5, 2022, will be a Saturday.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<Saturday>>>"
