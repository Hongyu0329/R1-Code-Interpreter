    "To determine if the year 2065 is a leap year, we need to follow the rules for identifying leap years in the Gregorian calendar. Here are the steps and careful points to consider:\n\n1. **Divisibility by 4**: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4. This is the first condition to check.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 100**: If a year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, even if it is divisible by 4. This is an exception to the first rule.\n\n3. **Divisibility by 400**: If a year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year, even if it is divisible by 100. This is an exception to the second rule.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the year 2065:\n\n- **Step 1**: Check if 2065 is divisible by 4.\n  - 2065 รท 4 = 516.25\n  - Since 2065 is not divisible by 4 (it does not result in a whole number), it does not satisfy the first condition for being a leap year.\n\n- **Step 2**: Since 2065 is not divisible by 4, we do not need to check the divisibility by 100 or 400. The year 2065 cannot be a leap year because it fails the first condition.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the year 2065 is not a leap year.\n\n<<<No>>>"
