    "To determine the weekday of April 3 in a year where January 1st is a Monday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given that January 1st is a Monday. We need to find out what day of the week April 3rd falls on in the same year.\n\n2. **Count the Days in Each Month**: \n   - January has 31 days.\n   - February typically has 28 days (since no leap year is mentioned, we assume it's a common year).\n   - March has 31 days.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Days from January 1st to April 3rd**:\n   - Days in January: 31\n   - Days in February: 28\n   - Days in March: 31\n   - Days in April up to April 3rd: 3\n\n4. **Sum the Days**:\n   - Total days from January 1st to April 3rd = 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 3 (April) = 93 days.\n\n5. **Determine the Weekday**:\n   - Since January 1st is a Monday, we need to find the weekday 93 days later.\n   - We calculate the number of weeks and the remaining days: 93 days รท 7 days/week = 13 weeks and 2 days.\n   - 13 weeks will bring us back to the same weekday, which is Monday.\n   - Adding 2 more days to Monday gives us Wednesday.\n\nTherefore, April 3rd falls on a Wednesday.\n\n<<<Wednesday>>>"
