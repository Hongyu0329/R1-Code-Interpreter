    "To determine which weekday occurs on March 6, given that January 1 fell on a Monday, we need to calculate the number of days between January 1 and March 6 and then determine the weekday based on this count.\n\n1. **Identify the number of days in each month:**\n   - January has 31 days.\n   - February typically has 28 days, but 29 days in a leap year.\n   - March has 31 days.\n\n2. **Determine if the year is a leap year:**\n   - Since the problem does not specify whether it is a leap year, we will assume it is a common year with February having 28 days.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of days from January 1 to March 6:**\n   - Days in January: 31 days\n   - Days in February: 28 days\n   - Days in March up to March 6: 6 days\n\n   Total days = 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 6 (March) = 65 days\n\n4. **Determine the weekday for March 6:**\n   - January 1 is a Monday.\n   - We need to find the weekday 65 days after January 1.\n   - To find the weekday, calculate the remainder when 65 is divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n\n   65 รท 7 = 9 weeks and 2 days remainder.\n\n   - Starting from Monday, 2 days later is Wednesday.\n\nTherefore, March 6 falls on a Wednesday.\n\n<<<Wednesday>>>"
