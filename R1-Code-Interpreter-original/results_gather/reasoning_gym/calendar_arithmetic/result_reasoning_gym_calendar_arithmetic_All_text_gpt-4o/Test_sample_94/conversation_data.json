    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of Fridays between two specific dates: Monday, January 31, 2022, and Thursday, April 14, 2022, inclusive. Let's break down the steps to find the solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Dates:**\n   - Start Date: Monday, January 31, 2022\n   - End Date: Thursday, April 14, 2022\n\n2. **Determine the Day of the Week for the Start Date:**\n   - January 31, 2022, is a Monday.\n\n3. **Determine the Day of the Week for the End Date:**\n   - April 14, 2022, is a Thursday.\n\n4. **Count the Total Number of Days Between the Two Dates:**\n   - Calculate the number of days from January 31 to April 14, inclusive.\n   - January 31 to February 28 (28 days in February 2022, as it is not a leap year) = 28 days\n   - March 1 to March 31 = 31 days\n   - April 1 to April 14 = 14 days\n   - Total days = 28 + 31 + 14 = 73 days\n\n5. **Calculate the Number of Complete Weeks:**\n   - A week consists of 7 days.\n   - Total complete weeks = 73 days / 7 days per week = 10 weeks and 3 days\n\n6. **Determine the Number of Fridays:**\n   - Each complete week contains exactly one Friday.\n   - Therefore, in 10 complete weeks, there are 10 Fridays.\n\n7. **Check the Remaining Days for Additional Fridays:**\n   - After accounting for 10 complete weeks, there are 3 additional days.\n   - Since the start date is a Monday, the sequence of days for the remaining 3 days is: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\n   - There is no Friday in these 3 days.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The total number of Fridays from January 31, 2022, to April 14, 2022, inclusive, is 10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10>>>"
