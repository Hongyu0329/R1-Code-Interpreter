    "To determine if the year 2121 is a leap year, we need to follow the rules for identifying leap years in the Gregorian calendar. Here are the steps and careful points to consider:\n\n1. **Basic Rule for Leap Years**: A year is a leap year if:\n   - It is divisible by 4.\n   - However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless:\n   - The year is also divisible by 400, in which case it is a leap year.\n\n2. **Apply the Rule to 2121**:\n   - **Divisibility by 4**: Check if 2121 is divisible by 4. \n     - Calculation: 2121 รท 4 = 530.25. Since 530.25 is not an integer, 2121 is not divisible by 4.\n   - Since 2121 is not divisible by 4, it cannot be a leap year. There is no need to check further conditions (divisibility by 100 or 400).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Based on the above analysis, since 2121 is not divisible by 4, it does not satisfy the basic requirement for being a leap year.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
