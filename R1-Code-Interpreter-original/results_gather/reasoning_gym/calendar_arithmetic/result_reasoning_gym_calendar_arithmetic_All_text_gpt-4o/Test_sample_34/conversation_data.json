    "To determine which weekday falls after a 32-day jump starting from Saturday, May 14, 2022, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Starting Day**: \n   - The starting day is Saturday, May 14, 2022.\n\n2. **Understand the Weekday Cycle**:\n   - A week consists of 7 days: Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Complete Weeks in 32 Days**:\n   - Divide 32 by 7 (the number of days in a week) to find the number of complete weeks and the remainder.\n   - 32 รท 7 = 4 weeks with a remainder of 4 days.\n\n4. **Determine the Day After 32 Days**:\n   - Since 32 days include 4 complete weeks, the weekday will be the same as the starting day after 28 days (4 weeks).\n   - Starting from Saturday, after 28 days, it will again be Saturday.\n   - Now, account for the remaining 4 days:\n     - Day 1: Sunday\n     - Day 2: Monday\n     - Day 3: Tuesday\n     - Day 4: Wednesday\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - After a 32-day jump from Saturday, the weekday will be Wednesday.\n\nTherefore, the weekday that falls after a 32-day jump from Saturday, May 14, 2022, is:\n\n<<<Wednesday>>>"
