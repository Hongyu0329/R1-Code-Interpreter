    "To determine the day of the week for September 18, 2022, we can use a step-by-step approach. One common method is to use Zeller's Congruence, a formula devised to calculate the day of the week for any given date. Here's how we can apply it:\n\n1. **Identify the Components:**\n   - Year: 2022\n   - Month: September (9th month)\n   - Day: 18\n\n2. **Adjust the Month and Year:**\n   - In Zeller's Congruence, January and February are considered as months 13 and 14 of the previous year. Since September is the 9th month, we don't need to adjust the year.\n\n3. **Apply Zeller's Congruence Formula:**\n   - The formula is: \n     \\[\n     h = \\left(q + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13(m + 1)}{5} \\right\\rfloor + K + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{K}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{J}{4} \\right\\rfloor - 2J \\right) \\mod 7\n     \\]\n   - Where:\n     - \\( h \\) is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n     - \\( q \\) is the day of the month\n     - \\( m \\) is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 12 = December; January and February are 13 and 14 of the previous year)\n     - \\( K \\) is the year of the century (year \\% 100)\n     - \\( J \\) is the zero-based century (year // 100)\n\n4. **Substitute the Values:**\n   - For September 18, 2022:\n     - \\( q = 18 \\)\n     - \\( m = 9 \\)\n     - \\( K = 22 \\) (2022 \\% 100)\n     - \\( J = 20 \\) (2022 // 100)\n\n5. **Calculate Each Component:**\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{13(m + 1)}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13 \\times 10}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 26 \\right\\rfloor = 26\\)\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{K}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{22}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 5.5 \\right\\rfloor = 5\\)\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{J}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 5 \\right\\rfloor = 5\\)\n\n6. **Plug into the Formula:**\n   - \\( h = (18 + 26 + 22 + 5 + 5 - 2 \\times 20) \\mod 7 \\)\n   - \\( h = (76 - 40) \\mod 7 \\)\n   - \\( h = 36 \\mod 7 \\)\n   - \\( h = 1 \\)\n\n7. **Determine the Day of the Week:**\n   - According to Zeller's Congruence, \\( h = 1 \\) corresponds to Sunday.\n\nTherefore, the day of the week for September 18, 2022, was Sunday.\n\n<<<Sunday>>>"
