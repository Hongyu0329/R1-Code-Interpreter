    "To determine the weekday on which October 4, 2022, fell, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the weekday for a specific date, October 4, 2022.\n\n2. **Choose a Method**: There are several methods to find the day of the week for a given date, such as using Zeller's Congruence, the Doomsday Algorithm, or simply counting days from a known reference date. Here, we'll use a straightforward approach by counting from a known reference date.\n\n3. **Select a Reference Date**: A common reference date is January 1, 2000, which was a Saturday. This is a well-known date and can be used to calculate the day of the week for other dates.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Days Between the Reference Date and the Target Date**:\n   - **From January 1, 2000, to January 1, 2022**: \n     - Count the number of years: 2022 - 2000 = 22 years.\n     - Calculate the number of leap years in this period. Leap years are divisible by 4, except for years divisible by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400. The leap years from 2000 to 2021 are 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020, totaling 6 leap years.\n     - Calculate the total number of days: (22 years * 365 days) + 6 leap days = 8030 days.\n\n   - **From January 1, 2022, to October 4, 2022**:\n     - Count the days in each month from January to September, and then add the days in October up to the 4th:\n       - January: 31 days\n       - February: 28 days (2022 is not a leap year)\n       - March: 31 days\n       - April: 30 days\n       - May: 31 days\n       - June: 30 days\n       - July: 31 days\n       - August: 31 days\n       - September: 30 days\n       - October: 4 days\n     - Total days from January 1 to October 4, 2022: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 4 = 277 days.\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Number of Days from the Reference Date to the Target Date**:\n   - Total days from January 1, 2000, to October 4, 2022: 8030 + 277 = 8307 days.\n\n6. **Determine the Day of the Week**:\n   - Since January 1, 2000, was a Saturday, we can find the day of the week for October 4, 2022, by calculating the remainder when the total number of days (8307) is divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n   - 8307 รท 7 = 1186 weeks and 5 days remainder.\n   - Starting from Saturday, count 5 days forward: Saturday (0), Sunday (1), Monday (2), Tuesday (3), Wednesday (4), Thursday (5).\n\nTherefore, October 4, 2022, fell on a Tuesday.\n\n<<<Tuesday>>>"
