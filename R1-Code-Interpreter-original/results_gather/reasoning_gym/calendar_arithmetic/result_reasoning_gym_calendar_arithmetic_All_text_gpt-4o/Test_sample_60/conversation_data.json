    "To determine the day of the month for the last Friday in September 2022, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Month and Year**: We are dealing with September 2022. September has 30 days.\n\n2. **Identify the Last Day of the Month**: The last day of September 2022 is September 30th.\n\n3. **Determine the Day of the Week for the Last Day**: We need to find out what day of the week September 30, 2022, falls on. \n\n4. **Calculate the Day of the Week**: \n   - September 1, 2022, was a Thursday. \n   - Therefore, September 30, 2022, is a Friday. This is because there are 30 days in September, and 30 days after a Thursday is a Friday (since 30 mod 7 = 2, and two days after Thursday is Saturday, then Sunday, then Monday, etc., until Friday).\n\n5. **Identify the Last Friday**: Since September 30, 2022, is a Friday, it is the last Friday of the month.\n\n6. **Output the Day of the Month**: The day of the month for the last Friday in September 2022 is the 30th.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<30>>>"
