    "To determine the day of the week for a given date, we can use a known algorithm such as Zeller's Congruence or the Doomsday algorithm. Here, I'll use a straightforward approach to find the day of the week for 08/12/2022 (in MM/DD/YYYY format).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Date Components:**\n   - Month: August (08)\n   - Day: 12\n   - Year: 2022\n\n2. **Adjust the Month and Year:**\n   - For Zeller's Congruence, January and February are considered as months 13 and 14 of the previous year. However, since August is neither January nor February, we don't need to adjust the month or year.\n\n3. **Zeller's Congruence Formula:**\n   - The formula to find the day of the week is:\n     \\[\n     h = \\left(q + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13(m + 1)}{5} \\right\\rfloor + K + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{K}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{J}{4} \\right\\rfloor - 2J \\right) \\mod 7\n     \\]\n   - Where:\n     - \\( h \\) is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n     - \\( q \\) is the day of the month\n     - \\( m \\) is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 12 = December; January and February are 13 and 14 of the previous year)\n     - \\( K \\) is the year of the century (year \\% 100)\n     - \\( J \\) is the zero-based century (year // 100)\n\n4. **Plug in the Values:**\n   - \\( q = 12 \\)\n   - \\( m = 8 \\) (August)\n   - \\( K = 22 \\) (2022 \\% 100)\n   - \\( J = 20 \\) (2022 // 100)\n\n5. **Calculate Each Component:**\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{13(m + 1)}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13 \\times 9}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 23.4 \\right\\rfloor = 23\\)\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{K}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{22}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 5.5 \\right\\rfloor = 5\\)\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{J}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 5\\)\n\n6. **Calculate \\( h \\):**\n   - \\( h = (12 + 23 + 22 + 5 + 5 - 2 \\times 20) \\mod 7 \\)\n   - \\( h = (67 - 40) \\mod 7 \\)\n   - \\( h = 27 \\mod 7 \\)\n   - \\( h = 6 \\)\n\n7. **Determine the Day of the Week:**\n   - According to Zeller's Congruence, \\( h = 6 \\) corresponds to Friday.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe day of the week for 08/12/2022 is Friday.\n\n<<<answer>>>Friday"
