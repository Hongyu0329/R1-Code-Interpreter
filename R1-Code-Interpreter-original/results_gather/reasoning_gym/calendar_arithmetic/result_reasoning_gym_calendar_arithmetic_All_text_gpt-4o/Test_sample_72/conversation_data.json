    "To determine which weekday it was 99 days before Sunday, April 24, 2022, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Day of the Week for the Given Date:**\n   - We are given that April 24, 2022, is a Sunday.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Weeks and Remaining Days:**\n   - We need to find the weekday 99 days before this date.\n   - First, calculate how many full weeks are in 99 days: \n     \\[\n     99 \\div 7 = 14 \\text{ weeks and } 1 \\text{ day}\n     \\]\n   - This means 99 days is equivalent to 14 weeks and 1 additional day.\n\n3. **Determine the Day of the Week 99 Days Before:**\n   - Since 14 weeks is a complete cycle of weeks, it will bring us back to the same day of the week, which is Sunday.\n   - We then need to go back 1 more day to account for the additional day.\n   - Going back 1 day from Sunday takes us to Saturday.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, 99 days before Sunday, April 24, 2022, was a Saturday.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Saturday>>>"
