    "To determine the day of the week for a given date, we can use a known algorithm such as Zeller's Congruence or the Doomsday algorithm. Here, I'll use a straightforward approach to find the day of the week for December 7, 2022.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Date Components:**\n   - Day: 7\n   - Month: December (12)\n   - Year: 2022\n\n2. **Zeller's Congruence Formula:**\n   Zeller's Congruence is a formula to calculate the day of the week for any given date. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   h = \\left(q + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13(m + 1)}{5} \\right\\rfloor + K + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{K}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{J}{4} \\right\\rfloor - 2J \\right) \\mod 7\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( h \\) is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n   - \\( q \\) is the day of the month\n   - \\( m \\) is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 12 = December; January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year)\n   - \\( K \\) is the year of the century (\\( \\text{year} \\mod 100 \\))\n   - \\( J \\) is the zero-based century (\\( \\text{year} / 100 \\))\n\n3. **Adjust the Month and Year:**\n   Since December is the 12th month, we use \\( m = 12 \\). The year remains 2022, so:\n   - \\( K = 22 \\) (2022 mod 100)\n   - \\( J = 20 \\) (2022 divided by 100)\n\n4. **Plug Values into the Formula:**\n   \\[\n   h = \\left(7 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13(12 + 1)}{5} \\right\\rfloor + 22 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{22}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{4} \\right\\rfloor - 2 \\times 20 \\right) \\mod 7\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Each Component:**\n   - \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13 \\times 13}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{169}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 33 \\)\n   - \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{22}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 5 \\)\n   - \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 5 \\)\n\n6. **Substitute and Simplify:**\n   \\[\n   h = (7 + 33 + 22 + 5 + 5 - 40) \\mod 7\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h = (32) \\mod 7\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h = 4\n   \\]\n\n7. **Determine the Day of the Week:**\n   According to Zeller's Congruence, \\( h = 4 \\) corresponds to Wednesday.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe day of the week for 12/07/2022 is Wednesday.\n\n<<<Wednesday>>>"
