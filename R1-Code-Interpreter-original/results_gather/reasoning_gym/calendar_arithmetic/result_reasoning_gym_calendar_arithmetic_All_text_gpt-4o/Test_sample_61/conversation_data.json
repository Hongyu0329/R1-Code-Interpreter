    "To determine whether the year 2048 is a leap year, we need to follow the rules for identifying leap years in the Gregorian calendar. Here are the steps and careful points to consider:\n\n1. **Divisibility by 4**: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4. This is the first and most basic rule. If a year is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 100**: If a year is divisible by 4, we then check if it is divisible by 100. If it is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless it also meets the next condition.\n\n3. **Divisibility by 400**: If a year is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be considered a leap year. This rule is what makes the year 2000 a leap year, but not the year 1900.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the year 2048:\n\n- **Step 1**: Check if 2048 is divisible by 4.\n  - Calculation: 2048 รท 4 = 512\n  - Since 2048 is divisible by 4, it passes the first test.\n\n- **Step 2**: Check if 2048 is divisible by 100.\n  - Calculation: 2048 รท 100 = 20.48\n  - Since 2048 is not divisible by 100 (it does not result in a whole number), we do not need to check the divisibility by 400. The year 2048 is not a century year, so it does not need to meet the additional condition of being divisible by 400.\n\nSince 2048 is divisible by 4 and not a century year, it satisfies the conditions to be a leap year.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
