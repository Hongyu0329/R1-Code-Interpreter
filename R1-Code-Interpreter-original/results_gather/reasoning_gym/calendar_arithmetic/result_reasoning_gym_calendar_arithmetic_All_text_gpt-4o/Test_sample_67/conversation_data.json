    "To determine the date of the second Friday in July 2022, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the First Day of July 2022:**\n   - July 1, 2022, is a Friday. This is determined by checking a calendar or using a known reference point for the days of the week in 2022.\n\n2. **Determine the First Friday:**\n   - Since July 1, 2022, is a Friday, it is the first Friday of the month.\n\n3. **Calculate the Second Friday:**\n   - The second Friday will be one week after the first Friday. Therefore, we add 7 days to July 1, 2022.\n   - July 1 + 7 days = July 8, 2022.\n\n4. **Verify the Date:**\n   - Check that July 8, 2022, is indeed a Friday. This can be confirmed by counting the days of the week from July 1, 2022.\n\n5. **Check for Validity:**\n   - Since July 8, 2022, is a valid date and falls within the month of July, there is no need to return -1.\n\nBy following these steps, we determine that the second Friday of July 2022 is on the 8th.\n\nFinal answer: <<<8>>>"
