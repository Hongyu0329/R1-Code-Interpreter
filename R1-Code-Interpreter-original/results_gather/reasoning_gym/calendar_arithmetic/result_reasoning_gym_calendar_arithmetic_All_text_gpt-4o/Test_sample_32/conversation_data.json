    "To determine the day of the month for the last Thursday in February 2022, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of days in February 2022:**\n   - February typically has 28 days, but in a leap year, it has 29 days.\n   - 2022 is not a leap year (as it is not divisible by 4), so February 2022 has 28 days.\n\n2. **Determine the day of the week for February 28, 2022:**\n   - We need to find out what day of the week February 28, 2022, falls on.\n   - February 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. We can calculate the day of the week for February 28 by counting the days forward.\n   - February 1, 2022 (Tuesday) + 27 days = February 28, 2022.\n   - 27 days is equivalent to 3 weeks and 6 days.\n   - Starting from Tuesday, adding 6 days brings us to Monday.\n   - Therefore, February 28, 2022, is a Monday.\n\n3. **Find the last Thursday in February 2022:**\n   - Since February 28, 2022, is a Monday, the last Thursday before this date would be 4 days earlier.\n   - Counting back 4 days from February 28, we have:\n     - February 28 (Monday)\n     - February 27 (Sunday)\n     - February 26 (Saturday)\n     - February 25 (Friday)\n     - February 24 (Thursday)\n   - Therefore, the last Thursday in February 2022 is February 24.\n\n4. **Verify the result:**\n   - We have confirmed that February 24, 2022, is a Thursday, and it is the last Thursday of the month.\n\nThus, the day of the month for the last Thursday in February 2022 is 24.\n\nFinal answer: <<<24>>>"
