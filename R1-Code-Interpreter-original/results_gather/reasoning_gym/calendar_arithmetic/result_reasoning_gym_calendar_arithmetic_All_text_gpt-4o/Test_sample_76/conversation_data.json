    "To determine the day of the week for December 27, 2022, we can use the following step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Date Format**: The date given is December 27, 2022. This is in the format of Month-Day-Year.\n\n2. **Identify the Year**: The year is 2022. We need to determine if this is a leap year or not, as this affects the number of days in February.\n\n3. **Leap Year Check**: A year is a leap year if:\n   - It is divisible by 4.\n   - If it is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400.\n   - 2022 is not divisible by 4, so it is not a leap year.\n\n4. **Days in Each Month for 2022**:\n   - January: 31 days\n   - February: 28 days (since 2022 is not a leap year)\n   - March: 31 days\n   - April: 30 days\n   - May: 31 days\n   - June: 30 days\n   - July: 31 days\n   - August: 31 days\n   - September: 30 days\n   - October: 31 days\n   - November: 30 days\n   - December: 31 days\n\n5. **Calculate the Day of the Year for December 27, 2022**:\n   - Days from January to November: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 334 days\n   - Add 27 days of December: 334 + 27 = 361 days\n\n6. **Determine the Day of the Week**:\n   - We need to find the day of the week for the 361st day of 2022.\n   - January 1, 2022, was a Saturday.\n   - Calculate the number of days from January 1 to December 27, 2022, which is 360 days.\n   - Determine the day of the week by calculating the remainder when 360 is divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n   - 360 รท 7 = 51 weeks and 3 days remainder.\n\n7. **Find the Day of the Week**:\n   - Starting from Saturday (January 1, 2022), count 3 days forward:\n     - Saturday (Day 0)\n     - Sunday (Day 1)\n     - Monday (Day 2)\n     - Tuesday (Day 3)\n\nTherefore, December 27, 2022, was a Tuesday.\n\n<<<Tuesday>>>"
