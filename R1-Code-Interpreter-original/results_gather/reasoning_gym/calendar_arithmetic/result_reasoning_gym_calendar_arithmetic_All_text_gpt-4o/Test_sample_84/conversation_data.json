    "To determine whether the year 2112 is a leap year, we need to follow the rules for identifying leap years in the Gregorian calendar. Here are the steps and considerations:\n\n1. **Divisibility by 4**: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4. This is the first condition to check.\n   - Calculation: 2112 รท 4 = 528\n   - Since 2112 is divisible by 4, it passes the first test.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 100**: If a year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400. This rule is to account for the fact that the Earth does not orbit the sun in exactly 365.25 days.\n   - Calculation: 2112 รท 100 = 21.12\n   - Since 2112 is not divisible by 100, we do not need to apply the rule for divisibility by 400.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since 2112 is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, it satisfies the conditions for being a leap year.\n\nTherefore, based on the rules of the Gregorian calendar, the year 2112 is a leap year.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
