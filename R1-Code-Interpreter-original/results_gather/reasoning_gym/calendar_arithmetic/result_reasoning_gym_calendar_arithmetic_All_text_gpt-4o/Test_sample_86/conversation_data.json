    "To solve this problem, we need to count the weekdays (Monday through Friday) between two given dates, including both the start and end dates. The dates provided are from Sunday, November 20, 2022, to Tuesday, December 13, 2022.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Dates:**\n   - Start Date: Sunday, November 20, 2022\n   - End Date: Tuesday, December 13, 2022\n\n2. **Determine the Total Number of Days:**\n   - Calculate the total number of days between the start and end dates, inclusive.\n   - November 20 to November 30 is 11 days (including November 20).\n   - December 1 to December 13 is 13 days (including December 13).\n   - Total days = 11 (November) + 13 (December) = 24 days.\n\n3. **Identify the Weekdays:**\n   - Weekdays are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\n   - Weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\n4. **Count the Weekdays:**\n   - November 20, 2022, is a Sunday.\n   - The first weekday after November 20 is Monday, November 21, 2022.\n   - From November 21 to November 25, we have 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday).\n   - November 26 and 27 are a weekend (Saturday and Sunday).\n   - From November 28 to December 2, we have another 5 weekdays.\n   - December 3 and 4 are a weekend.\n   - From December 5 to December 9, we have another 5 weekdays.\n   - December 10 and 11 are a weekend.\n   - From December 12 to December 13, we have 2 weekdays (Monday and Tuesday).\n\n5. **Sum the Weekdays:**\n   - Weekdays from November 21 to November 25: 5 days\n   - Weekdays from November 28 to December 2: 5 days\n   - Weekdays from December 5 to December 9: 5 days\n   - Weekdays from December 12 to December 13: 2 days\n   - Total weekdays = 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 17 weekdays\n\nTherefore, the total number of weekdays from Sunday, November 20, 2022, to Tuesday, December 13, 2022, is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
