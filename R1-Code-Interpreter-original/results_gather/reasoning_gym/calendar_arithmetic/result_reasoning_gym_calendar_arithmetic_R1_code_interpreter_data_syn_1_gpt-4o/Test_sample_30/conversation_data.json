    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Sundays fall between the given dates, including both the start and end dates. The dates in question are from Wednesday, March 30, 2022, to Thursday, April 7, 2022.\n\n1. **Identify the days of the week for the given dates:**\n   - March 30, 2022, is a Wednesday.\n   - April 7, 2022, is a Thursday.\n\n2. **Determine the Sundays within this range:**\n   - The first Sunday after March 30, 2022, is April 3, 2022.\n   - We need to check if there are any more Sundays before April 7, 2022.\n\n3. **Count the Sundays:**\n   - We will count the Sundays from April 3, 2022, to April 7, 2022.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate the number of Sundays in this date range.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the start and end dates\nstart_date = datetime(2022, 3, 30)\nend_date = datetime(2022, 4, 7)\n\n# Initialize the count of Sundays\nsunday_count = 0\n\n# Iterate through each day in the date range\ncurrent_date = start_date\nwhile current_date <= end_date:\n    # Check if the current day is a Sunday (weekday() == 6)\n    if current_date.weekday() == 6:\n        sunday_count += 1\n    # Move to the next day\n    current_date += timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Output the count of Sundays\nprint(sunday_count)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the number of Sundays between the specified dates. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution indicates that there is 1 Sunday between March 30, 2022, and April 7, 2022, inclusive. The Sunday in this range is April 3, 2022.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    How many Sundays are there from Wednesday, March 30, 2022 to Thursday, April 7, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?
