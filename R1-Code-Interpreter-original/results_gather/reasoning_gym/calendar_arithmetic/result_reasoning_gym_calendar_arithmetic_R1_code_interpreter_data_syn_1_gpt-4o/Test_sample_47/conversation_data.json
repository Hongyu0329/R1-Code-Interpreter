    "To determine the day of the week for a given date, we can use Python's `datetime` module. This module provides a convenient way to handle dates and times, and it includes functionality to determine the day of the week for any given date.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Use the `datetime` module to create a date object for 08/12/2022.\n2. Use the `weekday()` method of the date object to get the day of the week as an integer (where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6).\n3. Map the integer to the corresponding weekday name.\n\nLet's write the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# Create a date object for 08/12/2022\ndate = datetime.datetime.strptime('08/12/2022', '%m/%d/%Y')\n\n# Get the day of the week as an integer\nday_of_week = date.weekday()\n\n# Map the integer to the corresponding weekday name\nweekdays = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']\nweekday_name = weekdays[day_of_week]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(weekday_name)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find out the day of the week for 08/12/2022.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned \"Friday\" as the day of the week for 08/12/2022. This means that December 8, 2022, falls on a Friday.\n\n<<<Friday>>>"
