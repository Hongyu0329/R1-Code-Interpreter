    "To determine the day of the week 59 days from Monday, May 23, 2022, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of weeks and the remaining days from 59 days.\n2. Since a week has 7 days, divide 59 by 7 to find out how many full weeks and extra days are there.\n3. Add the extra days to the current day of the week (Monday) to find the future day of the week.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Starting date\nstart_date = datetime(2022, 5, 23)\n\n# Number of days to add\ndays_to_add = 59\n\n# Calculate the future date\nfuture_date = start_date + timedelta(days=days_to_add)\n\n# Get the full weekday name\nfuture_weekday = future_date.strftime(\"%A\")\n\nprint(future_weekday)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the day of the week 59 days from the given date. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and determined that 59 days from Monday, May 23, 2022, falls on a Thursday. \n\nTherefore, the day of the week 59 days from May 23, 2022, is:\n\n<<<Thursday>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    If today is Monday, May 23, 2022, what day of the week will it be in 59 days?
