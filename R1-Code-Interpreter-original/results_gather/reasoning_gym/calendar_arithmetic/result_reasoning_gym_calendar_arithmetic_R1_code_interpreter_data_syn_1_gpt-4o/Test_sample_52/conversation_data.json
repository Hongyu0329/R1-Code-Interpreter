    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of business days (Monday to Friday) between two given dates, inclusive of both dates. The dates provided are Thursday, May 26, 2022, and Friday, September 2, 2022.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Date Range**: We need to consider all the days from May 26, 2022, to September 2, 2022.\n\n2. **Count Total Days**: Calculate the total number of days between these two dates, inclusive.\n\n3. **Count Business Days**: Out of the total days, count only the weekdays (Monday to Friday).\n\n4. **Exclude Weekends**: We need to exclude Saturdays and Sundays from the total count.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use Python's `datetime` module to iterate through each day in the date range and check if it is a weekday.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the start and end dates\nstart_date = datetime(2022, 5, 26)\nend_date = datetime(2022, 9, 2)\n\n# Initialize the count of business days\nbusiness_days_count = 0\n\n# Iterate through each day in the date range\ncurrent_date = start_date\nwhile current_date <= end_date:\n    # Check if the current day is a weekday (Monday=0, ..., Sunday=6)\n    if current_date.weekday() < 5:  # Monday to Friday are 0 to 4\n        business_days_count += 1\n    # Move to the next day\n    current_date += timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Output the count of business days\nprint(business_days_count)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of business days between the specified dates. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the number of business days between Thursday, May 26, 2022, and Friday, September 2, 2022, inclusive of both dates.\n\nThe number of business days is 72.\n\n<<<72>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Thursday, May 26, 2022 to Friday, September 2, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?
