    "To determine if 1982 is a leap year, we need to follow the rules for identifying leap years in the Gregorian calendar:\n\n1. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.\n2. However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless:\n3. The year is also divisible by 400, in which case it is a leap year.\n\nLet's apply these rules to the year 1982:\n\n- First, check if 1982 is divisible by 4.\n- If it is, then check if it is divisible by 100.\n- If it is divisible by 100, then check if it is divisible by 400.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these checks:\n\n```python\nyear = 1982\n\nif (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if 1982 is a leap year.",
    "The code execution indicates that 1982 is not a leap year. Based on the rules for determining leap years, 1982 is not divisible by 4, which means it does not meet the criteria for being a leap year.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
