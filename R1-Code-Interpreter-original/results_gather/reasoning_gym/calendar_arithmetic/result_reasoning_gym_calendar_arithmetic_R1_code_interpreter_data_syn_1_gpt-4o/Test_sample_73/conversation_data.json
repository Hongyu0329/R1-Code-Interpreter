    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of Sundays between two given dates: June 28, 2022, and September 10, 2022, inclusive. \n\n1. **Identify the start and end dates**: \n   - Start date: June 28, 2022\n   - End date: September 10, 2022\n\n2. **Determine the day of the week for the start date**: \n   - June 28, 2022, is a Tuesday.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of days between the start and end dates**: \n   - We will calculate the total number of days between these two dates.\n\n4. **Count the number of Sundays**: \n   - We will iterate over each day from the start date to the end date and count how many of those days are Sundays.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the start and end dates\nstart_date = datetime(2022, 6, 28)\nend_date = datetime(2022, 9, 10)\n\n# Initialize a counter for Sundays\nsunday_count = 0\n\n# Iterate over each day in the date range\ncurrent_date = start_date\nwhile current_date <= end_date:\n    # Check if the current day is a Sunday (weekday() == 6)\n    if current_date.weekday() == 6:\n        sunday_count += 1\n    # Move to the next day\n    current_date += timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Output the number of Sundays\nprint(sunday_count)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of Sundays between the specified dates. Let's execute it to find the answer.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    How many Sundays are there from Tuesday, June 28, 2022 to Saturday, September 10, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?
