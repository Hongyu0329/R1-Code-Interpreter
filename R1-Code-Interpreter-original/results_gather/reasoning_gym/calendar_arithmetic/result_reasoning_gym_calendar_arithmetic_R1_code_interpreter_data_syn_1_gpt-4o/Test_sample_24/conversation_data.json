    "To determine if the year 2065 is a leap year, we need to follow the rules for identifying leap years in the Gregorian calendar:\n\n1. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.\n2. However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless:\n3. The year is also divisible by 400, in which case it is a leap year.\n\nLet's apply these rules to the year 2065:\n\n- First, check if 2065 is divisible by 4.\n- If it is, then check if it is divisible by 100.\n- If it is divisible by 100, then check if it is divisible by 400.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these checks:\n\n```python\nyear = 2065\n\n# Check if the year is a leap year\nis_leap_year = (year % 4 == 0) and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Yes\" if is_leap_year else \"No\")\n```",
    "The code execution confirms that the year 2065 is not a leap year based on the rules of the Gregorian calendar. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Determine if the year 2065 is a leap year.
