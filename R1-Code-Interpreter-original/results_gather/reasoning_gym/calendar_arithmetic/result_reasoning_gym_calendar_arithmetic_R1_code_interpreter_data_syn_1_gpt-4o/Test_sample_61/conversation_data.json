    "To determine if the year 2048 is a leap year, we need to follow the rules for identifying leap years:\n\n1. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.\n2. However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless:\n3. The year is also divisible by 400, in which case it is a leap year.\n\nLet's apply these rules to the year 2048:\n\n- Check if 2048 is divisible by 4.\n- Check if 2048 is divisible by 100.\n- Check if 2048 is divisible by 400.\n\nI will write a Python script to perform these checks and determine if 2048 is a leap year.\n\n```python\nyear = 2048\n\nis_leap_year = (year % 4 == 0) and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\nprint(\"Yes\" if is_leap_year else \"No\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out if 2048 is a leap year.",
    "Based on the execution of the code, the year 2048 is indeed a leap year. The code checks the divisibility rules and confirms that 2048 meets the criteria for being a leap year.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
