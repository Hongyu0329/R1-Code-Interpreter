    "To determine the day of the week 78 days before Sunday, June 19, 2022, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of weeks and extra days in 78 days. Since a week has 7 days, we can divide 78 by 7 to find out how many full weeks and extra days are there.\n2. Subtract the extra days from the given day (Sunday) to find the day of the week 78 days ago.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given information\ncurrent_day = \"Sunday\"\ndays_ago = 78\n\n# Days of the week in order\ndays_of_week = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\"]\n\n# Find the index of the current day\ncurrent_index = days_of_week.index(current_day)\n\n# Calculate the index of the day 78 days ago\ndays_ago_index = (current_index - days_ago) % 7\n\n# Find the day of the week 78 days ago\nday_78_days_ago = days_of_week[days_ago_index]\n\nprint(day_78_days_ago)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the day of the week 78 days ago.",
    "The code execution output indicates that 78 days before Sunday, June 19, 2022, was a Saturday. The calculation involved determining the number of weeks and extra days in 78 days and then using this information to find the corresponding day of the week.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Saturday>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    If today is Sunday, June 19, 2022, what day of the week was it 78 days ago?
