    "To solve this problem, we need to count backward 51 days from a given date, which is Tuesday, April 19, 2022. We are interested in finding out what day of the week it will be.\n\n1. **Identify the starting point**: We know that April 19, 2022, is a Tuesday.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of weeks and remaining days**: \n   - 51 days can be broken down into weeks and days. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 51 by 7 to find out how many full weeks and extra days there are.\n\n3. **Determine the day of the week**: \n   - Subtract the number of full weeks from the starting day, and then adjust for the remaining days to find the final day of the week.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Starting date\nstart_date = datetime(2022, 4, 19)\n\n# Number of days to count backward\ndays_to_subtract = 51\n\n# Calculate the new date\nnew_date = start_date - timedelta(days=days_to_subtract)\n\n# Get the day of the week\nday_of_week = new_date.strftime(\"%A\")\n\nprint(day_of_week)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the day of the week 51 days before April 19, 2022. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and determined that 51 days before Tuesday, April 19, 2022, falls on a Sunday. \n\nTherefore, the day of the week is:\n\n<<<Sunday>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Count backward 51 days from Tuesday, April 19, 2022 - what's the weekday?
