    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Sundays fall between the two given dates, including both the start and end dates.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Dates**: \n   - Start Date: Saturday, August 6, 2022\n   - End Date: Friday, September 9, 2022\n\n2. **Determine the Day of the Week for the Start Date**: \n   - August 6, 2022, is a Saturday.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Days Between the Two Dates**: \n   - We need to count the number of days from August 6, 2022, to September 9, 2022, inclusive.\n\n4. **Count the Number of Sundays**: \n   - Starting from the first Sunday after August 6, 2022, count every 7th day until September 9, 2022.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the start and end dates\nstart_date = datetime(2022, 8, 6)\nend_date = datetime(2022, 9, 9)\n\n# Find the first Sunday on or after the start date\ncurrent_date = start_date\nwhile current_date.weekday() != 6:  # 6 corresponds to Sunday\n    current_date += timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Count the number of Sundays until the end date\nsunday_count = 0\nwhile current_date <= end_date:\n    sunday_count += 1\n    current_date += timedelta(days=7)\n\nprint(sunday_count)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of Sundays between the given dates. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 5 Sundays between Saturday, August 6, 2022, and Friday, September 9, 2022, inclusive. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
