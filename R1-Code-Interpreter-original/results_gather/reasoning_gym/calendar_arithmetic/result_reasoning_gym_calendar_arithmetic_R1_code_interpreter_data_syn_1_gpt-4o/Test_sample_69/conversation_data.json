    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of Wednesdays between two specific dates: April 10, 2022, and June 18, 2022, inclusive. \n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Dates**: We have the start date as April 10, 2022, and the end date as June 18, 2022.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Each Day**: We will iterate over each day from the start date to the end date.\n\n3. **Check for Wednesdays**: For each day, we will check if it is a Wednesday.\n\n4. **Count Wednesdays**: We will maintain a counter to count how many Wednesdays occur in this period.\n\n5. **Return the Count**: Finally, we will return the count of Wednesdays.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the answer.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the start and end dates\nstart_date = datetime(2022, 4, 10)\nend_date = datetime(2022, 6, 18)\n\n# Initialize the counter for Wednesdays\nwednesday_count = 0\n\n# Iterate over each day in the date range\ncurrent_date = start_date\nwhile current_date <= end_date:\n    # Check if the current day is a Wednesday (weekday() == 2)\n    if current_date.weekday() == 2:\n        wednesday_count += 1\n    # Move to the next day\n    current_date += timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Output the count of Wednesdays\nprint(wednesday_count)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of Wednesdays between the given dates. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the number of Wednesdays between April 10, 2022, and June 18, 2022, inclusive. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<10>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Count the occurrences of Wednesday from Sunday, April 10 to Saturday, June 18, 2022 (including both start and end dates).
