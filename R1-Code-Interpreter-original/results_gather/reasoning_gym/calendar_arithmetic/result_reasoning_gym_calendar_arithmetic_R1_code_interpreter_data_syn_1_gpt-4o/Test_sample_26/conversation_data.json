    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Saturdays fall between the two given dates, including both endpoints. The approach involves:\n\n1. Identifying the day of the week for the start date (April 11, 2022).\n2. Identifying the day of the week for the end date (May 7, 2022).\n3. Counting the number of Saturdays between these two dates.\n\nWe can use Python's `datetime` module to facilitate this process. The `datetime` module allows us to easily find the day of the week for any given date and to iterate through the dates to count the Saturdays.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the start and end dates\nstart_date = datetime(2022, 4, 11)\nend_date = datetime(2022, 5, 7)\n\n# Initialize a counter for Saturdays\nsaturday_count = 0\n\n# Iterate through each day in the date range\ncurrent_date = start_date\nwhile current_date <= end_date:\n    # Check if the current day is a Saturday (5 represents Saturday)\n    if current_date.weekday() == 5:\n        saturday_count += 1\n    # Move to the next day\n    current_date += timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Output the total number of Saturdays\nprint(saturday_count)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the number of Saturdays between the specified dates. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 4 Saturdays between Monday, April 11, 2022, and Saturday, May 7, 2022, inclusive. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
