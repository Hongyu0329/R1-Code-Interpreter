    "To determine the weekday 88 days before Thursday, October 6, 2022, we can use Python's `datetime` module. This module allows us to perform date arithmetic easily. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Start with the given date: October 6, 2022.\n2. Subtract 88 days from this date.\n3. Determine the weekday of the resulting date.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Given date\nstart_date = datetime(2022, 10, 6)\n\n# Subtract 88 days\ndays_to_subtract = 88\nnew_date = start_date - timedelta(days=days_to_subtract)\n\n# Get the weekday name\nweekday_name = new_date.strftime(\"%A\")\n\nprint(weekday_name)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the date 88 days before October 6, 2022, and then determine the weekday name of that date. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and determined that 88 days before Thursday, October 6, 2022, was a Sunday.\n\n<<<Sunday>>>"
