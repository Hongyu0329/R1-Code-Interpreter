    "To determine the weekday for February 21, 2022, we can use Python's `datetime` module, which provides a straightforward way to handle dates and times. The `weekday()` function from this module returns the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6. We can then map this integer to the corresponding weekday name.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the weekday for February 21, 2022.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# Define the date\ndate = datetime.date(2022, 2, 21)\n\n# Get the weekday as an integer\nweekday_number = date.weekday()\n\n# Map the integer to the weekday name\nweekdays = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\"]\nweekday_name = weekdays[weekday_number]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(weekday_name)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output \"Monday\". This means that February 21, 2022, fell on a Monday.\n\n<<<Monday>>>"
