    "To determine the weekday for October 4, 2022, we can use Python's `datetime` module, which provides a straightforward way to handle dates and calculate the day of the week. The `weekday()` function returns the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6. We can then map this integer to the corresponding weekday name.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the weekday for October 4, 2022.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# Define the date\ndate = datetime.date(2022, 10, 4)\n\n# Get the weekday as an integer\nweekday_index = date.weekday()\n\n# Map the integer to the weekday name\nweekdays = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\"]\nweekday_name = weekdays[weekday_index]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(weekday_name)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the weekday.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned \"Tuesday\" as the output. This means that October 4, 2022, fell on a Tuesday.\n\n<<<Tuesday>>>"
