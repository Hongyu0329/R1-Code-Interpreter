    "To determine the weekday of April 9 in a year where January 1st is a Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of days from January 1st to April 9th and then find the weekday that corresponds to that number of days.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of days from January 1st to April 9th:**\n   - January has 31 days.\n   - February typically has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - April 9th is 9 days into April.\n\n2. **Total number of days from January 1st to April 9th:**\n   - Days in January: 31\n   - Days in February: 28\n   - Days in March: 31\n   - Days in April: 9\n\n3. **Sum these days to get the total number of days from January 1st to April 9th.**\n\n4. **Determine the weekday:**\n   - Since January 1st is a Wednesday, we can calculate the weekday by finding the remainder when the total number of days is divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Days in each month from January to April\ndays_in_january = 31\ndays_in_february = 28\ndays_in_march = 31\ndays_in_april = 9\n\n# Total days from January 1st to April 9th\ntotal_days = days_in_january + days_in_february + days_in_march + days_in_april\n\n# Weekdays list starting with Wednesday as January 1st\nweekdays = [\"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\", \"Monday\", \"Tuesday\"]\n\n# Calculate the weekday of April 9th\nweekday_index = total_days % 7\nweekday_of_april_9 = weekdays[weekday_index]\n\nprint(weekday_of_april_9)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the weekday of April 9th.",
    "The code execution output indicates that April 9th falls on a Thursday in a year where January 1st is a Wednesday. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Thursday>>>"
