    "To determine the date of the last Tuesday in March 2022, we need to identify all the Tuesdays in that month and then select the last one.\n\nMarch 2022 starts on a Tuesday, and it has 31 days. We can calculate the dates of all Tuesdays in March 2022 by starting from the first Tuesday and adding 7 days repeatedly until we exceed the number of days in the month.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the last Tuesday in March 2022.\n\n```python\nimport calendar\n\n# March 2022\nyear = 2022\nmonth = 3\n\n# Find all Tuesdays in March 2022\ntuesdays = [day for day in range(1, 32) if calendar.weekday(year, month, day) == calendar.TUESDAY]\n\n# Get the last Tuesday\nlast_tuesday = tuesdays[-1] if tuesdays else -1\n\nprint(last_tuesday)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the last Tuesday in March 2022 by iterating over all days in the month and checking if they are Tuesdays. The last Tuesday is then selected from the list of Tuesdays. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `29`, which indicates that the last Tuesday in March 2022 is on the 29th. \n\nTherefore, the date of the event that recurs on the last Tuesday of March 2022 is the 29th.\n\n<<<29>>>"
