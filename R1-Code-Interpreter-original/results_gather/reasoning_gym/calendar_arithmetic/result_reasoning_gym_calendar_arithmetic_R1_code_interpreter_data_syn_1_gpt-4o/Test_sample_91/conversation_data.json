    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the day of the week that falls 99 days after Tuesday, May 3, 2022. \n\n1. **Identify the starting day**: We know that May 3, 2022, is a Tuesday.\n2. **Calculate the day of the week after 99 days**: \n   - A week has 7 days, so we can find the remainder of 99 divided by 7 to determine how many days beyond complete weeks we need to count.\n   - The remainder will tell us how many days to count forward from Tuesday.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Starting day is Tuesday\nstarting_day = \"Tuesday\"\n\n# Days of the week in order\ndays_of_week = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\"]\n\n# Find the index of the starting day\nstart_index = days_of_week.index(starting_day)\n\n# Number of days to jump\ndays_to_jump = 99\n\n# Calculate the index of the new day\nnew_index = (start_index + days_to_jump) % 7\n\n# Find the new day\nnew_day = days_of_week[new_index]\n\nprint(new_day)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the day of the week that falls 99 days after Tuesday, May 3, 2022.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the day of the week that falls 99 days after Tuesday, May 3, 2022. The calculation involves finding the remainder of 99 divided by 7, which gives us the number of days to count forward from Tuesday.\n\nThe result is:\n\n<<<Wednesday>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Starting from Tuesday, May 3, 2022, which weekday falls after a 99-day jump?
