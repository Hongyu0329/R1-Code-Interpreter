    "To determine the weekday 99 days before Sunday, April 24, 2022, we can use Python's `datetime` module. This module allows us to perform date arithmetic easily. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Convert the given date (April 24, 2022) into a `datetime` object.\n2. Subtract 99 days from this date using a `timedelta` object.\n3. Determine the weekday of the resulting date.\n4. Output the full name of the weekday.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Given date\nstart_date = datetime(2022, 4, 24)\n\n# Subtract 99 days\ndays_to_subtract = timedelta(days=99)\nnew_date = start_date - days_to_subtract\n\n# Get the full weekday name\nweekday_name = new_date.strftime(\"%A\")\n\nprint(weekday_name)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that 99 days before Sunday, April 24, 2022, was a Saturday.\n\n<<<Saturday>>>"
