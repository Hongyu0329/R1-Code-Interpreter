    "To determine the weekday 34 days before Sunday, October 23, 2022, we need to calculate the date 34 days prior and then find out what day of the week that date falls on.\n\n1. **Identify the starting date**: October 23, 2022, is a Sunday.\n2. **Calculate the date 34 days before**: We need to subtract 34 days from October 23, 2022.\n3. **Determine the weekday of the resulting date**: Once we have the date, we can find out the weekday.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Starting date\nstart_date = datetime(2022, 10, 23)\n\n# Subtract 34 days\ntarget_date = start_date - timedelta(days=34)\n\n# Get the full name of the weekday\nweekday_name = target_date.strftime('%A')\n\nprint(weekday_name)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the date 34 days before October 23, 2022, and then determine the weekday of that date. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution shows that 34 days before Sunday, October 23, 2022, was a Monday. \n\nTherefore, the full name of the weekday 34 days before October 23, 2022, is:\n\n<<<Monday>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Starting from Sunday, October 23, 2022, which weekday was it 34 days before?
