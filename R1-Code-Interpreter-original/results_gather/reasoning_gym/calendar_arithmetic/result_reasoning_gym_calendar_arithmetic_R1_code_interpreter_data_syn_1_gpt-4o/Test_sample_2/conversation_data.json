    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of Mondays between two specific dates: July 2, 2022, and September 14, 2022, inclusive. \n\n1. **Identify the day of the week for the start date (July 2, 2022):** \n   - July 2, 2022, is a Saturday.\n\n2. **Identify the day of the week for the end date (September 14, 2022):**\n   - September 14, 2022, is a Wednesday.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of days between the two dates:**\n   - We will calculate the total number of days between July 2, 2022, and September 14, 2022, inclusive.\n\n4. **Determine the number of Mondays:**\n   - We will iterate through each day between the start and end dates and count how many of those days are Mondays.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the start and end dates\nstart_date = datetime(2022, 7, 2)\nend_date = datetime(2022, 9, 14)\n\n# Initialize a counter for Mondays\nmonday_count = 0\n\n# Iterate through each day in the date range\ncurrent_date = start_date\nwhile current_date <= end_date:\n    # Check if the current day is a Monday (0 = Monday, 6 = Sunday)\n    if current_date.weekday() == 0:\n        monday_count += 1\n    # Move to the next day\n    current_date += timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Output the number of Mondays\nprint(monday_count)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of Mondays between the given dates. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the number of Mondays between July 2, 2022, and September 14, 2022, inclusive. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<11>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    How many Mondays are there from Saturday, July 2, 2022 to Wednesday, September 14, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?
