    "To solve this problem, we need to count backward 76 days from a given date, which is Saturday, July 2, 2022. We are tasked with finding out what day of the week it will be.\n\n### Steps to solve the problem:\n1. **Identify the starting date**: July 2, 2022, which is a Saturday.\n2. **Count backward 76 days**: We need to subtract 76 days from the starting date.\n3. **Determine the day of the week**: After finding the new date, we need to determine what day of the week it falls on.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use Python's `datetime` module, which provides convenient functions to handle dates and times.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Starting date\nstart_date = datetime(2022, 7, 2)\n\n# Subtract 76 days\nnew_date = start_date - timedelta(days=76)\n\n# Get the day of the week\nday_of_week = new_date.strftime('%A')\n\nprint(day_of_week)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the new date by subtracting 76 days from July 2, 2022, and then determine the day of the week for that new date. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned \"Sunday\" as the day of the week. This means that 76 days before Saturday, July 2, 2022, falls on a Sunday.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Sunday>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Count backward 76 days from Saturday, July 2, 2022 - what's the weekday?
