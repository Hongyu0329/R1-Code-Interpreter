    "To determine the day of the week 73 days ago from Wednesday, October 19, 2022, we need to calculate the date 73 days before October 19, 2022, and then find the corresponding weekday.\n\n1. **Calculate the date 73 days ago:**\n   - Start from October 19, 2022, and subtract 73 days.\n\n2. **Determine the weekday for the calculated date:**\n   - Once we have the date, we can find out what day of the week it was.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Given date\ngiven_date = datetime(2022, 10, 19)\n\n# Subtract 73 days\ndays_ago = given_date - timedelta(days=73)\n\n# Get the weekday name\nweekday_name = days_ago.strftime('%A')\n\nprint(weekday_name)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the date 73 days before October 19, 2022, and then determine the day of the week for that date.",
    "The code execution indicates that 73 days before Wednesday, October 19, 2022, was a Sunday. \n\nTherefore, the day of the week 73 days ago was:\n\n<<<Sunday>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    If today is Wednesday, October 19, 2022, what day of the week was it 73 days ago?
