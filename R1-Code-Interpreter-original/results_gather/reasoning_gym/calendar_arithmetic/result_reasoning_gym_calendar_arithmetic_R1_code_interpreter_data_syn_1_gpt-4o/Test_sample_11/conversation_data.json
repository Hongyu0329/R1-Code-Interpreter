    "To determine the weekday 98 days before Monday, May 23, 2022, we can use Python's `datetime` module. This module allows us to perform date arithmetic easily. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Start with the given date: May 23, 2022.\n2. Subtract 98 days from this date.\n3. Determine the weekday of the resulting date.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Given date\nstart_date = datetime(2022, 5, 23)\n\n# Subtract 98 days\ndays_to_subtract = timedelta(days=98)\nnew_date = start_date - days_to_subtract\n\n# Get the full weekday name\nweekday_name = new_date.strftime(\"%A\")\n\nprint(weekday_name)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the date 98 days before May 23, 2022, and then determine the weekday name of that date. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution indicates that 98 days before Monday, May 23, 2022, was also a Monday. Therefore, the full weekday name is:\n\n<<<Monday>>>"
