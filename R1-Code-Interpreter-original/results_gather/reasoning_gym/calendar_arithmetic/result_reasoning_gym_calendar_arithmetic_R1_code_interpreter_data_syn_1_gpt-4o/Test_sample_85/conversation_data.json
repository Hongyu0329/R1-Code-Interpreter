    "To determine the day of the week for March 6, 2022, we can use Python's `datetime` module, which provides a straightforward way to handle dates and times. The `datetime` module has a method called `weekday()` that returns the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6. We can then map this integer to the corresponding weekday name.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the day of the week for March 6, 2022.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# Define the date\ndate = datetime.date(2022, 3, 6)\n\n# Get the weekday as an integer\nweekday_number = date.weekday()\n\n# Map the integer to the weekday name\nweekdays = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\"]\nweekday_name = weekdays[weekday_number]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(weekday_name)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution output indicates that March 6, 2022, was a Sunday. The `datetime` module correctly calculated the day of the week for the given date.\n\n<<<Sunday>>>"
