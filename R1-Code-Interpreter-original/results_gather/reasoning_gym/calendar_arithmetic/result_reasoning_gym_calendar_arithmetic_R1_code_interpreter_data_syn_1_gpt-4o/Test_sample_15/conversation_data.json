    "To determine the weekday of February 25 in a year where January 1st is a Monday, we need to calculate the number of days from January 1st to February 25th and then find the weekday that corresponds to that number of days.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of days from January 1st to February 25th:**\n   - January has 31 days.\n   - February 25th is the 25th day of February.\n   - Total days from January 1st to February 25th = 31 (January) + 25 (February) = 56 days.\n\n2. **Determine the weekday:**\n   - Since January 1st is a Monday, we can calculate the weekday by finding the remainder when the total number of days (56) is divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n   - The remainder will give us the offset from Monday.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total number of days from January 1st to February 25th\ntotal_days = 31 + 25\n\n# Calculate the weekday by finding the remainder when total_days is divided by 7\n# Monday is represented as 0, so we add the remainder to 0\nweekdays = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\"]\nweekday_index = total_days % 7\n\n# Get the weekday name\nweekday_name = weekdays[weekday_index]\nprint(weekday_name)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the weekday name for February 25th.",
    "The code output indicates that February 25th falls on a Monday in a year where January 1st is also a Monday. This is consistent with the calculation, as 56 days from a Monday will also land on a Monday (since 56 is a multiple of 7).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Monday>>>"
