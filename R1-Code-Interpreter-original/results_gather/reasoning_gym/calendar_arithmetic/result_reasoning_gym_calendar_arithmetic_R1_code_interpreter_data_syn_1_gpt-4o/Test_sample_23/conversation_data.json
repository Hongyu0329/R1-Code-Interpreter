  "response_list": [
    "To determine the day of the week 95 days from Tuesday, April 5, 2022, we can use modular arithmetic. The days of the week cycle every 7 days, so we can find the remainder when 95 is divided by 7 to determine how many days forward we need to move from Tuesday.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of days to move forward\ndays_to_move = 95\n\n# Days of the week starting from Tuesday\ndays_of_week = [\"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\", \"Monday\"]\n\n# Calculate the index of the new day\nnew_day_index = (days_of_week.index(\"Tuesday\") + days_to_move) % 7\n\n# Get the new day\nnew_day = days_of_week[new_day_index]\n\nprint(new_day)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the day of the week 95 days from Tuesday, April 5, 2022.",
    "The code correctly calculates the day of the week 95 days from Tuesday, April 5, 2022. By using modular arithmetic, we determined that the day of the week will be Saturday.\n\n<<<Saturday>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    If today is Tuesday, April 5, 2022, what day of the week will it be in 95 days?
