    "To determine the weekday of April 3rd in a year where January 1st is a Monday, we need to calculate the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd and then find the weekday that corresponds to that number of days.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd:**\n   - January has 31 days.\n   - February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year since it's not specified).\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - April 3rd is the 3rd day of April.\n\n2. **Total days from January 1st to April 3rd:**\n   - Total days = 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 3 (April) = 93 days.\n\n3. **Determine the weekday:**\n   - Since January 1st is a Monday, we can calculate the weekday by finding the remainder of the total days divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total number of days from January 1st to April 3rd\ntotal_days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 3\n\n# Calculate the weekday by finding the remainder when total_days is divided by 7\n# Monday is 0, Tuesday is 1, ..., Sunday is 6\nweekday_index = (total_days - 1) % 7\n\n# List of weekdays\nweekdays = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\"]\n\n# Determine the weekday\nweekday = weekdays[weekday_index]\n\nprint(weekday)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the weekday of April 3rd.",
    "The code execution shows that April 3rd falls on a Tuesday in a year where January 1st is a Monday. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Tuesday>>>"
