    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of swaps required to make the given binary string alternating. An alternating binary string is one where no two adjacent characters are the same, such as \"010101\" or \"101010\".\n\nFirst, let's consider the two possible alternating patterns for a binary string of length `n`:\n1. Pattern 1: \"010101...\" (starting with '0')\n2. Pattern 2: \"101010...\" (starting with '1')\n\nFor the given string, we will:\n- Count the number of mismatches with Pattern 1.\n- Count the number of mismatches with Pattern 2.\n\nThe minimum number of swaps required will be the minimum of these two mismatch counts, provided that the mismatches can be resolved by swapping.\n\nTo determine if the mismatches can be resolved by swapping, we need to ensure that the number of '0's and '1's in the string allows for one of the patterns to be formed. Specifically:\n- For Pattern 1, the number of '0's should be equal to or one more than the number of '1's if the string length is odd.\n- For Pattern 2, the number of '1's should be equal to or one more than the number of '0's if the string length is odd.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the minimum number of swaps.\n\n```python\ndef min_swaps_to_alternate(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    count_0 = s.count('0')\n    count_1 = s.count('1')\n    \n    # Check if it's possible to form an alternating string\n    if abs(count_0 - count_1) > 1:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Calculate mismatches for both patterns\n    mismatch_pattern1 = 0  # \"010101...\"\n    mismatch_pattern2 = 0  # \"101010...\"\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        expected_char_pattern1 = '0' if i % 2 == 0 else '1'\n        expected_char_pattern2 = '1' if i % 2 == 0 else '0'\n        \n        if s[i] != expected_char_pattern1:\n            mismatch_pattern1 += 1\n        if s[i] != expected_char_pattern2:\n            mismatch_pattern2 += 1\n    \n    # Determine the minimum swaps needed\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        # If length is even, both patterns are possible\n        min_swaps = min(mismatch_pattern1 // 2, mismatch_pattern2 // 2)\n    else:\n        # If length is odd, only one pattern is possible\n        if count_0 > count_1:\n            min_swaps = mismatch_pattern1 // 2\n        else:\n            min_swaps = mismatch_pattern2 // 2\n    \n    return min_swaps\n\n# Given binary string\nbinary_string = \"10000101111010101101\"\nresult = min_swaps_to_alternate(binary_string)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the minimum number of swaps required.",
