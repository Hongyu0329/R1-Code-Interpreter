    "To determine the minimum number of swaps needed to make the binary string \"10011101000011\" alternating, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: An alternating binary string is one where no two adjacent characters are the same. For example, \"010101\" or \"101010\".\n\n2. **Identify Possible Alternating Patterns**: For a binary string, there are two possible alternating patterns:\n   - Pattern 1: Starts with '0', i.e., \"010101...\"\n   - Pattern 2: Starts with '1', i.e., \"101010...\"\n\n3. **Count Mismatches for Each Pattern**:\n   - For Pattern 1 (\"010101...\"), count how many characters are out of place.\n   - For Pattern 2 (\"101010...\"), count how many characters are out of place.\n\n4. **Calculate Mismatches**:\n   - For the given string \"10011101000011\", compare each character with the expected character in both patterns.\n   - Count the number of mismatches for each pattern.\n\n5. **Determine Feasibility**:\n   - The number of '0's and '1's in the string must allow for one of the patterns to be possible. Specifically, the difference in the count of '0's and '1's should not be more than 1 for an alternating pattern to be possible.\n\n6. **Calculate Minimum Swaps**:\n   - If the string can be rearranged into an alternating pattern, the minimum number of swaps required is half the number of mismatches for that pattern (since each swap fixes two mismatches).\n\n7. **Check for Impossibility**:\n   - If neither pattern can be achieved due to an imbalance in the number of '0's and '1's, return -1.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the string \"10011101000011\":\n\n- Count the number of '0's and '1's:\n  - Number of '0's = 6\n  - Number of '1's = 8\n\n- Check feasibility:\n  - The difference between the number of '0's and '1's is 2, which is more than 1. This means it is impossible to rearrange the string into an alternating pattern.\n\nSince the difference in the count of '0's and '1's is more than 1, it is impossible to make the string alternating.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"
