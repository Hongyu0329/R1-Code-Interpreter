    "To determine the minimum number of swaps needed to make the binary string \"11101011000101001\" alternating, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: An alternating binary string is one where no two adjacent characters are the same. For example, \"010101\" or \"101010\".\n\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the number of '0's and '1's in the string.\n   - In the given string \"11101011000101001\", there are 8 '0's and 11 '1's.\n\n3. **Check Feasibility**: For a string to be rearranged into an alternating pattern, the difference between the counts of '0's and '1's should not be more than 1. This is because an alternating string of length n can either have:\n   - n/2 '0's and n/2 '1's if n is even.\n   - (n+1)/2 of one character and (n-1)/2 of the other if n is odd.\n\n   In this case, the string length is 17 (odd), so the counts should be either 9 '0's and 8 '1's or 8 '0's and 9 '1's. The current counts (8 '0's and 11 '1's) do not satisfy this condition, making it impossible to rearrange the string into an alternating pattern.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the difference in counts of '0's and '1's is more than 1, it is impossible to rearrange the string into an alternating pattern.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of swaps required is -1, indicating that it is impossible.\n\nFinal answer: <<<-1>>>"
