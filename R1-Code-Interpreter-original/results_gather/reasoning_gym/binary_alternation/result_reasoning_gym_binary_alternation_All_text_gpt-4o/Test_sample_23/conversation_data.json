    "To determine the minimum number of swaps needed to make the binary string \"10001111001110\" alternating, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: An alternating binary string is one where no two adjacent characters are the same. For example, \"010101\" or \"101010\".\n\n2. **Identify Possible Patterns**: For a binary string of length `n`, there are two possible alternating patterns:\n   - Pattern 1: Starts with '0', i.e., \"010101...\" (if `n` is even) or \"0101010...\" (if `n` is odd).\n   - Pattern 2: Starts with '1', i.e., \"101010...\" (if `n` is even) or \"1010101...\" (if `n` is odd).\n\n3. **Count Mismatches for Each Pattern**:\n   - Compare the given string with both patterns and count the number of mismatches for each.\n   - A mismatch occurs when the character in the string does not match the expected character in the pattern.\n\n4. **Calculate Swaps**:\n   - For each pattern, calculate the number of swaps needed to correct the mismatches.\n   - Since each swap can fix two mismatches (one for each character involved in the swap), the number of swaps required is half the number of mismatches.\n\n5. **Check Feasibility**:\n   - For a string to be convertible to an alternating pattern, the number of '0's and '1's must be such that they can form one of the alternating patterns.\n   - Specifically, the difference between the count of '0's and '1's should not be more than 1.\n\n6. **Determine the Minimum Swaps**:\n   - If both patterns are feasible, choose the one with the minimum swaps.\n   - If neither pattern is feasible, return -1.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the string \"10001111001110\":\n\n- **Count '0's and '1's**:\n  - Number of '0's = 6\n  - Number of '1's = 8\n\n- **Feasibility Check**:\n  - The difference between the number of '0's and '1's is 2, which is greater than 1. This means it is impossible to rearrange the string into an alternating pattern.\n\nSince the feasibility condition is not met, it is impossible to make the string alternating.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"
