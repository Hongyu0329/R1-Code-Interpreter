    "To determine the minimum number of swaps needed to make the binary string \"01110001011001\" alternating, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: An alternating binary string is one where no two adjacent characters are the same. For example, \"010101\" or \"101010\".\n\n2. **Identify Possible Patterns**: For a binary string to be alternating, it can follow one of two patterns:\n   - Pattern 1: Starts with '0', i.e., \"010101...\"\n   - Pattern 2: Starts with '1', i.e., \"101010...\"\n\n3. **Count Mismatches for Each Pattern**:\n   - For Pattern 1 (\"010101...\"), count how many characters are out of place.\n   - For Pattern 2 (\"101010...\"), count how many characters are out of place.\n\n4. **Calculate Mismatches**:\n   - For Pattern 1:\n     - At even indices (0, 2, 4,...), expect '0'.\n     - At odd indices (1, 3, 5,...), expect '1'.\n   - For Pattern 2:\n     - At even indices (0, 2, 4,...), expect '1'.\n     - At odd indices (1, 3, 5,...), expect '0'.\n\n5. **Count the Mismatches**:\n   - For the given string \"01110001011001\":\n     - Pattern 1 mismatches: Count the number of positions where the string does not match \"010101...\".\n     - Pattern 2 mismatches: Count the number of positions where the string does not match \"101010...\".\n\n6. **Check Feasibility**:\n   - The number of '0's and '1's in the string must be such that it is possible to rearrange them into one of the alternating patterns.\n   - If the difference in the count of '0's and '1's is more than 1, it is impossible to rearrange them into an alternating pattern.\n\n7. **Calculate Minimum Swaps**:\n   - If feasible, the minimum number of swaps required will be the minimum of the mismatches calculated for the two patterns divided by 2 (since each swap fixes two mismatches).\n\n8. **Determine the Result**:\n   - If the string can be rearranged into an alternating pattern, output the minimum number of swaps.\n   - If not, output -1.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the string \"01110001011001\":\n\n- Count of '0's: 7\n- Count of '1's: 7\n\nSince the counts of '0's and '1's are equal, it is possible to rearrange the string into an alternating pattern.\n\n- Pattern 1 mismatches: 6\n- Pattern 2 mismatches: 8\n\nThe minimum number of swaps required is the minimum of these mismatches divided by 2:\n\n- Minimum swaps = min(6, 8) / 2 = 3\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of swaps required to make the string alternating is 3.\n\nFinal answer: <<<3>>>"
