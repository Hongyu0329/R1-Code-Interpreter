    "To determine the minimum number of swaps needed to make the binary string \"1010111011010000\" alternating, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: An alternating binary string is one where no two adjacent characters are the same. For example, \"010101\" or \"101010\" are alternating strings.\n\n2. **Identify Possible Alternating Patterns**: For a binary string, there are two possible alternating patterns:\n   - Pattern 1: Starts with '0', i.e., \"010101...\"\n   - Pattern 2: Starts with '1', i.e., \"101010...\"\n\n3. **Count Mismatches for Each Pattern**:\n   - For Pattern 1 (\"010101...\"), count how many characters are out of place.\n   - For Pattern 2 (\"101010...\"), count how many characters are out of place.\n\n4. **Calculate Mismatches**:\n   - For the given string \"1010111011010000\", compare each character with the expected character in both patterns.\n   - Count the number of mismatches for each pattern.\n\n5. **Determine Feasibility**:\n   - Check if the string can be rearranged into an alternating pattern. This is possible if the number of '0's and '1's differ by at most 1. If the difference is greater than 1, it is impossible to rearrange the string into an alternating pattern.\n\n6. **Calculate Minimum Swaps**:\n   - If feasible, the minimum number of swaps required will be the minimum of the mismatches calculated for the two patterns divided by 2 (since each swap fixes two mismatches).\n\n7. **Apply to the Given String**:\n   - Count the number of '0's and '1's in \"1010111011010000\".\n   - Check the feasibility condition.\n   - Calculate mismatches for both patterns.\n   - Determine the minimum number of swaps.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the string \"1010111011010000\":\n\n- Count of '1's = 9\n- Count of '0's = 7\n\nSince the difference between the count of '1's and '0's is 2, which is greater than 1, it is impossible to rearrange the string into an alternating pattern.\n\nTherefore, the answer is -1.\n\n<<<-1>>>"
