    "To determine the minimum number of swaps needed to make the binary string \"01000111101110\" alternating, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: An alternating binary string is one where no two adjacent characters are the same. For example, \"010101\" or \"101010\".\n\n2. **Identify Possible Patterns**: For a binary string to be alternating, it can follow one of two patterns:\n   - Pattern 1: Starts with '0', i.e., \"010101...\"\n   - Pattern 2: Starts with '1', i.e., \"101010...\"\n\n3. **Count Mismatches for Each Pattern**:\n   - For Pattern 1 (\"010101...\"), count how many characters are out of place.\n   - For Pattern 2 (\"101010...\"), count how many characters are out of place.\n\n4. **Calculate Mismatches**:\n   - For Pattern 1:\n     - At even indices (0, 2, 4,...), expect '0'.\n     - At odd indices (1, 3, 5,...), expect '1'.\n   - For Pattern 2:\n     - At even indices (0, 2, 4,...), expect '1'.\n     - At odd indices (1, 3, 5,...), expect '0'.\n\n5. **Count the Swaps**:\n   - For each pattern, count the number of mismatches at even and odd indices.\n   - The number of swaps needed for each pattern is the maximum of mismatches at even and odd indices because each swap can fix one mismatch at an even index and one at an odd index.\n\n6. **Check Feasibility**:\n   - The string can only be made alternating if the number of '0's and '1's differ by at most 1. This is because an alternating string of length n will have either ⌊n/2⌋ '0's and ⌈n/2⌉ '1's or vice versa.\n\n7. **Determine the Minimum Swaps**:\n   - If the string can be made alternating, the answer is the minimum number of swaps needed for either pattern.\n   - If not, return -1.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the string \"01000111101110\":\n\n- Count the number of '0's and '1's:\n  - Number of '0's = 6\n  - Number of '1's = 8\n\n- Check feasibility:\n  - The difference between the number of '0's and '1's is 2, which is greater than 1. Therefore, it is impossible to make the string alternating.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"
