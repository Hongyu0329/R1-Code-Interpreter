    "To determine the minimum number of swaps needed to make the binary string \"01100111000110\" alternating, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: An alternating binary string is one where no two adjacent characters are the same. For example, \"010101\" or \"101010\".\n\n2. **Identify Possible Patterns**: For a binary string of length `n`, there are two possible alternating patterns:\n   - Pattern 1: Starts with '0', i.e., \"010101...\" (if `n` is even) or \"0101010...\" (if `n` is odd).\n   - Pattern 2: Starts with '1', i.e., \"101010...\" (if `n` is even) or \"1010101...\" (if `n` is odd).\n\n3. **Count Mismatches**: For each pattern, count how many characters in the given string do not match the expected character in the pattern at each position.\n\n4. **Calculate Swaps**: The number of swaps needed to convert the string to match a pattern is half the number of mismatches (since each swap fixes two mismatches).\n\n5. **Check Feasibility**: For a string to be convertible to an alternating pattern, the number of '0's and '1's must be such that they can form one of the patterns. Specifically:\n   - If the string length `n` is even, the counts of '0's and '1's must be equal.\n   - If `n` is odd, the counts of '0's and '1's must differ by exactly 1.\n\n6. **Apply to the Given String**: The string \"01100111000110\" has 14 characters, which is even. Count the number of '0's and '1's:\n   - Count of '0's = 6\n   - Count of '1's = 8\n\n   Since the counts of '0's and '1's are not equal, it is impossible to rearrange the string into an alternating pattern.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Since the condition for forming an alternating pattern is not met, the answer is -1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"
