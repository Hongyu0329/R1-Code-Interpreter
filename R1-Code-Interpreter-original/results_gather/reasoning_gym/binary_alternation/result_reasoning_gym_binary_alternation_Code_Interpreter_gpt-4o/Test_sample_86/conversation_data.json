    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of swaps required to make the given binary string alternating. An alternating binary string is one where no two adjacent characters are the same.\n\nThe given binary string is: `110111110010001100000010101101`\n\nTo make it alternating, we can consider two possible patterns:\n1. Starting with '0': \"010101...\"\n2.
