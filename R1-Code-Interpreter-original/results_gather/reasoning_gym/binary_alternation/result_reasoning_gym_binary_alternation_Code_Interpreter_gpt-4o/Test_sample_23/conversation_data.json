    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of swaps required to make the given binary string alternating. An alternating binary string is one where no two adjacent characters are the same.\n\nFor a binary string of length \\( n \\), there are two possible alternating patterns:\n1. Starting with '0': \"010101...\" (for even indices) and \"101010...\" (for odd indices).\n2. Starting with '1': \"101010...\" (for even indices) and \"010101...\" (for odd indices).\n\nTo find the minimum number of swaps, we can:\n1. Count the number of mismatches for each pattern.\n2.
