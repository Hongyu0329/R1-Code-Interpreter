    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are: -23.85, -64.0, -73.0, -49.8, 6.16, 7.73, -2.1, 44.45, -56.7.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: We need to compare each number to determine their order from largest to smallest.\n\n4. **Sort the Numbers**:\n   - The largest number is 44.45.\n   - The next largest is 7.73.\n   - Followed by 6.16.\n   - Then -2.1.\n   - Next is -23.85.\n   - Followed by -49.8.\n   - Then -56.7.\n   - Next is -64.0.\n   - The smallest number is -73.0.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **List the Numbers**: List the numbers in descending order as strings.\n\nThe sorted list in descending order is: <<<['44.45', '7.73', '6.16', '-2.1', '-23.85', '-49.8', '-56.7', '-64.0', '-73.0']>>>"
