    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: -21.21, 72.6, -26.18, -20.0, 10.0, 85.71, -89.0.\n\n2. **Identify the Negative and Positive Numbers**: \n   - Negative numbers: -21.21, -26.18, -20.0, -89.0\n   - Positive numbers: 72.6, 10.0, 85.71\n\n3. **Sort the Negative Numbers**: \n   - The more negative a number is, the smaller it is. \n   - Order the negative numbers from smallest to largest: -89.0, -26.18, -21.21, -20.0.\n\n4. **Sort the Positive Numbers**: \n   - Order the positive numbers from smallest to largest: 10.0, 72.6, 85.71.\n\n5. **Combine the Sorted Lists**: \n   - Combine the sorted negative numbers with the sorted positive numbers to get the full list in ascending order.\n\n6. **Convert Numbers to Strings**: \n   - Convert each number in the sorted list to a string format as per the instruction.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list in ascending order is:\n\n<<<['-89.0', '-26.18', '-21.21', '-20.0', '10.0', '72.6', '85.71']>>>"
