    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: 15.9, -93.6, 32.91, 33.0, 52.4, 75.9, 63.77, 79.0, -88.0, 23.9.\n\n2. **Identify the Smallest Number**: Look through the list to find the smallest number. In this case, -93.6 is the smallest.\n\n3. **Identify the Next Smallest Number**: After -93.6, the next smallest number is -88.0.\n\n4. **Continue Finding the Next Smallest Numbers**: Continue this process for the remaining numbers:\n   - After -88.0, the next smallest is 15.9.\n   - Then, 23.9.\n   - Next, 32.91.\n   - Followed by 33.0.\n   - Then, 52.4.\n   - Next, 63.77.\n   - Then, 75.9.\n   - Finally, 79.0.\n\n5. **List the Numbers in Ascending Order**: Arrange the numbers in the order identified above.\n\n6. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number in the sorted list to a string format as per the instructions.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list of numbers in ascending order, converted to strings, is:\n\n<<<['-93.6', '-88.0', '15.9', '23.9', '32.91', '33.0', '52.4', '63.77', '75.9', '79.0']>>>"
