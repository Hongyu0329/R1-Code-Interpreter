    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: 17.0, -91.67, 34.69, 85.22, 35.87, 64.0, 79.5, 85.4, -45.08, 72.3.\n\n2. **Identify the Largest Number**: Look through the list to find the largest number. In this case, 85.4 is the largest.\n\n3. **Order the Numbers**: Continue identifying the next largest number and place it in order. The sequence of numbers from largest to smallest is:\n   - 85.4\n   - 85.22\n   - 79.5\n   - 72.3\n   - 64.0\n   - 35.87\n   - 34.69\n   - 17.0\n   - -45.08\n   - -91.67\n\n4. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number in the ordered list to a string format.\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: Present the final sorted list in the specified format.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list in descending order, with each number as a string, is:\n\n<<<['85.4', '85.22', '79.5', '72.3', '64.0', '35.87', '34.69', '17.0', '-45.08', '-91.67']>>>"
