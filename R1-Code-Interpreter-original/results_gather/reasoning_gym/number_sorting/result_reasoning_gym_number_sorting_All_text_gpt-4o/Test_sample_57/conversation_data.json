    "To sort the numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers given are 53.57, 100.0, -31.0, and -70.1.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the largest number. Here, 100.0 is the largest.\n   - Next, compare the remaining numbers: 53.57, -31.0, and -70.1.\n   - 53.57 is greater than -31.0 and -70.1.\n   - Between -31.0 and -70.1, -31.0 is greater than -70.1.\n\n4. **Arrange the Numbers**: Based on the comparisons:\n   - The order from largest to smallest is: 100.0, 53.57, -31.0, -70.1.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is: <<<['100.0', '53.57', '-31.0', '-70.1']>>>"
