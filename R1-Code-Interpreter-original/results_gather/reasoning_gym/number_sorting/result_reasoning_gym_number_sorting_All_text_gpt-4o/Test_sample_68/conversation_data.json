    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -8.0, 41.1, -30.05, 60.0, and -75.74.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the largest number. Among the given numbers, 60.0 is the largest.\n   - Next, compare the remaining numbers to find the second largest. 41.1 is the next largest after 60.0.\n   - Continue this process: -8.0 is larger than -30.05 and -75.74.\n   - -30.05 is larger than -75.74.\n   - -75.74 is the smallest number.\n\n4. **Arrange the Numbers**: Based on the comparisons, the order from largest to smallest is: 60.0, 41.1, -8.0, -30.05, -75.74.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is: <<<['60.0', '41.1', '-8.0', '-30.05', '-75.74']>>>"
