    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: 47.58, -79.6, 28.94, -34.45, 81.6.\n\n2. **Identify the Smallest Number**: \n   - Compare each number to find the smallest.\n   - -79.6 is the smallest number.\n\n3. **Identify the Next Smallest Number**:\n   - After -79.6, the next smallest number is -34.45.\n\n4. **Continue Finding the Next Smallest Numbers**:\n   - After -34.45, the next smallest number is 28.94.\n   - After 28.94, the next smallest number is 47.58.\n   - Finally, the largest number is 81.6.\n\n5. **Arrange in Ascending Order**:\n   - Arrange the numbers from the smallest to the largest: -79.6, -34.45, 28.94, 47.58, 81.6.\n\n6. **Convert to Strings**:\n   - Convert each number in the sorted list to a string format.\n\n7. **Format the Answer**:\n   - Present the sorted list in the required format.\n\nThe final sorted list in ascending order, with each number as a string, is:\n\n<<<['-79.6', '-34.45', '28.94', '47.58', '81.6']>>>"
