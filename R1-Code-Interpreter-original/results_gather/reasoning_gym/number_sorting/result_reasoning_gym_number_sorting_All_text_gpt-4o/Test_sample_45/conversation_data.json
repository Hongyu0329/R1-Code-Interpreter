    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -35.0, -61.0, -41.53, 100.0, -70.91, 32.0, and 70.0.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: In descending order, numbers are arranged from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: We need to compare each number to determine their order from largest to smallest:\n   - The largest number is 100.0.\n   - The next largest is 70.0.\n   - Followed by 32.0.\n   - Then -35.0.\n   - Next is -41.53.\n   - Followed by -61.0.\n   - The smallest number is -70.91.\n\n4. **Arrange the Numbers**: Based on the comparison, arrange the numbers in descending order: 100.0, 70.0, 32.0, -35.0, -41.53, -61.0, -70.91.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['100.0', '70.0', '32.0', '-35.0', '-41.53', '-61.0', '-70.91']>>>"
