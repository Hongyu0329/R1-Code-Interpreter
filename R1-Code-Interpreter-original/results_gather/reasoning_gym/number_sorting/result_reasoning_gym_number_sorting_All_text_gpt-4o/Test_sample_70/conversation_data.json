    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are 35.3, -66.06, 32.0, -23.13, and -14.18.\n\n2. **Understand Ascending Order**: Ascending order means arranging numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: \n   - Start by identifying the smallest number. In this case, -66.06 is the smallest.\n   - Next, compare the remaining numbers to find the next smallest. -23.13 is the next smallest.\n   - Continue this process: -14.18 is next, followed by 32.0, and finally 35.3.\n\n4. **List the Numbers in Order**: Arrange the numbers from the smallest to the largest based on the comparisons made.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: As per the instruction, convert each number to a string format.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list of numbers in ascending order is:\n\n<<<['-66.06', '-23.13', '-14.18', '32.0', '35.3']>>>"
