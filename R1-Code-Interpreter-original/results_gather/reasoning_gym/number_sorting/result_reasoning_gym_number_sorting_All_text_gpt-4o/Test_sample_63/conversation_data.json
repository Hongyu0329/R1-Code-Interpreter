    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are 89.0, -72.0, 20.23, -45.0, and -91.03.\n\n2. **Convert to Comparable Format**: Since all numbers are already in decimal format, they are directly comparable.\n\n3. **List the Numbers**: Start by listing the numbers as they are: [89.0, -72.0, 20.23, -45.0, -91.03].\n\n4. **Sort the Numbers**: To sort these numbers in ascending order, we need to arrange them from the smallest to the largest.\n\n   - The smallest number is -91.03.\n   - The next smallest number is -72.0.\n   - The next is -45.0.\n   - Followed by 20.23.\n   - The largest number is 89.0.\n\n5. **Sorted List**: The sorted list in ascending order is: [-91.03, -72.0, -45.0, 20.23, 89.0].\n\n6. **Convert to Strings**: According to the instructions, convert each number in the sorted list to a string.\n\n7. **Final Answer**: Present the sorted list as strings in the specified format.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<['-91.03', '-72.0', '-45.0', '20.23', '89.0']>>>"
