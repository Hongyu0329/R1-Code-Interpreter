    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -48.0, -61.0, 46.0, 29.2, 35.34, and -64.0.\n\n2. **Convert to Comparable Format**: Since all numbers are already in decimal format, we can directly compare them.\n\n3. **Sort in Descending Order**: We need to arrange the numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n   - Start by identifying the largest number: 46.0\n   - Next largest: 35.34\n   - Next: 29.2\n   - Next: -48.0\n   - Next: -61.0\n   - Smallest: -64.0\n\n4. **Convert to Strings**: As per the instruction, convert each number to a string format.\n\n5. **List the Numbers**: Arrange the numbers in a list in descending order as strings.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['46.0', '35.34', '29.2', '-48.0', '-61.0', '-64.0']>>>"
