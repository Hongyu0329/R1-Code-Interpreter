    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -12.5, -67.0, 44.7, -69.0, and -94.0.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - The largest number is 44.7 because it is the only positive number.\n   - Next, we compare the negative numbers. The less negative a number is, the larger it is in value.\n   - -12.5 is less negative than -67.0, -69.0, and -94.0, so it comes after 44.7.\n   - -67.0 is less negative than -69.0 and -94.0, so it comes next.\n   - -69.0 is less negative than -94.0, so it follows -67.0.\n   - -94.0 is the most negative, so it is the smallest number.\n\n4. **Arrange the Numbers**: Based on the comparisons, the descending order is 44.7, -12.5, -67.0, -69.0, -94.0.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['44.7', '-12.5', '-67.0', '-69.0', '-94.0']>>>"
