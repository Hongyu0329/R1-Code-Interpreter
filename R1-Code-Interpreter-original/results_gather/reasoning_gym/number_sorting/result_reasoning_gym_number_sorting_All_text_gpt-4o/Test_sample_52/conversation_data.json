    "To solve the problem of sorting the given numbers in descending order, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are 83.0, -2.17, 98.7, 66.6, -0.26, 50.9, and 21.72.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: We need to compare each number to determine their order from largest to smallest.\n\n4. **Sort the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the largest number: 98.7\n   - Next largest: 83.0\n   - Next: 66.6\n   - Next: 50.9\n   - Next: 21.72\n   - Next: -0.26\n   - Smallest: -2.17\n\n5. **Convert Numbers to Strings**: According to the instructions, we need to convert each number into a string format.\n\n6. **List the Numbers in Descending Order as Strings**: We will list the numbers in descending order, ensuring each number is a string.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list of numbers in descending order is:\n\n<<<['98.7', '83.0', '66.6', '50.9', '21.72', '-0.26', '-2.17']>>>"
