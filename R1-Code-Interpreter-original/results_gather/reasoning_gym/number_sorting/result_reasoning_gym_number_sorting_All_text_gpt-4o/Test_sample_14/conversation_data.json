Instead of reporting your answer as -69, -13, 1, 7, 11, 43, 59, 61, use <<<['-69', '-13', '1', '7', '11', '43', '59', '61']>>> instead\n## 2. Convert all numbers in the square brackets as strings. For example, <<<['-69', '-13', '1', '7', '11', '43', '59', '61']>>>\n",

    "To sort the numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers given are -20.0, 17.0, 27.0, and 17.0.\n\n2. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction. This gives us the list: ['-20.0', '17.0', '27.0', '17.0'].\n\n3. **Sort the Numbers**: Sort the list of numbers in ascending order. The order of numbers from smallest to largest is: -20.0, 17.0, 17.0, 27.0.\n\n4. **Convert Sorted Numbers to Strings**: Convert each sorted number to a string. This results in the list: ['-20.0', '17.0', '17.0', '27.0'].\n\n5. **Output the Final Answer**: Present the sorted list of numbers as strings in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list of numbers in ascending order is: <<<['-20.0', '17.0', '17.0', '27.0']>>>."
