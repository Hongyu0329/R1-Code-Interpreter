    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: -34.0, 80.4, 15.59, -43.3, -23.29, 53.0, 56.24, 100.0, -12.0.\n\n2. **Identify the Negative Numbers**: Identify which numbers are negative, as they will appear first in ascending order. The negative numbers are: -34.0, -43.3, -23.29, -12.0.\n\n3. **Sort the Negative Numbers**: Sort these negative numbers in ascending order. The order is: -43.3, -34.0, -23.29, -12.0.\n\n4. **Identify the Positive Numbers**: Identify the positive numbers from the list: 80.4, 15.59, 53.0, 56.24, 100.0.\n\n5. **Sort the Positive Numbers**: Sort these positive numbers in ascending order. The order is: 15.59, 53.0, 56.24, 80.4, 100.0.\n\n6. **Combine the Sorted Lists**: Combine the sorted negative and positive numbers to form a single list in ascending order: -43.3, -34.0, -23.29, -12.0, 15.59, 53.0, 56.24, 80.4, 100.0.\n\n7. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number in the list to a string as per the instruction.\n\nThe final sorted list in ascending order, with each number as a string, is:\n\n<<<['-43.3', '-34.0', '-23.29', '-12.0', '15.59', '53.0', '56.24', '80.4', '100.0']>>>"
