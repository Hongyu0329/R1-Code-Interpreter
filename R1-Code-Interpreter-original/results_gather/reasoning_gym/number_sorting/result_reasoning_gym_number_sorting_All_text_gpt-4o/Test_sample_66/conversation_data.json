    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: 15.0, -30.0, 94.4, 45.64, 11.2, 82.0, -93.09, 52.0.\n\n2. **Identify the Smallest Number**: Look through the list to find the smallest number. In this case, -93.09 is the smallest.\n\n3. **Identify the Next Smallest Number**: After -93.09, the next smallest number is -30.0.\n\n4. **Continue Finding the Next Smallest Numbers**: Continue this process:\n   - After -30.0, the next smallest is 11.2.\n   - After 11.2, the next smallest is 15.0.\n   - After 15.0, the next smallest is 45.64.\n   - After 45.64, the next smallest is 52.0.\n   - After 52.0, the next smallest is 82.0.\n   - Finally, the largest number is 94.4.\n\n5. **List the Numbers in Ascending Order**: Arrange the numbers in the order identified:\n   - -93.09, -30.0, 11.2, 15.0, 45.64, 52.0, 82.0, 94.4.\n\n6. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list in ascending order, with each number as a string, is:\n\n<<<['-93.09', '-30.0', '11.2', '15.0', '45.64', '52.0', '82.0', '94.4']>>>"
