    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are: -32.38, -23.0, -68.1, 34.57, -99.7, -42.3, -55.68, -74.0, -57.7, 75.04.\n\n2. **Understand Ascending Order**: Ascending order means arranging numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n\n3. **Compare and Order the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the smallest number. In this list, -99.7 is the smallest.\n   - Next, find the second smallest number, which is -74.0.\n   - Continue this process: -68.1, -57.7, -55.68, -42.3, -32.38, -23.0.\n   - The positive numbers are 34.57 and 75.04, which are the largest in this list.\n\n4. **List the Numbers in Ascending Order**: Arrange the numbers from the smallest to the largest based on the comparisons made.\n\n5. **Convert Numbers to Strings**: As per the instruction, convert each number in the sorted list to a string format.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list in ascending order is:\n\n<<<['-99.7', '-74.0', '-68.1', '-57.7', '-55.68', '-42.3', '-32.38', '-23.0', '34.57', '75.04']>>>"
