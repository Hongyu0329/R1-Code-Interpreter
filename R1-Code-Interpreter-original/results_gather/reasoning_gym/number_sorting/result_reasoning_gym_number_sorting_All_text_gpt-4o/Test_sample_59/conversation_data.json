    "To solve the problem of sorting the numbers in descending order, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers given are 18.12, 35.7, 89.84, and -12.0.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the largest number among the list.\n   - Compare each number with the others to determine their order.\n\n4. **Order the Numbers**:\n   - 89.84 is the largest number.\n   - Next, 35.7 is smaller than 89.84 but larger than the others.\n   - Then, 18.12 is smaller than 35.7 but larger than -12.0.\n   - Finally, -12.0 is the smallest number.\n\n5. **List the Numbers in Descending Order**: Arrange the numbers from the largest to the smallest based on the comparisons.\n\n6. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string format as per the instructions.\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format.\n\nFollowing these steps, the numbers in descending order are:\n\n<<<['89.84', '35.7', '18.12', '-12.0']>>>"
