    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to carefully compare each number and arrange them from the smallest to the largest. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers given are: -11.2, -3.0, -23.0, -85.0, -41.85, -38.61, 22.0, 32.0, -34.4, 20.0.\n\n2. **Understand Ascending Order**: Ascending order means arranging numbers from the smallest (most negative) to the largest (most positive).\n\n3. **Compare and Sort**:\n   - Start by identifying the smallest number. Here, -85.0 is the smallest.\n   - Next, compare the remaining numbers to find the next smallest. -41.85 is the next smallest.\n   - Continue this process: -38.61, -34.4, -23.0, -11.2, -3.0.\n   - Now, move to the positive numbers: 20.0, 22.0, 32.0.\n\n4. **List the Numbers in Order**: After sorting, the numbers in ascending order are: -85.0, -41.85, -38.61, -34.4, -23.0, -11.2, -3.0, 20.0, 22.0, 32.0.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: According to the instructions, convert each number to a string.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the sorted list as a list of strings within square brackets.\n\nThe final sorted list in ascending order, with each number as a string, is:\n\n<<<['-85.0', '-41.85', '-38.61', '-34.4', '-23.0', '-11.2', '-3.0', '20.0', '22.0', '32.0']>>>"
