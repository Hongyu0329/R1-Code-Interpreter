    "To solve the problem of sorting the given numbers in descending order, let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are 19.4, 82.0, 46.0, -8.38, 46.77, and -67.9.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: We need to compare each number to determine their order from largest to smallest:\n   - 82.0 is the largest number.\n   - Next, 46.77 is larger than 46.0 and 19.4.\n   - 46.0 is larger than 19.4.\n   - 19.4 is larger than -8.38.\n   - -8.38 is larger than -67.9.\n\n4. **Arrange the Numbers**: Based on the comparisons, arrange the numbers in descending order: 82.0, 46.77, 46.0, 19.4, -8.38, -67.9.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format with square brackets and commas, ensuring each number is a string.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['82.0', '46.77', '46.0', '19.4', '-8.38', '-67.9']>>>"
