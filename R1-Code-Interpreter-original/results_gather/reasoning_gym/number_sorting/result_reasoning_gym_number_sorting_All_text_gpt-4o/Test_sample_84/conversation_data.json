    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are: -98.25, -76.0, -3.9, 91.2, -18.43, -15.26, -85.0.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: We need to compare each number to determine their order from largest to smallest:\n   - The largest number is 91.2.\n   - The next largest is -3.9.\n   - Then, -15.26.\n   - Followed by -18.43.\n   - Next is -76.0.\n   - Then, -85.0.\n   - The smallest number is -98.25.\n\n4. **Arrange in Descending Order**: Based on the comparison, the numbers in descending order are: 91.2, -3.9, -15.26, -18.43, -76.0, -85.0, -98.25.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is:\n<<<['91.2', '-3.9', '-15.26', '-18.43', '-76.0', '-85.0', '-98.25']>>>"
