    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -64.04, 33.07, 51.0, -84.1, 26.0, 98.1, and 88.1.\n\n2. **Understand Ascending Order**: Ascending order means arranging numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n\n3. **Compare and Order the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the smallest number. In this case, -84.1 is the smallest.\n   - Next, find the next smallest number, which is -64.04.\n   - Continue this process: 26.0, 33.07, 51.0, 88.1, and finally 98.1.\n\n4. **List the Numbers in Ascending Order**: The numbers in ascending order are -84.1, -64.04, 26.0, 33.07, 51.0, 88.1, and 98.1.\n\n5. **Convert Numbers to Strings**: According to the instructions, convert each number to a string format.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format with square brackets and commas.\n\nThe final sorted list in ascending order, with each number as a string, is:\n\n<<<['-84.1', '-64.04', '26.0', '33.07', '51.0', '88.1', '98.1']>>>"
