    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -36.1, -64.0, -29.7, and 60.34.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the largest number. Among the given numbers, 60.34 is the largest because it is the only positive number.\n   - Next, compare the negative numbers. The number with the smallest absolute value is the largest among negative numbers. Therefore, -29.7 is larger than -36.1 and -64.0.\n   - Between -36.1 and -64.0, -36.1 is larger because it is closer to zero.\n\n4. **Arrange the Numbers**: Based on the comparisons:\n   - The largest number is 60.34.\n   - The next largest is -29.7.\n   - Followed by -36.1.\n   - The smallest number is -64.0.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **List the Numbers**: Arrange them in a list in descending order.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is: <<<['60.34', '-29.7', '-36.1', '-64.0']>>>"
