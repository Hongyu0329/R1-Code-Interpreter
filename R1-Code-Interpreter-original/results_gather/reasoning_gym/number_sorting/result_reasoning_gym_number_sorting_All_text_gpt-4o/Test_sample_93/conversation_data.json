    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -55.49, -39.81, -64.0, 21.5, 26.0, and 42.0.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: We need to compare each number to determine their order from largest to smallest.\n\n4. **Sort the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the largest number. Among the given numbers, 42.0 is the largest.\n   - Next, find the second largest number, which is 26.0.\n   - Then, the third largest number is 21.5.\n   - Now, we move to the negative numbers. The largest (least negative) is -39.81.\n   - The next is -55.49.\n   - Finally, the smallest (most negative) number is -64.0.\n\n5. **List the Numbers in Descending Order**: Arrange the numbers from the largest to the smallest based on the comparisons made.\n\n6. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number in the list to a string format as per the instructions.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['42.0', '26.0', '21.5', '-39.81', '-55.49', '-64.0']>>>"
