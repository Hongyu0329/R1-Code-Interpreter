    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are 26.4, -4.21, 82.0, 95.85, and 88.7.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: \n   - Start by identifying the largest number. Among 26.4, -4.21, 82.0, 95.85, and 88.7, the largest is 95.85.\n   - Next, find the second largest number. After 95.85, the next largest is 88.7.\n   - Continue this process: after 88.7, the next largest is 82.0.\n   - Then, 26.4 follows 82.0.\n   - Finally, the smallest number is -4.21.\n\n4. **Arrange in Descending Order**: Based on the comparisons, the numbers in descending order are 95.85, 88.7, 82.0, 26.4, and -4.21.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: According to the instructions, convert each number to a string.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['95.85', '88.7', '82.0', '26.4', '-4.21']>>>"
