    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -31.0, -35.3, 2.0, and 35.97.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the largest number. Among -31.0, -35.3, 2.0, and 35.97, the largest number is 35.97.\n   - Next, compare the remaining numbers: -31.0, -35.3, and 2.0. The next largest number is 2.0.\n   - Now, compare -31.0 and -35.3. Since -31.0 is greater than -35.3, -31.0 comes next.\n   - Finally, the smallest number is -35.3.\n\n4. **Arrange in Descending Order**: Based on the comparisons, the numbers in descending order are 35.97, 2.0, -31.0, and -35.3.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: According to the instructions, convert each number to a string.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is: <<<['35.97', '2.0', '-31.0', '-35.3']>>>"
