    "To sort the numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers given are 56.44, 97.9, 39.78, and -25.13.\n\n2. **Understand Ascending Order**: Ascending order means arranging numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the smallest number. Here, -25.13 is the smallest because it is the only negative number.\n   - Next, compare the remaining positive numbers: 56.44, 97.9, and 39.78.\n   - Among these, 39.78 is the smallest.\n   - Then, compare 56.44 and 97.9. Here, 56.44 is smaller than 97.9.\n\n4. **Arrange the Numbers**: Based on the comparisons, the numbers in ascending order are -25.13, 39.78, 56.44, and 97.9.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the sorted numbers as a list of strings.\n\nThe final sorted list in ascending order is: <<<['-25.13', '39.78', '56.44', '97.9']>>>"
