    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -54.2, 9.0, -54.5, 91.27, 83.0, 58.0, and 1.2.\n\n2. **Understand Ascending Order**: Ascending order means arranging numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n\n3. **Compare Each Number**: \n   - Start by identifying the smallest number. \n   - Compare each number with the others to determine their order.\n\n4. **Order the Numbers**:\n   - The smallest number is -54.5.\n   - The next smallest number is -54.2.\n   - The next number is 1.2.\n   - Followed by 9.0.\n   - Then 58.0.\n   - Next is 83.0.\n   - The largest number is 91.27.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **List the Numbers**: List the numbers in ascending order as strings.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list of numbers in ascending order is:\n\n<<<['-54.5', '-54.2', '1.2', '9.0', '58.0', '83.0', '91.27']>>>"
