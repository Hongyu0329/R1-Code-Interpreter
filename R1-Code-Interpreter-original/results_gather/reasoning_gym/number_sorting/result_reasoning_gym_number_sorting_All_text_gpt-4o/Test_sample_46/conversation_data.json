    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: -80.8, 46.1, 49.0, 31.1, -19.86, -62.26.\n\n2. **Identify the Largest Number**: Look for the largest number in the list. Here, 49.0 is the largest.\n\n3. **Identify the Second Largest Number**: After 49.0, the next largest number is 46.1.\n\n4. **Continue Identifying in Descending Order**: \n   - After 46.1, the next largest number is 31.1.\n   - After 31.1, the next largest number is -19.86.\n   - After -19.86, the next largest number is -62.26.\n   - Finally, the smallest number is -80.8.\n\n5. **Arrange in Descending Order**: Arrange the numbers from the largest to the smallest based on the steps above.\n\n6. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number in the list to a string format as per the instruction.\n\n7. **Output the Final List**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['49.0', '46.1', '31.1', '-19.86', '-62.26', '-80.8']>>>"
