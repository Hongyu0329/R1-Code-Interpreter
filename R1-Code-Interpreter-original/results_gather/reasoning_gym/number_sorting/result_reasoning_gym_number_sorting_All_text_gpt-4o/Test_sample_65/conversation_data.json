    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -14.2, 83.0, 14.87, 55.0, 77.6, and -26.0.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: \n   - Start by identifying the largest number. In this case, 83.0 is the largest.\n   - Next, compare the remaining numbers to find the next largest. 77.6 is the second largest.\n   - Continue this process: 55.0 is the third largest, followed by 14.87.\n   - Finally, compare the negative numbers: -14.2 is larger than -26.0.\n\n4. **Arrange the Numbers**: Based on the comparisons, arrange the numbers in descending order: 83.0, 77.6, 55.0, 14.87, -14.2, -26.0.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is:\n<<<['83.0', '77.6', '55.0', '14.87', '-14.2', '-26.0']>>>"
