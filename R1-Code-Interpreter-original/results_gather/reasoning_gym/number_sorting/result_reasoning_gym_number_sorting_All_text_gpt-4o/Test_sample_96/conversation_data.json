    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -18.9, -73.0, 97.0, 27.6, 25.82, and 42.63.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: \n   - Start by identifying the largest number. Here, 97.0 is the largest.\n   - Next, compare the remaining numbers to find the next largest. 42.63 is the next largest after 97.0.\n   - Continue this process: 27.6 is next, followed by 25.82, then -18.9, and finally -73.0.\n\n4. **Arrange the Numbers**: Based on the comparisons, arrange the numbers in descending order: 97.0, 42.63, 27.6, 25.82, -18.9, -73.0.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instructions.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['97.0', '42.63', '27.6', '25.82', '-18.9', '-73.0']>>>"
