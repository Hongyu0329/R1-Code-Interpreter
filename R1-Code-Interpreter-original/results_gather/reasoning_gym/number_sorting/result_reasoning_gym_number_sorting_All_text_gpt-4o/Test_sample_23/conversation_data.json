    "To sort the numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: We have the following numbers to sort: 98.0, -70.01, -39.0, 49.4.\n\n2. **Convert to Comparable Format**: Since all numbers are already in decimal format, we can directly compare them.\n\n3. **Compare and Order**: \n   - Start by identifying the smallest number. Among 98.0, -70.01, -39.0, and 49.4, the smallest is -70.01.\n   - Next, compare the remaining numbers: -39.0, 49.4, and 98.0. The next smallest is -39.0.\n   - Then, compare the remaining numbers: 49.4 and 98.0. The next smallest is 49.4.\n   - Finally, the largest number is 98.0.\n\n4. **List in Ascending Order**: The numbers in ascending order are -70.01, -39.0, 49.4, and 98.0.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string format as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the sorted numbers as a list of strings.\n\nThe final sorted list in ascending order is: <<<['-70.01', '-39.0', '49.4', '98.0']>>>"
