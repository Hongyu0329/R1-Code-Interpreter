    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are 42.7, 31.9, -38.0, 61.0, 77.7, and -47.1.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: We need to compare each number to determine their order from largest to smallest.\n\n4. **Arrange the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the largest number: 77.7\n   - Next largest is 61.0\n   - Followed by 42.7\n   - Then 31.9\n   - Next is -38.0\n   - Finally, the smallest is -47.1\n\n5. **List the Numbers in Order**: Arrange them in descending order based on the comparison.\n\n6. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format.\n\nFollowing these steps, the numbers in descending order are:\n\n<<<['77.7', '61.0', '42.7', '31.9', '-38.0', '-47.1']>>>"
