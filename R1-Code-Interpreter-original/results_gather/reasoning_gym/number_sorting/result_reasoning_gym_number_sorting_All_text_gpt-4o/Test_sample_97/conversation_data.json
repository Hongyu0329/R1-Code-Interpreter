    "To solve the problem of sorting the given numbers in descending order, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are: -90.77, 91.02, -55.0, -77.63, -69.37, 57.51, -54.0.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: We need to compare each number to determine their order from largest to smallest:\n   - The largest number is 91.02.\n   - The next largest is 57.51.\n   - The next largest is -54.0.\n   - The next largest is -55.0.\n   - The next largest is -69.37.\n   - The next largest is -77.63.\n   - The smallest number is -90.77.\n\n4. **Arrange the Numbers**: Based on the comparison, arrange the numbers in descending order: 91.02, 57.51, -54.0, -55.0, -69.37, -77.63, -90.77.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format with numbers as strings in a list.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is:\n<<<['91.02', '57.51', '-54.0', '-55.0', '-69.37', '-77.63', '-90.77']>>>"
