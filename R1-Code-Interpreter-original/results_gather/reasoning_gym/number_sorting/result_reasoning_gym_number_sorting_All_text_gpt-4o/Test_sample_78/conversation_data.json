    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: 58.93, -50.4, 42.7, 8.0, 8.86, -37.0, -76.74, 82.0, -12.0.\n\n2. **Identify the Largest Number**: Look for the largest number in the list. Here, 82.0 is the largest.\n\n3. **Order the Remaining Numbers**: Continue to find the next largest number from the remaining list and repeat until all numbers are sorted.\n\n4. **Descending Order**: The numbers should be arranged from the largest to the smallest.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Once sorted, convert each number to a string format as per the instruction.\n\nLet's sort the numbers step by step:\n\n- Start with the largest: 82.0\n- Next largest: 58.93\n- Next: 42.7\n- Next: 8.86\n- Next: 8.0\n- Next: -12.0\n- Next: -37.0\n- Next: -50.4\n- Smallest: -76.74\n\nNow, convert each number to a string:\n\n- '82.0'\n- '58.93'\n- '42.7'\n- '8.86'\n- '8.0'\n- '-12.0'\n- '-37.0'\n- '-50.4'\n- '-76.74'\n\nFinally, the sorted list in descending order as strings is:\n\n<<<['82.0', '58.93', '42.7', '8.86', '8.0', '-12.0', '-37.0', '-50.4', '-76.74']>>>"
