    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: 4.0, 72.0, -24.1, -94.0, 14.0, -68.66, 37.8, 38.7, 18.2.\n\n2. **Identify the Largest Number**: Look through the list to find the largest number. In this case, 72.0 is the largest.\n\n3. **Order the Numbers**: Arrange the numbers from largest to smallest. This involves comparing each number with the others to determine their order.\n\n4. **Convert to Strings**: Once the numbers are sorted, convert each number to a string format as per the instruction.\n\n5. **List the Sorted Numbers**: Present the sorted numbers in a list format with each number as a string.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n- Start with the list: [4.0, 72.0, -24.1, -94.0, 14.0, -68.66, 37.8, 38.7, 18.2].\n- Identify the largest number: 72.0.\n- Sort the numbers in descending order: 72.0, 38.7, 37.8, 18.2, 14.0, 4.0, -24.1, -68.66, -94.0.\n- Convert each number to a string: '72.0', '38.7', '37.8', '18.2', '14.0', '4.0', '-24.1', '-68.66', '-94.0'.\n- Present the sorted list in the required format.\n\nFinal sorted list in descending order as strings:\n<<<['72.0', '38.7', '37.8', '18.2', '14.0', '4.0', '-24.1', '-68.66', '-94.0']>>>"
