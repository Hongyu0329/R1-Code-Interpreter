    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: -87.49, -9.3, -48.5, -22.0, 59.02, -95.0, -99.9, 45.0.\n\n2. **Identify the Largest Number**: Look for the largest number in the list. In this case, 59.02 is the largest.\n\n3. **Identify the Next Largest Number**: After 59.02, the next largest number is 45.0.\n\n4. **Continue the Process**: Continue identifying the next largest numbers in sequence:\n   - After 45.0, the next largest is -9.3.\n   - Then, -22.0.\n   - Followed by -48.5.\n   - Then, -87.49.\n   - Next, -95.0.\n   - Finally, -99.9.\n\n5. **Arrange in Descending Order**: Arrange the numbers from the largest to the smallest based on the sequence identified.\n\n6. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number in the list to a string format as per the instruction.\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: Present the final sorted list in the specified format.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['59.02', '45.0', '-9.3', '-22.0', '-48.5', '-87.49', '-95.0', '-99.9']>>>"
