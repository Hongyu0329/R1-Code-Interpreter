    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -8.7, -3.46, 4.11, -9.0, 72.0, and 82.3.\n\n2. **Understand Ascending Order**: Ascending order means arranging numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: \n   - Start by identifying the smallest number. In this case, -9.0 is the smallest.\n   - Next, compare the remaining numbers to find the next smallest. -8.7 is the next smallest.\n   - Continue this process: -3.46 is next, followed by 4.11, then 72.0, and finally 82.3.\n\n4. **List the Numbers in Order**: Arrange the numbers in the order identified: -9.0, -8.7, -3.46, 4.11, 72.0, 82.3.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format with each number as a string within a list.\n\nThe final sorted list in ascending order is:\n\n<<<['-9.0', '-8.7', '-3.46', '4.11', '72.0', '82.3']>>>"
