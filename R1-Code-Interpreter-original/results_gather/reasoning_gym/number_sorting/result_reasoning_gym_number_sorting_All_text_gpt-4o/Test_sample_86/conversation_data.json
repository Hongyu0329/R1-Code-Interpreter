    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -37.57, -28.0, -39.0, 21.56, and 93.6.\n\n2. **Understand Ascending Order**: Ascending order means arranging numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: \n   - Start by identifying the smallest number. In this case, -39.0 is the smallest.\n   - Next, compare the remaining numbers to find the next smallest. -37.57 is the next smallest.\n   - Continue this process: -28.0 is next, followed by 21.56, and finally 93.6.\n\n4. **List the Numbers in Order**: Arrange the numbers from the smallest to the largest based on the comparisons.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string format as per the instruction.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list in ascending order is:\n\n<<<['-39.0', '-37.57', '-28.0', '21.56', '93.6']>>>"
