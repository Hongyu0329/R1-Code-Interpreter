    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to carefully compare each number and arrange them from the smallest to the largest. Let's analyze the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the smallest number**: \n   - The numbers given are: -14.2, -79.7, 39.6, -91.26, -66.0, -34.39, -34.1, -38.43, -19.85.\n   - The smallest number is -91.26.\n\n2. **Identify the next smallest number**:\n   - After -91.26, the next smallest number is -79.7.\n\n3. **Continue identifying the next smallest numbers**:\n   - After -79.7, the next smallest number is -66.0.\n   - After -66.0, the next smallest number is -38.43.\n   - After -38.43, the next smallest number is -34.39.\n   - After -34.39, the next smallest number is -34.1.\n   - After -34.1, the next smallest number is -19.85.\n   - After -19.85, the next smallest number is -14.2.\n   - Finally, the largest number is 39.6.\n\n4. **List the numbers in ascending order**:\n   - The sorted order of the numbers is: -91.26, -79.7, -66.0, -38.43, -34.39, -34.1, -19.85, -14.2, 39.6.\n\n5. **Convert the numbers to strings and format the answer**:\n   - Convert each number to a string and format the answer as specified.\n\nThe final sorted list in ascending order is:\n<<<['-91.26', '-79.7', '-66.0', '-38.43', '-34.39', '-34.1', '-19.85', '-14.2', '39.6']>>>"
