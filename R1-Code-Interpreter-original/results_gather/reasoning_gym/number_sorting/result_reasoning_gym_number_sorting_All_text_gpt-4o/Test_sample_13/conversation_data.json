    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -16.5, -83.6, -95.7, -97.8, 61.5, 71.08, and -92.85.\n\n2. **Understand Ascending Order**: Ascending order means arranging numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: We need to compare each number to determine their order from smallest to largest.\n\n4. **Sort the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the smallest number. In this case, -97.8 is the smallest.\n   - Next, -95.7 is larger than -97.8 but smaller than the others.\n   - Then, -92.85 follows as it is larger than -95.7 but smaller than the rest.\n   - After that, -83.6 is next in the order.\n   - Then, -16.5 is larger than -83.6 but smaller than the positive numbers.\n   - Next, 61.5 is the smallest among the positive numbers.\n   - Finally, 71.08 is the largest number.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string format as per the instruction.\n\n6. **List the Sorted Numbers**: Arrange the numbers in a list format with each number as a string.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list of numbers in ascending order is:\n\n<<<['-97.8', '-95.7', '-92.85', '-83.6', '-16.5', '61.5', '71.08']>>>"
