    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -58.86, 96.0, -91.8, -18.9, 61.1, and 93.35.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: We need to compare each number to determine their order from largest to smallest.\n\n4. **Sort the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the largest number. Among the given numbers, 96.0 is the largest.\n   - Next, compare the remaining numbers to find the next largest. 93.35 is the next largest after 96.0.\n   - Continue this process: 61.1 is next, followed by -18.9, -58.86, and finally -91.8.\n\n5. **List the Numbers in Descending Order**: Arrange the numbers from the largest to the smallest based on the comparisons.\n\n6. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number in the sorted list to a string format as per the instructions.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['96.0', '93.35', '61.1', '-18.9', '-58.86', '-91.8']>>>"
