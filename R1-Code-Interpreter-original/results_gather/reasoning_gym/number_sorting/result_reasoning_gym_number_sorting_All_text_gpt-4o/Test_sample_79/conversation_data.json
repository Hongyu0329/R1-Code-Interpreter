    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are 84.2, -1.2, -17.0, 25.95, -16.0, and -63.3.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: We need to compare each number to determine their order from largest to smallest.\n\n4. **Order the Numbers**:\n   - Start with the largest number: 84.2\n   - Next largest is 25.95\n   - Then -1.2\n   - Followed by -16.0\n   - Then -17.0\n   - Finally, the smallest is -63.3\n\n5. **List the Numbers in Descending Order**: Arrange them as identified in the previous step.\n\n6. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string format as per the instruction.\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format with square brackets and commas.\n\nFollowing these steps, the numbers in descending order are:\n\n<<<['84.2', '25.95', '-1.2', '-16.0', '-17.0', '-63.3']>>>"
