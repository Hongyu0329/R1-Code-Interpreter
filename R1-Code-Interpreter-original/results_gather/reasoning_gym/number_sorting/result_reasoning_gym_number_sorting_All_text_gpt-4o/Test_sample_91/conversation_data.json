    "To sort the numbers -46.5, -47.0, and -24.18 in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: We have three numbers: -46.5, -47.0, and -24.18.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Compare -46.5 and -47.0: Since -46.5 is greater than -47.0 (because -46.5 is closer to zero), -46.5 should come before -47.0.\n   - Compare -46.5 and -24.18: Since -24.18 is greater than -46.5 (because -24.18 is closer to zero), -24.18 should come before -46.5.\n   - Compare -47.0 and -24.18: Since -24.18 is greater than -47.0, -24.18 should come before -47.0.\n\n4. **Arrange the Numbers**: Based on the comparisons, the order from largest to smallest is -24.18, -46.5, -47.0.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **List the Numbers**: Present the numbers in a list format with each number as a string.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['-24.18', '-46.5', '-47.0']>>>"
