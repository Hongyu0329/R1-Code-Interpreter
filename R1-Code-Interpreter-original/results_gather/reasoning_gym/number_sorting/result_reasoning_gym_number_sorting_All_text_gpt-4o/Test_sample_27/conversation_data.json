    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -83.08, 89.0, -72.8, 42.87, 24.3, and -24.35.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: We need to compare each number to determine their order from largest to smallest.\n\n4. **Sort the Numbers**:\n   - The largest number is 89.0.\n   - The next largest is 42.87.\n   - Followed by 24.3.\n   - Then -24.35.\n   - Next is -72.8.\n   - The smallest number is -83.08.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **List the Numbers**: Arrange the numbers in a list in descending order as strings.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['89.0', '42.87', '24.3', '-24.35', '-72.8', '-83.08']>>>"
