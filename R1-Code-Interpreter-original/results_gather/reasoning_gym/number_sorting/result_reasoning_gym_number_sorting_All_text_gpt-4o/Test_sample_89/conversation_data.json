    "To sort the numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers given are -56.4, 25.0, 22.9, and -64.5.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Start by comparing each number to determine which is the largest.\n   - 25.0 is greater than 22.9, -56.4, and -64.5.\n   - 22.9 is greater than -56.4 and -64.5.\n   - -56.4 is greater than -64.5.\n\n4. **Arrange the Numbers**: Based on the comparisons:\n   - The largest number is 25.0.\n   - The next largest is 22.9.\n   - Then comes -56.4.\n   - The smallest number is -64.5.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **List the Numbers**: Arrange them in a list in descending order.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is: <<<['25.0', '22.9', '-56.4', '-64.5']>>>"
