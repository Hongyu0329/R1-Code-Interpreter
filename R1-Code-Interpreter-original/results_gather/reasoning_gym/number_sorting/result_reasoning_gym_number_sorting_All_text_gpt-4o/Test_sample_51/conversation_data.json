    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are: 68.8, -82.3, -93.12, -58.0, -38.0, -17.9, -40.0, -4.91, 41.0, 64.0.\n\n2. **Understand Ascending Order**: Ascending order means arranging numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n\n3. **Compare and Arrange**: We need to compare each number with the others to determine their order from smallest to largest.\n\n4. **List the Numbers in Order**:\n   - Start with the smallest number: -93.12\n   - Next smallest: -82.3\n   - Then: -58.0\n   - Followed by: -40.0\n   - Then: -38.0\n   - Next: -17.9\n   - Followed by: -4.91\n   - Then: 41.0\n   - Next: 64.0\n   - Finally, the largest number: 68.8\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number in the sorted list to a string format.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\nThe sorted list of numbers in ascending order, converted to strings, is:\n\n<<<['-93.12', '-82.3', '-58.0', '-40.0', '-38.0', '-17.9', '-4.91', '41.0', '64.0', '68.8']>>>"
