    "To sort the numbers in ascending order, we need to compare each number and arrange them from the smallest to the largest. Let's analyze the given numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: The numbers provided are -41.2, -10.0, 99.0, and 63.96.\n\n2. **Compare the numbers**:\n   - **Negative numbers**: Among -41.2 and -10.0, -41.2 is smaller because it is more negative.\n   - **Positive numbers**: Between 99.0 and 63.96, 63.96 is smaller.\n\n3. **Order the numbers**:\n   - Start with the smallest negative number: -41.2\n   - Next is the larger negative number: -10.0\n   - Then the smaller positive number: 63.96\n   - Finally, the largest positive number: 99.0\n\n4. **List the numbers in ascending order**: The sequence from smallest to largest is -41.2, -10.0, 63.96, 99.0.\n\n5. **Convert the numbers to strings**: According to the instructions, we need to convert each number to a string format.\n\n6. **Format the final answer**: Place the string representations of the numbers in a list format as specified.\n\nThe final sorted list in ascending order is:\n<<<['-41.2', '-10.0', '63.96', '99.0']>>>"
