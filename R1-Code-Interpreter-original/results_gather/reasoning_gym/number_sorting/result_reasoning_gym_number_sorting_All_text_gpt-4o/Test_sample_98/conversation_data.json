    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: -45.34, 32.0, 29.0, -28.33, -32.3, 31.66, 76.75, -78.9, 90.0.\n\n2. **Identify the Largest Number**: Look for the largest number in the list. Here, 90.0 is the largest.\n\n3. **Identify the Second Largest Number**: After 90.0, the next largest number is 76.75.\n\n4. **Continue Identifying the Next Largest Numbers**: \n   - After 76.75, the next largest is 32.0.\n   - Then, 31.66 follows.\n   - Next is 29.0.\n\n5. **Identify the Negative Numbers in Descending Order**:\n   - The least negative (or largest in terms of absolute value) is -28.33.\n   - Followed by -32.3.\n   - Then -45.34.\n   - Finally, the most negative is -78.9.\n\n6. **Compile the Sorted List**: Combine all the numbers in descending order: 90.0, 76.75, 32.0, 31.66, 29.0, -28.33, -32.3, -45.34, -78.9.\n\n7. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number in the sorted list to a string format as per the instruction.\n\n8. **Format the Answer**: Present the final sorted list in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order, with each number as a string, is:\n\n<<<['90.0', '76.75', '32.0', '31.66', '29.0', '-28.33', '-32.3', '-45.34', '-78.9']>>>"
