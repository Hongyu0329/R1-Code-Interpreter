    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: 53.88, -42.0, 58.03, -48.0, -13.3.\n\n2. **Identify the Order**: We need to arrange these numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: \n   - Start by identifying the smallest number. In this list, -48.0 is the smallest.\n   - Next, compare the remaining numbers to find the next smallest. -42.0 is the next smallest.\n   - Continue this process: -13.3 is next.\n   - Then, 53.88 follows.\n   - Finally, 58.03 is the largest.\n\n4. **Arrange in Ascending Order**: Based on the comparisons, the numbers in ascending order are: -48.0, -42.0, -13.3, 53.88, 58.03.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number in the sorted list to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the final sorted list in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list in ascending order, with each number as a string, is:\n\n<<<['-48.0', '-42.0', '-13.3', '53.88', '58.03']>>>"
