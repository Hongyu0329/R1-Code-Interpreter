    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: 86.84, 47.0, 37.82, 47.83, -23.6, 74.0, -2.0, -56.0, -91.0, 38.29.\n\n2. **Identify the Largest Number**: Look for the largest number in the list. Here, 86.84 is the largest.\n\n3. **Identify the Next Largest Number**: After 86.84, the next largest number is 74.0.\n\n4. **Continue the Process**: Continue identifying the next largest numbers in sequence:\n   - 47.83\n   - 47.0\n   - 38.29\n   - 37.82\n   - -2.0\n   - -23.6\n   - -56.0\n   - -91.0\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Compile the Final List**: Arrange the numbers in descending order as strings.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['86.84', '74.0', '47.83', '47.0', '38.29', '37.82', '-2.0', '-23.6', '-56.0', '-91.0']>>>"
