    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: -96.65, 64.0, 90.7, 61.0, 61.9, -27.2, 48.1, 38.04, -6.37, -3.0.\n\n2. **Identify the Smallest Number**: Begin by identifying the smallest number in the list. Here, -96.65 is the smallest.\n\n3. **Order the Numbers**: Continue identifying the next smallest number and place it in order. Repeat this process until all numbers are sorted.\n\n4. **Convert to Strings**: Once the numbers are sorted, convert each number to a string format as per the instruction.\n\n5. **List the Sorted Numbers**: Finally, list the sorted numbers in the required format.\n\nLet's sort the numbers step by step:\n\n- Start with the smallest: -96.65\n- Next smallest: -27.2\n- Next: -6.37\n- Next: -3.0\n- Next: 38.04\n- Next: 48.1\n- Next: 61.0\n- Next: 61.9\n- Next: 64.0\n- Largest: 90.7\n\nNow, convert each number to a string and list them:\n\n<<<['-96.65', '-27.2', '-6.37', '-3.0', '38.04', '48.1', '61.0', '61.9', '64.0', '90.7']>>>"
