    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: -62.27, 46.77, 88.0, -37.0, -55.4, 44.6.\n\n2. **Identify the Negative and Positive Numbers**: \n   - Negative numbers: -62.27, -37.0, -55.4\n   - Positive numbers: 46.77, 88.0, 44.6\n\n3. **Sort the Negative Numbers in Ascending Order**: \n   - Compare the absolute values: |-62.27| = 62.27, |-55.4| = 55.4, |-37.0| = 37.0\n   - Order by increasing absolute value: -62.27, -55.4, -37.0\n\n4. **Sort the Positive Numbers in Ascending Order**: \n   - Compare the values: 44.6, 46.77, 88.0\n   - Order by increasing value: 44.6, 46.77, 88.0\n\n5. **Combine the Sorted Lists**: \n   - Combine the sorted negative numbers with the sorted positive numbers to get the full list in ascending order.\n\n6. **Convert All Numbers to Strings**: \n   - Convert each number in the final sorted list to a string format.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list in ascending order is:\n\n<<<['-62.27', '-55.4', '-37.0', '44.6', '46.77', '88.0']>>>"
