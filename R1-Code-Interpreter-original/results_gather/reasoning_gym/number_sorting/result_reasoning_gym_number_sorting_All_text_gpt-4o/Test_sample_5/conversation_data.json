    "To sort the numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: We have the numbers 87.06, 68.38, 3.0, and 96.7.\n\n2. **Compare the Numbers**: We need to compare each number to determine their order from smallest to largest.\n\n3. **Order the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the smallest number. Among 87.06, 68.38, 3.0, and 96.7, the smallest number is 3.0.\n   - Next, find the second smallest number. After 3.0, the next smallest number is 68.38.\n   - Then, identify the third smallest number. After 68.38, the next smallest number is 87.06.\n   - Finally, the largest number is 96.7.\n\n4. **List the Numbers in Ascending Order**: Arrange the numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string format as per the instruction.\n\nFollowing these steps, the numbers in ascending order are:\n\n<<<['3.0', '68.38', '87.06', '96.7']>>>"
