    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: -61.0, 7.5, 50.86, 98.29, 83.4, 37.5, -87.65.\n\n2. **Identify the Smallest Number**: Look through the list to find the smallest number. In this case, -87.65 is the smallest.\n\n3. **Identify the Next Smallest Number**: After -87.65, the next smallest number is -61.0.\n\n4. **Continue Finding the Next Smallest Numbers**: \n   - After -61.0, the next smallest number is 7.5.\n   - After 7.5, the next smallest number is 37.5.\n   - After 37.5, the next smallest number is 50.86.\n   - After 50.86, the next smallest number is 83.4.\n   - Finally, the largest number is 98.29.\n\n5. **List the Numbers in Ascending Order**: Arrange the numbers from the smallest to the largest based on the steps above.\n\n6. **Convert Numbers to Strings**: Convert each number in the sorted list to a string format as per the instructions.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list of numbers in ascending order is:\n\n<<<['-87.65', '-61.0', '7.5', '37.5', '50.86', '83.4', '98.29']>>>"
