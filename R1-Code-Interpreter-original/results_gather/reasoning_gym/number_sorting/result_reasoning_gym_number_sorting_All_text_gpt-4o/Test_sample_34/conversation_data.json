    "To sort the numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers given are -38.0, 57.4, -48.78, and -81.0.\n\n2. **Convert to Comparable Format**: Since all numbers are already in decimal format, we can directly compare them.\n\n3. **Compare and Order**: \n   - Start by identifying the smallest number. \n   - Compare -81.0 with the other numbers: -81.0 is less than -48.78, -38.0, and 57.4.\n   - Next, compare -48.78 with the remaining numbers: -48.78 is less than -38.0 and 57.4.\n   - Then, compare -38.0 with 57.4: -38.0 is less than 57.4.\n   - Finally, 57.4 is the largest number.\n\n4. **List in Ascending Order**: Arrange the numbers from the smallest to the largest based on the comparisons.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string format as per the instruction.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list in ascending order is:\n\n<<<['-81.0', '-48.78', '-38.0', '57.4']>>>"
