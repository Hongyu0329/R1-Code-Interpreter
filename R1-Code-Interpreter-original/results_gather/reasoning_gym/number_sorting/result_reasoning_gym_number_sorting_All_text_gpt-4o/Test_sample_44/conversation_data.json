    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: -7.3, -60.0, -89.0, -43.7, -2.0, -33.1, -54.52, -87.92.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: In descending order, numbers are arranged from the largest to the smallest. Since all numbers are negative, the number with the smallest absolute value is considered the largest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: Compare each number to determine their order from largest to smallest:\n   - -2.0 is the largest because it has the smallest absolute value.\n   - -7.3 is next, as it is larger than the remaining numbers.\n   - -33.1 follows, being larger than -43.7, -54.52, -60.0, -87.92, and -89.0.\n   - -43.7 is next.\n   - -54.52 comes after -43.7.\n   - -60.0 follows -54.52.\n   - -87.92 is larger than -89.0.\n   - -89.0 is the smallest.\n\n4. **Order the Numbers**: Arrange the numbers in descending order based on the comparisons:\n   - -2.0, -7.3, -33.1, -43.7, -54.52, -60.0, -87.92, -89.0.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number in the ordered list to a string format as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the final sorted list in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['-2.0', '-7.3', '-33.1', '-43.7', '-54.52', '-60.0', '-87.92', '-89.0']>>>"
