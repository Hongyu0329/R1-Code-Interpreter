    "To sort the numbers -5.27, -39.77, and 97.7 in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: We have three numbers: -5.27, -39.77, and 97.7.\n\n2. **Understand Ascending Order**: Ascending order means arranging numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Compare -5.27 and -39.77: Since -39.77 is less than -5.27, -39.77 comes first.\n   - Compare -5.27 and 97.7: Since -5.27 is less than 97.7, -5.27 comes before 97.7.\n   - Compare -39.77 and 97.7: Since -39.77 is less than 97.7, -39.77 comes before 97.7.\n\n4. **Arrange the Numbers**: Based on the comparisons, the order from smallest to largest is -39.77, -5.27, and 97.7.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the sorted numbers in the specified format.\n\nThe sorted list of numbers in ascending order is: <<<['-39.77', '-5.27', '97.7']>>>"
