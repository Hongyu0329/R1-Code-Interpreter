    "To sort the numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers given are -95.0, -51.0, 47.29, and 48.13.\n\n2. **Understand Ascending Order**: Ascending order means arranging numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Start by comparing the first two numbers: -95.0 and -51.0. Since -95.0 is less than -51.0, it comes first.\n   - Next, compare -51.0 with the next number, 47.29. Since -51.0 is less than 47.29, it remains in its position.\n   - Finally, compare 47.29 with 48.13. Since 47.29 is less than 48.13, it remains in its position.\n\n4. **List the Numbers in Order**: After comparing all numbers, the order from smallest to largest is -95.0, -51.0, 47.29, 48.13.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: According to the instructions, convert each number to a string.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format.\n\nThe sorted list of numbers in ascending order is: <<<['-95.0', '-51.0', '47.29', '48.13']>>>"
