    "To solve the problem of sorting the given numbers in descending order, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: -88.0, 91.8, 75.0, 1.0, -50.47, 30.5, 12.02, -84.5.\n\n2. **Identify the Order**: We need to sort these numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: \n   - The largest number is 91.8.\n   - The next largest is 75.0.\n   - Followed by 30.5.\n   - Then 12.02.\n   - Next is 1.0.\n   - Then -50.47.\n   - Followed by -84.5.\n   - The smallest number is -88.0.\n\n4. **Sort the Numbers**: Arrange the numbers in descending order based on the comparison:\n   - 91.8, 75.0, 30.5, 12.02, 1.0, -50.47, -84.5, -88.0.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number in the sorted list to a string format.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the final sorted list in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order, with each number as a string, is:\n\n<<<['91.8', '75.0', '30.5', '12.02', '1.0', '-50.47', '-84.5', '-88.0']>>>"
