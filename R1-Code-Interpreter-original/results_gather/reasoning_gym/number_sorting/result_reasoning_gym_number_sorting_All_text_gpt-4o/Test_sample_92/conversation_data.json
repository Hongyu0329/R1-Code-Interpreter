    "To solve the problem of sorting the given numbers in descending order, let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are 10.0, 89.0, -16.8, -94.0, -20.5, 63.0, and 8.61.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: We need to compare each number to determine their order from largest to smallest.\n\n4. **Sort the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the largest number: 89.0\n   - Next largest is 63.0\n   - Followed by 10.0\n   - Then 8.61\n   - Next is -16.8\n   - Followed by -20.5\n   - Finally, the smallest is -94.0\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **List the Numbers**: Arrange the numbers in a list in descending order as strings.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['89.0', '63.0', '10.0', '8.61', '-16.8', '-20.5', '-94.0']>>>"
