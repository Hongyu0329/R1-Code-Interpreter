    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: -75.03, -19.21, -96.6, 40.82, 61.0, 39.73, 95.0, 72.3, -60.0, -83.27.\n\n2. **Identify the Smallest Number**: Look for the smallest number in the list. Here, -96.6 is the smallest.\n\n3. **Order the Numbers**: Arrange the numbers from the smallest to the largest. This involves comparing each number with the others to determine their order.\n\n4. **Convert to Strings**: Once the numbers are sorted, convert each number to a string format as per the instruction.\n\n5. **List the Sorted Numbers**: Present the sorted numbers in a list format with each number as a string.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list in ascending order is:\n\n- -96.6\n- -83.27\n- -75.03\n- -60.0\n- -19.21\n- 39.73\n- 40.82\n- 61.0\n- 72.3\n- 95.0\n\nNow, convert each number to a string and present them in a list:\n\nFinal sorted list: <<<['-96.6', '-83.27', '-75.03', '-60.0', '-19.21', '39.73', '40.82', '61.0', '72.3', '95.0']>>>"
