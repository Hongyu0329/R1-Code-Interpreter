    "To sort the given numbers in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start with the list of numbers provided: -75.6, 12.8, -40.0, -2.55, 0.1, -77.9, -18.0.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Identify the Largest Number**: Among the given numbers, identify the largest number. Here, 12.8 is the largest.\n\n4. **Continue Identifying the Next Largest**: After 12.8, the next largest number is 0.1.\n\n5. **Continue the Process**: Continue identifying the next largest numbers in sequence: -2.55, -18.0, -40.0, -75.6, and finally -77.9.\n\n6. **List in Descending Order**: Arrange the numbers in the order identified: 12.8, 0.1, -2.55, -18.0, -40.0, -75.6, -77.9.\n\n7. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number in the list to a string format as per the instruction.\n\n8. **Format the Answer**: Present the final sorted list in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is:\n\n<<<['12.8', '0.1', '-2.55', '-18.0', '-40.0', '-75.6', '-77.9']>>>"
