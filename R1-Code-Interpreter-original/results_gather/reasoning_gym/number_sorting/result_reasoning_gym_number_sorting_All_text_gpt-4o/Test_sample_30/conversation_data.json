Instead of reporting your answer as -69, -13, 1, 7, 11, 43, 59, 61, use <<<['-69', '-13', '1', '7', '11', '43', '59', '61']>>> instead\n## 2. Convert all numbers in the square brackets as strings. For example, <<<['-69', '-13', '1', '7', '11', '43', '59', '61']>>>\n",

    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -87.0, 78.5, 79.6, -66.0, and -67.7.\n\n2. **Convert to Strings**: Before sorting, we need to ensure that each number is treated as a string for the final output. However, for sorting purposes, we will consider them as numbers.\n\n3. **Sort the Numbers**: We will sort the numbers from the smallest to the largest. The order of the numbers from smallest to largest is:\n   - -87.0\n   - -67.7\n   - -66.0\n   - 78.5\n   - 79.6\n\n4. **Convert Sorted Numbers to Strings**: After sorting, convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: Present the sorted list of numbers as strings within square brackets and separated by commas.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list of numbers in ascending order is:\n\n<<<['-87.0', '-67.7', '-66.0', '78.5', '79.6']>>>"
