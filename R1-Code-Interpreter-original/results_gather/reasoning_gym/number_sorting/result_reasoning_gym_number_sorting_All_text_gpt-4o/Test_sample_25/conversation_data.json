    "To sort the numbers -26.45, -96.14, and -35.8 in descending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: We have three numbers: -26.45, -96.14, and -35.8.\n\n2. **Understand Descending Order**: Descending order means arranging numbers from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Compare -26.45 and -96.14: -26.45 is greater than -96.14 because it is closer to zero.\n   - Compare -26.45 and -35.8: -26.45 is greater than -35.8 because it is closer to zero.\n   - Compare -35.8 and -96.14: -35.8 is greater than -96.14 because it is closer to zero.\n\n4. **Arrange in Descending Order**: Based on the comparisons:\n   - The largest number is -26.45.\n   - The next largest number is -35.8.\n   - The smallest number is -96.14.\n\n5. **List the Numbers as Strings**: Convert each number to a string and list them in descending order.\n\nThe final sorted list in descending order is: <<<['-26.45', '-35.8', '-96.14']>>>"
