    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are -75.2, -40.0, 37.5, 90.4, and 19.0.\n\n2. **Understand Ascending Order**: Ascending order means arranging numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Start by identifying the smallest number. In this case, -75.2 is the smallest.\n   - Next, compare the remaining numbers to find the next smallest. -40.0 is the next smallest after -75.2.\n   - Continue this process: 19.0 is smaller than 37.5 and 90.4, so it comes next.\n   - Then, 37.5 is smaller than 90.4, so it follows 19.0.\n   - Finally, 90.4 is the largest number.\n\n4. **Arrange the Numbers**: Based on the comparisons, the numbers in ascending order are -75.2, -40.0, 19.0, 37.5, and 90.4.\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the sorted numbers as a list of strings.\n\nThe final sorted list in ascending order is: <<<['-75.2', '-40.0', '19.0', '37.5', '90.4']>>>"
