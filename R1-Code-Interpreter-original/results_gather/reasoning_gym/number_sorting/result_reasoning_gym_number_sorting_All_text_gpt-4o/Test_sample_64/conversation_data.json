    "To sort the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are: -37.07, -21.0, -80.8, 51.76, 77.0, -18.6, -82.6, -29.0.\n\n2. **Understand Ascending Order**: Ascending order means arranging numbers from the smallest to the largest.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: We need to compare each number to determine their order from smallest to largest. Negative numbers are smaller than positive numbers, and among negative numbers, the one with the larger absolute value is smaller.\n\n4. **Sort the Numbers**:\n   - Start with the smallest number: -82.6\n   - Next is -80.8\n   - Then -37.07\n   - Followed by -29.0\n   - Then -21.0\n   - Followed by -18.6\n   - Next is 51.76\n   - Finally, the largest number is 77.0\n\n5. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\nThe sorted list of numbers in ascending order is:\n\n<<<['-82.6', '-80.8', '-37.07', '-29.0', '-21.0', '-18.6', '51.76', '77.0']>>>"
