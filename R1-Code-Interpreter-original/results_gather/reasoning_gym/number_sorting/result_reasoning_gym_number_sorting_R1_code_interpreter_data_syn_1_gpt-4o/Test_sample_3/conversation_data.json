Instead of reporting your answer as -69, -13, 1, 7, 11, 43, 59, 61, use <<<['-69', '-13', '1', '7', '11', '43', '59', '61']>>> instead\n## 2. Convert all numbers in the square brackets as strings. For example, <<<['-69', '-13', '1', '7', '11', '43', '59', '61']>>>\n",

    "To solve the problem of sorting the given numbers in ascending order, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: Start by listing the numbers provided in the problem.\n2. **Sort the Numbers**: Use a sorting algorithm or a built-in function to sort the numbers in ascending order.\n3. **Convert to Strings**: Convert each number in the sorted list to a string format.\n4. **Format the Output**: Ensure the output is in the specified format with each number as a string in a list.\n\nLet's implement this using Python code to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\n# List of numbers to sort\nnumbers = [50.11, -32.0, -42.8, 13.35, 5.2, 30.58, 84.0, -27.14]\n\n# Sort the numbers in ascending order\nsorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n\n# Convert each number to a string\nsorted_numbers_as_strings = [str(num) for num in sorted_numbers]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(sorted_numbers_as_strings)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list of numbers in the required format.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the numbers have been sorted in ascending order. Each number has been converted to a string, and the output is formatted as required.\n\n<<<['-42.8', '-32.0', '-27.14', '5.2', '13.35', '30.58', '50.11', '84.0']>>>"
