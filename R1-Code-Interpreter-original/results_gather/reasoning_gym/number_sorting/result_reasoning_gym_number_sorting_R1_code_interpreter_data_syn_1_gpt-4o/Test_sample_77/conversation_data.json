    "To solve the problem of sorting the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Numbers**: The numbers provided are -54.2, 9.0, -54.5, 91.27, 83.0, 58.0, and 1.2.\n\n2. **Sort the Numbers**: We will sort these numbers in ascending order. This means arranging them from the smallest to the largest.\n\n3. **Convert Numbers to Strings**: After sorting, we need to convert each number to a string format as per the instructions.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: Finally, we will output the sorted list of numbers in string format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\n# List of numbers to be sorted\nnumbers = [-54.2, 9.0, -54.5, 91.27, 83.0, 58.0, 1.2]\n\n# Sorting the numbers in ascending order\nsorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n\n# Converting each number to a string\nsorted_numbers_as_strings = [str(num) for num in sorted_numbers]\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(sorted_numbers_as_strings)\n```\n\nThis code will sort the numbers and convert them to strings, providing the desired output format.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sorted list of numbers in ascending order, with each number converted to a string. Now, I will present the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<['-54.5', '-54.2', '1.2', '9.0', '58.0', '83.0', '91.27']>>>"
