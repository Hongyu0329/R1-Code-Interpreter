Instead of reporting your answer as -69, -13, 1, 7, 11, 43, 59, 61, use <<<['-69', '-13', '1', '7', '11', '43', '59', '61']>>> instead\n## 2. Convert all numbers in the square brackets as strings. For example, <<<['-69', '-13', '1', '7', '11', '43', '59', '61']>>>\n",

    "To solve the problem of sorting the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the given numbers into a list.\n2. Sort the list in ascending order.\n3. Convert each number in the sorted list to a string.\n4. Return the final list of strings in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this process using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Create a list of the given numbers\nnumbers = [-37.57, -28.0, -39.0, 21.56, 93.6]\n\n# Step 2: Sort the list in ascending order\nsorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n\n# Step 3: Convert each number to a string\nsorted_numbers_as_strings = [str(num) for num in sorted_numbers]\n\n# Step 4: Print the final list of strings\nprint(sorted_numbers_as_strings)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list of numbers as strings.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the sorted list of numbers in ascending order, with each number converted to a string. \n\nThe final answer, formatted as specified, is:\n\n<<<['-39.0', '-37.57', '-28.0', '21.56', '93.6']>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Sort these numbers in ascending order: -37.57, -28.0, -39.0, 21.56, 93.6\nPlease follow the instruction below:\n## 1.
