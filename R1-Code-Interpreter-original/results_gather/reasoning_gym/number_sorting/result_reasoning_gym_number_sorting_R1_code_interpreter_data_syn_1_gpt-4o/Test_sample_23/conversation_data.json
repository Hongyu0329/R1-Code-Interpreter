    "To solve the problem of sorting the given numbers in ascending order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are 98.0, -70.01, -39.0, and 49.4.\n2. **Sort the Numbers**: We need to sort these numbers in ascending order.\n3. **Convert to Strings**: After sorting, convert each number to a string as per the instruction.\n4. **Output the Result**: Present the sorted list of numbers as strings in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\n# List of numbers to sort\nnumbers = [98.0, -70.01, -39.0, 49.4]\n\n# Sort the numbers in ascending order\nsorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n\n# Convert each number to a string\nsorted_numbers_as_strings = [str(num) for num in sorted_numbers]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(sorted_numbers_as_strings)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the sorted list of numbers as strings.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sorted list of numbers as strings. Based on the output, the numbers have been sorted in ascending order and converted to strings as required.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['-70.01', '-39.0', '49.4', '98.0']>>>"
