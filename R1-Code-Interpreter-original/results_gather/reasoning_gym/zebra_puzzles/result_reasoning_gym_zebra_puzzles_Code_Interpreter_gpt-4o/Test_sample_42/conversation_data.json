    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite cigars, drinks, and lunches in each house. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. The boba tea drinker is the person who loves the soup.\n2. The Prince smoker is the one who only drinks water.\n3. Arnold is in the third house.\n4. Carol and the boba tea drinker are next to each other.\n5. The person partial to Pall Mall is the person who likes milk.\n6. The coffee drinker is the person who is a pizza lover.\n7. The person partial to Pall Mall is in the third house.\n8. The coffee drinker is Carol.\n9. The person who smokes Blue Master and the person who loves stir fry are next to each other.\n10. Bob is directly left of Arnold.\n\nLet's start by placing Arnold in the third house, as per clue 3. Since the person who is partial to Pall Mall is also in the third house (clue 7), Arnold must be the one who smokes Pall Mall and drinks milk (clue 5).\n\nNow, let's place Bob directly left of Arnold, which means Bob is in the second house (clue 10).\n\nSince Carol is the coffee drinker and pizza lover (clues 6 and 8), and she must be next to the boba tea drinker (clue 4), Carol must be in the fourth house. This means the boba tea drinker is in the second house, which is Bob's house. Therefore, Bob loves soup (clue 1).\n\nThe only house left for Alice is the first house.\n\nNow, let's place the remaining cigars and drinks:\n\n- The Prince smoker drinks water (clue 2). Since Arnold drinks milk, and Bob drinks boba tea, the Prince smoker must be Alice in the first house.\n- The person who smokes Blue Master and the person who loves stir fry are next to each other (clue 9). Since Carol is in the fourth house and loves pizza, Alice must love stir fry, and Bob must smoke Blue Master.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- House 1: Alice, Prince, Water, Stir Fry\n- House 2: Bob, Blue Master, Boba Tea, Soup\n- House 3: Arnold, Pall Mall, Milk, Grilled Cheese\n- House 4: Carol, (unknown cigar), Coffee, Pizza\n\nThe only cigar left for Carol is Dunhill.\n\nTherefore, the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Alice>>>."
