    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, cigars, colors, and animals in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. The Prince smoker is in the fourth house.\n2. The person who smokes Blue Master is in the first house.\n3. The dog owner is directly left of the person partial to Pall Mall.\n4. The person who loves brown is the cat lover.\n5. The cat lover is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n6. The dog owner is the person who loves blue.\n7. Bob is directly left of Carol.\n8. The person who loves white is Arnold.\n9. The bird keeper is Carol.\n10. The Prince smoker is Carol.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know for sure:\n\n- House 1: Blue Master smoker\n- House 4: Prince smoker (Carol)\n\nNow, let's use the other clues to fill in the rest:\n\n- Since Carol is in House 4 and is the Prince smoker, Bob must be in House 3 (directly left of Carol).\n- The person who loves white is Arnold, so Arnold cannot be in House 1 or 4. Therefore, Arnold must be in House 2.\n- The person who loves blue is the dog owner, and since House 1 is the only house left, the person in House 1 must love blue and own a dog.\n- The person in House 3 (Bob) is directly left of the person partial to Pall Mall, so the person in House 4 (Carol) must be partial to Pall Mall. However, this contradicts the fact that Carol is the Prince smoker. Therefore, the person in House 3 (Bob) must be partial to Pall Mall.\n- The person who loves brown is the cat lover, and since the cat lover is partial to Pall Mall, Bob must love brown and own a cat.\n- The bird keeper is Carol, so Carol must own a bird.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information:\n\n- House 1: Blue Master smoker, loves blue, owns a dog\n- House 2: Arnold, loves white\n- House 3: Bob, Pall Mall smoker, loves brown, owns a cat\n- House 4: Carol, Prince smoker, owns a bird\n\nThe only person left without a house is Alice, who must be in House 1.\n\nTherefore, the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Alice>>>."
