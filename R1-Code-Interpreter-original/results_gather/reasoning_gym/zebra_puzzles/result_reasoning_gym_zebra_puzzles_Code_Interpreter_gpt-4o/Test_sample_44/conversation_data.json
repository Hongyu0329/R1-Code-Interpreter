    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite smoothies, their children, and their favorite cigars in each house.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. Alice's child is named Bella.\n2. The Prince smoker is the mother of Timothy.\n3. The Desert smoothie lover is in the first house.\n4. Arnold is in the fourth house.\n5. Bob is in the second house.\n6. The Butterscotch smoothie drinker is the Dunhill smoker.\n7. The Darkness smoothie drinker is the Prince smoker.\n8. Bob is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n9. The mother of Billy is in the fourth house.\n10. The Blue Master smoker is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n\nNow, let's use these clues to fill in the details for each house:\n\n- House 1: \n  - The Desert smoothie lover is here (Clue 3).\n\n- House 2:\n  - Bob is here (Clue 5).\n  - Bob is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker (Clue 8).\n  - The Butterscotch smoothie drinker is the Dunhill smoker (Clue 6).\n\n- House 3:\n  - The Prince smoker is the mother of Timothy (Clue 2).\n  - The Darkness smoothie drinker is the Prince smoker (Clue 7).\n\n- House 4:\n  - Arnold is here (Clue 4).\n  - The mother of Billy is here (Clue 9).\n\nNow, let's deduce the remaining details:\n\n- Since Alice's child is Bella (Clue 1), Alice cannot be in House 3 or House 4 (as House 3 is Timothy's mother and House 4 is Billy's mother). Therefore, Alice must be in House 1.\n\n- Since the Blue Master smoker is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover (Clue 10), and the Desert smoothie lover is in House 1, the Blue Master smoker must be in House 3 or House 4.\n\n- Since Arnold is in House 4, and the mother of Billy is in House 4, Arnold must be the mother of Billy.\n\n- Since the Prince smoker is the mother of Timothy and the Darkness smoothie drinker, and Bob is in House 2, the Prince smoker must be in House 3.\n\n- Since Alice is in House 1, and Bob is in House 2, the only person left for House 3 is Carol.\n\n- Therefore, the person in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Alice>>>."
