    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, let's organize the information given and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the houses.\n\n1. The person who uses a Huawei P50 is the mother of Billy.\n2. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is directly left of the person who loves brown.\n3. The person who loves purple is Bob.\n4. Bob is in the third house.\n5. Carol is the person who loves blue.\n6. Carol is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.\n7. The mother of Timothy is in the second house.\n8. The person whose child is named Alice is directly left of Alice.\n9. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is in the first house.\n\nLet's deduce the information step by step:\n\n- From point 9, the person who uses a OnePlus 9 is in the first house.\n- From point 2, the person who uses a OnePlus 9 is directly left of the person who loves brown. Therefore, the person who loves brown is in the second house.\n- From point 7, the mother of Timothy is in the second house.\n- From point 3 and 4, Bob loves purple and is in the third house.\n- From point 5 and 6, Carol loves blue and uses a Google Pixel 6.\n- From point 8, the person whose child is named Alice is directly left of Alice. Therefore, Alice is in the second house, and the person whose child is named Alice is in the first house.\n\nNow, let's fill in the information:\n\n- House 1: Uses OnePlus 9, child named Alice\n- House 2: Loves brown, mother of Timothy, Alice\n- House 3: Bob, loves purple\n- House 4: Carol, loves blue, uses Google Pixel 6\n\nFrom point 1, the person who uses a Huawei P50 is the mother of Billy. Since Carol uses a Google Pixel 6, the person in House 1 must use a Huawei P50 and be the mother of Billy.\n\nNow, let's assign the names:\n\n- House 1: Arnold (mother of Billy, uses Huawei P50)\n- House 2: Alice (mother of Timothy, loves brown)\n- House 3: Bob (loves purple)\n- House 4: Carol (loves blue, uses Google Pixel 6)\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Arnold>>>"
