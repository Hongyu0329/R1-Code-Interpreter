    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their nationalities, favorite drinks, and favorite smoothies in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. Alice is directly left of Carol.\n2. The boba tea drinker is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n3. The boba tea drinker is the German.\n4. The Darkness smoothie drinker is the Dane.\n5. Alice is the British person.\n6. The person who likes milk is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n7. The Darkness smoothie drinker is in the second house.\n8. Bob is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n9. The one who only drinks water is directly left of the Desert smoothie lover.\n10. Carol is the Darkness smoothie drinker.\n\nLet's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n- From clue 7, we know that the Darkness smoothie drinker is in the second house.\n- From clue 10, Carol is the Darkness smoothie drinker, so Carol is in the second house.\n- From clue 4, the Darkness smoothie drinker is the Dane, so Carol is the Dane.\n- From clue 1, Alice is directly left of Carol, so Alice is in the first house.\n- From clue 5, Alice is the British person.\n- From clue 8, Bob is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n- From clue 2, the boba tea drinker is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker, so Bob is the boba tea drinker.\n- From clue 3, the boba tea drinker is the German, so Bob is the German.\n- From clue 6, the person who likes milk is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n- From clue 9, the one who only drinks water is directly left of the Desert smoothie lover.\n\nNow, let's fill in the information we have:\n\n- House 1: Alice (British)\n- House 2: Carol (Dane, Darkness smoothie)\n- House 3: Bob (German, Boba tea, Butterscotch smoothie)\n- House 4: ???\n\nSince Alice is in House 1 and Carol is in House 2, Bob must be in House 3. The only person left is Arnold, who must be in House 4.\n\nNow, let's determine the drinks and smoothies for Arnold:\n\n- From clue 9, the one who only drinks water is directly left of the Desert smoothie lover. Since Bob is in House 3, Arnold must be the Desert smoothie lover, and Alice must be the one who only drinks water.\n\nFinally, the person in House 1 is Alice.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Alice>>>."
