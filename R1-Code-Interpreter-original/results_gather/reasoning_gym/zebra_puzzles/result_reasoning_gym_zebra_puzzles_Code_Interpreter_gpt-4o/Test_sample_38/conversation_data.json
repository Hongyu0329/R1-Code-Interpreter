    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their lunches, their children, and their favorite flowers in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. The person's child named Alice is in the third house.\n2. The mother of Billy loves the bouquet of iris.\n3. Arnold loves pizza.\n4. The mother of Timothy is in the fourth house.\n5. The person who loves stir fry has a child named Bella.\n6. Alice loves grilled cheese.\n7. The mother of Billy is directly left of the person who loves lilies.\n8. The person who loves soup is the mother of Timothy.\n9. The person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the first house.\n10. Carol loves daffodils.\n11. The mother of Billy loves pizza.\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:\n\n- From clue 9, the person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the first house.\n- From clue 2 and 11, the mother of Billy loves the bouquet of iris and pizza. Therefore, the mother of Billy is in the first house and is Arnold (from clue 3).\n- From clue 10, Carol loves daffodils. Since Arnold is in the first house, Carol cannot be in the first house.\n- From clue 4, the mother of Timothy is in the fourth house.\n- From clue 8, the person who loves soup is the mother of Timothy, so the person in the fourth house loves soup.\n- From clue 6, Alice loves grilled cheese. Since Arnold is in the first house, Alice cannot be in the first house.\n- From clue 1, the person's child named Alice is in the third house.\n- From clue 5, the person who loves stir fry has a child named Bella. Since Arnold is in the first house, this person cannot be in the first house.\n- From clue 7, the mother of Billy is directly left of the person who loves lilies. Since Arnold is in the first house, the person who loves lilies is in the second house.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining people and characteristics:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, loves pizza, mother of Billy, loves iris.\n- House 2: Carol, loves daffodils, loves lilies.\n- House 3: Alice, loves grilled cheese, child named Alice.\n- House 4: Bob, loves soup, mother of Timothy.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Arnold>>>."
