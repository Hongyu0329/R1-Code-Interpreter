    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their lunches, phone models, and favorite flowers in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. Alice is the person who is a pizza lover.\n2. The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is directly left of the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n3. The person who loves the soup is in the second house.\n4. Carol and the person who loves carnations are next to each other.\n5. The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is directly left of the person who loves stir fry.\n6. The person who is a pizza lover and the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 are next to each other.\n7. Bob is directly left of the person who is a pizza lover.\n8. The person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the third house.\n\nLet's analyze these clues step by step:\n\n- From clue 3, we know that the person who loves soup is in the second house.\n- From clue 8, the person who loves iris is in the third house.\n- From clue 1, Alice loves pizza.\n- From clue 7, Bob is directly left of Alice, so Bob is in house 1 and Alice is in house 2.\n- From clue 6, Alice (pizza lover) is next to the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21, so the person in house 3 uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n- From clue 5, the person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is directly left of the person who loves stir fry. Since Alice is in house 2 and loves pizza, the person in house 1 must use a Google Pixel 6, and the person in house 2 loves stir fry.\n- From clue 2, the person who loves daffodils is directly left of the person who uses a Huawei P50. Since house 3 uses a Samsung Galaxy S21, house 4 must use a Huawei P50, and house 3 loves daffodils.\n- From clue 4, Carol and the person who loves carnations are next to each other. Since house 3 loves daffodils and house 2 loves stir fry, house 4 must love carnations, and Carol must be in house 3.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n\n- House 1: Bob, Google Pixel 6, stir fry, lilies\n- House 2: Alice, Samsung Galaxy S21, pizza, soup\n- House 3: Carol, Samsung Galaxy S21, daffodils\n- House 4: Arnold, Huawei P50, carnations\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Bob>>>"
