    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, cigars, flowers, and colors in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. Bob and the person who loves brown are next to each other.\n2. The Prince smoker is Arnold.\n3. The person who loves white is the Dunhill smoker.\n4. Arnold is the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.\n5. The person who smokes Blue Master is in the fourth house.\n6. The person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the fourth house.\n7. The person who loves a carnations arrangement is the Dunhill smoker.\n8. The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is directly left of Alice.\n9. The person partial to Pall Mall is the person who loves blue.\n10. The person who loves white is Carol.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know for sure:\n\n- From clue 5 and 6, the person in the fourth house smokes Blue Master and loves iris.\n- From clue 10, Carol loves white.\n- From clue 3, Carol is the Dunhill smoker.\n- From clue 7, the person who loves carnations is the Dunhill smoker, so Carol loves carnations.\n- From clue 2 and 4, Arnold smokes Prince and loves daffodils.\n- From clue 8, Arnold is directly left of Alice.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- Since Arnold is directly left of Alice, Arnold must be in house 2 and Alice in house 3.\n- Carol, who loves white, must be in house 1 because she can't be in house 4 (as the person there loves iris).\n- Bob must be in house 3 or 4, but since Alice is in house 3, Bob must be in house 4.\n\nLet's summarize the positions:\n\n- House 1: Carol, Dunhill, carnations, white\n- House 2: Arnold, Prince, daffodils\n- House 3: Alice\n- House 4: Bob, Blue Master, iris\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining details:\n\n- From clue 1, Bob and the person who loves brown are next to each other. Since Bob is in house 4, the person who loves brown must be in house 3 (Alice).\n- From clue 9, the person who loves blue smokes Pall Mall. Since Carol loves white, Arnold loves daffodils, and Alice loves brown, Bob must love blue and smoke Pall Mall.\n\nNow we have:\n\n- House 1: Carol, Dunhill, carnations, white\n- House 2: Arnold, Prince, daffodils\n- House 3: Alice, brown\n- House 4: Bob, Blue Master, iris, blue\n\nTherefore, the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Carol>>>."
