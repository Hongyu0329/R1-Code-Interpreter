    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to organize the information given into a coherent structure. Let's break down the clues and fill in the details step by step:\n\n1. Arnold is the person who is the mother of Timothy.\n   - Arnold -> Timothy\n\n2. The coffee drinker is in the fourth house.\n   - House 4: Coffee\n\n3. Bob is the person who likes milk.\n   - Bob -> Milk\n\n4. The person who is the mother of Billy is directly left of the person who loves a carnations arrangement.\n   - House X: Mother of Billy\n   - House X+1: Carnations\n\n5. The person's child is named Alice and the person who loves the bouquet of lilies are next to each other.\n   - House Y: Child Alice\n   - House YÂ±1: Lilies\n\n6. The one who only drinks water is Arnold.\n   - Arnold -> Water\n\n7. The boba tea drinker is Carol.\n   - Carol -> Boba Tea\n\n8. The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is the person who is the mother of Timothy.\n   - Arnold -> Daffodils\n\n9. The person who likes milk is the person's child is named Alice.\n   - Bob -> Child Alice\n\n10. Carol is the person who loves the bouquet of iris.\n    - Carol -> Iris\n\nNow, let's organize this information into a table format to deduce the arrangement:\n\n| House | Name   | Child   | Flower     | Drink    |\n|-------|--------|---------|------------|----------|\n| 1     |        |         |            |          |\n| 2     |        |         |            |          |\n| 3     |        |         |            |          |\n| 4     |        |         |            | Coffee   |\n\nFrom the clues:\n- Arnold is the mother of Timothy, drinks water, and loves daffodils.\n- Bob drinks milk and his child is Alice.\n- Carol drinks boba tea and loves iris.\n- The mother of Billy is directly left of the carnations lover.\n\nLet's fill in the table:\n\n1. House 4 is the coffee drinker, so it cannot be Arnold, Bob, or Carol. Therefore, it must be the remaining person, who is Alice.\n2. Since Carol drinks boba tea and loves iris, she cannot be in House 4. She must be in House 3.\n3. Bob drinks milk and his child is Alice, so Bob must be in House 2.\n4. Arnold drinks water, is the mother of Timothy, and loves daffodils, so Arnold must be in House 1.\n\nNow, let's fill in the table with this information:\n\n| House | Name   | Child   | Flower     | Drink    |\n|-------|--------|---------|------------|----------|\n| 1     | Arnold | Timothy | Daffodils  | Water    |\n| 2     | Bob    | Alice   |            | Milk     |\n| 3     | Carol  |         | Iris       | Boba Tea |\n| 4     | Alice  |         |            | Coffee   |\n\nNow, we need to determine the remaining details:\n- The mother of Billy is directly left of the carnations lover. Since House 1 is Arnold and House 2 is Bob, House 3 must be the mother of Billy, and House 4 must love carnations.\n\nFinally, let's fill in the remaining details:\n\n| House | Name   | Child   | Flower     | Drink    |\n|-------|--------|---------|------------|----------|\n| 1     | Arnold | Timothy | Daffodils  | Water    |\n| 2     | Bob    | Alice   | Lilies     | Milk     |\n| 3     | Carol  | Billy   | Iris       | Boba Tea |\n| 4     | Alice  |         | Carnations | Coffee   |\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Arnold>>>."
