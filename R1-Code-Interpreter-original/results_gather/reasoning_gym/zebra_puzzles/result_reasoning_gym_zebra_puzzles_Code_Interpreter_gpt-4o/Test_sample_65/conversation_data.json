    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their nationalities, favorite smoothies, and pets in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. The Chinese is directly left of Arnold.\n2. The cat lover is in the second house.\n3. Alice is the dog owner.\n4. The cat lover is the British person.\n5. The Dragonfruit smoothie lover and the Butterscotch smoothie drinker are next to each other.\n6. The bird keeper is in the third house.\n7. The German is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n8. The Chinese is Carol.\n9. The Darkness smoothie drinker is in the second house.\n\nLet's start solving step by step:\n\n- From clue 8, we know Carol is Chinese.\n- From clue 1, Carol (Chinese) is directly left of Arnold.\n- From clue 2, the cat lover is in the second house.\n- From clue 4, the cat lover is British.\n- From clue 9, the Darkness smoothie drinker is in the second house.\n\nLet's try to place these pieces of information:\n\n1. House 2: British, Cat lover, Darkness smoothie\n2. House 3: Bird keeper (from clue 6)\n\nNow, let's place Carol and Arnold:\n\n- Since Carol is Chinese and directly left of Arnold, and Carol is not in house 2 (British), Carol must be in house 1, and Arnold must be in house 2.\n\nNow, let's place Alice:\n\n- From clue 3, Alice is the dog owner. Since house 2 is the cat lover, Alice cannot be in house 2. Alice must be in house 4.\n\nNow, let's place the German and Butterscotch smoothie drinker:\n\n- From clue 7, the German is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker. Since house 2 is already occupied by the British, the German must be in house 3, and the Butterscotch smoothie drinker must be in house 4.\n\nNow, let's place the remaining person and smoothie:\n\n- The remaining person is Bob, and the remaining smoothie is Dragonfruit.\n- From clue 5, the Dragonfruit smoothie lover and the Butterscotch smoothie drinker are next to each other. Since the Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in house 4, the Dragonfruit smoothie lover must be in house 3.\n\nLet's summarize the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Carol (Chinese)\n- House 2: Arnold (British, Cat lover, Darkness smoothie)\n- House 3: Bob (German, Bird keeper, Dragonfruit smoothie)\n- House 4: Alice (Dog owner, Butterscotch smoothie)\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Carol>>>"
