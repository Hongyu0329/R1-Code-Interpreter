    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to organize the information given into a coherent structure. Let's break down the clues and use a process of elimination to determine the arrangement of people, their favorite cigars, lunches, and colors.\n\n### Clues:\n1. The person who loves white is the person who loves stir fry.\n2. The person who loves brown is directly left of the Prince smoker.\n3. The person who is a pizza lover and Arnold are next to each other.\n4. The person partial to Pall Mall is the person who loves white.\n5. Alice is the person who loves the soup.\n6. The person partial to Pall Mall is directly left of the person who loves the soup.\n7. The person who smokes Blue Master is directly left of the Dunhill smoker.\n8. The Dunhill smoker is Bob.\n9. The person who loves the soup is the person who loves blue.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From clue 5, Alice loves soup.\n- From clue 9, Alice also loves blue.\n- From clue 8, Bob smokes Dunhill.\n- From clue 7, the Blue Master smoker is directly left of Bob.\n- From clue 6, the Pall Mall smoker is directly left of Alice.\n- From clue 4, the Pall Mall smoker loves white.\n- From clue 1, the Pall Mall smoker also loves stir fry.\n- From clue 2, the person who loves brown is directly left of the Prince smoker.\n- From clue 3, the pizza lover and Arnold are next to each other.\n\nLet's try to place these pieces of information into the houses:\n\n1. Alice loves soup and blue, and the Pall Mall smoker is directly left of her. Therefore, Alice cannot be in House 1.\n2. Bob smokes Dunhill, and the Blue Master smoker is directly left of him. Therefore, Bob cannot be in House 1.\n3. The Pall Mall smoker loves white and stir fry, and is directly left of Alice. Therefore, the Pall Mall smoker cannot be in House 1.\n4. The person who loves brown is directly left of the Prince smoker. Therefore, the person who loves brown cannot be in House 1.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: The person who loves brown (since they must be directly left of the Prince smoker).\n- House 2: The Prince smoker.\n- House 3: The Pall Mall smoker (loves white and stir fry).\n- House 4: Alice (loves soup and blue).\n\nNow, let's determine who is in House 1:\n\n- House 1: Carol (since Alice and Bob are already placed, and Arnold is next to the pizza lover, which must be in House 2 or 3).\n\nThus, the person in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Carol>>>."
