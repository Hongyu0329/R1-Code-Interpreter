    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to organize the information given into a coherent structure. Let's break down the clues and fill in the details step by step:\n\n1. The person who is the mother of Billy is directly left of the person's child named Alice.\n2. The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils and Bob are next to each other.\n3. The person who likes milk is directly left of the coffee drinker.\n4. The person's child named Alice is in the second house.\n5. The person who is the mother of Timothy is the one who only drinks water.\n6. The person who likes milk is the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.\n7. The person's child named Alice and Arnold are next to each other.\n8. The one who only drinks water is the person who loves the bouquet of iris.\n9. Alice is the person who is the mother of Billy.\n10. The person who is the mother of Timothy is in the fourth house.\n11. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is the person's child named Alice.\n\nLet's start by filling in the information we can deduce directly:\n\n- From clue 4, we know that the person's child named Alice is in the second house.\n- From clue 11, the person who loves the bouquet of lilies is in the second house.\n- From clue 7, Arnold is next to the person whose child is named Alice, so Arnold must be in house 1 or 3.\n- From clue 9, Alice is the mother of Billy.\n- From clue 10, the person who is the mother of Timothy is in the fourth house.\n- From clue 5, the person who is the mother of Timothy drinks water.\n- From clue 8, the person who drinks water loves the bouquet of iris, so the person in the fourth house loves iris.\n\nNow, let's try to fill in the rest of the information:\n\n- Since Alice is the mother of Billy, and the mother of Billy is directly left of the person whose child is named Alice (clue 1), Alice must be in house 1.\n- From clue 2, Bob is next to the person who loves daffodils. Since Alice is in house 1, Bob must be in house 2 or 3.\n- From clue 6, the person who likes milk loves daffodils. From clue 3, the person who likes milk is directly left of the coffee drinker. Therefore, the person who likes milk must be in house 1 or 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 2 or 3.\n\nLet's summarize what we have so far:\n\n- House 1: Alice (mother of Billy), loves daffodils, drinks milk\n- House 2: Child named Alice, loves lilies, drinks coffee\n- House 3: Arnold or Bob\n- House 4: Mother of Timothy, loves iris, drinks water\n\nNow, let's deduce the remaining information:\n\n- Since Alice is in house 1, and Arnold is next to the person whose child is named Alice (clue 7), Arnold must be in house 3.\n- Therefore, Bob must be in house 2.\n- The only remaining name for house 4 is Carol.\n\nLet's finalize the information:\n\n- House 1: Alice (mother of Billy), loves daffodils, drinks milk\n- House 2: Bob, child named Alice, loves lilies, drinks coffee\n- House 3: Arnold\n- House 4: Carol (mother of Timothy), loves iris, drinks water\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Alice>>>"
