The boba tea drinker is Arnold.\n9. The Chinese is directly left of the British person.\n10. The coffee drinker is Bob.\n\nLet's start solving step by step:\n\n- From clue 3, the Dane is in the second house.\n- From clue 6, the person who only drinks water is in the second house.\n- From clue 2, the person who loves pizza is in the second house.\n- From clue 4, Bob loves soup.\n- From clue 10, Bob is the coffee drinker, and from clue 1, Bob is the German.\n- From clue 8, Arnold drinks boba tea.\n- From clue 5, Carol loves stir fry.\n- From clue 9, the Chinese is directly left of the British person.\n- From clue 7, the Dane and the grilled cheese lover are next to each other.\n\nLet's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- House 2: Dane, drinks water, loves pizza.\n- Bob is the German and drinks coffee, so he cannot be in House 2. Bob must be in another house.\n- Arnold drinks boba tea, so he cannot be in House 2.\n- Carol loves stir fry, so she cannot be in House 2.\n\nNow, let's place Bob, Arnold, and Carol in the remaining houses and deduce the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Chinese, drinks milk, loves grilled cheese.\n- House 2: Dane, drinks water, loves pizza.\n- House 3: Bob (German), drinks coffee, loves soup.\n- House 4: Arnold, drinks boba tea, loves stir fry.\n\nFrom clue 9, the Chinese is directly left of the British person, so:\n\n- House 1: Chinese\n- House 2: Dane\n- House 3: Bob (German)\n- House 4: British\n\nNow, let's deduce the names:\n\n- House 1: Carol (Chinese, drinks milk, loves grilled cheese)\n- House 2: Alice (Dane, drinks water, loves pizza)\n- House 3: Bob (German, drinks coffee, loves soup)\n- House 4: Arnold (British, drinks boba tea, loves stir fry)\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Carol>>>"
