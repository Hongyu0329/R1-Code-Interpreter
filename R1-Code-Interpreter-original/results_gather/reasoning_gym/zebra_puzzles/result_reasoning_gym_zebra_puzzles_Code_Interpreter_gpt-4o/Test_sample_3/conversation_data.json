    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite colors, drinks, and cigars in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. Bob is the person who loves white.\n2. The person who loves brown is the person who smokes Blue Master.\n3. The person who loves purple and Arnold are next to each other.\n4. The coffee drinker is in the third house.\n5. The person who loves purple is the person who likes milk.\n6. The one who only drinks water and the Prince smoker are next to each other.\n7. The Prince smoker is the person who loves white.\n8. The one who only drinks water is the person who loves blue.\n9. The person who loves blue is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n10. Alice is the person who loves brown.\n\nLet's start solving step by step:\n\n- From clue 10, Alice loves brown.\n- From clue 2, Alice smokes Blue Master.\n- From clue 1 and 7, Bob loves white and smokes Prince.\n- From clue 4, the coffee drinker is in the third house.\n- From clue 5, the person who loves purple likes milk.\n- From clue 8 and 9, the person who loves blue drinks water and smokes Pall Mall.\n\nNow, let's try to place these people in the houses:\n\n1. Alice loves brown and smokes Blue Master.\n2. Bob loves white and smokes Prince.\n3. The coffee drinker is in the third house.\n4. The person who loves purple likes milk.\n5. The person who loves blue drinks water and smokes Pall Mall.\n\nLet's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- Since Bob loves white and smokes Prince, he cannot be in the third house (coffee drinker).\n- Alice loves brown and smokes Blue Master, so she cannot be in the third house either.\n- The person who loves purple likes milk, so they cannot be in the third house (coffee drinker).\n- The person who loves blue drinks water and smokes Pall Mall, so they cannot be in the third house (coffee drinker).\n\nLet's place the coffee drinker in the third house and deduce the rest:\n\n- House 3: Coffee drinker\n- House 2: Bob (loves white, smokes Prince)\n- House 1: Alice (loves brown, smokes Blue Master)\n- House 4: The person who loves purple and likes milk\n\nNow, let's finalize the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Alice (loves brown, smokes Blue Master)\n- House 2: Bob (loves white, smokes Prince)\n- House 3: Coffee drinker\n- House 4: The person who loves purple and likes milk\n\nFrom clue 3, the person who loves purple and Arnold are next to each other. Since the person who loves purple is in House 4, Arnold must be in House 3.\n\nTherefore, the person in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Carol>>>."
