    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, cigars, nationalities, and drinks in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. The person who smokes Blue Master is the coffee drinker.\n2. Alice is directly left of the boba tea drinker.\n3. The Prince smoker is the one who only drinks water.\n4. The coffee drinker is the Chinese.\n5. The British person is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n6. The person who smokes Blue Master is Carol.\n7. The boba tea drinker is the Dane.\n8. The person partial to Pall Mall is in the fourth house.\n9. Bob and the person who likes milk are next to each other.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know for sure:\n\n- From clue 6, Carol smokes Blue Master.\n- From clue 1, the Blue Master smoker is the coffee drinker.\n- From clue 4, the coffee drinker is Chinese.\n- Therefore, Carol is Chinese and drinks coffee.\n\n- From clue 8, the person who smokes Pall Mall is in the fourth house.\n- From clue 5, the British person smokes Pall Mall.\n- Therefore, the British person is in the fourth house.\n\n- From clue 7, the boba tea drinker is the Dane.\n\nNow, let's try to place these people in the houses:\n\n- Since Alice is directly left of the boba tea drinker (clue 2), Alice must be in house 1 or 2, and the Dane (boba tea drinker) must be in house 2 or 3.\n\n- Since Carol is Chinese and drinks coffee, and the coffee drinker is Chinese (clue 4), Carol must be in house 3.\n\n- The British person is in house 4, smoking Pall Mall.\n\n- The Prince smoker drinks water (clue 3), and since Carol drinks coffee, the Prince smoker must be in house 1 or 2.\n\n- Bob and the person who likes milk are next to each other (clue 9).\n\nLet's try to fit these pieces together:\n\n- House 1: Alice (since Alice is directly left of the boba tea drinker, who is in house 2)\n- House 2: Dane (boba tea drinker)\n- House 3: Carol (Chinese, coffee drinker, Blue Master smoker)\n- House 4: British (Pall Mall smoker)\n\nNow, let's determine the remaining details:\n\n- Since the Prince smoker drinks water, and Carol drinks coffee, the Prince smoker must be in house 1.\n- Bob and the person who likes milk are next to each other, so Bob must be in house 2 or 3, and the milk drinker must be in house 1 or 2.\n\n- Since Alice is in house 1, and the Prince smoker is in house 1, Alice must be the Prince smoker and drinks water.\n\n- Since the Dane is in house 2 and drinks boba tea, Bob must be in house 3, and the milk drinker must be in house 2.\n\nLet's summarize:\n\n- House 1: Alice, Prince smoker, drinks water\n- House 2: Dane, drinks boba tea, milk drinker\n- House 3: Carol, Chinese, drinks coffee, Blue Master smoker, Bob\n- House 4: British, Pall Mall smoker\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Alice>>>"
