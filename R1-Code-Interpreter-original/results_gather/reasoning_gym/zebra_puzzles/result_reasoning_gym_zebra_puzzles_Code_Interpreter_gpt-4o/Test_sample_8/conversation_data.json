    "\nassistant > Let's solve the puzzle step by step using the given clues:\n\n1. **Arnold loves stir fry** and **Arnold is in the third house**. Therefore, the person in the third house loves stir fry.\n\n2. The person who loves stir fry is the person who likes milk. Therefore, the person in the third house likes milk.\n\n3. **Alice is in the second house**.\n\n4. **The Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in the third house**.\n\n5. **The Desert smoothie lover is in the first house**.\n\n6. **Bob and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover are next to each other**. This means Bob is either in house 1 or house 3, and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in house 2 or house 4.\n\n7. **The person who is a pizza lover is the one who only drinks water**. This person cannot be in house 3 because the person in house 3 drinks milk.\n\n8. **The person who loves eating grilled cheese is directly left of the boba tea drinker**. This means the grilled cheese lover cannot be in house 4.\n\nLet's organize this information and deduce the positions:\n\n- House 1: Desert smoothie lover\n- House 2: Alice\n- House 3: Arnold, Stir fry, Milk, Butterscotch smoothie\n- House 4: \n\nNow, let's deduce the remaining information:\n\n- Since Alice is in house 2, and Bob and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover are next to each other, Bob must be in house 1 or 3. But Arnold is in house 3, so Bob must be in house 1.\n\n- The Dragonfruit smoothie lover must be in house 2 or 4. Since Alice is in house 2, the Dragonfruit smoothie lover must be in house 4.\n\n- The person who loves eating grilled cheese is directly left of the boba tea drinker. Since house 4 is the only house left for the boba tea drinker, the grilled cheese lover must be in house 3.\n\n- The person who is a pizza lover is the one who only drinks water. Since house 3 drinks milk, the pizza lover must be in house 1 or 2. Since Alice is in house 2, the pizza lover must be in house 1.\n\nLet's summarize:\n\n- House 1: Bob, Desert smoothie, Pizza, Water\n- House 2: Alice\n- House 3: Arnold, Stir fry, Milk, Butterscotch smoothie, Grilled cheese\n- House 4: Dragonfruit smoothie, Boba tea\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Bob>>>"
