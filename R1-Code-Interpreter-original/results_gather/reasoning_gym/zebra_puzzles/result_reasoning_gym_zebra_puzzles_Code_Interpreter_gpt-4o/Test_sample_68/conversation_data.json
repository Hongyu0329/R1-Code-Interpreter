The person who is a pizza lover is in the third house.\n2. The Prince smoker is the person who loves the soup.\n3. The person who loves the soup is the person who loves brown.\n4. The person who loves stir fry is the person who loves blue.\n5. The person who loves eating grilled cheese is the person who loves purple.\n6.
