    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite flowers, cigars, and their children in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. The person's child named Alice is in the third house.\n   - House 3: Child = Alice\n\n2. The person's child named Alice and the person who loves a carnations arrangement are next to each other.\n   - House 2 or House 4: Carnations\n\n3. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n   - Lilies = Pall Mall\n\n4. Bob is the Prince smoker.\n   - Bob = Prince\n\n5. The person's child named Bella is Alice.\n   - Alice = Bella's mother\n\n6. Bob is the person who loves a carnations arrangement.\n   - Bob = Carnations\n\n7. Carol and the Prince smoker are next to each other.\n   - Carol is next to Bob\n\n8. The person who smokes Blue Master is in the second house.\n   - House 2: Blue Master\n\n9. The Dunhill smoker is the person's child named Bella.\n   - Dunhill = Bella's mother\n\n10. The person who is the mother of Billy is the person who loves the bouquet of iris.\n    - Iris = Billy's mother\n\nLet's organize this information and deduce the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: \n- House 2: Blue Master\n- House 3: Child = Alice\n- House 4: \n\nFrom clues 4 and 6, Bob is the Prince smoker and loves carnations. From clue 7, Carol is next to Bob. Since Bob loves carnations and is next to Alice (clue 2), Bob must be in House 2 or House 4. However, House 2 is Blue Master, so Bob must be in House 4.\n\n- House 4: Bob, Prince, Carnations\n\nCarol must be in House 3 or House 2. Since House 3 has Alice, Carol must be in House 2.\n\n- House 2: Carol, Blue Master\n\nFrom clue 9, the Dunhill smoker is Bella's mother, who is Alice. Since Alice is in House 3, Alice must be the Dunhill smoker.\n\n- House 3: Alice, Dunhill, Child = Alice\n\nFrom clue 10, the person who loves iris is Billy's mother. Since House 1 is the only house left, this must be the case.\n\n- House 1: Iris, Billy's mother\n\nNow, let's deduce the names:\n\n- House 1: Arnold (since Bob, Carol, and Alice are already assigned)\n- House 2: Carol\n- House 3: Alice\n- House 4: Bob\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Arnold>>>"
