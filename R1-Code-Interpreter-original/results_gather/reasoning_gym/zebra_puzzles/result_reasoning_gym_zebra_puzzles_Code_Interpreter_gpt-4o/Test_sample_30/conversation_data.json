    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to organize the information given into a coherent structure. Let's break down the clues and fill in the details step by step:\n\n1. The person who loves the soup is Carol.\n2. The person who loves the soup is directly left of the Dunhill smoker.\n3. The person who loves purple is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n4. The person who loves white is in the first house.\n5. The person who loves blue is directly left of the person who loves purple.\n6. The person who loves stir fry is in the third house.\n7. The Prince smoker is the person who is a pizza lover.\n8. Arnold is the Prince smoker.\n9. The Dunhill smoker is Bob.\n10. The person who smokes Blue Master is the person who loves brown.\n\nLet's create a table to organize the information:\n\n| House | Name   | Color | Lunch       | Cigar      |\n|-------|--------|-------|-------------|------------|\n| 1     |        | White |             |            |\n| 2     |        |       |             |            |\n| 3     |        |       | Stir Fry    |            |\n| 4     |        |       |             |            |\n\nNow, let's fill in the table using the clues:\n\n- From clue 4, the person who loves white is in the first house.\n- From clue 6, the person who loves stir fry is in the third house.\n- From clue 1, Carol loves soup.\n- From clue 2, Carol is directly left of the Dunhill smoker, so Carol must be in house 1, and Bob (Dunhill smoker) must be in house 2.\n- From clue 9, Bob is the Dunhill smoker.\n- From clue 8, Arnold is the Prince smoker, and from clue 7, the Prince smoker loves pizza. So Arnold must be in house 3 or 4.\n- From clue 5, the person who loves blue is directly left of the person who loves purple. Since house 1 is white, house 2 must be blue, and house 3 must be purple.\n- From clue 3, the person who loves purple is partial to Pall Mall, so house 3 is Pall Mall.\n- From clue 10, the person who smokes Blue Master loves brown, so house 4 must be brown.\n\nLet's fill in the table with this information:\n\n| House | Name   | Color | Lunch       | Cigar      |\n|-------|--------|-------|-------------|------------|\n| 1     | Carol  | White | Soup        |            |\n| 2     | Bob    | Blue  |             | Dunhill    |\n| 3     | Arnold | Purple| Stir Fry    | Pall Mall  |\n| 4     | Alice  | Brown | Pizza       | Blue Master|\n\nNow, we can see that the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is:\n\n<<<Carol>>>"
