    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their nationalities, the animals they keep, and their favorite colors in each house.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. The bird keeper is Arnold.\n2. The dog owner is the German.\n3. The person who loves purple is the Chinese.\n4. Carol is directly left of Alice.\n5. The cat lover is the person who loves brown.\n6. Carol is directly left of the cat lover.\n7. The Dane is Arnold.\n8. The cat lover is directly left of the person who loves blue.\n9. The bird keeper is in the first house.\n\nFrom clue 9, we know Arnold is in House 1 because he is the bird keeper.\n\nLet's use these clues to fill in the rest of the information:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Dane, Bird, (Color unknown)\n- House 2: Carol, (Nationality unknown), (Animal unknown), (Color unknown)\n- House 3: (Name unknown), (Nationality unknown), Cat, Brown\n- House 4: Alice, (Nationality unknown), (Animal unknown), Blue\n\nNow, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:\n\n- From clue 4, Carol is directly left of Alice, so Carol is in House 2 and Alice is in House 4.\n- From clue 6, Carol is directly left of the cat lover, so the cat lover is in House 3.\n- From clue 8, the cat lover is directly left of the person who loves blue, so the person who loves blue is in House 4.\n- From clue 3, the person who loves purple is the Chinese, and since House 4 is blue, the Chinese person must be in House 3.\n- From clue 5, the cat lover loves brown, which matches House 3.\n- From clue 2, the dog owner is the German, and since House 3 has a cat, the German must be in House 4.\n- This leaves House 2 for the Brit, who must own the fish (since the other animals are accounted for).\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining details:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Dane, Bird, (Color unknown)\n- House 2: Carol, Brit, Fish, (Color unknown)\n- House 3: Bob, Chinese, Cat, Brown\n- House 4: Alice, German, Dog, Blue\n\nFinally, we need to determine the color for House 1 and House 2. Since House 3 is brown and House 4 is blue, the remaining colors are purple and white. From clue 3, the person who loves purple is the Chinese, which is House 3. Therefore, House 1 must be white.\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Dane, Bird, White\n- House 2: Carol, Brit, Fish, Purple\n- House 3: Bob, Chinese, Cat, Brown\n- House 4: Alice, German, Dog, Blue\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Arnold>>>"
