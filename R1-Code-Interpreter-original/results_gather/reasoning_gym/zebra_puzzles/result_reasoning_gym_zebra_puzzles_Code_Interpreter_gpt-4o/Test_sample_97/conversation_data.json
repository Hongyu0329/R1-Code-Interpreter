    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, animals, flowers, and phone models in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the cat lover.\n2. The bird keeper and the dog owner are next to each other.\n3. The person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the second house.\n4. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the person who loves the bouquet of lilies.\n5. The cat lover is Carol.\n6. The person who loves the bouquet of iris is the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n7. The fish enthusiast is the person who loves a carnations arrangement.\n8. The bird keeper is Alice.\n9. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is the dog owner.\n10. Bob is the person who uses a OnePlus 9.\n11. The cat lover is directly left of Alice.\n\nLet's organize this information and deduce the arrangement:\n\n- From clue 3, the person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the second house.\n- From clue 6, the person who loves the bouquet of iris uses a Huawei P50.\n- From clue 4, the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 loves the bouquet of lilies.\n- From clue 5, Carol is the cat lover.\n- From clue 1, Carol uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n- From clue 11, Carol is directly left of Alice.\n- From clue 8, Alice is the bird keeper.\n- From clue 2, the bird keeper (Alice) and the dog owner are next to each other.\n- From clue 9, the person who uses a OnePlus 9 is the dog owner.\n- From clue 10, Bob uses a OnePlus 9.\n\nLet's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- House 2: Loves iris, uses Huawei P50.\n- House 3: Carol (cat lover), uses Samsung Galaxy S21, loves lilies.\n- House 4: Alice (bird keeper).\n\nSince Carol is directly left of Alice, Carol is in House 3 and Alice is in House 4. Bob, who uses a OnePlus 9 and is the dog owner, must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the dog owner is next to the bird keeper, Bob must be in House 2. This leaves Arnold for House 1.\n\nLet's verify:\n\n- House 1: Arnold\n- House 2: Bob (dog owner), uses OnePlus 9, loves iris, uses Huawei P50.\n- House 3: Carol (cat lover), uses Samsung Galaxy S21, loves lilies.\n- House 4: Alice (bird keeper).\n\nNow, let's provide the answer for the person in House 1:\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Arnold>>>."
