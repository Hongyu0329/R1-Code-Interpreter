    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite flowers, lunches, and pets in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. The person who is a pizza lover is the cat lover.\n2. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is the bird keeper.\n3. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies and Arnold are next to each other.\n4. Bob is directly left of the person who loves the bouquet of iris.\n5. The cat lover is in the first house.\n6. Carol is the person who loves the bouquet of iris.\n7. The fish enthusiast is the person who loves eating grilled cheese.\n8. The bird keeper is directly left of the person who loves a carnations arrangement.\n9. The person who loves the soup is Arnold.\n\nLet's start solving step by step:\n\n- From clue 5, the cat lover is in the first house.\n- From clue 1, the pizza lover is the cat lover, so the pizza lover is in the first house.\n- From clue 9, Arnold loves soup.\n- From clue 6, Carol loves the bouquet of iris.\n- From clue 4, Bob is directly left of Carol (who loves the bouquet of iris).\n- From clue 3, the person who loves lilies and Arnold are next to each other.\n- From clue 2, the person who loves lilies is the bird keeper.\n- From clue 8, the bird keeper is directly left of the person who loves carnations.\n- From clue 7, the fish enthusiast loves grilled cheese.\n\nLet's deduce the arrangement:\n\n1. House 1: Pizza lover, Cat lover\n2. House 2: Bob\n3. House 3: Carol, Iris lover\n4. House 4: Arnold, Soup lover\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining details:\n\n- Since the cat lover is in House 1, and the pizza lover is also in House 1, the person in House 1 is the pizza lover and cat lover.\n- Bob is in House 2, directly left of Carol in House 3.\n- Carol is in House 3, and she loves the bouquet of iris.\n- Arnold is in House 4, and he loves soup.\n- The bird keeper (lilies lover) must be in House 2, as they are next to Arnold (House 4) and directly left of the carnations lover (House 3).\n- The fish enthusiast (grilled cheese lover) must be in House 3.\n- The carnations lover must be in House 4.\n\nNow, let's assign names:\n\n- House 1: Alice (since Bob, Carol, and Arnold are already assigned to other houses)\n- House 2: Bob\n- House 3: Carol\n- House 4: Arnold\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Alice>>>"
