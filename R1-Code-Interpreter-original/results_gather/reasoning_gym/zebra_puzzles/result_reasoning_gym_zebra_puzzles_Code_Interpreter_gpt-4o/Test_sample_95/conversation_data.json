The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is the person who loves the soup.\n5. Bob is the person who smokes Blue Master.\n6.

Since the first house is the only one left, Arnold must be in the first house.\n- From clue 6, the person who loves the bouquet of lilies is the person partial to Pall Mall. Since the second house is the only one left, the person who loves lilies and smokes Pall Mall is in the second house.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Stir Fry, Prince, (unknown flower)\n- House 2: Bob, Soup, Blue Master, Daffodils\n- House 3: Carol, Pizza, (unknown cigar), (unknown flower)\n- House 4: (unknown name), (unknown lunch), Dunhill, Carnations\n\nThe only name left is Alice, so Alice must be in the fourth house.\n\nTherefore, the person in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Arnold>>>."
