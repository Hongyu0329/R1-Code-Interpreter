    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their nationalities, phone models, and favorite cigars in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. The Dunhill smoker is in the fourth house.\n2. The Chinese is Arnold.\n3. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the Dunhill smoker.\n4. The Dane is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.\n5. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is directly left of the British person.\n6. The German is the person who smokes Blue Master.\n7. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is Alice.\n8. Arnold and the person who uses a OnePlus 9 are next to each other.\n9. Arnold is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n10. The Dane is Bob.\n\nLet's start solving step by step:\n\n- From clue 1 and 3, the Dunhill smoker is in the fourth house and uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n- From clue 2, Arnold is Chinese.\n- From clue 4, Bob is the Dane and uses a Google Pixel 6.\n- From clue 5 and 7, Alice uses a OnePlus 9 and is directly left of the British person.\n- From clue 6, the German smokes Blue Master.\n- From clue 8, Arnold and Alice are next to each other.\n- From clue 9, Arnold smokes Pall Mall.\n- From clue 10, Bob is the Dane.\n\nLet's deduce the arrangement:\n\n1. Since Alice uses a OnePlus 9 and is directly left of the British person, Alice cannot be in house 4. Therefore, Alice must be in house 2 or 3.\n2. Arnold and Alice are next to each other, so Arnold must be in house 1 or 3.\n3. Since Arnold is Chinese and smokes Pall Mall, and Alice is in house 2 or 3, Arnold must be in house 3.\n4. Therefore, Alice must be in house 2.\n5. Since Alice is in house 2 and the British person is directly to the right, the British person must be in house 3.\n6. Since Bob is the Dane and uses a Google Pixel 6, and Alice is in house 2, Bob must be in house 1.\n7. The German, who smokes Blue Master, must be in house 3.\n\nNow, let's assign the names to the houses:\n\n- House 1: Bob (Dane, Google Pixel 6)\n- House 2: Alice (OnePlus 9)\n- House 3: Arnold (Chinese, Pall Mall)\n- House 4: (Dunhill, Samsung Galaxy S21)\n\nThe only name left for house 4 is Carol.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Bob>>>"
