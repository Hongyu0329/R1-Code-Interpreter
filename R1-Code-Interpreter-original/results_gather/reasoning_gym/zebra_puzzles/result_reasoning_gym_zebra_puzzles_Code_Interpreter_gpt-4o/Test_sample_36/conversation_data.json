    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite colors, the animals they keep, and their lunch preferences in each house.\n\nLet's break down the clues:\n\n1. The person who loves eating grilled cheese and Arnold are next to each other.\n2. The bird keeper is in the fourth house.\n3. The person who loves blue and the person who loves white are next to each other.\n4. The person who loves eating grilled cheese is the fish enthusiast.\n5. The dog owner is directly left of the person who loves blue.\n6. The cat lover and the person who loves purple are next to each other.\n7. The person who loves stir fry is Alice.\n8. The person who loves stir fry is directly left of the person who is a pizza lover.\n9. Bob is the dog owner.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know for sure:\n\n- From clue 2, the bird keeper is in the fourth house.\n- From clue 7, Alice loves stir fry.\n- From clue 9, Bob is the dog owner.\n\nNow, let's use the clues to deduce the arrangement:\n\n- Since Alice loves stir fry (clue 7) and is directly left of the pizza lover (clue 8), Alice must be in house 3, and the pizza lover must be in house 4.\n- Bob, the dog owner, must be in house 2 because he is directly left of the person who loves blue (clue 5).\n- The person who loves grilled cheese is the fish enthusiast (clue 4) and is next to Arnold (clue 1). Since Alice is in house 3 and the pizza lover is in house 4, Arnold must be in house 1, and the grilled cheese lover (fish enthusiast) must be in house 2.\n- The person who loves blue must be in house 3, as Bob (dog owner) is in house 2 (clue 5).\n- The person who loves white must be in house 4, as they are next to the person who loves blue (clue 3).\n- The cat lover and the person who loves purple are next to each other (clue 6). Since house 4 is occupied by the bird keeper, the cat lover must be in house 1, and the person who loves purple must be in house 2.\n\nNow, let's summarize the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Cat lover, (unknown color), (unknown lunch)\n- House 2: Bob, Dog owner, Purple, Grilled cheese (fish enthusiast)\n- House 3: Alice, (unknown animal), Blue, Stir fry\n- House 4: (unknown name), Bird keeper, White, Pizza\n\nFrom the above deductions, Arnold is in house 1.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Arnold>>>."
