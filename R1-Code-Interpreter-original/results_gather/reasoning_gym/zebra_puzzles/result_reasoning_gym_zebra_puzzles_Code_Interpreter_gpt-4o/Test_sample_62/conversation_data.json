    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to organize the information given into a coherent structure. Let's break down the clues and fill in the details step by step:\n\n1. The person who loves brown is in the second house.\n2. The person who loves purple is directly left of the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n3. Alice is directly left of Bob.\n4. Bob and the person who loves blue are next to each other.\n5. Carol is the person who loves blue.\n6. Carol is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.\n7. The person who loves purple is the Prince smoker.\n8. The person who uses a Huawei P50 is Alice.\n9. The person who smokes Blue Master is Bob.\n10. The Dunhill smoker is the person who loves white.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know for sure:\n\n- House 2: Loves brown.\n- Carol loves blue and uses a Google Pixel 6.\n- Alice uses a Huawei P50.\n- Bob smokes Blue Master.\n- The person who loves purple smokes Prince.\n- The Dunhill smoker loves white.\n\nNow, let's try to place these people in the houses:\n\n1. Since Carol loves blue, and Bob and the person who loves blue are next to each other, Carol must be in House 3 or 4.\n2. Alice is directly left of Bob, so Alice must be in House 1 or 2, and Bob must be in House 2 or 3.\n3. Since the person who loves brown is in House 2, Alice must be in House 1, and Bob must be in House 2.\n4. Carol, who loves blue, must be in House 3.\n5. The person who loves purple is directly left of the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21, so the person who loves purple must be in House 3, and the person with the Samsung Galaxy S21 must be in House 4.\n6. Since Carol is in House 3 and loves blue, the person who loves purple must be in House 1.\n7. The person who loves purple smokes Prince, so Alice, who is in House 1, smokes Prince.\n8. The Dunhill smoker loves white, so the person in House 4 must love white and smoke Dunhill.\n\nNow, let's summarize the house assignments:\n\n- House 1: Alice, loves purple, smokes Prince, uses Huawei P50.\n- House 2: Bob, loves brown, smokes Blue Master.\n- House 3: Carol, loves blue, uses Google Pixel 6.\n- House 4: Arnold, loves white, smokes Dunhill, uses Samsung Galaxy S21.\n\nTherefore, the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Alice>>>."
