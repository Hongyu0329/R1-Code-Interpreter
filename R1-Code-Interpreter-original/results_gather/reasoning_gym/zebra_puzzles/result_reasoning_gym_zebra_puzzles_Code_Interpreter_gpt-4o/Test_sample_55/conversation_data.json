The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is in the third house.\n\nLet's start by filling in the information we know for sure:\n\n- House 3: The person uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 and is the mother of Billy (from clues 2 and 9). This person is Carol (from clue 8).\n\nNow, let's use the other clues to fill in the rest:\n\n- Since Carol is in House 3 and loves brown (clue 4), we know:\n  - House 3: Carol, Samsung Galaxy S21, Brown, Billy\n\n- From clue 6, the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is directly left of the person who uses a OnePlus 9. Therefore, the person in House 4 uses a OnePlus 9.\n\n- From clue 1, the person who loves white is directly left of the person's child named Alice. Since Arnold's child is Alice (clue 3), Arnold must be in House 2, and the person in House 1 loves white.\n\n- From clue 7, Alice loves purple. Therefore, Alice must be in House 1.\n\n- From clue 5, the person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is the mother of Timothy. Since House 3 is Carol and House 4 uses a OnePlus 9, the person in House 2 must use a Google Pixel 6 and be the mother of Timothy.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information:\n\n- House 1: Alice, ?, White, ?\n- House 2: Arnold, Google Pixel 6, ?, Timothy\n- House 3: Carol, Samsung Galaxy S21, Brown, Billy\n- House 4: Bob, OnePlus 9, ?, ?\n\nSince Alice is in House 1, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is:\n\n<<<Alice>>>"
