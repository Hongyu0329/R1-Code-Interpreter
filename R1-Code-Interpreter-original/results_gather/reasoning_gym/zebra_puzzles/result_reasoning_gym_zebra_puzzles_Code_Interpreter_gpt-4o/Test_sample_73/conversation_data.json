    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite drinks, flowers, and phone models in each house.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. Bob is the one who only drinks water.\n2. Carol is the boba tea drinker.\n3. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is directly left of the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.\n4. The boba tea drinker is in the third house.\n5. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is in the fourth house.\n6. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is in the first house.\n7. Arnold is the person who loves a carnations arrangement.\n8. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies and Alice are next to each other.\n9. The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is the person who likes milk.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know for sure:\n\n- House 3: Carol (boba tea)\n- House 4: OnePlus 9\n- House 1: Lilies\n\nNow, let's deduce the rest:\n\n- Since Carol is in House 3, and she drinks boba tea, House 3 is occupied by Carol.\n- The person who loves lilies is in House 1, and Alice is next to them, so Alice must be in House 2.\n- The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is directly left of the person who loves daffodils. This means the person with the Samsung Galaxy S21 must be in House 3, and the person who loves daffodils must be in House 4.\n- Since the person who uses a OnePlus 9 is in House 4, the person who loves daffodils must be in House 4.\n- Arnold loves carnations, so he cannot be in House 1 (lilies) or House 4 (daffodils). Therefore, Arnold must be in House 2.\n- Bob drinks water, so he cannot be in House 3 (boba tea). Therefore, Bob must be in House 1.\n- The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 likes milk, so they cannot be in House 1 (water) or House 3 (boba tea). Therefore, they must be in House 2.\n- The only remaining phone model for House 1 is Huawei P50.\n\nLet's summarize the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Bob, water, lilies, Huawei P50\n- House 2: Arnold, milk, carnations, Google Pixel 6\n- House 3: Carol, boba tea, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 4: Alice, daffodils, OnePlus 9\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Bob>>>"
