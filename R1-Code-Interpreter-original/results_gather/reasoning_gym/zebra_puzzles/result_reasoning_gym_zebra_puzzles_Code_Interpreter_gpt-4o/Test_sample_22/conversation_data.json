    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, let's organize the information given and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the houses.\n\n1. The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in the fourth house.\n2. The person who loves blue is Carol.\n3. The Desert smoothie lover is Arnold.\n4. The person who is the mother of Timothy is the person who loves blue.\n5. The person who loves brown is Bob.\n6. The Darkness smoothie drinker is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n7. Alice and the person who loves purple are next to each other.\n8. Bob is the Darkness smoothie drinker.\n9. The person who loves brown is the person's child is named Alice.\n10. The person who is the mother of Billy is in the second house.\n\nLet's start by filling in the information we know:\n\n- House 4: Dragonfruit smoothie\n- Carol loves blue and is the mother of Timothy.\n- Arnold loves Desert smoothie.\n- Bob loves brown and is the Darkness smoothie drinker. His child is Alice.\n- The Darkness smoothie drinker (Bob) is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n- The person who is the mother of Billy is in the second house.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- Since Bob is the Darkness smoothie drinker and is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker, Bob must be in House 1 or House 2.\n- If Bob is in House 1, then the Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in House 2. But House 2 is the mother of Billy, which doesn't match Bob's characteristics.\n- Therefore, Bob must be in House 2, and the Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in House 3.\n- Carol, who loves blue and is the mother of Timothy, must be in House 1 because she can't be in House 2 (mother of Billy) or House 3 (Butterscotch smoothie drinker).\n- Arnold, who loves Desert smoothie, must be in House 3.\n- Alice must be in House 4 because she is next to the person who loves purple, and House 4 is the only remaining house.\n\nNow, let's summarize the positions:\n\n- House 1: Carol (blue, mother of Timothy)\n- House 2: Bob (brown, Darkness smoothie, child Alice)\n- House 3: Arnold (Desert smoothie, Butterscotch smoothie)\n- House 4: Alice (Dragonfruit smoothie, next to purple lover)\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Carol>>>"
