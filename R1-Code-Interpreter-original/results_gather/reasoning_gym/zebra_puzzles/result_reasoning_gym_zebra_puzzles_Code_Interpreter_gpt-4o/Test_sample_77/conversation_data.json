Bob is the British person.\n2. The fish enthusiast is the person who loves the bouquet of iris.\n3. The dog owner is the person who loves the bouquet of lilies.\n4. The Dane is Carol.\n5. The bird keeper is directly left of the dog owner.\n6. The German is in the first house.\n7. The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is Bob.\n8. Arnold is the person who loves the bouquet of iris.\n9. The British person is in the fourth house.\n10. The Dane is in the third house.\n\nLet's deduce the arrangement step by step:\n\n- From clue 6, the German is in the first house.\n- From clue 9, the British person (Bob) is in the fourth house.\n- From clue 10, the Dane (Carol) is in the third house.\n- This leaves the second house for the Chinese person.\n\nNow, let's assign the names:\n\n- From clue 4, Carol is the Dane, so she is in the third house.\n- From clue 8, Arnold loves the bouquet of iris, and from clue 2, Arnold is the fish enthusiast.\n- Since Bob is in the fourth house, and Carol is in the third house, Arnold must be in the second house.\n- This leaves Alice for the first house.\n\nNow, let's assign the pets and flowers:\n\n- From clue 3, the dog owner loves the bouquet of lilies. Since the bird keeper is directly left of the dog owner (clue 5), the dog owner must be in the fourth house, and the bird keeper in the third house.\n- From clue 7, Bob loves the bouquet of daffodils, so the person in the fourth house loves daffodils.\n- Since Arnold loves the bouquet of iris, and he is in the second house, the person in the first house must love carnations.\n\nLet's summarize the findings:\n\n- House 1: Alice (German), carnations\n- House 2: Arnold (Chinese), fish, iris\n- House 3: Carol (Dane), bird\n- House 4: Bob (British), dog, daffodils\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Alice>>>"
