The person partial to Pall Mall is in the first house.\n9. The Dunhill smoker is in the third house.\n\nLet's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n- From clue 8, we know that the person in the first house smokes Pall Mall and uses a Huawei P50.\n- From clue 9, we know that the Dunhill smoker is in the third house.\n- From clue 2, Alice is directly left of the Dunhill smoker, so Alice must be in the second house.\n- From clue 5, the person who loves the bouquet of iris is directly left of Carol, so Carol must be in the fourth house.\n- From clue 1, Arnold smokes Blue Master, and from clue 3, Arnold uses a Google Pixel 6. From clue 4, Arnold loves carnations. Since Alice is in the second house and the Dunhill smoker is in the third house, Arnold must be in the fourth house.\n- From clue 6, the person who uses a OnePlus 9 loves daffodils. Since Arnold is in the fourth house, the person in the first house must use a OnePlus 9 and love daffodils.\n\nNow, let's deduce the names:\n\n- House 1: Uses Huawei P50, smokes Pall Mall, loves daffodils, and uses OnePlus 9.\n- House 2: Alice (directly left of Dunhill smoker).\n- House 3: Smokes Dunhill.\n- House 4: Arnold (smokes Blue Master, uses Google Pixel 6, loves carnations).\n\nSince Alice is in the second house and Arnold is in the fourth house, the person in the first house must be Bob, and the person in the third house must be Carol.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Bob>>>."
