    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, phone models, favorite colors, and lunch preferences in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. The person who loves the soup and the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 are next to each other.\n2. The person who loves blue is Alice.\n3. The person who loves eating grilled cheese is in the fourth house.\n4. The person who loves white is in the first house.\n5. Arnold and the person who is a pizza lover are next to each other.\n6. The person who loves brown is in the fourth house.\n7. The person who loves purple is Arnold.\n8. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is the person who loves white.\n9. Carol is the person who loves brown.\n10. The person who loves blue is the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n11. The person who loves the soup is in the first house.\n\nLet's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n- From clue 11, the person who loves the soup is in the first house.\n- From clue 4, the person who loves white is in the first house.\n- From clue 8, the person who uses a OnePlus 9 is the person who loves white, so the person in the first house uses a OnePlus 9.\n- From clue 6, the person who loves brown is in the fourth house.\n- From clue 9, Carol is the person who loves brown, so Carol is in the fourth house.\n- From clue 3, the person who loves eating grilled cheese is in the fourth house.\n- From clue 7, the person who loves purple is Arnold.\n- From clue 5, Arnold and the person who is a pizza lover are next to each other.\n- From clue 2, the person who loves blue is Alice.\n- From clue 10, the person who loves blue is the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Loves soup, loves white, uses OnePlus 9\n- House 2: \n- House 3: \n- House 4: Carol, loves brown, loves grilled cheese\n\nSince Arnold loves purple and is next to the pizza lover, Arnold must be in House 2 or House 3. Alice loves blue and uses a Huawei P50, so she cannot be in House 1 or House 4. Let's place Alice in House 3.\n\n- House 1: Loves soup, loves white, uses OnePlus 9\n- House 2: Arnold, loves purple\n- House 3: Alice, loves blue, uses Huawei P50\n- House 4: Carol, loves brown, loves grilled cheese\n\nNow, Arnold must be in House 2, and the pizza lover must be in House 3. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 must be in House 2 or House 3, but since Alice is in House 3, the Samsung Galaxy S21 user must be in House 2.\n\n- House 1: Loves soup, loves white, uses OnePlus 9\n- House 2: Arnold, loves purple, uses Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 3: Alice, loves blue, uses Huawei P50, loves pizza\n- House 4: Carol, loves brown, loves grilled cheese\n\nThe only person left is Bob, who must be in House 1.\n\n- House 1: Bob, loves soup, loves white, uses OnePlus 9\n- House 2: Arnold, loves purple, uses Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 3: Alice, loves blue, uses Huawei P50, loves pizza\n- House 4: Carol, loves brown, loves grilled cheese\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Bob>>>"
