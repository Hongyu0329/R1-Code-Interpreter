    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, animals, cigars, and phone models in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. Arnold uses a Huawei P50.\n2. The fish enthusiast is directly left of Arnold.\n3. Bob is in the second house.\n4. The person who smokes Blue Master is directly left of the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n5. The bird keeper uses a OnePlus 9.\n6. Arnold smokes Blue Master.\n7. Carol is the cat lover.\n8. The person who smokes Pall Mall and Arnold are next to each other.\n9. The Dunhill smoker is the cat lover.\n\nLet's start by placing Arnold and Bob:\n\n- Bob is in the second house.\n- Arnold uses a Huawei P50 and smokes Blue Master. He cannot be in the first house because the fish enthusiast is directly left of him. So, Arnold must be in the third house.\n\nNow, let's place the other people and characteristics:\n\n- The fish enthusiast is in the second house (directly left of Arnold).\n- The person who smokes Blue Master (Arnold) is directly left of the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21, so the Samsung user is in the fourth house.\n- The bird keeper uses a OnePlus 9, and since Bob is in the second house, Bob must be the bird keeper.\n- Carol is the cat lover and smokes Dunhill. Since Bob is in the second house and Arnold is in the third, Carol must be in the first house.\n- The person who smokes Pall Mall is next to Arnold, so they must be in the second house.\n\nLet's summarize the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Carol (cat lover, Dunhill)\n- House 2: Bob (bird keeper, OnePlus 9, Pall Mall)\n- House 3: Arnold (Huawei P50, Blue Master)\n- House 4: (Samsung Galaxy S21)\n\nThe person in House 1 is Carol.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is:\n\n<<<Carol>>>"
