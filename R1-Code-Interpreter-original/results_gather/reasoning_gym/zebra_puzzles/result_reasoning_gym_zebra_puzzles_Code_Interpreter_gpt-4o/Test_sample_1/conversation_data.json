    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, colors, cigars, and lunches in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. The person who loves white is in the first house.\n   - House 1: White\n\n2. The Prince smoker is the person who loves eating grilled cheese.\n   - Prince = Grilled Cheese\n\n3. The person who loves stir fry is directly left of the person who loves brown.\n   - Alice loves stir fry (from clue 4), so Alice is directly left of Bob (who loves brown, from clue 7).\n\n4. Alice is the person who loves stir fry.\n   - Alice = Stir Fry\n\n5. The person who loves eating grilled cheese and the person who smokes Blue Master are next to each other.\n   - Grilled Cheese (Prince) is next to Blue Master (Arnold, from clue 9).\n\n6. The Dunhill smoker is the person who loves the soup.\n   - Dunhill = Soup\n\n7. Bob is the person who loves brown.\n   - Bob = Brown\n\n8. The person who loves blue is the person who loves the soup.\n   - Blue = Soup (Dunhill)\n\n9. Arnold is the person who smokes Blue Master.\n   - Arnold = Blue Master\n\nLet's organize this information and deduce the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: White\n- House 2: Alice (Stir Fry)\n- House 3: Bob (Brown)\n- House 4: Arnold (Blue Master)\n\nSince Alice is directly left of Bob, Alice must be in House 2 and Bob in House 3. Arnold, who smokes Blue Master, must be in House 4. The person who loves white must be in House 1.\n\nNow, let's determine the name of the person in House 1. The remaining name is Carol.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is:\n\n<<<Carol>>>"
