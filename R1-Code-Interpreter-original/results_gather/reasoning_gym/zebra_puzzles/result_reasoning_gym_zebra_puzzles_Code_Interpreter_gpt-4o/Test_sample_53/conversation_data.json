    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, phone models, favorite colors, and cigars in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. The person who smokes Blue Master uses a Google Pixel 6.\n2. The person who loves brown and Carol are next to each other.\n3. Alice uses a Google Pixel 6.\n4. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 loves brown.\n5. The Prince smoker uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n6. The person who loves purple is the Prince smoker.\n7. The person who smokes Pall Mall is in the third house.\n8. The person who loves white is directly left of the person who loves brown.\n9. The person who loves blue is Arnold.\n\nLet's start solving step by step:\n\n- From clue 3, Alice uses a Google Pixel 6.\n- From clue 1, the person who smokes Blue Master uses a Google Pixel 6, so Alice smokes Blue Master.\n- From clue 4, the person who uses a OnePlus 9 loves brown.\n- From clue 8, the person who loves white is directly left of the person who loves brown.\n- From clue 9, Arnold loves blue.\n- From clue 7, the person who smokes Pall Mall is in the third house.\n\nLet's deduce the arrangement:\n\n1. Since Alice uses a Google Pixel 6 and smokes Blue Master, she cannot be in the third house (Pall Mall is there). So, Alice must be in house 2 or 4.\n2. The person who loves brown must be in house 2 or 3 (since house 1 must be white, and house 4 cannot be brown because it would not have a house to its right).\n3. Since Arnold loves blue, he cannot be in house 1 (white) or house 2 (brown), so Arnold must be in house 4.\n4. Since Alice cannot be in house 3 (Pall Mall), Alice must be in house 2.\n5. Therefore, the person who loves brown must be in house 3.\n6. The person who loves white must be in house 1.\n7. Since Carol is next to the person who loves brown, Carol must be in house 2 or 4. But Alice is in house 2, so Carol must be in house 4.\n8. Since Arnold is in house 4, and Carol is in house 4, Arnold must be Carol.\n9. The person who smokes Prince and loves purple must be in house 1 (since house 2 is Alice, house 3 is brown, and house 4 is blue).\n\nNow, let's finalize the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Person who loves white, smokes Prince, uses Samsung Galaxy S21.\n- House 2: Alice, uses Google Pixel 6, smokes Blue Master.\n- House 3: Person who loves brown, uses OnePlus 9, smokes Pall Mall.\n- House 4: Arnold (Carol), loves blue.\n\nThe person in house 1 is the one who loves white, smokes Prince, and uses Samsung Galaxy S21. Since Carol is in house 4, the person in house 1 must be Bob.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is:\n\n<<<Bob>>>"
