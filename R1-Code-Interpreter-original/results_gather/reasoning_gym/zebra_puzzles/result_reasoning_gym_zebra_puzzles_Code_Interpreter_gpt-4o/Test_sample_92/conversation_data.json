    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to determine the arrangement of people, their favorite smoothies, lunches, and flowers in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. The person who loves eating grilled cheese is the Darkness smoothie drinker.\n2. The Butterscotch smoothie drinker is Carol.\n3. The person who loves the bouquet of iris is directly left of the person who loves a carnations arrangement.\n4. The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is Bob.\n5. The Darkness smoothie drinker is the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.\n6. The person who loves stir fry is directly left of Carol.\n7. The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in the first house.\n8. The person who loves stir fry is Arnold.\n9. The person who loves the bouquet of iris is the person who loves the soup.\n\nLet's start solving the puzzle step by step:\n\n- From clue 7, we know Bob is in the first house because he loves the Dragonfruit smoothie.\n- From clue 8, Arnold loves stir fry.\n- From clue 6, Arnold is directly left of Carol, so Arnold must be in house 2, and Carol in house 3.\n- From clue 2, Carol drinks the Butterscotch smoothie.\n- From clue 1 and 5, the Darkness smoothie drinker loves grilled cheese and daffodils. This person cannot be Bob or Carol, so it must be the person in house 4.\n- From clue 3, the person who loves the bouquet of iris is directly left of the person who loves carnations. Since the person in house 4 loves daffodils, the person in house 3 must love carnations, and the person in house 2 must love iris.\n- From clue 9, the person who loves the bouquet of iris also loves soup. So Arnold loves soup.\n- The only person left is Alice, who must be in house 4.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n\n- House 1: Bob, Dragonfruit smoothie, ?, ?\n- House 2: Arnold, ?, Stir fry, Iris\n- House 3: Carol, Butterscotch smoothie, ?, Carnations\n- House 4: Alice, Darkness smoothie, Grilled cheese, Daffodils\n\nFrom the above, we can see that Bob is in House 1.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is:\n\n<<<Bob>>>"
