    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, phone models, favorite flowers, and favorite smoothies in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. The person who loves the bouquet of iris is directly left of Arnold.\n2. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the person who loves the bouquet of lilies.\n3. The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is Carol.\n4. The person who uses a Huawei P50 and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover are next to each other.\n5. Alice is the Desert smoothie lover.\n6. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is in the second house.\n7. The person who loves a carnations arrangement is in the fourth house.\n8. The Darkness smoothie drinker is directly left of the person who loves a carnations arrangement.\n9. The person who uses a Huawei P50 is the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.\n\nLet's start solving the puzzle step by step:\n\n- From clue 6, we know that the person who uses a OnePlus 9 is in the second house.\n- From clue 7, the person who loves carnations is in the fourth house.\n- From clue 8, the Darkness smoothie drinker is directly left of the person who loves carnations, so the Darkness smoothie drinker is in the third house.\n- From clue 5, Alice is the Desert smoothie lover, so Alice is not in the third house.\n- From clue 3 and 9, Carol loves daffodils and uses a Huawei P50. Since Carol loves daffodils, she cannot be in the fourth house, and since she uses a Huawei P50, she cannot be in the second house. Therefore, Carol must be in the first house.\n- From clue 4, the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is next to the Huawei P50 user (Carol), so the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in the second house.\n- From clue 5, Alice is the Desert smoothie lover, so Alice must be in the fourth house.\n- From clue 2, the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 loves lilies. Since the person in the fourth house loves carnations, the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 must be in the third house.\n- From clue 1, the person who loves iris is directly left of Arnold. Since the person in the fourth house is Alice, Arnold must be in the third house, and the person who loves iris must be in the second house.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n\n- House 1: Carol, Huawei P50, Daffodils, ?\n- House 2: ?, OnePlus 9, Iris, Dragonfruit\n- House 3: Arnold, Samsung Galaxy S21, Lilies, Darkness\n- House 4: Alice, ?, Carnations, Desert\n\nThe only name left for House 2 is Bob.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Carol>>>"
