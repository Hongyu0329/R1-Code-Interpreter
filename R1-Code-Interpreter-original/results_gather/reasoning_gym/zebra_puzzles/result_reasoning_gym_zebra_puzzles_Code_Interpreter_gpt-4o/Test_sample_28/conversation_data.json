    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite flowers, colors, and lunches in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. The pizza lover and the person who loves lilies are next to each other.\n2. Alice and the person who loves brown are next to each other.\n3. Carol loves stir fry.\n4. Arnold loves blue.\n5. The person who loves iris also loves purple.\n6. The person who loves brown is in the third house.\n7. Alice loves soup.\n8. The person who loves iris is in the first house.\n9. Arnold loves lilies.\n10. The person who loves daffodils is directly left of Arnold.\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:\n\n- From clue 8, the person who loves iris is in the first house.\n- From clue 5, the person who loves iris also loves purple.\n- From clue 6, the person who loves brown is in the third house.\n- From clue 2, Alice is next to the person who loves brown, so Alice must be in house 2 or 4.\n- From clue 7, Alice loves soup.\n- From clue 4, Arnold loves blue.\n- From clue 9, Arnold loves lilies.\n- From clue 10, the person who loves daffodils is directly left of Arnold, so Arnold cannot be in house 1.\n- From clue 3, Carol loves stir fry.\n\nLet's fill in the information we have:\n\n- House 1: Iris, Purple\n- House 3: Brown\n- House 4: Arnold, Blue, Lilies\n\nNow, let's deduce the remaining information:\n\n- Since Arnold is in house 4, the person who loves daffodils must be in house 3.\n- Alice must be in house 2 (since she is next to the person who loves brown in house 3).\n- Carol must be in house 1 (since she cannot be in house 3 or 4, and Alice is in house 2).\n\nLet's fill in the remaining information:\n\n- House 1: Carol, Iris, Purple, Stir Fry\n- House 2: Alice, Soup\n- House 3: Brown, Daffodils\n- House 4: Arnold, Blue, Lilies\n\nNow, let's determine the lunch for the person in house 3 and the flower for Alice:\n\n- From clue 1, the pizza lover and the person who loves lilies are next to each other. Since Arnold loves lilies and is in house 4, the pizza lover must be in house 3.\n- Therefore, the person in house 3 loves pizza.\n- Alice, in house 2, must love carnations (since daffodils and lilies are already taken).\n\nThe final arrangement is:\n\n- House 1: Carol, Iris, Purple, Stir Fry\n- House 2: Alice, Carnations, Soup\n- House 3: Bob, Brown, Daffodils, Pizza\n- House 4: Arnold, Blue, Lilies\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Carol>>>"
