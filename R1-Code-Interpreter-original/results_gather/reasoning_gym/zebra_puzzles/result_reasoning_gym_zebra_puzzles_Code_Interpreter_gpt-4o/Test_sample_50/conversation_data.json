    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their children, favorite drinks, and favorite colors in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. Bob and the one who only drinks water are next to each other.\n2. The person who loves brown and the person who is the mother of Timothy are next to each other.\n3. The person who is the mother of Billy is in the second house.\n4. The person's child is named Alice is Carol.\n5. The boba tea drinker is the person's child is named Alice.\n6. Arnold and the person who is the mother of Billy are next to each other.\n7. Arnold is the person's child is named Bella.\n8. The person who loves blue is Carol.\n9. The person who is the mother of Billy is directly left of the person who loves white.\n10. The one who only drinks water is in the third house.\n11. The coffee drinker is the person's child is named Bella.\n\nLet's start solving step by step:\n\n- From clue 10, we know the person who only drinks water is in the third house.\n- From clue 3, the person who is the mother of Billy is in the second house.\n- From clue 9, the person who is the mother of Billy is directly left of the person who loves white, so the person who loves white is in the third house.\n- From clue 1, Bob and the one who only drinks water are next to each other, so Bob is in either the second or fourth house.\n- From clue 6, Arnold and the person who is the mother of Billy are next to each other, so Arnold is in the first house.\n- From clue 7, Arnold's child is Bella.\n- From clue 11, the coffee drinker is Arnold, as Arnold's child is Bella.\n- From clue 8, Carol loves blue.\n- From clue 4, Carol's child is Alice.\n- From clue 5, the boba tea drinker is Carol, as Carol's child is Alice.\n- From clue 2, the person who loves brown and the person who is the mother of Timothy are next to each other. Since the person who loves brown cannot be in the second house (mother of Billy) or third house (loves white), they must be in the first house, and the mother of Timothy must be in the second house.\n\nNow, let's fill in the details:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Bella, Coffee, Brown\n- House 2: Bob, Billy, ?, ?\n- House 3: ?, ?, Water, White\n- House 4: Carol, Alice, Boba Tea, Blue\n\nSince Bob is in the second house, the mother of Timothy must be in the third house. The only remaining person is Alice, who must be in the third house.\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Bella, Coffee, Brown\n- House 2: Bob, Billy, ?, ?\n- House 3: Alice, Timothy, Water, White\n- House 4: Carol, Alice, Boba Tea, Blue\n\nFinally, the only remaining drink for Bob is milk, and the only remaining color is purple.\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Bella, Coffee, Brown\n- House 2: Bob, Billy, Milk, Purple\n- House 3: Alice, Timothy, Water, White\n- House 4: Carol, Alice, Boba Tea, Blue\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Arnold>>>"
