    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their phone models, nationalities, and favorite cigars in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. Bob uses a OnePlus 9.\n2. The Chinese is directly left of Alice.\n3. Arnold is in the first house.\n4. The person who uses a Huawei P50 is directly left of Bob.\n5. The person who smokes Blue Master is directly left of the person who uses a OnePlus 9.\n6. The Dane is directly left of the person who smokes Blue Master.\n7. The Prince smoker is the British person.\n8. The Dunhill smoker and the Dane are next to each other.\n9. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the Dane.\n\nLet's start by placing Arnold in the first house, as per clue 3. Then, we'll use the other clues to fill in the rest of the information.\n\n1. Arnold is in House 1.\n2. Bob uses a OnePlus 9, so he cannot be in House 1.\n3. The Dane uses a Samsung Galaxy S21, so he cannot be in House 1.\n4. The Chinese is directly left of Alice, so Alice cannot be in House 1.\n\nSince Arnold is in House 1, he cannot be Bob, the Dane, or Alice. Therefore, Arnold must be the Chinese person.\n\nNow, let's use the remaining clues to deduce the arrangement:\n\n- Since Arnold is Chinese and in House 1, Alice must be in House 2.\n- Bob, who uses a OnePlus 9, must be in House 4, as the person who uses a Huawei P50 is directly left of Bob (House 3).\n- The Dane, who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21, must be in House 3.\n- The person who smokes Blue Master is directly left of Bob, so they must be in House 3.\n- The Dane is directly left of the person who smokes Blue Master, so the Dane must be in House 2.\n- The Prince smoker is the British person, so they must be in House 4.\n- The Dunhill smoker and the Dane are next to each other, so the Dunhill smoker must be in House 1.\n\nLet's summarize the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Arnold (Chinese, Dunhill smoker)\n- House 2: Alice (Dane, Samsung Galaxy S21)\n- House 3: (Huawei P50, Blue Master smoker)\n- House 4: Bob (British, OnePlus 9, Prince smoker)\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Arnold>>>"
