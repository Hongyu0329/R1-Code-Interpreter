    "\nassistant > To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite colors, phone models, and smoothies in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. Bob and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover are next to each other.\n2. The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n3. The person who loves white is Carol.\n4. Alice is directly left of the person who uses a OnePlus 9.\n5. The person who loves purple is the Darkness smoothie drinker.\n6. The Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in the first house.\n7. The Darkness smoothie drinker is in the third house.\n8. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the person who loves white.\n9. The person who loves purple is directly left of the person who loves blue.\n\nLet's start solving step by step:\n\n- From clue 6, the Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in the first house.\n- From clue 2, the person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker, so the person in the first house uses a Google Pixel 6.\n- From clue 7, the Darkness smoothie drinker is in the third house.\n- From clue 5, the person who loves purple is the Darkness smoothie drinker, so the person in the third house loves purple.\n- From clue 9, the person who loves purple is directly left of the person who loves blue, so the person in the fourth house loves blue.\n- From clue 3, the person who loves white is Carol, and from clue 8, the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the person who loves white. Therefore, Carol is in the second house, loves white, and uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n- From clue 4, Alice is directly left of the person who uses a OnePlus 9, so Alice is in the third house, and the person in the fourth house uses a OnePlus 9.\n- From clue 1, Bob and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover are next to each other. Since the Dragonfruit smoothie lover cannot be in the first house (Butterscotch is there), and Alice is in the third house, Bob must be in the second house, and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover must be in the third house.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n\n- House 1: Butterscotch smoothie, Google Pixel 6\n- House 2: Carol, White, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 3: Alice, Purple, Darkness smoothie\n- House 4: OnePlus 9, Blue\n\nSince the Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in the first house, and we have not assigned a name to this person yet, the person in the first house must be Arnold.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is:\n\n<<<Arnold>>>"
