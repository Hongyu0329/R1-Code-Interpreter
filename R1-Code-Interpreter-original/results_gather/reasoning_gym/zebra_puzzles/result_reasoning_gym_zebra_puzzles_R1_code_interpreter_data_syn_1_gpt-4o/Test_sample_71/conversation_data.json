    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite flowers, animals, and smoothies in each house. Let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. Bob drinks the Butterscotch smoothie.\n2. The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in the third house.\n3. Carol drinks the Darkness smoothie.\n4. The cat lover is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n5. The bird keeper loves carnations.\n6. The Desert smoothie lover is in the fourth house.\n7. Alice loves iris.\n8. The bird keeper drinks the Butterscotch smoothie.\n9. The Desert smoothie lover owns a dog.\n10. Alice is directly left of the lilies lover.\n11. The carnations lover is directly left of the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n\nLet's start by organizing the information:\n\n- House 3: Dragonfruit smoothie, Cat lover\n- House 4: Desert smoothie, Dog owner\n- Bob: Butterscotch smoothie, Bird keeper, Carnations lover\n- Carol: Darkness smoothie\n- Alice: Iris lover\n\nFrom clues 2 and 4, we know the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in House 3 and is also the cat lover.\n\nFrom clue 6, the Desert smoothie lover is in House 4 and is the dog owner.\n\nFrom clue 8, Bob is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker and the bird keeper, and from clue 5, he loves carnations. Therefore, Bob cannot be in House 3 or 4, so he must be in House 1 or 2.\n\nFrom clue 11, the carnations lover (Bob) is directly left of the Dragonfruit smoothie lover (House 3), so Bob must be in House 2.\n\nFrom clue 10, Alice is directly left of the lilies lover. Since Bob is in House 2, Alice must be in House 1, and the lilies lover must be in House 2.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information:\n\n- House 1: Alice, Iris lover\n- House 2: Bob, Butterscotch smoothie, Bird keeper, Carnations lover, Lilies lover\n- House 3: Dragonfruit smoothie, Cat lover\n- House 4: Desert smoothie, Dog owner\n\nCarol must be in House 3 because she drinks the Darkness smoothie, and the only remaining person for House 4 is the Desert smoothie lover.\n\nNow, let's finalize the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Alice, Iris lover\n- House 2: Bob, Butterscotch smoothie, Bird keeper, Carnations lover\n- House 3: Carol, Dragonfruit smoothie, Cat lover\n- House 4: Desert smoothie, Dog owner\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\n<<<Alice>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
