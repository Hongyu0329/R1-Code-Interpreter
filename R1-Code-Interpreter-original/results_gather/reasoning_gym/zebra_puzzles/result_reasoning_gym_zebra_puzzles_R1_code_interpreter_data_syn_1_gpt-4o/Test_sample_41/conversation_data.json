    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of people, their favorite colors, lunches, and flowers in each house. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. The person who loves purple is in the second house.\n2. Arnold is directly left of the person who loves eating grilled cheese.\n3. The person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the first house.\n4. The person who loves purple and the person who loves white are next to each other.\n5. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is the person who loves stir fry.\n6. The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is Carol.\n7. Bob is the person who loves eating grilled cheese.\n8. The person who loves brown is the person who is a pizza lover.\n9. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is in the third house.\n10. Arnold is the person who loves brown.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know for sure:\n\n- House 1: The person who loves the bouquet of iris.\n- House 2: The person who loves purple.\n- House 3: The person who loves the bouquet of lilies and stir fry.\n- House 4: The person who loves white (since they are next to the person who loves purple).\n\nFrom clue 10, Arnold loves brown, and from clue 8, the person who loves brown is a pizza lover. Therefore, Arnold is a pizza lover.\n\nFrom clue 2, Arnold is directly left of Bob, who loves grilled cheese. Therefore, Arnold must be in House 3, and Bob must be in House 4.\n\nNow, let's place Carol. From clue 6, Carol loves daffodils. Since House 1 is the only house left without a flower assigned, Carol must be in House 1.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- House 1: Carol, daffodils, iris\n- House 2: Loves purple\n- House 3: Arnold, brown, pizza, lilies, stir fry\n- House 4: Bob, grilled cheese, white\n\nFrom clue 4, the person who loves purple and the person who loves white are next to each other. Since House 4 loves white, House 2 must love purple.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- House 1: Carol, daffodils, iris\n- House 2: Loves purple\n- House 3: Arnold, brown, pizza, lilies, stir fry\n- House 4: Bob, grilled cheese, white\n\nThe only person left is Alice, who must be in House 2.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- House 1: Carol, daffodils, iris\n- House 2: Alice, purple\n- House 3: Arnold, brown, pizza, lilies, stir fry\n- House 4: Bob, grilled cheese, white\n\nFinally, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\n<<<Carol>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
