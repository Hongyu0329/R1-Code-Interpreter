    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of people, their favorite smoothies, lunches, and drinks in each house. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information:\n\n1. The person who loves stir fry is Arnold.\n2. The person who loves stir fry is the person who likes milk.\n3. Alice is in the second house.\n4. Bob and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover are next to each other.\n5. The person who is a pizza lover is the one who only drinks water.\n6. The Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in the third house.\n7. Arnold is in the third house.\n8. The person who loves eating grilled cheese is directly left of the boba tea drinker.\n9. The Desert smoothie lover is in the first house.\n\nFrom these clues, we can start filling in the information:\n\n- From clue 7, Arnold is in the third house.\n- From clue 1 and 2, Arnold loves stir fry and likes milk.\n- From clue 6, the Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in the third house, so Arnold's favorite smoothie is Butterscotch.\n- From clue 3, Alice is in the second house.\n- From clue 9, the Desert smoothie lover is in the first house.\n\nNow, let's use the remaining clues to deduce the rest:\n\n- From clue 4, Bob and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover are next to each other. Since Arnold is in the third house, Bob must be in either the second or fourth house. Alice is in the second house, so Bob must be in the fourth house. Therefore, the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in the second house.\n- From clue 5, the pizza lover drinks water. Since Arnold drinks milk, the pizza lover must be in either the first or fourth house. Since Bob is in the fourth house, and we know from clue 4 that the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in the second house, the pizza lover must be in the first house.\n- From clue 8, the grilled cheese lover is directly left of the boba tea drinker. Since Alice is in the second house, and the first house is the only one left for the grilled cheese lover, the boba tea drinker must be in the second house.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information we have:\n\n- House 1: ???, Desert smoothie, Pizza, Water\n- House 2: Alice, Dragonfruit smoothie, Grilled cheese, Boba tea\n- House 3: Arnold, Butterscotch smoothie, Stir fry, Milk\n- House 4: Bob, ??? smoothie, ???, ???\n\nThe only person left for House 1 is Carol. Therefore, Carol lives in House 1.\n\nLet's confirm this by checking the remaining clues:\n\n- House 4 must have the remaining smoothie, which is the Dragonfruit smoothie, and the remaining lunch and drink options.\n\nNow, let's finalize the answer:\n\n<<<Carol>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
