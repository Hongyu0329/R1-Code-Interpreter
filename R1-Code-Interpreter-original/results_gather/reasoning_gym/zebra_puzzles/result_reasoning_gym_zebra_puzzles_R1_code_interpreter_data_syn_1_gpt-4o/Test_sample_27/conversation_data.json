    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their lunches, favorite smoothies, and favorite cigars in each house. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. The person who is a pizza lover is in the fourth house.\n2. The Darkness smoothie drinker is the person who is a pizza lover.\n3. The Desert smoothie lover is Alice.\n4. The Dunhill smoker is directly left of the person who smokes Blue Master.\n5. Arnold is directly left of the person who is a pizza lover.\n6. Bob is the person who loves the soup.\n7. The Dunhill smoker is the Desert smoothie lover.\n8. The person who loves the soup is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n9. The Prince smoker is the person who loves eating grilled cheese.\n\nLet's start by placing the known information:\n\n- House 4: Pizza lover, Darkness smoothie drinker.\n- House 3: Arnold (since Arnold is directly left of the pizza lover in house 4).\n- House 2: Dunhill smoker, Desert smoothie lover (Alice).\n- House 1: Blue Master smoker (since Dunhill is directly left of Blue Master).\n\nNow, let's fill in the rest of the information:\n\n- Bob loves soup and is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker. Since house 2 is Alice and house 3 is Arnold, Bob must be in house 1.\n- The Prince smoker loves grilled cheese. Since house 1 is Bob and house 4 is the pizza lover, the Prince smoker must be in house 3 (Arnold).\n\nNow, let's summarize the information:\n\n- House 1: Bob, Soup, Butterscotch, Blue Master\n- House 2: Alice, Stir Fry, Desert, Dunhill\n- House 3: Arnold, Grilled Cheese, Dragonfruit, Prince\n- House 4: Carol, Pizza, Darkness, Pall Mall\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\n<<<Bob>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
