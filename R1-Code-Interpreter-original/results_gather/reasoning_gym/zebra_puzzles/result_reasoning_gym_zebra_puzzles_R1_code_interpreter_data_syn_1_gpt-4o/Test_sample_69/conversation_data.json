The dog owner is directly left of the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.\n\nLet's start by organizing the information:\n\n- House 1: ?, ?, ?, ?\n- House 2: ?, ?, ?, Dog\n- House 3: ?, ?, ?, Cat\n- House 4: ?, ?, ?, ?\n\nFrom clue 9, the dog owner is directly left of the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils. Therefore, the person who loves daffodils must be in House 3.\n\n- House 1: ?, ?, ?, ?\n- House 2: ?, ?, ?, Dog\n- House 3: ?, Daffodils, ?, Cat\n- House 4: ?, ?, ?, ?\n\nFrom clue 6, the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils and Alice are next to each other. Therefore, Alice must be in House 2 or House 4. Since House 2 has the dog, Alice must be in House 4.\n\n- House 1: ?, ?, ?, ?\n- House 2: ?, ?, ?, Dog\n- House 3: ?, Daffodils, ?, Cat\n- House 4: Alice, ?, ?, ?\n\nFrom clue 5 and 7, Bob uses a Huawei P50 and loves lilies. Bob cannot be in House 4 (Alice) or House 3 (Daffodils), so Bob must be in House 1.\n\n- House 1: Bob, Lilies, Huawei P50, ?\n- House 2: ?, ?, ?, Dog\n- House 3: ?, Daffodils, ?, Cat\n- House 4: Alice, ?, ?, ?\n\nFrom clue 1, the person who loves the bouquet of iris uses a Samsung Galaxy S21. This person cannot be in House 1 (Lilies), House 3 (Daffodils), or House 4 (Alice), so they must be in House 2.\n\n- House 1: Bob, Lilies, Huawei P50, ?\n- House 2: ?, Iris, Samsung Galaxy S21, Dog\n- House 3: ?, Daffodils, ?, Cat\n- House 4: Alice, ?, ?, ?\n\nFrom clue 3, the fish enthusiast uses a Google Pixel 6. This person cannot be in House 2 (Samsung Galaxy S21), so they must be in House 4.\n\n- House 1: Bob, Lilies, Huawei P50, ?\n- House 2: ?, Iris, Samsung Galaxy S21, Dog\n- House 3: ?, Daffodils, ?, Cat\n- House 4: Alice, ?, Google Pixel 6, Fish\n\nFrom clue 2, Arnold is the bird keeper. Arnold cannot be in House 4 (Fish), so Arnold must be in House 3.\n\n- House 1: Bob, Lilies, Huawei P50, ?\n- House 2: ?, Iris, Samsung Galaxy S21, Dog\n- House 3: Arnold, Daffodils, ?, Cat\n- House 4: Alice, ?, Google Pixel 6, Fish\n\nNow, the only person left is Carol, who must be in House 2.\n\n- House 1: Bob, Lilies, Huawei P50, ?\n- House 2: Carol, Iris, Samsung Galaxy S21, Dog\n- House 3: Arnold, Daffodils, ?, Cat\n- House 4: Alice, ?, Google Pixel 6, Fish\n\nFinally, the only pet left for House 1 is the bird.\n\n- House 1: Bob, Lilies, Huawei P50, Bird\n- House 2: Carol, Iris, Samsung Galaxy S21, Dog\n- House 3: Arnold, Daffodils, ?, Cat\n- House 4: Alice, ?, Google Pixel 6, Fish\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\n<<<Bob>>>"
