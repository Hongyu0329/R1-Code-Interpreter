    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite cigars, drinks, and phone models in each house. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. The Dunhill smoker is in the first house.\n2. The person who likes milk is the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n3. The person who smokes Blue Master is Alice.\n4. The person who likes milk is the person who smokes Blue Master.\n5. The person who smokes Blue Master and the person who uses a OnePlus 9 are next to each other.\n6. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is in the fourth house.\n7. Carol is the one who only drinks water.\n8. The boba tea drinker and the Prince smoker are next to each other.\n9. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the coffee drinker.\n10. Bob is the person who uses a OnePlus 9.\n\nLet's start by organizing the information:\n\n- House 1: Dunhill smoker\n- House 4: Samsung Galaxy S21 user, coffee drinker\n- Bob uses OnePlus 9\n- Carol drinks water\n- Alice smokes Blue Master and drinks milk, uses Huawei P50\n- Blue Master smoker (Alice) and OnePlus 9 user (Bob) are next to each other\n\nFrom the above, we can deduce:\n- Alice must be in House 2 or 3 because she is next to Bob, who uses OnePlus 9.\n- Since Alice drinks milk and uses Huawei P50, she cannot be in House 1 or 4.\n- Bob must be in House 2 or 3, next to Alice.\n- Carol, who drinks water, cannot be in House 2 or 3 because Alice drinks milk and Bob is next to Alice.\n- Therefore, Carol must be in House 1 or 4. Since House 4 is occupied by the coffee drinker, Carol must be in House 1.\n\nNow, let's use this information to fill in the rest:\n\n- House 1: Carol, Dunhill smoker, water drinker\n- House 2: Alice, Blue Master smoker, milk drinker, Huawei P50 user\n- House 3: Bob, OnePlus 9 user\n- House 4: Samsung Galaxy S21 user, coffee drinker\n\nNow, let's determine the name of the person in House 1:\n\n- House 1: Carol\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\n<<<Carol>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
