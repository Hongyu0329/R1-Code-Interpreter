    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their phone models, favorite colors, and lunch preferences in each house. Let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. The person who loves the soup is in the first house.\n2. The person who loves white is in the first house.\n3. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is the person who loves white.\n4. The person who loves blue is Alice.\n5. The person who loves blue is the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n6. The person who loves eating grilled cheese is in the fourth house.\n7. The person who loves brown is in the fourth house.\n8. Carol is the person who loves brown.\n9. The person who loves purple is Arnold.\n10. Arnold and the person who is a pizza lover are next to each other.\n11. The person who loves the soup and the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 are next to each other.\n\nLet's start filling in the information:\n\n- House 1: Soup, White, OnePlus 9\n- House 4: Grilled Cheese, Brown, Carol\n\nFrom the clues, we know:\n- Alice loves blue and uses a Huawei P50.\n- Arnold loves purple.\n- Arnold and the pizza lover are next to each other.\n- The soup lover and Samsung Galaxy S21 user are next to each other.\n\nLet's deduce the positions:\n\n- House 1: Soup, White, OnePlus 9\n- House 2: Samsung Galaxy S21 (next to House 1)\n- House 3: Alice, Blue, Huawei P50\n- House 4: Grilled Cheese, Brown, Carol\n\nSince Arnold loves purple and must be next to the pizza lover, and the only remaining house for Arnold is House 2, Arnold must be in House 2. Therefore, the pizza lover must be in House 3.\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining details:\n\n- House 1: Soup, White, OnePlus 9\n- House 2: Arnold, Purple, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 3: Alice, Blue, Huawei P50, Pizza\n- House 4: Grilled Cheese, Brown, Carol\n\nThe only person left is Bob, who must be in House 1.\n\nThus, the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\n<<<Bob>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
