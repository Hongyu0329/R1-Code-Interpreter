    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite colors, lunches, and cigars in the four houses. Let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. **Carol loves soup.**\n2. **Carol is directly left of the Dunhill smoker.** (This means Carol is not in house 4, and the Dunhill smoker is not in house 1.)\n3. **The person who loves purple is partial to Pall Mall.**\n4. **The person who loves white is in the first house.**\n5. **The person who loves blue is directly left of the person who loves purple.** (This means the person who loves blue is not in house 4, and the person who loves purple is not in house 1.)\n6. **The person who loves stir fry is in the third house.**\n7. **The Prince smoker is a pizza lover.**\n8. **Arnold is the Prince smoker.**\n9. **The Dunhill smoker is Bob.**\n10. **The person who smokes Blue Master loves brown.**\n\nLet's start by placing the known information into a table format:\n\n| House | Name  | Color | Lunch      | Cigar      |\n|-------|-------|-------|------------|------------|\n| 1     |       | White |            |            |\n| 2     | Carol |       | Soup       |            |\n| 3     |       |       | Stir Fry   |            |\n| 4     |       |       |            |            |\n\nFrom clue 2, Bob (Dunhill smoker) must be in house 3, since Carol is in house 2 and Bob is directly to the right of Carol.\n\n| House | Name  | Color | Lunch      | Cigar      |\n|-------|-------|-------|------------|------------|\n| 1     |       | White |            |            |\n| 2     | Carol |       | Soup       |            |\n| 3     | Bob   |       | Stir Fry   | Dunhill    |\n| 4     |       |       |            |            |\n\nFrom clue 8, Arnold is the Prince smoker and loves pizza. Since Bob is in house 3, Arnold cannot be in house 3. Therefore, Arnold must be in house 4.\n\n| House | Name   | Color | Lunch      | Cigar      |\n|-------|--------|-------|------------|------------|\n| 1     |        | White |            |            |\n| 2     | Carol  |       | Soup       |            |\n| 3     | Bob    |       | Stir Fry   | Dunhill    |\n| 4     | Arnold |       | Pizza      | Prince     |\n\nFrom clue 5, the person who loves blue is directly left of the person who loves purple. Since house 1 is white, house 2 must be blue, and house 3 must be purple.\n\n| House | Name   | Color | Lunch      | Cigar      |\n|-------|--------|-------|------------|------------|\n| 1     |        | White |            |            |\n| 2     | Carol  | Blue  | Soup       |            |\n| 3     | Bob    | Purple| Stir Fry   | Dunhill    |\n| 4     | Arnold |       | Pizza      | Prince     |\n\nFrom clue 10, the person who smokes Blue Master loves brown. Since house 2 is blue and house 3 is purple, house 4 must be brown.\n\n| House | Name   | Color | Lunch      | Cigar      |\n|-------|--------|-------|------------|------------|\n| 1     |        | White |            |            |\n| 2     | Carol  | Blue  | Soup       |            |\n| 3     | Bob    | Purple| Stir Fry   | Dunhill    |\n| 4     | Arnold | Brown | Pizza      | Prince     |\n\nFrom clue 3, the person who loves purple is partial to Pall Mall. Since Bob is in house 3 and loves purple, Bob must smoke Pall Mall.\n\n| House | Name   | Color | Lunch      | Cigar      |\n|-------|--------|-------|------------|------------|\n| 1     |        | White |            |            |\n| 2     | Carol  | Blue  | Soup       |            |\n| 3     | Bob    | Purple| Stir Fry   | Pall Mall  |\n| 4     | Arnold | Brown | Pizza      | Prince     |\n\nFinally, from clue 9, the person who smokes Blue Master loves brown. Since Arnold is in house 4 and loves brown, Arnold must smoke Blue Master.\n\n| House | Name   | Color | Lunch      | Cigar      |\n|-------|--------|-------|------------|------------|\n| 1     |        | White |            |            |\n| 2     | Carol  | Blue  | Soup       |            |\n| 3     | Bob    | Purple| Stir Fry   | Pall Mall  |\n| 4     | Arnold | Brown | Pizza      | Blue Master|\n\nThe only person left is Alice, who must be in house 1.\n\n| House | Name   | Color | Lunch      | Cigar      |\n|-------|--------|-------|------------|------------|\n| 1     | Alice  | White |            |            |\n| 2     | Carol  | Blue  | Soup       |            |\n| 3     | Bob    | Purple| Stir Fry   | Pall Mall  |\n| 4     | Arnold | Brown | Pizza      | Blue Master|\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\n<<<Alice>>>"
