    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite cigars, drinks, and lunches in each house. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. The boba tea drinker is the person who loves the soup.\n2. The Prince smoker is the one who only drinks water.\n3. Arnold is in the third house.\n4. Carol and the boba tea drinker are next to each other.\n5. The person partial to Pall Mall is the person who likes milk.\n6. The coffee drinker is the person who is a pizza lover.\n7. The person partial to Pall Mall is in the third house.\n8. The coffee drinker is Carol.\n9. The person who smokes Blue Master and the person who loves stir fry are next to each other.\n10. Bob is directly left of Arnold.\n\nLet's start by placing Arnold in the third house, as per clue 3. Since the person who likes Pall Mall is also in the third house (clue 7), Arnold must like Pall Mall and milk (clue 5).\n\nNow, let's place Bob. According to clue 10, Bob is directly left of Arnold, so Bob must be in the second house.\n\nSince Carol is the coffee drinker and pizza lover (clues 6 and 8), and she must be next to the boba tea drinker (clue 4), Carol must be in the fourth house. This means the boba tea drinker is in the first house, and they love soup (clue 1).\n\nNow, let's place the remaining person, Alice, in the first house, as she is the only one left.\n\nLet's summarize what we have so far:\n- House 1: Alice, boba tea, soup\n- House 2: Bob\n- House 3: Arnold, Pall Mall, milk\n- House 4: Carol, coffee, pizza\n\nNow, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the rest:\n- The Prince smoker drinks water (clue 2), so Bob must be the Prince smoker and drink water.\n- The person who smokes Blue Master and the person who loves stir fry are next to each other (clue 9). Since Bob is the Prince smoker, Alice must smoke Blue Master, and Bob must love stir fry.\n\nNow, we have:\n- House 1: Alice, Blue Master, boba tea, soup\n- House 2: Bob, Prince, water, stir fry\n- House 3: Arnold, Pall Mall, milk\n- House 4: Carol, coffee, pizza\n\nFinally, the only remaining cigar for Carol is Dunhill.\n\nLet's confirm:\n- House 1: Alice, Blue Master, boba tea, soup\n- House 2: Bob, Prince, water, stir fry\n- House 3: Arnold, Pall Mall, milk\n- House 4: Carol, Dunhill, coffee, pizza\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\n<<<Alice>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
