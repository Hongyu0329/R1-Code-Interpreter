    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite smoothies, their children, and their favorite cigars in each house. Let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. Alice's child is named Bella.\n2. The Prince smoker is the mother of Timothy.\n3. The Desert smoothie lover is in the first house.\n4. Arnold is in the fourth house.\n5. Bob is in the second house.\n6. The Butterscotch smoothie drinker is the Dunhill smoker.\n7. The Darkness smoothie drinker is the Prince smoker.\n8. Bob is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n9. The mother of Billy is in the fourth house.\n10. The Blue Master smoker is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n\nLet's start by filling in the information we know for sure:\n\n- House 1: Desert smoothie\n- House 2: Bob, Butterscotch smoothie, Dunhill smoker\n- House 4: Arnold, mother of Billy\n\nFrom clue 3, we know the Desert smoothie lover is in the first house. Since Bob is in the second house and Arnold is in the fourth house, Alice must be in the first house because she is the only one left.\n\nNow, let's fill in the rest of the information:\n\n- House 1: Alice, Desert smoothie, child Bella\n- House 2: Bob, Butterscotch smoothie, Dunhill smoker\n- House 4: Arnold, mother of Billy\n\nFrom clue 7, the Darkness smoothie drinker is the Prince smoker, who is also the mother of Timothy (clue 2). Since Bob is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker and Arnold is in the fourth house, Carol must be the Prince smoker and the mother of Timothy. Therefore, Carol is in the third house.\n\nNow, let's fill in the rest of the information:\n\n- House 1: Alice, Desert smoothie, child Bella\n- House 2: Bob, Butterscotch smoothie, Dunhill smoker\n- House 3: Carol, Darkness smoothie, Prince smoker, mother of Timothy\n- House 4: Arnold, mother of Billy\n\nFinally, from clue 10, the Blue Master smoker is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover. Since the only cigar left for Alice is Blue Master, she must be the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information for each house:\n\n- House 1: Alice, Desert smoothie, child Bella, Blue Master smoker\n- House 2: Bob, Butterscotch smoothie, Dunhill smoker\n- House 3: Carol, Darkness smoothie, Prince smoker, mother of Timothy\n- House 4: Arnold, mother of Billy\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\n<<<Alice>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
