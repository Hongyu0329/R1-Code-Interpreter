    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, animals, flowers, and phone models in the four houses. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the details:\n\n1. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the cat lover.\n2. The bird keeper and the dog owner are next to each other.\n3. The person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the second house.\n4. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the person who loves the bouquet of lilies.\n5. The cat lover is Carol.\n6. The person who loves the bouquet of iris is the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n7. The fish enthusiast is the person who loves a carnations arrangement.\n8. The bird keeper is Alice.\n9. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is the dog owner.\n10. Bob is the person who uses a OnePlus 9.\n11. The cat lover is directly left of Alice.\n\nFrom these clues, we can start making deductions:\n\n- From clues 1, 4, and 5, we know Carol uses a Samsung Galaxy S21, loves lilies, and is the cat lover.\n- From clue 11, Carol is directly left of Alice, so Carol must be in house 1 or 2, and Alice must be in house 2 or 3.\n- From clue 3, the person who loves iris is in house 2, and from clue 6, this person uses a Huawei P50.\n- From clue 8, Alice is the bird keeper, so Alice cannot be in house 2 (since house 2 is for the person who loves iris and uses a Huawei P50).\n- Therefore, Alice must be in house 3, and Carol must be in house 2.\n- From clue 9 and 10, Bob uses a OnePlus 9 and is the dog owner.\n- From clue 2, the bird keeper (Alice) and the dog owner (Bob) are next to each other, so Bob must be in house 4.\n- This leaves Arnold for house 1.\n- From clue 7, the fish enthusiast loves carnations, and since Arnold is the only one left without a flower or animal, Arnold must be the fish enthusiast and love carnations.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Fish, Carnations, (unknown phone)\n- House 2: Carol, Cat, Lilies, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 3: Alice, Bird, (unknown flower), (unknown phone)\n- House 4: Bob, Dog, (unknown flower), OnePlus 9\n\nSince the only phone left for Arnold is the Google Pixel 6, and the only flower left for Alice is daffodils, we can complete the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Fish, Carnations, Google Pixel 6\n- House 2: Carol, Cat, Lilies, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 3: Alice, Bird, Daffodils, Huawei P50\n- House 4: Bob, Dog, Iris, OnePlus 9\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\n<<<Arnold>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
