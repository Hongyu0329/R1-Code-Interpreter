    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their lunches, phone models, and favorite flowers in the four houses. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. Alice is the person who is a pizza lover.\n2. The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is directly left of the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n3. The person who loves the soup is in the second house.\n4. Carol and the person who loves a carnations arrangement are next to each other.\n5. The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is directly left of the person who loves stir fry.\n6. The person who is a pizza lover and the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 are next to each other.\n7. Bob is directly left of the person who is a pizza lover.\n8. The person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the third house.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know for sure:\n\n- House 2: Soup (from clue 3)\n- House 3: Iris (from clue 8)\n\nNow, let's use the clues to deduce more information:\n\n- Since Alice is the pizza lover (clue 1), and Bob is directly left of the pizza lover (clue 7), Alice must be in House 2 or 3, and Bob must be in House 1 or 2. However, since House 2 is already occupied by the soup lover, Alice must be in House 3, and Bob must be in House 2.\n\n- Since Alice is in House 3, and the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is next to the pizza lover (clue 6), the Samsung Galaxy S21 user must be in House 2 or 4. But since House 2 is occupied by Bob, the Samsung Galaxy S21 user must be in House 4.\n\n- The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is directly left of the person who uses a Huawei P50 (clue 2). Since House 3 is occupied by Alice, and House 4 is occupied by the Samsung Galaxy S21 user, the Huawei P50 user must be in House 4, and the daffodils lover must be in House 3.\n\n- The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is directly left of the person who loves stir fry (clue 5). Since House 3 is occupied by Alice, and House 4 is occupied by the Huawei P50 user, the Google Pixel 6 user must be in House 2, and the stir fry lover must be in House 3.\n\n- Carol and the person who loves a carnations arrangement are next to each other (clue 4). Since House 3 is occupied by Alice, and House 4 is occupied by the Huawei P50 user, Carol must be in House 1, and the carnations lover must be in House 2.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information we have:\n\n- House 1: Carol\n- House 2: Bob, Soup, Google Pixel 6, Carnations\n- House 3: Alice, Pizza, Stir Fry, Iris\n- House 4: Huawei P50, Samsung Galaxy S21\n\nFinally, let's determine the name of the person who lives in House 1. Since we have already deduced that Carol lives in House 1, the answer is:\n\n<<<Carol>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
