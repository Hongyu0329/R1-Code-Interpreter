    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their lunches, cigars, and favorite flowers in the four houses. Let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. The person who loves stir fry is in the first house.\n2. The person who loves a carnations arrangement is the Dunhill smoker.\n3. The person who is a pizza lover is Carol.\n4. The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is the person who loves the soup.\n5. Bob is the person who smokes Blue Master.\n6. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n7. Arnold is the Prince smoker.\n8. The person who smokes Blue Master is directly left of Carol.\n9. The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is in the second house.\n10. The person who loves the soup is directly left of the person who is a pizza lover.\n11. The Dunhill smoker is in the fourth house.\n\nLet's start by organizing the information:\n\n- House 1: Stir fry\n- House 2: Daffodils, Soup\n- House 3: Carol, Pizza\n- House 4: Dunhill, Carnations\n\nFrom clue 8, Bob (Blue Master) is directly left of Carol, so Bob must be in House 2. This means:\n- House 2: Bob, Blue Master, Daffodils, Soup\n\nFrom clue 10, the person who loves soup is directly left of the pizza lover (Carol), which is consistent with Bob being in House 2 and Carol in House 3.\n\nFrom clue 7, Arnold is the Prince smoker. Since Bob is in House 2 and Carol is in House 3, Arnold must be in House 1 or House 4. However, House 4 is already occupied by the Dunhill smoker, so Arnold must be in House 1.\n\nNow we have:\n- House 1: Arnold, Prince, Stir fry\n- House 2: Bob, Blue Master, Daffodils, Soup\n- House 3: Carol, Pizza\n- House 4: Dunhill, Carnations\n\nFinally, from clue 6, the person who loves lilies is the Pall Mall smoker. Since House 1, 2, and 4 are already filled with other cigars, the Pall Mall smoker must be in House 3. Therefore, the person in House 3 loves lilies.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information:\n- House 1: Arnold, Prince, Stir fry\n- House 2: Bob, Blue Master, Daffodils, Soup\n- House 3: Carol, Pizza, Pall Mall, Lilies\n- House 4: Dunhill, Carnations\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\n<<<arnold>>>"
