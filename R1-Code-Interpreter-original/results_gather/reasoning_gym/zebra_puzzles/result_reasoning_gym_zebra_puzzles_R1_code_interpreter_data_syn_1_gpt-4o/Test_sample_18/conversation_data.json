    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to deduce the correct arrangement of people, their children, favorite flowers, and favorite colors in the four houses based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. **Arnold is the person's child is named Bella.**\n   - Arnold's child is Bella.\n\n2. **The person who loves purple is the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.**\n   - Purple and daffodils go together.\n\n3. **Bob is the person who loves a carnations arrangement.**\n   - Bob loves carnations.\n\n4. **Carol is directly left of the person who loves white.**\n   - Carol is in a house immediately to the left of the person who loves white.\n\n5. **Arnold is in the first house.**\n   - Arnold is in House 1.\n\n6. **The person who loves white is in the third house.**\n   - White is in House 3.\n\n7. **The person who loves white is the person who is the mother of Billy.**\n   - The person in House 3 is Billy's mother.\n\n8. **The person who loves brown is in the second house.**\n   - Brown is in House 2.\n\n9. **The person who loves purple and the person's child is named Alice are next to each other.**\n   - Purple and Alice's mother are in adjacent houses.\n\n10. **The person who loves blue is the person who loves the bouquet of iris.**\n    - Blue and iris go together.\n\nNow, let's use these clues to deduce the arrangement:\n\n- From clue 5, Arnold is in House 1, and from clue 1, Arnold's child is Bella.\n- From clue 6, the person who loves white is in House 3, and from clue 7, this person is Billy's mother.\n- From clue 4, Carol is directly left of the person who loves white, so Carol is in House 2.\n- From clue 8, the person who loves brown is in House 2, which is Carol.\n- From clue 3, Bob loves carnations. Since House 3 is already occupied by Billy's mother, Bob must be in House 4.\n- From clue 9, the person who loves purple and Alice's mother are next to each other. Since House 3 is occupied by Billy's mother, Alice's mother must be in House 4, and the person who loves purple must be in House 2.\n- From clue 2, the person who loves purple also loves daffodils, so Carol loves daffodils.\n- From clue 10, the person who loves blue also loves iris. Since House 4 is occupied by Alice's mother, who is not Bob, the person who loves blue and iris must be in House 1.\n\nLet's summarize the information we have:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Bella, Blue, Iris\n- House 2: Carol, ?, Purple, Daffodils\n- House 3: ?, Billy, White, ?\n- House 4: Bob, Alice, ?, Carnations\n\nNow, let's determine the name of the person in House 1. Since Arnold is in House 1, the name of the person in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is:\n\n<<<Arnold>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
