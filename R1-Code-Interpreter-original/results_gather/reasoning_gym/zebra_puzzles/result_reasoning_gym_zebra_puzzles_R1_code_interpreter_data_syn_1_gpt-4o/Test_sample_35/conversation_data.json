    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite colors, cigars, and their children based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and use logical reasoning to determine the correct arrangement.\n\n1. The person who loves purple is the Dunhill smoker.\n2. Carol's child is named Bella.\n3. The person who loves white is in the first house.\n4. Bob loves blue.\n5. Alice loves brown.\n6. The person who is the mother of Timothy loves brown.\n7. The person who smokes Blue Master is in the fourth house.\n8. The person who loves blue is the mother of Billy.\n9. The mother of Billy and the Blue Master smoker are next to each other.\n10. Carol is directly left of the Prince smoker.\n\nLet's start by organizing the information:\n\n- House 1: White\n- House 4: Blue Master smoker\n- Bob loves blue and is the mother of Billy.\n- Alice loves brown and is the mother of Timothy.\n- Carol's child is Bella.\n- The person who loves purple smokes Dunhill.\n- Carol is directly left of the Prince smoker.\n\nNow, let's try to deduce the arrangement:\n\n1. Since Alice loves brown and is the mother of Timothy, she cannot be in House 1 (white) or House 4 (Blue Master smoker). She must be in House 2 or 3.\n2. Bob loves blue and is the mother of Billy, so Bob cannot be in House 1 (white) or House 4 (Blue Master smoker). Bob must be in House 2 or 3.\n3. Since the person who loves purple smokes Dunhill, and Carol is directly left of the Prince smoker, we need to place Carol and the Prince smoker accordingly.\n\nLet's try to place these people in the houses:\n\n- House 1: White\n- House 2: Alice (brown, Timothy)\n- House 3: Bob (blue, Billy)\n- House 4: Blue Master smoker\n\nNow, let's check the remaining conditions:\n\n- The person who loves purple smokes Dunhill. This person must be in House 2 or 3.\n- Carol is directly left of the Prince smoker. This means Carol must be in House 3, and the Prince smoker in House 4.\n\nLet's finalize the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: White, ???, ???\n- House 2: Alice (brown, Timothy), ???\n- House 3: Bob (blue, Billy), Carol\n- House 4: Blue Master smoker, Prince smoker\n\nNow, let's determine the name of the person in House 1. Since Alice is in House 2 and Bob is in House 3, the only remaining person is Arnold.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\n<<<Arnold>>>"
