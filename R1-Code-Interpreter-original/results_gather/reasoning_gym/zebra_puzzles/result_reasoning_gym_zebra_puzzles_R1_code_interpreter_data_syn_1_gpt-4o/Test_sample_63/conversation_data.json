    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to determine the arrangement of people, cigars, flowers, and phone models in the four houses. Let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step:\n\n1. **Arnold is the person who smokes Blue Master.**\n   - Arnold -> Blue Master\n\n2. **Alice is directly left of the Dunhill smoker.**\n   - Alice is in House 2, Dunhill smoker is in House 3.\n\n3. **Arnold is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.**\n   - Arnold -> Google Pixel 6\n\n4. **The person who loves a carnations arrangement is Arnold.**\n   - Arnold -> Carnations\n\n5. **The person who loves the bouquet of iris is directly left of Carol.**\n   - Iris is in House 3, Carol is in House 4.\n\n6. **The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.**\n   - OnePlus 9 -> Daffodils\n\n7. **The person partial to Pall Mall is the person who uses a Huawei P50.**\n   - Pall Mall -> Huawei P50\n\n8. **The person partial to Pall Mall is in the first house.**\n   - House 1 -> Pall Mall, Huawei P50\n\n9. **The Dunhill smoker is in the third house.**\n   - House 3 -> Dunhill\n\nFrom the above clues, we can deduce the following:\n\n- House 1: Pall Mall, Huawei P50\n- House 2: Alice\n- House 3: Dunhill, Iris\n- House 4: Carol\n\nNow, let's use the information to determine the name of the person in House 1. We know that Arnold is not in House 1 because he smokes Blue Master and uses a Google Pixel 6. Alice is in House 2, and Carol is in House 4. Therefore, the person in House 1 must be Bob.\n\nLet's confirm this by checking the remaining clues:\n\n- Bob is in House 1, smokes Pall Mall, and uses a Huawei P50.\n- Alice is in House 2, directly left of the Dunhill smoker in House 3.\n- Arnold is in House 3, smokes Blue Master, uses a Google Pixel 6, and loves carnations.\n- Carol is in House 4, directly right of the person who loves iris in House 3.\n\nEverything checks out, so the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\n<<<bob>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
