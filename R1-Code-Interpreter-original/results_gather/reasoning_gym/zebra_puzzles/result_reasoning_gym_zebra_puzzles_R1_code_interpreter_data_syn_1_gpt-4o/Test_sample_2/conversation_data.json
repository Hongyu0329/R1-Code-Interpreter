    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their pets, cigars, and smoothies in the four houses. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. The Desert smoothie lover is the bird keeper.\n2. The bird keeper is Arnold.\n3. The Dunhill smoker is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n4. The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in the first house.\n5. Bob is the Prince smoker.\n6. The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n7. The Desert smoothie lover and Carol are next to each other.\n8. The cat lover is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n9. The Butterscotch smoothie drinker and the Desert smoothie lover are next to each other.\n10. Alice and the dog owner are next to each other.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know for sure:\n\n- From clue 4, the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in the first house.\n- From clue 3, the Dunhill smoker is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover, so the Dunhill smoker is in the first house.\n- From clue 2, Arnold is the bird keeper, and from clue 1, the Desert smoothie lover is the bird keeper. Therefore, Arnold is the Desert smoothie lover.\n- From clue 6, the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker, so the Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in the second house.\n- From clue 9, the Butterscotch smoothie drinker and the Desert smoothie lover are next to each other, so Arnold (Desert smoothie lover) must be in the third house.\n- From clue 7, the Desert smoothie lover and Carol are next to each other, so Carol must be in the second or fourth house. Since the Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in the second house, Carol must be in the fourth house.\n- From clue 5, Bob is the Prince smoker. Since the first house is occupied by the Dunhill smoker and the second house is occupied by the Butterscotch smoothie drinker, Bob must be in the third or fourth house. Since Arnold is in the third house, Bob must be in the fourth house.\n- From clue 10, Alice and the dog owner are next to each other. Since the first house is occupied by the Dragonfruit smoothie lover and the second house is occupied by the Butterscotch smoothie drinker, Alice must be in the second house, and the dog owner must be in the third house.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information we have:\n\n- House 1: Dragonfruit smoothie lover, Dunhill smoker\n- House 2: Butterscotch smoothie drinker, Alice\n- House 3: Arnold, Desert smoothie lover, bird keeper, dog owner\n- House 4: Bob, Prince smoker, Carol\n\nNow, let's determine the name of the person who lives in House 1. Since Alice is in House 2, Arnold is in House 3, and Bob is in House 4, the only person left for House 1 is Carol.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\n<<<Carol>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
