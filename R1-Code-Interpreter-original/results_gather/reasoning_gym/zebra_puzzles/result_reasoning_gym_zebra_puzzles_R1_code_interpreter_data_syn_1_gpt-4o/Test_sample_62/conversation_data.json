    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite cigars, phone models, and colors in each house. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. The person who loves brown is in the second house.\n2. The person who loves purple is directly left of the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n3. Alice is directly left of Bob.\n4. Bob and the person who loves blue are next to each other.\n5. Carol is the person who loves blue.\n6. Carol is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.\n7. The person who loves purple is the Prince smoker.\n8. The person who uses a Huawei P50 is Alice.\n9. The person who smokes Blue Master is Bob.\n10. The Dunhill smoker is the person who loves white.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know for sure:\n\n- House 2: Loves brown (from clue 1).\n- Carol loves blue and uses a Google Pixel 6 (from clues 5 and 6).\n- Alice uses a Huawei P50 (from clue 8).\n- Bob smokes Blue Master (from clue 9).\n\nNow, let's use the clues to deduce the positions:\n\n- From clue 3, Alice is directly left of Bob. This means Alice is in House 1 and Bob is in House 2 or Alice is in House 2 and Bob is in House 3.\n- From clue 4, Bob and the person who loves blue (Carol) are next to each other. This means Bob is in House 2 and Carol is in House 3.\n- From clue 8, Alice uses a Huawei P50, so Alice is in House 1.\n- From clue 9, Bob smokes Blue Master, so Bob is in House 2.\n- From clue 5 and 6, Carol loves blue and uses a Google Pixel 6, so Carol is in House 3.\n- From clue 10, the Dunhill smoker loves white. Since House 2 loves brown and House 3 loves blue, the Dunhill smoker must be in House 4.\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining information:\n\n- From clue 2, the person who loves purple is directly left of the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21. Since House 3 loves blue, House 4 must love white, and House 2 loves brown, the person who loves purple must be in House 1.\n- From clue 7, the person who loves purple is the Prince smoker, so the person in House 1 smokes Prince.\n- The only remaining cigar is Pall Mall, which must be in House 4.\n- The only remaining phone model is Samsung Galaxy S21, which must be in House 4.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information:\n\n- House 1: Alice, Prince, Huawei P50, Purple\n- House 2: Bob, Blue Master, ?, Brown\n- House 3: Carol, ?, Google Pixel 6, Blue\n- House 4: Arnold, Pall Mall, Samsung Galaxy S21, White\n\nThe person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\n<<<Alice>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
