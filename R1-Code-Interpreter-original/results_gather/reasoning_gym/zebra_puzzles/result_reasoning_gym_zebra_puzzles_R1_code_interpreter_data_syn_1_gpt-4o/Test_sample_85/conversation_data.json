    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite cigars, colors, and phone models in each house. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. Alice smokes Blue Master.\n2. The person who loves blue is in the fourth house.\n3. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is partial to Pall Mall.\n4. Arnold smokes Prince.\n5. The person who loves purple is in the second house.\n6. The person who loves white is in the first house.\n7. The Prince smoker is in the fourth house.\n8. The person who loves purple uses a Huawei P50.\n9. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 and Bob are next to each other.\n10. The person partial to Pall Mall and the person who uses a Google Pixel 6 are next to each other.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know for sure:\n\n- House 4: Loves blue, smokes Prince (Arnold), and therefore uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 (since the person who uses OnePlus 9 smokes Pall Mall, and the person who uses Google Pixel 6 is next to the Pall Mall smoker).\n\n- House 2: Loves purple, uses Huawei P50.\n\n- House 1: Loves white.\n\nNow, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:\n\n- Since Arnold is in House 4, Alice (who smokes Blue Master) must be in either House 1, 2, or 3. But since House 2 loves purple and uses Huawei P50, Alice must be in House 1 or 3.\n\n- The person who uses a OnePlus 9 smokes Pall Mall. Since House 4 is already filled, this person must be in House 1, 2, or 3.\n\n- The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 and Bob are next to each other. Since House 4 uses a Samsung Galaxy S21, Bob must be in House 3.\n\n- The person partial to Pall Mall and the person who uses a Google Pixel 6 are next to each other. Since House 4 is already filled, and House 3 is Bob, the Pall Mall smoker must be in House 3, and the Google Pixel 6 user must be in House 2.\n\n- Since House 2 uses a Huawei P50, the Google Pixel 6 user must be in House 1.\n\n- Therefore, the person in House 1 loves white, uses a Google Pixel 6, and smokes Blue Master (Alice).\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n\n- House 1: Alice, Blue Master, White, Google Pixel 6\n- House 2: Loves purple, Huawei P50\n- House 3: Bob, Pall Mall, OnePlus 9\n- House 4: Arnold, Prince, Blue, Samsung Galaxy S21\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\n<<<Alice>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
