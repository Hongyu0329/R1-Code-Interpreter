Since House 4 is the only house left for carnations, House 3 must be the one with iris.\n  - House 3: Carol, Butterscotch, ?, Iris, ?\n\n- The person who loves the bouquet of iris also loves soup (Clue 9). Therefore, Carol loves soup.\n  - House 3: Carol, Butterscotch, Soup, Iris, ?\n\n- The only lunch left for Bob is pizza.\n  - House 1: Bob, Dragonfruit, Pizza, ?, ?\n\n- The only flower left for Bob is lilies.\n  - House 1: Bob, Dragonfruit, Pizza, Lilies, ?\n\n- The only person left for House 4 is Alice.\n  - House 4: Alice, Darkness, Grilled cheese, Daffodils, Carnations\n\nNow, let's summarize the information:\n\n- House 1: Bob, Dragonfruit, Pizza, Lilies\n- House 2: Arnold, ?, Stir fry, ?, ?\n- House 3: Carol, Butterscotch, Soup, Iris\n- House 4: Alice, Darkness, Grilled cheese, Daffodils, Carnations\n\nThe only name left for House 2 is Arnold, and the only smoothie left for him is Desert.\n\n- House 2: Arnold, Desert, Stir fry, ?, ?\n\nNow, we have all the information:\n\n- House 1: Bob, Dragonfruit, Pizza, Lilies\n- House 2: Arnold, Desert, Stir fry, ?, ?\n- House 3: Carol, Butterscotch, Soup, Iris\n- House 4: Alice, Darkness, Grilled cheese, Daffodils, Carnations\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\n<<<Bob>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
