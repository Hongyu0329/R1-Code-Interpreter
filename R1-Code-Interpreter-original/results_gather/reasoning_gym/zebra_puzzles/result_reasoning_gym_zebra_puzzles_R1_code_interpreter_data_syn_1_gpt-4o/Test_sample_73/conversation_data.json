    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite drinks, flowers, and phone models in each house. Let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step:\n\n1. Bob is the one who only drinks water.\n2. Carol is the boba tea drinker.\n3. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is directly left of the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.\n4. The boba tea drinker is in the third house.\n5. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is in the fourth house.\n6. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is in the first house.\n7. Arnold is the person who loves a carnations arrangement.\n8. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies and Alice are next to each other.\n9. The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is the person who likes milk.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know for sure:\n\n- House 3: Carol (boba tea)\n- House 4: OnePlus 9\n- House 1: Lilies\n\nNow, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:\n\n- Since Carol is in House 3, and she drinks boba tea, House 3 is confirmed for Carol.\n- The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is in House 4.\n- The person who loves lilies is in House 1.\n- Alice must be in House 2 because she is next to the person who loves lilies (House 1).\n- Bob drinks water, so he cannot be in House 3 (Carol) or House 4 (OnePlus 9). Therefore, Bob must be in House 2.\n- Since Bob is in House 2, Alice must be in House 1.\n- The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is directly left of the person who loves daffodils. Since House 4 is OnePlus 9, House 3 must be daffodils, and House 2 must be Samsung Galaxy S21.\n- Arnold loves carnations, so he cannot be in House 1 (lilies) or House 3 (daffodils). Therefore, Arnold must be in House 4.\n- The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 likes milk. Since House 2 is Samsung Galaxy S21, House 1 must be Google Pixel 6.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information:\n\n- House 1: Alice, lilies, Google Pixel 6, milk\n- House 2: Bob, Samsung Galaxy S21, water\n- House 3: Carol, boba tea, daffodils\n- House 4: Arnold, OnePlus 9, carnations\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\n<<<Alice>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
