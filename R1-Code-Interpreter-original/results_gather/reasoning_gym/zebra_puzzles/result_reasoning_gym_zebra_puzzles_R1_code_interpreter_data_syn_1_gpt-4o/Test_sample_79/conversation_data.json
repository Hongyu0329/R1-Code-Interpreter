    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite cigars, colors, and animals in each house. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. The Prince smoker is in the fourth house.\n2. The person who smokes Blue Master is in the first house.\n3. The dog owner is directly left of the person partial to Pall Mall.\n4. The person who loves brown is the cat lover.\n5. The cat lover is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n6. The dog owner is the person who loves blue.\n7. Bob is directly left of Carol.\n8. The person who loves white is Arnold.\n9. The bird keeper is Carol.\n10. The Prince smoker is Carol.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know for sure:\n\n- House 4: Prince smoker (Carol) - Clue 1 and 10\n- House 1: Blue Master smoker - Clue 2\n\nFrom Clue 10, we know Carol is in House 4 and smokes Prince. From Clue 9, Carol is the bird keeper.\n\nFrom Clue 8, Arnold loves white. Since Carol is in House 4, Arnold cannot be in House 4. \n\nFrom Clue 7, Bob is directly left of Carol, so Bob must be in House 3.\n\nFrom Clue 3, the dog owner is directly left of the person partial to Pall Mall. Since Bob is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 2, and the person partial to Pall Mall must be in House 3.\n\nFrom Clue 5, the cat lover is the person partial to Pall Mall, so the cat lover is in House 3.\n\nFrom Clue 6, the dog owner loves blue, so the person in House 2 loves blue.\n\nNow, let's summarize what we have:\n\n- House 1: Blue Master smoker\n- House 2: Dog owner, loves blue\n- House 3: Bob, Pall Mall smoker, cat lover\n- House 4: Carol, Prince smoker, bird keeper\n\nArnold loves white, and since House 4 is Carol's, Arnold must be in House 2 or House 1. Since House 2 loves blue, Arnold must be in House 1.\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining information:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Blue Master smoker, loves white\n- House 2: Dog owner, loves blue\n- House 3: Bob, Pall Mall smoker, cat lover\n- House 4: Carol, Prince smoker, bird keeper\n\nSince Bob is in House 3, and Carol is in House 4, the only person left for House 2 is Alice.\n\nNow, let's finalize the information:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Blue Master smoker, loves white\n- House 2: Alice, Dog owner, loves blue\n- House 3: Bob, Pall Mall smoker, cat lover\n- House 4: Carol, Prince smoker, bird keeper\n\nThe person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\n<<<Arnold>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
