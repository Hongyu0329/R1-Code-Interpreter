    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their nationalities, drinks, and smoothie preferences in the four houses. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. **Alice is directly left of Carol.**\n   - This means Alice is in House 1 or 2, and Carol is in House 2 or 3.\n\n2. **The boba tea drinker is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.**\n   - This links the drink and smoothie preference.\n\n3. **The boba tea drinker is the German.**\n   - This links the drink, smoothie preference, and nationality.\n\n4. **The Darkness smoothie drinker is the Dane.**\n   - This links the smoothie preference and nationality.\n\n5. **Alice is the British person.**\n   - This gives us Alice's nationality.\n\n6. **The person who likes milk is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.**\n   - This links the drink and smoothie preference.\n\n7. **The Darkness smoothie drinker is in the second house.**\n   - This places the Dane in House 2.\n\n8. **Bob is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.**\n   - This links Bob to the boba tea drinker and the German.\n\n9. **The one who only drinks water is directly left of the Desert smoothie lover.**\n   - This gives us a relative position for these two people.\n\n10. **Carol is the Darkness smoothie drinker.**\n    - This places Carol in House 2, as the Darkness smoothie drinker is in House 2.\n\nFrom these clues, we can start filling in the information:\n\n- House 2: Carol, Dane, Darkness smoothie\n- Alice is directly left of Carol, so Alice is in House 1.\n- Alice is British, so House 1: Alice, British\n- Bob is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker, boba tea drinker, and German. Since Carol is in House 2, Bob must be in House 3 or 4.\n- The one who drinks water is directly left of the Desert smoothie lover. Since Alice is in House 1, she must drink water, and the Desert smoothie lover must be in House 2 or 3.\n- Since Bob is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker and the boba tea drinker, he must be in House 3.\n- The person who likes milk is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover. Since Bob is in House 3, the milk drinker must be in House 4.\n\nLet's summarize the information:\n\n- House 1: Alice, British, Water\n- House 2: Carol, Dane, Darkness smoothie\n- House 3: Bob, German, Boba tea, Butterscotch smoothie\n- House 4: (unknown name), (unknown nationality), Milk, Dragonfruit smoothie\n\nNow, we need to determine the name of the person in House 1. Since Alice is in House 1, the answer is:\n\n<<<Alice>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
