    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their nationalities, phone models, and favorite cigars in the four houses. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. The Dunhill smoker is in the fourth house.\n2. The Chinese is Arnold.\n3. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the Dunhill smoker.\n4. The Dane is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.\n5. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is directly left of the British person.\n6. The German is the person who smokes Blue Master.\n7. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is Alice.\n8. Arnold and the person who uses a OnePlus 9 are next to each other.\n9. Arnold is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n10. The Dane is Bob.\n\nLet's start by organizing the information we have:\n\n- House 4: Dunhill smoker, Samsung Galaxy S21 user.\n- Arnold is Chinese and smokes Pall Mall.\n- Bob is the Dane and uses a Google Pixel 6.\n- Alice uses a OnePlus 9.\n- The German smokes Blue Master.\n- The OnePlus 9 user (Alice) is directly left of the British person.\n- Arnold and Alice are next to each other.\n\nNow, let's try to deduce the arrangement:\n\n1. Since the Dunhill smoker is in House 4, and they use a Samsung Galaxy S21, we know:\n   - House 4: Dunhill, Samsung Galaxy S21\n\n2. Arnold is Chinese and smokes Pall Mall. Since Arnold and Alice are next to each other, and Alice uses a OnePlus 9, we can place them in Houses 2 and 3:\n   - House 2: Arnold, Chinese, Pall Mall\n   - House 3: Alice, OnePlus 9\n\n3. Alice is directly left of the British person, so the British person must be in House 4:\n   - House 4: British, Dunhill, Samsung Galaxy S21\n\n4. Bob is the Dane and uses a Google Pixel 6. Since Houses 2 and 3 are occupied by Arnold and Alice, Bob must be in House 1:\n   - House 1: Bob, Dane, Google Pixel 6\n\n5. The German smokes Blue Master. Since House 4 is occupied by the British person, the German must be in House 3:\n   - House 3: Alice, German, OnePlus 9, Blue Master\n\nNow, let's verify the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Bob, Dane, Google Pixel 6\n- House 2: Arnold, Chinese, Pall Mall\n- House 3: Alice, German, OnePlus 9, Blue Master\n- House 4: British, Dunhill, Samsung Galaxy S21\n\nEverything matches the clues. Therefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\n<<<Bob>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
