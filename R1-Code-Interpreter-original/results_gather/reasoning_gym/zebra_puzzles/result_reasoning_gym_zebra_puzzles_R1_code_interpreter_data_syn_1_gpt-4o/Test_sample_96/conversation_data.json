    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, cigars, animals, and phone models in the four houses. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. Bob is the Prince smoker.\n2. Alice and the Dunhill smoker are next to each other.\n3. Bob is directly left of the bird keeper.\n4. Alice is in the second house.\n5. The dog owner is Arnold.\n6. The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is the Dunhill smoker.\n7. Alice is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.\n8. The Dunhill smoker is the fish enthusiast.\n9. The person who uses a Huawei P50 is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n\nLet's start by placing Alice in the second house, as per clue 4. We know Alice uses a Google Pixel 6 (clue 7).\n\nNow, let's consider Bob. Since Bob is the Prince smoker (clue 1) and is directly left of the bird keeper (clue 3), Bob cannot be in the fourth house. Therefore, Bob must be in the first or third house.\n\nSince Alice is in the second house, and the Dunhill smoker is next to Alice (clue 2), the Dunhill smoker must be in either the first or third house. The Dunhill smoker uses a OnePlus 9 (clue 6) and is the fish enthusiast (clue 8).\n\nArnold, the dog owner (clue 5), must be in a different house than the Dunhill smoker. Since Bob is the Prince smoker, Arnold cannot be Bob. Therefore, Arnold must be in the fourth house, leaving the third house for the Dunhill smoker.\n\nNow, let's place Bob. Since Bob is directly left of the bird keeper (clue 3), Bob must be in the first house, and the bird keeper must be in the second house.\n\nFinally, the person who uses a Huawei P50 is the Pall Mall smoker (clue 9). Since the Dunhill smoker is in the third house, the Pall Mall smoker must be in the fourth house.\n\nLet's summarize the information:\n\n- House 1: Bob, Prince smoker\n- House 2: Alice, Google Pixel 6, bird keeper\n- House 3: Dunhill smoker, OnePlus 9, fish enthusiast\n- House 4: Arnold, dog owner, Pall Mall smoker, Huawei P50\n\nNow, let's determine the name of the person in House 1. Since Bob is in House 1, the answer is:\n\n<<<bob>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
