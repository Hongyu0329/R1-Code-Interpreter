    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to determine the arrangement of people, their favorite flowers, colors, and lunches in the four houses. Let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. **Clue 6**: The person who loves brown is in the third house.\n2. **Clue 4**: The person who loves blue is Arnold.\n3. **Clue 9**: Arnold is the person who loves the bouquet of lilies.\n4. **Clue 10**: The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is directly left of Arnold.\n\nFrom clues 4, 9, and 10, we can deduce:\n- Arnold loves blue and lilies.\n- Arnold must be in house 2 or 4 because the person who loves daffodils is directly left of him.\n\n5. **Clue 8**: The person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the first house.\n6. **Clue 5**: The person who loves the bouquet of iris is the person who loves purple.\n\nFrom clues 8 and 5, we know:\n- The person in house 1 loves iris and purple.\n\n7. **Clue 2**: Alice and the person who loves brown are next to each other.\n8. **Clue 7**: The person who loves the soup is Alice.\n\nFrom clues 6, 2, and 7, we can deduce:\n- The person who loves brown is in house 3.\n- Alice must be in house 2 or 4 because she is next to the person who loves brown.\n\n9. **Clue 3**: The person who loves stir fry is Carol.\n\nNow, let's try to place Arnold and Alice:\n- If Arnold is in house 2, then the person who loves daffodils is in house 1, which contradicts clue 8. So Arnold must be in house 4.\n- Therefore, the person who loves daffodils is in house 3, and Alice must be in house 2.\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n- House 1: Loves iris and purple.\n- House 2: Alice, loves soup.\n- House 3: Loves brown and daffodils.\n- House 4: Arnold, loves blue and lilies.\n\nSince Carol loves stir fry, and Alice is in house 2, Carol must be in house 1. This means:\n- House 1: Carol, loves iris, purple, and stir fry.\n\nFinally, let's check the remaining options for Bob:\n- Bob must be in house 3, loving brown and daffodils.\n\nNow, we have:\n- House 1: Carol, iris, purple, stir fry.\n- House 2: Alice, soup.\n- House 3: Bob, brown, daffodils.\n- House 4: Arnold, blue, lilies.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\n<<<Carol>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
