    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite flowers, their children, and their favorite colors in the four houses.\n\nLet's summarize the clues:\n\n1. The person who loves purple has a child named Alice.\n2. Carol loves lilies.\n3. The person who loves carnations is in the second house.\n4. The person who loves iris has a child named Bella.\n5. Arnold is in the fourth house.\n6. Bob loves blue.\n7. Arnold loves iris.\n8. Carol loves white.\n9. The person who loves white is directly left of the person who is the mother of Billy.\n\nNow, let's use these clues to deduce the arrangement:\n\n- From clue 5, Arnold is in the fourth house.\n- From clue 7, Arnold loves iris.\n- From clue 4, Arnold's child is Bella.\n- From clue 2, Carol loves lilies.\n- From clue 8, Carol loves white.\n- From clue 9, Carol is directly left of the person who is the mother of Billy. This means Carol cannot be in the fourth house, so she must be in the third house.\n- From clue 3, the person who loves carnations is in the second house.\n- From clue 6, Bob loves blue. Bob cannot be in the second house (carnations) or the third house (Carol, white), so Bob must be in the first house.\n- From clue 1, the person who loves purple has a child named Alice. Since Bob is in the first house and loves blue, the person who loves purple must be in the second house.\n- The only person left for the second house is Alice, who loves purple and has a child named Alice.\n- The only person left for the third house is Carol, who loves white and has a child named Timothy.\n- The only person left for the first house is Bob, who loves blue and has a child named Billy.\n\nNow, let's summarize the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Bob, blue, Billy\n- House 2: Alice, purple, Alice\n- House 3: Carol, white, Timothy\n- House 4: Arnold, iris, Bella\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\n<<<Bob>>>"
