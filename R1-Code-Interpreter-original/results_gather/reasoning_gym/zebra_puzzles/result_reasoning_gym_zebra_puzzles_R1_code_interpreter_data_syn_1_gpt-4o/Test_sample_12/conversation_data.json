    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to determine the arrangement of people, their favorite cigars, lunches, and colors in the four houses. Let's break down the clues and use them to deduce the correct arrangement.\n\n1. The person who loves white is the person who loves stir fry.\n2. The person who loves brown is directly left of the Prince smoker.\n3. The person who is a pizza lover and Arnold are next to each other.\n4. The person partial to Pall Mall is the person who loves white.\n5. Alice is the person who loves the soup.\n6. The person partial to Pall Mall is directly left of the person who loves the soup.\n7. The person who smokes Blue Master is directly left of the Dunhill smoker.\n8. The Dunhill smoker is Bob.\n9. The person who loves the soup is the person who loves blue.\n\nLet's start by organizing the information:\n\n- We know from clue 8 that Bob smokes Dunhill. From clue 7, the Blue Master smoker is directly left of Bob.\n- From clue 5, Alice loves soup. From clue 9, Alice also loves blue.\n- From clue 6, the Pall Mall smoker is directly left of Alice.\n- From clue 4, the Pall Mall smoker loves white, and from clue 1, they also love stir fry.\n- From clue 2, the person who loves brown is directly left of the Prince smoker.\n- From clue 3, Arnold and the pizza lover are next to each other.\n\nLet's use this information to deduce the arrangement:\n\n1. Since Alice loves blue and soup, and the Pall Mall smoker is directly left of her, Alice cannot be in house 1. She must be in house 3 or 4.\n2. If Alice is in house 3, then the Pall Mall smoker is in house 2, and Bob (Dunhill) must be in house 4. This leaves house 1 for the Blue Master smoker.\n3. If Alice is in house 4, then the Pall Mall smoker is in house 3, and Bob (Dunhill) must be in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the Blue Master smoker.\n\nLet's test these possibilities with code to find the correct arrangement.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define the possible attributes\nnames = ['alice', 'arnold', 'bob', 'carol']\ncigars = ['pall mall', 'dunhill', 'blue master', 'prince']\nlunches = ['stir fry', 'grilled cheese', 'soup', 'pizza']\ncolors = ['blue', 'purple', 'brown', 'white']\n\n# Define the constraints\ndef is_valid(arrangement):\n    # Unpack the arrangement\n    (name1, name2, name3, name4) = arrangement['names']\n    (cigar1, cigar2, cigar3, cigar4) = arrangement['cigars']\n    (lunch1, lunch2, lunch3, lunch4) = arrangement['lunches']\n    (color1, color2, color3, color4) = arrangement['colors']\n    \n    # Apply the constraints\n    if name1 == 'bob' and cigar1 != 'dunhill':\n        return False\n    if name2 == 'bob' and cigar2 != 'dunhill':\n        return False\n    if name3 == 'bob' and cigar3 != 'dunhill':\n        return False\n    if name4 == 'bob' and cigar4 != 'dunhill':\n        return False\n    \n    if name1 == 'alice' and lunch1 != 'soup':\n        return False\n    if name2 == 'alice' and lunch2 != 'soup':\n        return False\n    if name3 == 'alice' and lunch3 != 'soup':\n        return False\n    if name4 == 'alice' and lunch4 != 'soup':\n        return False\n    \n    if name1 == 'alice' and color1 != 'blue':\n        return False\n    if name2 == 'alice' and color2 != 'blue':\n        return False\n    if name3 == 'alice' and color3 != 'blue':\n        return False\n    if name4 == 'alice' and color4 != 'blue':\n        return False\n    \n    if cigar1 == 'pall mall' and color1 != 'white':\n        return False\n    if cigar2 == 'pall mall' and color2 != 'white':\n        return False\n    if cigar3 == 'pall mall' and color3 != 'white':\n        return False\n    if cigar4 == 'pall mall' and color4 != 'white':\n        return False\n    \n    if cigar1 == 'pall mall' and lunch1 != 'stir fry':\n        return False\n    if cigar2 == 'pall mall' and lunch2 != 'stir fry':\n        return False\n    if cigar3 == 'pall mall' and lunch3 != 'stir fry':\n        return False\n    if cigar4 == 'pall mall' and lunch4 != 'stir fry':\n        return False\n    \n    if color1 == 'brown' and cigar2 != 'prince':\n        return False\n    if color2 == 'brown' and cigar3 != 'prince':\n        return False\n    if color3 == 'brown' and cigar4 != 'prince':\n        return False\n    \n    if lunch1 == 'pizza' and name2 != 'arnold' and name1 != 'arnold':\n        return False\n    if lunch2 == 'pizza' and name3 != 'arnold' and name2 != 'arnold':\n        return False\n    if lunch3 == 'pizza' and name4 != 'arnold' and name3 != 'arnold':\n        return False\n    \n    if cigar1 == 'blue master' and cigar2 != 'dunhill':\n        return False\n    if cigar2 == 'blue master' and cigar3 != 'dunhill':\n        return False\n    if cigar3 == 'blue master' and cigar4 != 'dunhill':\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Generate all possible arrangements\nfor name_perm in permutations(names):\n    for cigar_perm in permutations(cigars):\n        for lunch_perm in permutations(lunches):\n            for color_perm in permutations(colors):\n                arrangement = {\n                    'names': name_perm,\n                    'cigars': cigar_perm,\n                    'lunches': lunch_perm,\n                    'colors': color_perm\n                }\n                if is_valid(arrangement):\n                    print(arrangement)\n                    break\n```\n\nThe code will find the valid arrangement based on the constraints.
