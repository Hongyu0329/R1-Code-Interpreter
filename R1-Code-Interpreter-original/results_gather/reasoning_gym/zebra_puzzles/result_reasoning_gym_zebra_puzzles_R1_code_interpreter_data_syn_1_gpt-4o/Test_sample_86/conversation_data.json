    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite drinks, their children, and their phone models in each house. Let's break down the clues and see what we can deduce step by step.\n\n1. The person who is the mother of Billy is in the fourth house.\n2. The person who likes milk is the person's child is named Alice.\n3. The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is in the third house.\n4. Arnold and Bob are next to each other.\n5. Alice is the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n6. The coffee drinker is the person who is the mother of Billy.\n7. The person who likes milk is in the third house.\n8. The boba tea drinker is Arnold.\n9. Carol is the person who uses a OnePlus 9.\n10. The boba tea drinker is the person's child is named Bella.\n11. Bob is directly left of the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n\nLet's start by organizing the information:\n\n- House 3: The person uses a Google Pixel 6 and likes milk. Their child is named Alice.\n- House 4: The person is the mother of Billy and drinks coffee.\n- Arnold drinks boba tea and his child is named Bella.\n- Alice uses a Huawei P50.\n- Carol uses a OnePlus 9.\n- Bob is directly left of Alice.\n\nFrom these deductions, we can start filling in the houses:\n\n- House 3: The person uses a Google Pixel 6, likes milk, and their child is Alice. This person cannot be Alice (since Alice uses a Huawei P50), so it must be Carol (since Carol uses a OnePlus 9, and the only other option for House 3 is the Google Pixel 6).\n- House 4: The person is the mother of Billy and drinks coffee. This person cannot be Carol (since Carol is in House 3), so it must be Arnold (since Arnold drinks boba tea, and the only other option for House 4 is coffee).\n- House 2: Since Bob is directly left of Alice, and Alice uses a Huawei P50, Alice must be in House 2.\n- House 1: The only person left is Bob.\n\nNow, let's verify:\n\n- House 1: Bob\n- House 2: Alice (uses Huawei P50)\n- House 3: Carol (uses Google Pixel 6, likes milk, child is Alice)\n- House 4: Arnold (drinks coffee, mother of Billy, drinks boba tea, child is Bella)\n\nEverything checks out with the clues. Therefore, the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\n<<<Bob>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
