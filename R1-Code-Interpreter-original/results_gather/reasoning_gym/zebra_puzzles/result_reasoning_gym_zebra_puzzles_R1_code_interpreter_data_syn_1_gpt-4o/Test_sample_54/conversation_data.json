    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their favorite cigars, nationalities, and drinks in the four houses. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. The person who smokes Blue Master is the coffee drinker.\n2. Alice is directly left of the boba tea drinker.\n3. The Prince smoker is the one who only drinks water.\n4. The coffee drinker is the Chinese.\n5. The British person is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n6. The person who smokes Blue Master is Carol.\n7. The boba tea drinker is the Dane.\n8. The person partial to Pall Mall is in the fourth house.\n9. Bob and the person who likes milk are next to each other.\n\nLet's start by using the clues to fill in the information:\n\n- From clue 6, Carol smokes Blue Master.\n- From clue 1, Carol drinks coffee.\n- From clue 4, Carol is Chinese.\n- From clue 8, the British person who smokes Pall Mall is in the fourth house.\n- From clue 5, the British person smokes Pall Mall.\n- From clue 7, the Dane drinks boba tea.\n- From clue 2, Alice is directly left of the boba tea drinker (Dane).\n\nNow, let's try to place these people in the houses:\n\n- House 4: British, Pall Mall\n- House 3: Since Alice is directly left of the Dane, Alice must be in House 3, and the Dane (boba tea drinker) must be in House 4.\n- House 2: Carol (Chinese, Blue Master, coffee) must be in House 2.\n- House 1: By elimination, Bob must be in House 1.\n\nNow, let's verify and fill in the remaining details:\n\n- House 1: Bob, drinks milk (since Bob and the milk drinker are next to each other, and House 2 is already occupied by Carol who drinks coffee).\n- House 2: Carol, Chinese, Blue Master, coffee.\n- House 3: Alice, drinks water (since the Prince smoker drinks water, and Alice is not the Dane or British).\n- House 4: Dane, boba tea, British, Pall Mall.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining cigars:\n\n- House 1: Bob must smoke Prince (since the Prince smoker drinks water, and Alice drinks water in House 3).\n\nLet's summarize the final arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Bob, Prince, water\n- House 2: Carol, Chinese, Blue Master, coffee\n- House 3: Alice, water\n- House 4: Dane, boba tea, British, Pall Mall\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\n<<<bob>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
