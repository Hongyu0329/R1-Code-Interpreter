    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to deduce the arrangement of people, their phone models, pets, and favorite colors in the four houses based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is the person who loves purple.\n2. The person who loves purple is directly left of the bird keeper.\n3. The cat lover is the person who loves purple.\n4. The person who uses a Huawei P50 is Arnold.\n5. The bird keeper is Bob.\n6. The person who loves blue is the fish enthusiast.\n7. Bob is the person who loves brown.\n8. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 and Arnold are next to each other.\n9. Alice is directly left of the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n10. The fish enthusiast is directly left of the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.\n\nLet's start by organizing the information:\n\n- We know from clue 4 that Arnold uses a Huawei P50.\n- From clue 5, Bob is the bird keeper.\n- From clue 7, Bob loves brown.\n- From clue 9, Alice is directly left of Arnold.\n- From clue 8, the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is next to Arnold.\n- From clue 6, the person who loves blue is the fish enthusiast.\n- From clue 10, the fish enthusiast is directly left of the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.\n- From clues 1 and 3, the person who uses a Google Pixel 6 loves purple and is the cat lover.\n\nLet's use this information to deduce the arrangement:\n\n1. Since Bob loves brown and is the bird keeper, he cannot be in house 1 because the person in house 1 must be directly left of the bird keeper (clue 2). Therefore, Bob must be in house 3 or 4.\n2. If Bob is in house 3, then the person who loves purple (and uses a Google Pixel 6) must be in house 2, and the fish enthusiast (who loves blue) must be in house 1.\n3. If Bob is in house 4, then the person who loves purple must be in house 3, and the fish enthusiast must be in house 2.\n4. Since Alice is directly left of Arnold (clue 9), and Arnold uses a Huawei P50, Arnold cannot be in house 1. Therefore, Arnold must be in house 3 or 4.\n5. If Arnold is in house 3, Alice must be in house 2, and the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 must be in house 4.\n6. If Arnold is in house 4, Alice must be in house 3, and the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 must be in house 2.\n\nLet's try to deduce the correct arrangement using the above deductions:\n\n- If Bob is in house 3, then Arnold must be in house 4, and Alice must be in house 3. This means the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is in house 2, and the fish enthusiast is in house 1.\n- If Bob is in house 4, then Arnold must be in house 3, and Alice must be in house 2. This means the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is in house 1, and the fish enthusiast is in house 2.\n\nLet's check the consistency of these arrangements with the clues:\n\n- If Bob is in house 3, then the person who loves purple (and uses a Google Pixel 6) is in house 2, and the fish enthusiast (who loves blue) is in house 1. This is consistent with all the clues.\n- If Bob is in house 4, then the person who loves purple (and uses a Google Pixel 6) is in house 3, and the fish enthusiast (who loves blue) is in house 2. This is also consistent with all the clues.\n\nSince both arrangements are consistent, we need to determine which one is correct. Let's use the remaining clues to finalize the arrangement:\n\n- From clue 8, the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 and Arnold are next to each other. This means if Arnold is in house 4, the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 must be in house 3, which is not possible because Bob is in house 3. Therefore, Arnold must be in house 3, and the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 must be in house 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct arrangement is:\n\n- House 1: Fish enthusiast (loves blue)\n- House 2: Person who loves purple (uses Google Pixel 6, cat lover)\n- House 3: Arnold (uses Huawei P50)\n- House 4: Bob (bird keeper, loves brown)\n\nSince the fish enthusiast is in house 1, and Alice is directly left of Arnold, Alice must be the fish enthusiast in house 1.\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\n<<<Alice>>>"
