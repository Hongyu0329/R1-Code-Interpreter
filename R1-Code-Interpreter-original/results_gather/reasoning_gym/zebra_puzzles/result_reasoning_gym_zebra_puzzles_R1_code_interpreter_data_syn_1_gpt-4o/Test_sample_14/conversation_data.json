Let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. Bob is the coffee drinker.\n2. The fish enthusiast and the person who uses a OnePlus 9 are next to each other.\n3. Alice is the person who likes milk.\n4. The bird keeper is Carol.\n5. The bird keeper and the person who uses a Google Pixel 6 are next to each other.\n6. The fish enthusiast is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.\n7. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is directly left of the boba tea drinker.\n8. The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the one who only drinks water.\n9. The bird keeper is in the first house.\n10. The fish enthusiast and the cat lover are next to each other.\n11. The person who likes milk is in the third house.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know for sure:\n\n- From clue 9, Carol is the bird keeper and is in the first house.\n- From clue 11, Alice, who likes milk, is in the third house.\n\nNow, let's use the other clues to fill in the rest:\n\n- From clue 4, Carol is the bird keeper.\n- From clue 5, the person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is next to Carol.\n- From clue 6, the fish enthusiast uses a Google Pixel 6.\n- From clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the cat lover are next to each other.\n\nLet's try to deduce the positions using the remaining clues:\n\n- From clue 8, the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 drinks water.\n- From clue 7, the Samsung Galaxy S21 user is directly left of the boba tea drinker.\n\nLet's try to place these in the houses:\n\n- House 1: Carol (bird keeper)\n- House 2: Samsung Galaxy S21 user (drinks water)\n- House 3: Alice (drinks milk)\n- House 4: Boba tea drinker\n\nNow, let's place the remaining people and items:\n\n- From clue 1, Bob drinks coffee. Since Alice is in house 3 and drinks milk, Bob must be in house 4.\n- From clue 2, the fish enthusiast and the OnePlus 9 user are next to each other. The fish enthusiast is in house 2 (Google Pixel 6 user), so the OnePlus 9 user must be in house 1 or 3.\n- From clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the cat lover are next to each other. The cat lover must be in house 3.\n\nNow, let's finalize the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Carol (bird keeper), OnePlus 9 user\n- House 2: Fish enthusiast, Google Pixel 6 user, drinks water\n- House 3: Alice (drinks milk), cat lover\n- House 4: Bob (drinks coffee), boba tea drinker\n\nSince Carol is in house 1, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\n<<<Carol>>>"
