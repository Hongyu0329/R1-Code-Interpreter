    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of people, their lunches, their children, and their favorite flowers in each house. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. The person's child named Alice is in the third house.\n2. The person who is the mother of Billy loves the bouquet of iris.\n3. Arnold is the person who loves pizza.\n4. The person who is the mother of Timothy is in the fourth house.\n5. The person who loves stir fry has a child named Bella.\n6. Alice loves eating grilled cheese.\n7. The person who is the mother of Billy is directly left of the person who loves the bouquet of lilies.\n8. The person who loves soup is the mother of Timothy.\n9. The person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the first house.\n10. The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is Carol.\n11. The person who is the mother of Billy is the person who loves pizza.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know for sure:\n\n- House 1: The person who loves the bouquet of iris (Clue 9).\n- House 3: The person's child named Alice (Clue 1).\n- House 4: The person who is the mother of Timothy and loves soup (Clue 4 and 8).\n\nFrom Clue 2 and Clue 9, we know that the person in House 1 is the mother of Billy and loves the bouquet of iris. From Clue 11, this person also loves pizza, which means Arnold is in House 1.\n\nNow, let's place the rest of the information:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, loves pizza, mother of Billy, loves bouquet of iris.\n- House 3: Child named Alice.\n- House 4: Mother of Timothy, loves soup.\n\nFrom Clue 6, Alice loves grilled cheese, so Alice must be in House 3.\n\n- House 1: Arnold, loves pizza, mother of Billy, loves bouquet of iris.\n- House 3: Alice, loves grilled cheese, child named Alice.\n- House 4: Mother of Timothy, loves soup.\n\nFrom Clue 10, Carol loves daffodils. Since House 1 has iris and House 4 is not mentioned, Carol must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 3 is Alice, so Carol must be in House 2.\n\n- House 1: Arnold, loves pizza, mother of Billy, loves bouquet of iris.\n- House 2: Carol, loves daffodils.\n- House 3: Alice, loves grilled cheese, child named Alice.\n- House 4: Mother of Timothy, loves soup.\n\nFrom Clue 5, the person who loves stir fry has a child named Bella. This person cannot be in House 1 (Arnold) or House 3 (Alice), so they must be in House 2 or House 4. Since House 4 is the mother of Timothy, the person who loves stir fry must be in House 2.\n\n- House 1: Arnold, loves pizza, mother of Billy, loves bouquet of iris.\n- House 2: Carol, loves stir fry, child named Bella, loves daffodils.\n- House 3: Alice, loves grilled cheese, child named Alice.\n- House 4: Mother of Timothy, loves soup.\n\nFrom Clue 7, the person who is the mother of Billy is directly left of the person who loves the bouquet of lilies. Since Arnold is in House 1 and is the mother of Billy, the person who loves lilies must be in House 2.\n\n- House 1: Arnold, loves pizza, mother of Billy, loves bouquet of iris.\n- House 2: Carol, loves stir fry, child named Bella, loves lilies.\n- House 3: Alice, loves grilled cheese, child named Alice.\n- House 4: Mother of Timothy, loves soup.\n\nNow, we have all the information we need. The name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\n<<<Arnold>>>"
