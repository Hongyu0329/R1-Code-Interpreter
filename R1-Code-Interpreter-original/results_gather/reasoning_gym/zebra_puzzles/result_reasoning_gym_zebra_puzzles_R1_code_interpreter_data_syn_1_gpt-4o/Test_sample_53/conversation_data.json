    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of people, their phone models, favorite colors, and cigars in the four houses. Let's break down the clues and use them to fill in the information step by step.\n\n1. **Alice uses a Google Pixel 6.** (Clue 3)\n2. **The person who smokes Blue Master uses a Google Pixel 6.** (Clue 1)\n   - Therefore, Alice smokes Blue Master.\n3. **The person who loves purple is the Prince smoker.** (Clue 6)\n4. **The Prince smoker uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.** (Clue 5)\n5. **The person who loves brown uses a OnePlus 9.** (Clue 4)\n6. **The person who loves white is directly left of the person who loves brown.** (Clue 8)\n7. **The person who loves blue is Arnold.** (Clue 9)\n8. **The person partial to Pall Mall is in the third house.** (Clue 7)\n9. **The person who loves brown and Carol are next to each other.** (Clue 2)\n\nLet's start by placing Arnold, who loves blue, and Alice, who uses a Google Pixel 6 and smokes Blue Master, in the houses. We know that the person who loves white is directly left of the person who loves brown, and the person who loves brown uses a OnePlus 9. We also know that the person who loves purple smokes Prince and uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n\nLet's use these clues to deduce the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Unknown\n- House 2: Unknown\n- House 3: Pall Mall smoker\n- House 4: Unknown\n\nSince Arnold loves blue, he cannot be in House 3 (Pall Mall smoker). Alice, who uses a Google Pixel 6 and smokes Blue Master, cannot be in House 3 either. Therefore, Arnold and Alice must be in Houses 1, 2, or 4.\n\nLet's try to place Arnold and Alice:\n\n- If Arnold is in House 1, then Alice could be in House 2 or 4.\n- If Alice is in House 2, then the person who loves brown (OnePlus 9 user) must be in House 3 or 4.\n- If the person who loves brown is in House 3, then the person who loves white must be in House 2, which is not possible because Alice is in House 2.\n- Therefore, the person who loves brown must be in House 4, and the person who loves white must be in House 3.\n\nNow, let's place the remaining people:\n\n- House 1: Arnold (loves blue)\n- House 2: Alice (Google Pixel 6, Blue Master)\n- House 3: Person who loves white, smokes Pall Mall\n- House 4: Person who loves brown, uses OnePlus 9\n\nNow, let's deduce the remaining information:\n\n- The person who loves purple smokes Prince and uses a Samsung Galaxy S21. This person cannot be in House 3 or 4, so they must be in House 1.\n- Therefore, Arnold must be the person who loves purple, smokes Prince, and uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n\nNow, let's finalize the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Arnold (loves purple, smokes Prince, Samsung Galaxy S21)\n- House 2: Alice (Google Pixel 6, Blue Master)\n- House 3: Person who loves white, smokes Pall Mall\n- House 4: Person who loves brown, uses OnePlus 9\n\nSince Carol is next to the person who loves brown, Carol must be in House 3.\n\nFinally, let's deduce the name of the person in House 1:\n\n- House 1: Arnold (loves purple, smokes Prince, Samsung Galaxy S21)\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\n<<<Arnold>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a logic puzzle.
