    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of people, their children, nationalities, and lunch preferences in the four houses.\n\n1. **The British person is Arnold.**\n   - Arnold is British.\n\n2. **The person's child named Alice is directly left of the person who loves the soup.**\n   - Alice's mother is directly left of the soup lover.\n\n3. **The person who loves stir fry is the person's child named Bella.**\n   - Bella's mother loves stir fry.\n\n4. **The Chinese is Carol.**\n   - Carol is Chinese.\n\n5. **The German is the person's child named Bella.**\n   - Bella's mother is German.\n\n6. **The person's child named Bella is Bob.**\n   - Bob is Bella's mother.\n\n7. **The person who loves the soup is in the second house.**\n   - The soup lover is in House 2.\n\n8. **The person who loves the soup is the British person.**\n   - Arnold, who is British, loves soup and is in House 2.\n\n9. **The person's child named Alice is Carol.**\n   - Carol's child is Alice.\n\n10. **The British person is directly left of the German.**\n    - Arnold (British) is directly left of Bob (German).\n\n11. **The person who is the mother of Billy is the person who is a pizza lover.**\n    - Billy's mother loves pizza.\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- **House 2**: Arnold (British, soup lover) is in House 2.\n- **House 3**: Bob (German, stir fry lover, Bella's mother) is in House 3, directly to the right of Arnold.\n- **House 1**: Carol (Chinese, Alice's mother) must be in House 1, as Alice's mother is directly left of the soup lover.\n- **House 4**: The remaining person is Dane, who must be in House 4, and is the mother of Billy, who loves pizza.\n\nThus, the arrangement is:\n- House 1: Carol (Chinese, Alice's mother)\n- House 2: Arnold (British, soup lover)\n- House 3: Bob (German, stir fry lover, Bella's mother)\n- House 4: Dane (Billy's mother, pizza lover)\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Carol>>>"
