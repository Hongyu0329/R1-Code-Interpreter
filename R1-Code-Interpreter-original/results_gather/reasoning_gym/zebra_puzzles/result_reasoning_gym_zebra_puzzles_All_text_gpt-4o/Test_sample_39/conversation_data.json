    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of people, cigars, drinks, and phone models in the four houses.\n\n1. **The Dunhill smoker is in the first house.**\n   - House 1: Dunhill smoker\n\n2. **The person who likes milk is the person who uses a Huawei P50.**\n   - Milk drinker = Huawei P50 user\n\n3. **The person who smokes Blue Master is Alice.**\n   - Alice = Blue Master smoker\n\n4. **The person who likes milk is the person who smokes Blue Master.**\n   - Milk drinker = Blue Master smoker = Alice\n   - Therefore, Alice drinks milk and uses a Huawei P50.\n\n5. **The person who smokes Blue Master and the person who uses a OnePlus 9 are next to each other.**\n   - Alice (Blue Master, Milk, Huawei P50) is next to the OnePlus 9 user.\n\n6. **The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is in the fourth house.**\n   - House 4: Samsung Galaxy S21 user\n\n7. **Carol is the one who only drinks water.**\n   - Carol = Water drinker\n\n8. **The boba tea drinker and the Prince smoker are next to each other.**\n   - Boba tea drinker is next to the Prince smoker.\n\n9. **The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the coffee drinker.**\n   - House 4: Samsung Galaxy S21 user = Coffee drinker\n\n10. **Bob is the person who uses a OnePlus 9.**\n    - Bob = OnePlus 9 user\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- Since Alice drinks milk and uses a Huawei P50, and she is next to Bob (OnePlus 9 user), Alice cannot be in House 1 or House 4. Therefore, Alice must be in House 2 or House 3.\n\n- If Alice is in House 2, then Bob (OnePlus 9) must be in House 1 or House 3. But since House 1 is occupied by the Dunhill smoker, Bob must be in House 3.\n\n- Therefore, Alice is in House 2, and Bob is in House 3.\n\n- House 4 is occupied by the Samsung Galaxy S21 user who drinks coffee. This person cannot be Alice or Bob, so it must be Arnold or Carol.\n\n- Since Carol drinks water, she cannot be in House 4. Therefore, Arnold is in House 4, and Carol must be in House 1.\n\n- House 1: Carol (Water, Dunhill)\n- House 2: Alice (Milk, Blue Master, Huawei P50)\n- House 3: Bob (OnePlus 9)\n- House 4: Arnold (Coffee, Samsung Galaxy S21)\n\n- The boba tea drinker and the Prince smoker are next to each other. Since Carol is in House 1 and drinks water, and Alice drinks milk, Bob must drink boba tea, and Arnold must smoke Prince.\n\n- House 1: Carol (Water, Dunhill)\n- House 2: Alice (Milk, Blue Master, Huawei P50)\n- House 3: Bob (Boba Tea, OnePlus 9)\n- House 4: Arnold (Coffee, Prince, Samsung Galaxy S21)\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Carol>>>."
