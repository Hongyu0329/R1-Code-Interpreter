    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in the fourth house.**\n   - This means the person in house 4 loves Dragonfruit smoothie.\n\n2. **The person who loves blue is Carol.**\n   - Carol's favorite color is blue.\n\n3. **The Desert smoothie lover is Arnold.**\n   - Arnold loves Desert smoothie.\n\n4. **The person who is the mother of Timothy is the person who loves blue.**\n   - Since Carol loves blue, Carol is Timothy's mother.\n\n5. **The person who loves brown is Bob.**\n   - Bob's favorite color is brown.\n\n6. **The Darkness smoothie drinker is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.**\n   - This means the person who drinks Darkness smoothie is in a house directly to the left of the person who drinks Butterscotch smoothie.\n\n7. **Alice and the person who loves purple are next to each other.**\n   - Alice is next to the person who loves purple.\n\n8. **Bob is the Darkness smoothie drinker.**\n   - Bob drinks Darkness smoothie.\n\n9. **The person who loves brown is the person's child is named Alice.**\n   - Since Bob loves brown, Bob's child is Alice.\n\n10. **The person who is the mother of Billy is in the second house.**\n    - The mother of Billy is in house 2.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- Since Bob loves brown and drinks Darkness smoothie, and he is directly left of the Butterscotch drinker, Bob cannot be in house 4. He must be in house 1 or 2.\n- Bob's child is Alice, so Alice is not Bob's mother. Therefore, Bob is not in house 2 (since the mother of Billy is in house 2).\n- Bob must be in house 1, and the Butterscotch drinker must be in house 2.\n- Since Carol loves blue and is Timothy's mother, and she cannot be in house 1 (Bob is there), she must be in house 2.\n- Therefore, Carol is in house 2, loves blue, drinks Butterscotch, and is Timothy's mother.\n- Arnold loves Desert smoothie, so he cannot be in house 4 (Dragonfruit is there). He must be in house 3.\n- Alice must be in house 4, next to the person who loves purple (house 3).\n- Since Bob is in house 1, and his child is Alice, Bob's child Alice is in house 4.\n\nThus, the person in house 1 is Bob.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Bob>>>."
