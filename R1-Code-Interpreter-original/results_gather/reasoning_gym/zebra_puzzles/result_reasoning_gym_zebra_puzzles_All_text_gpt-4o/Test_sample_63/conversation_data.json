From clue 4, Arnold loves carnations. Since Carol is in House 4, Arnold must be in House 3.\n- From clue 6, the OnePlus 9 user loves daffodils. Since Arnold is in House 3 and Carol is in House 4, the OnePlus 9 user must be in House 2.\n- Since Alice is in House 2, she must use the OnePlus 9 and love daffodils.\n- The only person left for House 1 is Bob, who smokes Pall Mall and uses a Huawei P50.\n\nThus, the person in House 1 is Bob.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<bob>>>."
