The person who loves stir fry is in the first house.\n   - House 1: Stir fry\n\n2. The person who loves a carnations arrangement is the Dunhill smoker.\n   - Dunhill = Carnations\n\n3. The person who is a pizza lover is Carol.\n   - Carol = Pizza\n\n4. The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is the person who loves the soup.\n   - Daffodils = Soup\n\n5.

The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is in the second house.\n   - House 2: Daffodils, Soup\n\n10. The person who loves the soup is directly left of the person who is a pizza lover.\n    - Since the person who loves soup is in House 2, Carol (pizza lover) must be in House 3.\n\n11.
