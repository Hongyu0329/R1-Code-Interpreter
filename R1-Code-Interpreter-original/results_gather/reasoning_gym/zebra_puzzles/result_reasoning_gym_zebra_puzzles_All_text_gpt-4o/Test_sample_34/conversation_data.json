    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of people, phone models, favorite colors, and lunches in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 11**: The person who loves the soup is in the first house.\n   - House 1: Soup\n\n2. **Clue 4**: The person who loves white is in the first house.\n   - House 1: Soup, White\n\n3. **Clue 8**: The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is the person who loves white.\n   - House 1: Soup, White, OnePlus 9\n\n4. **Clue 1**: The person who loves the soup and the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 are next to each other.\n   - House 2: Samsung Galaxy S21\n\n5. **Clue 5**: Arnold and the person who is a pizza lover are next to each other.\n   - Arnold cannot be in House 1 (since House 1 is Soup, White, OnePlus 9) or House 4 (since House 4 is Grilled Cheese, Brown, Carol). Therefore, Arnold must be in House 2 or House 3.\n\n6. **Clue 7**: The person who loves purple is Arnold.\n   - Arnold: Purple\n\n7. **Clue 6**: The person who loves brown is in the fourth house.\n   - House 4: Grilled Cheese, Brown, Carol\n\n8. **Clue 9**: Carol is the person who loves brown.\n   - House 4: Grilled Cheese, Brown, Carol\n\n9. **Clue 3**: The person who loves eating grilled cheese is in the fourth house.\n   - House 4: Grilled Cheese, Brown, Carol\n\n10. **Clue 2**: The person who loves blue is Alice.\n    - Alice: Blue\n\n11. **Clue 10**: The person who loves blue is the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n    - Alice: Blue, Huawei P50\n\n12. Since House 1 is Soup, White, OnePlus 9, and House 4 is Grilled Cheese, Brown, Carol, the remaining options for Alice (Blue, Huawei P50) are House 2 or House 3.\n\n13. Since House 2 has Samsung Galaxy S21, Alice must be in House 3.\n    - House 3: Alice, Blue, Huawei P50\n\n14. Since Arnold is Purple and must be next to the pizza lover, and Alice is in House 3, Arnold must be in House 2.\n    - House 2: Arnold, Purple, Samsung Galaxy S21\n\n15. The only remaining lunch option for House 2 is Pizza.\n    - House 2: Arnold, Purple, Samsung Galaxy S21, Pizza\n\n16. The only remaining person for House 1 is Bob.\n    - House 1: Bob, Soup, White, OnePlus 9\n\n17. The only remaining lunch option for House 3 is Stir Fry.\n    - House 3: Alice, Blue, Huawei P50, Stir Fry\n\nNow, we have the complete arrangement:\n- House 1: Bob, Soup, White, OnePlus 9\n- House 2: Arnold, Purple, Samsung Galaxy S21, Pizza\n- House 3: Alice, Blue, Huawei P50, Stir Fry\n- House 4: Carol, Brown, Grilled Cheese\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Bob>>>"
