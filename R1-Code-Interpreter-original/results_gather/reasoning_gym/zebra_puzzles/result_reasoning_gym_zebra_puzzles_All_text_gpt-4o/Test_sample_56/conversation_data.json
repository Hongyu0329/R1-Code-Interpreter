    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, their children, pets, and favorite smoothies in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Bob drinks the Darkness smoothie.**\n   - Bob's smoothie is fixed as Darkness.\n\n2. **The cat lover is directly left of the Desert smoothie lover.**\n   - This means the cat lover is in a house immediately to the left of the Desert smoothie lover.\n\n3. **The person who is the mother of Billy is the Desert smoothie lover.**\n   - The Desert smoothie lover is the mother of Billy.\n\n4. **Arnold is in the third house.**\n   - Arnold's position is fixed in house 3.\n\n5. **Carol is directly left of the fish enthusiast.**\n   - Carol is in a house immediately to the left of the fish enthusiast.\n\n6. **The person's child named Bella is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.**\n   - Bella's mother is in a house immediately to the left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n\n7. **The dog owner is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.**\n   - The Butterscotch smoothie drinker owns the dog.\n\n8. **The person's child named Bella is directly left of the person who is the mother of Timothy.**\n   - Bella's mother is in a house immediately to the left of Timothy's mother.\n\nNow, let's use these clues to deduce the arrangement:\n\n- **House 3:** Arnold is in house 3. Since Bob drinks the Darkness smoothie, he cannot be in house 3. Therefore, Arnold is not Bob. Arnold cannot be the Desert smoothie lover (mother of Billy) because the cat lover must be directly left of the Desert smoothie lover, and there is no house to the left of house 1. Thus, Arnold is not the Desert smoothie lover.\n\n- **House 4:** Since Arnold is in house 3, Bob must be in house 4 (as he drinks the Darkness smoothie). Bob cannot be the Desert smoothie lover, so the Desert smoothie lover must be in house 2.\n\n- **House 2:** The Desert smoothie lover is the mother of Billy. Therefore, the person in house 2 is the mother of Billy.\n\n- **House 1:** The only house left for Carol is house 1, as she must be directly left of the fish enthusiast. Therefore, Carol is in house 1.\n\n- **House 2:** Since the Desert smoothie lover is in house 2, and the cat lover is directly left of the Desert smoothie lover, the cat lover must be in house 1. Therefore, Carol loves cats.\n\n- **House 3:** Since Bella's mother is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker, and Bella's mother is not in house 1, Bella's mother must be in house 2. Therefore, the Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in house 3. Since the Butterscotch smoothie drinker owns the dog, Arnold owns the dog.\n\n- **House 4:** Since Bella's mother is in house 2, and Bella's mother is directly left of Timothy's mother, Timothy's mother must be in house 3. Therefore, Arnold is Timothy's mother.\n\n- **House 1:** Since Carol is in house 1, and she is not the Desert smoothie lover, she must be the mother of Alice.\n\nThus, the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Carol>>>."
