    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 7**: The person who loves the soup is in the first house.\n2. **Clue 2**: The Prince smoker is the person who loves the soup.\n3. **Clue 8**: Carol is the Prince smoker.\n   - From clues 1, 2, and 3, we know Carol is in the first house, loves soup, and smokes Prince.\n\n4. **Clue 3**: The person who loves the soup is the person who loves brown.\n   - Therefore, Carol loves brown.\n\n5. **Clue 1**: The person who is a pizza lover is in the third house.\n\n6. **Clue 4**: The person who loves stir fry is the person who loves blue.\n7. **Clue 9**: The person who loves stir fry is Bob.\n   - Therefore, Bob loves blue.\n\n8. **Clue 5**: The person who loves eating grilled cheese is the person who loves purple.\n\n9. **Clue 6**: The person who loves purple is directly left of the person partial to Pall Mall.\n   - This means the person who loves purple is in house 2, and the person who loves Pall Mall is in house 3.\n\n10. **Clue 10**: Arnold is the Dunhill smoker.\n    - Since Carol is in house 1 and the person who loves purple is in house 2, Arnold must be in house 4.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining characteristics:\n\n- House 1: Carol, Prince, Brown, Soup\n- House 2: Loves purple, Grilled cheese\n- House 3: Pizza lover, Pall Mall\n- House 4: Arnold, Dunhill\n\nFrom the above deductions, we can conclude:\n\n- House 1: Carol\n- House 2: Alice (since Bob is in house 3 and Arnold is in house 4)\n- House 3: Bob\n- House 4: Arnold\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Carol>>>."
