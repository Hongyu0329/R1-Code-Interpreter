    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 4**: The Chinese is in the third house.\n   - Therefore, Bob, who is Chinese (Clue 2), is in House 3.\n\n2. **Clue 3**: Bob is directly left of Arnold.\n   - Therefore, Arnold is in House 4.\n\n3. **Clue 8**: The person who loves blue is in the fourth house.\n   - Therefore, Arnold loves blue.\n\n4. **Clue 6**: Alice is the German.\n   - Alice cannot be in House 3 or 4, so Alice must be in House 1 or 2.\n\n5. **Clue 9**: The cat lover is Alice.\n   - Therefore, Alice, who loves cats, is in House 1 or 2.\n\n6. **Clue 7**: The dog owner is in the second house.\n   - Since Alice loves cats, Alice cannot be in House 2. Therefore, Alice is in House 1.\n\n7. **Clue 5**: The British person is the person who loves purple.\n   - The British person cannot be in House 3 or 4 (since Bob is Chinese and Arnold loves blue), so the British person must be in House 2.\n\n8. **Clue 1**: The person who loves brown is the bird keeper.\n   - Since the British person loves purple, the person who loves brown must be in House 1 or 3. Since Alice is in House 1 and loves cats, the person who loves brown must be in House 3.\n\n9. **Conclusion**:\n   - House 1: Alice (German, cat lover)\n   - House 2: British person (loves purple, dog owner)\n   - House 3: Bob (Chinese, loves brown, bird keeper)\n   - House 4: Arnold (loves blue)\n\nFrom the above deductions, the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Alice>>>."
