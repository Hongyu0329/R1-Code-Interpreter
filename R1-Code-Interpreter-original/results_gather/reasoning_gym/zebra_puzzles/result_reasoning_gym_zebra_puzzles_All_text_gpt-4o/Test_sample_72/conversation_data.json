    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. Carol smokes Blue Master.\n2. The person who smokes Pall Mall loves stir fry.\n3. The person who loves stir fry is directly left of the person who loves carnations.\n4. The person who loves stir fry is in the second house.\n5. Carol loves daffodils.\n6. Arnold loves pizza.\n7. The person who smokes Blue Master is directly left of the person who loves lilies.\n8. Alice is directly left of the Dunhill smoker.\n9. The person who loves soup is in the fourth house.\n\nLet's start placing these clues:\n\n- From clue 4, the person who loves stir fry is in the second house.\n- From clue 2, the person in the second house smokes Pall Mall.\n- From clue 3, the person in the third house loves carnations.\n- From clue 9, the person in the fourth house loves soup.\n\nNow, let's place Carol:\n\n- From clue 1, Carol smokes Blue Master.\n- From clue 5, Carol loves daffodils.\n- From clue 7, Carol (Blue Master) is directly left of the person who loves lilies, so Carol must be in the third house, and the person who loves lilies is in the fourth house.\n\nNow, let's place Arnold:\n\n- From clue 6, Arnold loves pizza. Since the fourth house is already taken by the person who loves soup, Arnold cannot be in the fourth house. He also cannot be in the third house because Carol is there. Therefore, Arnold must be in the first house.\n\nNow, let's place Alice:\n\n- From clue 8, Alice is directly left of the Dunhill smoker. Since the first house is the only one left for Alice, she must be in the first house, and the Dunhill smoker must be in the second house.\n\nNow, let's finalize the positions:\n\n- House 1: Alice (since she is directly left of the Dunhill smoker in house 2)\n- House 2: Person who loves stir fry and smokes Pall Mall\n- House 3: Carol (smokes Blue Master, loves daffodils)\n- House 4: Person who loves soup and lilies\n\nSince Arnold must be in the first house and Alice is in the first house, Arnold and Alice must be the same person. Therefore, the person in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Arnold>>>."
