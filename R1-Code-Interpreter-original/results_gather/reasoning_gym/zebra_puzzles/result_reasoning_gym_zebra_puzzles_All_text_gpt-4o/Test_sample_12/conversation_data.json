    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The person who loves white is the person who loves stir fry.**\n   - This means the person who loves white also loves stir fry.\n\n2. **The person who loves brown is directly left of the Prince smoker.**\n   - This means the person who loves brown is in a house immediately to the left of the person who smokes Prince cigars.\n\n3. **The person who is a pizza lover and Arnold are next to each other.**\n   - Arnold and the pizza lover are in adjacent houses.\n\n4. **The person partial to Pall Mall is the person who loves white.**\n   - This means the person who smokes Pall Mall cigars also loves white and stir fry (from clue 1).\n\n5. **Alice is the person who loves the soup.**\n   - Alice's favorite lunch is soup.\n\n6. **The person partial to Pall Mall is directly left of the person who loves the soup.**\n   - The Pall Mall smoker (who loves white and stir fry) is immediately to the left of Alice (who loves soup).\n\n7. **The person who smokes Blue Master is directly left of the Dunhill smoker.**\n   - The Blue Master smoker is immediately to the left of Bob, who smokes Dunhill (from clue 8).\n\n8. **The Dunhill smoker is Bob.**\n   - Bob smokes Dunhill cigars.\n\n9. **The person who loves the soup is the person who loves blue.**\n   - Alice, who loves soup, also loves blue.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- From clues 5 and 9, Alice loves soup and blue.\n- From clue 6, the Pall Mall smoker (who loves white and stir fry) is directly left of Alice.\n- From clue 4, the Pall Mall smoker loves white.\n- From clue 7, the Blue Master smoker is directly left of Bob (Dunhill smoker).\n- From clue 2, the person who loves brown is directly left of the Prince smoker.\n\nLet's assign the houses:\n\n- House 1: The person who loves brown (since they must be left of the Prince smoker).\n- House 2: The Prince smoker (since they are right of the person who loves brown).\n- House 3: The Pall Mall smoker (who loves white and stir fry) is directly left of Alice.\n- House 4: Alice (who loves soup and blue).\n\nNow, let's fill in the details:\n\n- House 1: The person who loves brown.\n- House 2: The Prince smoker.\n- House 3: The Pall Mall smoker (who loves white and stir fry).\n- House 4: Alice (who loves soup and blue).\n\nFrom clue 3, Arnold and the pizza lover are next to each other. Since Alice is in House 4, Arnold must be in House 3 or House 2. However, House 3 is already occupied by the Pall Mall smoker, so Arnold must be in House 2. Therefore, the pizza lover is in House 1.\n\nNow, let's assign the names:\n\n- House 1: Carol (since Alice is in House 4, and Bob is in House 3, and Arnold is in House 2).\n- House 2: Arnold (Prince smoker).\n- House 3: Bob (Dunhill smoker, Pall Mall smoker, loves white and stir fry).\n- House 4: Alice (loves soup and blue).\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<carol>>>."
