    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 4**: Bob is in the third house.\n   - House 3: Bob\n\n2. **Clue 3**: The person who loves purple is Bob.\n   - House 3: Bob, loves purple\n\n3. **Clue 9**: The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is in the first house.\n   - House 1: OnePlus 9\n\n4. **Clue 2**: The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is directly left of the person who loves brown.\n   - House 2: Loves brown\n\n5. **Clue 5**: Carol is the person who loves blue.\n   - Carol loves blue\n\n6. **Clue 6**: Carol is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.\n   - Carol uses Google Pixel 6\n\n7. **Clue 7**: The person who is the mother of Timothy is in the second house.\n   - House 2: Mother of Timothy, loves brown\n\n8. **Clue 1**: The person who uses a Huawei P50 is the person who is the mother of Billy.\n   - Mother of Billy uses Huawei P50\n\n9. **Clue 8**: The person's child named Alice is directly left of Alice.\n   - This means Alice is in House 2, and the mother of Alice is in House 1.\n\nNow, let's fill in the details:\n\n- **House 1**: Uses OnePlus 9, mother of Alice\n- **House 2**: Loves brown, mother of Timothy\n- **House 3**: Bob, loves purple\n- **House 4**: Carol, loves blue, uses Google Pixel 6\n\nFrom the clues, we know:\n- The mother of Billy uses Huawei P50, and since Carol uses Google Pixel 6, the mother of Billy must be in House 2 or House 1.\n- Since House 2 is the mother of Timothy, the mother of Billy must be in House 1.\n\nThus, the mother of Alice in House 1 is also the mother of Billy, and uses OnePlus 9.\n\nNow, we need to assign names:\n- House 1: Arnold (since Carol and Bob are already assigned, and Alice is a child)\n- House 2: Alice (mother of Timothy)\n- House 3: Bob\n- House 4: Carol\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Arnold>>>."
