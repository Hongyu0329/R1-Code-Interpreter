    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of the people, their favorite colors, smoothies, and their children in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The person's child named Bella loves blue.**\n   - Bella's parent loves blue.\n\n2. **The person's child named Alice is Alice.**\n   - Alice is both the name of the person and the child.\n\n3. **The person who is the mother of Billy is Arnold.**\n   - Arnold is Billy's parent.\n\n4. **The person who is the mother of Billy is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.**\n   - Arnold loves the Dragonfruit smoothie.\n\n5. **The person who loves brown is in the second house.**\n   - House 2 has the person who loves brown.\n\n6. **Bob is the person who loves purple.**\n   - Bob loves purple.\n\n7. **The Butterscotch smoothie drinker is directly left of the person who is the mother of Timothy.**\n   - The Butterscotch lover is in a house directly to the left of Timothy's parent.\n\n8. **The person who loves purple is directly left of the Desert smoothie lover.**\n   - Bob (who loves purple) is directly left of the Desert smoothie lover.\n\nNow, let's use these clues to deduce the arrangement:\n\n- From clue 6, Bob loves purple. From clue 8, Bob is directly left of the Desert smoothie lover.\n- From clue 5, the person who loves brown is in House 2.\n- From clue 3 and 4, Arnold is Billy's parent and loves the Dragonfruit smoothie.\n- From clue 1, Bella's parent loves blue.\n- From clue 2, Alice is both the name of the person and the child.\n\nLet's start placing these:\n\n- Since Bob loves purple and is directly left of the Desert smoothie lover, Bob cannot be in House 4. Bob must be in House 1 or 2.\n- If Bob is in House 1, then the Desert smoothie lover is in House 2. But House 2 is occupied by the person who loves brown, so Bob must be in House 3, and the Desert smoothie lover is in House 4.\n- Therefore, Bob is in House 3, loves purple, and the Desert smoothie lover is in House 4.\n- House 2 is occupied by the person who loves brown.\n- Since Bob is in House 3, the Butterscotch lover must be in House 2 (directly left of House 3).\n- Therefore, the person in House 1 must be the one who loves blue (Bella's parent).\n\nNow, let's assign names:\n\n- House 1: Loves blue, Bella's parent.\n- House 2: Loves brown, Butterscotch lover.\n- House 3: Bob, loves purple.\n- House 4: Desert smoothie lover.\n\nFrom clue 3 and 4, Arnold is in House 1 (since Arnold is not Bob and must be in a house other than 2 or 3).\n\n- House 1: Arnold, loves blue, Bella's parent.\n- House 2: Butterscotch lover, loves brown.\n- House 3: Bob, loves purple.\n- House 4: Desert smoothie lover.\n\nSince Alice is both the name of the person and the child, Alice must be in House 2 or 4. But since House 2 is already occupied by the Butterscotch lover, Alice must be in House 4.\n\n- House 1: Arnold, loves blue, Bella's parent.\n- House 2: Butterscotch lover, loves brown.\n- House 3: Bob, loves purple.\n- House 4: Alice, Desert smoothie lover.\n\nFinally, since Arnold is in House 1, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Arnold>>>."
