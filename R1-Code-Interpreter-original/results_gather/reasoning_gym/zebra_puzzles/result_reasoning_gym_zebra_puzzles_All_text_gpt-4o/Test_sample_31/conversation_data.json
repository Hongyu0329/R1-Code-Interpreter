    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of people, their nationalities, their children's names, and their favorite flowers in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 9**: The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is in the third house.\n2. **Clue 1**: The person's child named Alice is the person who loves the bouquet of lilies. Therefore, Bob is in the third house (from Clue 7).\n3. **Clue 7**: The person's child named Alice is Bob. So, Bob is in the third house, loves lilies, and has a child named Alice.\n4. **Clue 3**: The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is in the first house.\n5. **Clue 4**: The British person is the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils. Therefore, the British person is in the first house.\n6. **Clue 8**: The person who is the mother of Timothy is the Dane. Since the Dane is directly left of the German (Clue 6), the Dane must be in the second house, and the German in the third house.\n7. **Clue 6**: The Dane is directly left of the German. Therefore, the German is in the third house, confirming Bob is German.\n8. **Clue 2**: The person who is the mother of Billy is Arnold. Since Bob is in the third house, Arnold cannot be in the third house. Arnold must be in the fourth house.\n9. **Clue 5**: Carol and the person who loves a carnations arrangement are next to each other. Since the first house loves daffodils, and the third house loves lilies, the carnations must be in the second or fourth house.\n10. Since Arnold is in the fourth house, and the person who loves carnations is next to Carol, Carol must be in the second house, and the person who loves carnations must be in the fourth house.\n11. Since the Dane is in the second house, Carol is the Dane, and her child is Timothy.\n12. The only remaining person is Alice, who must be in the first house.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Alice>>>."
