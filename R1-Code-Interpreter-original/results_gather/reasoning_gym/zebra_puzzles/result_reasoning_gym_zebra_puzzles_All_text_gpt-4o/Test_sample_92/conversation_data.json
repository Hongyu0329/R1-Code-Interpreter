    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, their favorite smoothies, lunches, and flowers in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Clue 4**: The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is Bob.\n2. **Clue 7**: The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in the first house.\n   - Therefore, Bob is in House 1 and loves the Dragonfruit smoothie.\n\n3. **Clue 8**: The person who loves stir fry is Arnold.\n4. **Clue 6**: The person who loves stir fry is directly left of Carol.\n   - Since Bob is in House 1, Arnold must be in House 2, and Carol must be in House 3.\n\n5. **Clue 2**: The Butterscotch smoothie drinker is Carol.\n   - Therefore, Carol in House 3 loves the Butterscotch smoothie.\n\n6. **Clue 1**: The person who loves eating grilled cheese is the Darkness smoothie drinker.\n7. **Clue 5**: The Darkness smoothie drinker is the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.\n   - Since Carol is in House 3 and drinks Butterscotch, the Darkness smoothie drinker must be in House 4.\n\n8. **Clue 3**: The person who loves the bouquet of iris is directly left of the person who loves a carnations arrangement.\n9. **Clue 9**: The person who loves the bouquet of iris is the person who loves the soup.\n   - Since Arnold is in House 2 and Carol is in House 3, the person in House 2 (Arnold) must love the bouquet of iris and soup.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information:\n- House 1: Bob, Dragonfruit smoothie\n- House 2: Arnold, Stir fry, Iris, Soup\n- House 3: Carol, Butterscotch smoothie\n- House 4: The person who loves grilled cheese, Darkness smoothie, Daffodils\n\nSince the person in House 4 loves grilled cheese and the Darkness smoothie, and the only name left is Alice, Alice must be in House 4.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Bob>>>."
