    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of people, cigars, colors, and phone models in the four houses.\n\n1. **Alice is the person who smokes Blue Master.**\n   - Alice = Blue Master\n\n2. **The person who loves blue is in the fourth house.**\n   - House 4 = Blue\n\n3. **The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is the person partial to Pall Mall.**\n   - OnePlus 9 = Pall Mall\n\n4. **The Prince smoker is Arnold.**\n   - Arnold = Prince\n\n5. **The person who loves purple is in the second house.**\n   - House 2 = Purple\n\n6. **The person who loves white is in the first house.**\n   - House 1 = White\n\n7. **The Prince smoker is in the fourth house.**\n   - House 4 = Arnold = Prince\n\n8. **The person who loves purple is the person who uses a Huawei P50.**\n   - House 2 = Purple = Huawei P50\n\n9. **The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 and Bob are next to each other.**\n   - Samsung Galaxy S21 is next to Bob\n\n10. **The person partial to Pall Mall and the person who uses a Google Pixel 6 are next to each other.**\n    - Pall Mall = OnePlus 9 is next to Google Pixel 6\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- From clue 7, Arnold is in House 4, and he smokes Prince.\n- From clue 2, the person who loves blue is in House 4.\n- From clue 6, the person who loves white is in House 1.\n- From clue 5, the person who loves purple is in House 2 and uses a Huawei P50.\n- From clue 3, the person who uses a OnePlus 9 smokes Pall Mall.\n- From clue 10, the person who smokes Pall Mall (OnePlus 9) is next to the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.\n- From clue 9, the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is next to Bob.\n\nLet's place these:\n\n- House 1: White\n- House 2: Purple, Huawei P50\n- House 4: Blue, Arnold, Prince\n\nSince House 4 is Arnold, and he smokes Prince, House 3 must be the person who smokes Pall Mall and uses a OnePlus 9. Therefore, House 3 is next to House 2, which uses a Huawei P50, and House 4, which is Arnold.\n\n- House 3: Pall Mall, OnePlus 9\n\nNow, we need to place Alice, who smokes Blue Master. Since Arnold is in House 4, Alice cannot be in House 4. Alice must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 2 is purple and uses a Huawei P50, Alice must be in House 1.\n\n- House 1: Alice, Blue Master, White\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- House 1: Alice, Blue Master, White\n- House 2: Purple, Huawei P50\n- House 3: Pall Mall, OnePlus 9\n- House 4: Arnold, Prince, Blue\n\nBob must be in House 2 or House 3. Since the Samsung Galaxy S21 is next to Bob, and House 3 is next to House 2, Bob must be in House 2, and the Samsung Galaxy S21 must be in House 1.\n\n- House 1: Alice, Blue Master, White, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 2: Bob, Purple, Huawei P50\n- House 3: Pall Mall, OnePlus 9\n- House 4: Arnold, Prince, Blue\n\nFinally, the person who uses a Google Pixel 6 must be in House 2 or House 3. Since House 3 is next to House 4, and House 2 is next to House 1, the Google Pixel 6 must be in House 2.\n\n- House 1: Alice, Blue Master, White, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 2: Bob, Purple, Huawei P50, Google Pixel 6\n- House 3: Pall Mall, OnePlus 9\n- House 4: Arnold, Prince, Blue\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Alice>>>"
