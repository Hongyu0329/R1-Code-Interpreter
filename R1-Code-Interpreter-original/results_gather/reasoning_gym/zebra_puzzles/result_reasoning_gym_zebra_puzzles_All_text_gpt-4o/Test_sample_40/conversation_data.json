    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, their favorite drinks, colors, and smoothies in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Arnold is in the second house.**\n   - House 2: Arnold\n\n2. **Bob and the person who likes milk are next to each other.**\n\n3. **The Darkness smoothie drinker and Alice are next to each other.**\n\n4. **Carol and Alice are next to each other.**\n\n5. **The coffee drinker is in the fourth house.**\n   - House 4: Coffee drinker\n\n6. **The person who loves blue is the one who only drinks water.**\n\n7. **Alice is the coffee drinker.**\n   - House 4: Alice\n\n8. **The Desert smoothie lover and the Butterscotch smoothie drinker are next to each other.**\n\n9. **The person who loves white is Alice.**\n   - House 4: Alice loves white\n\n10. **The one who only drinks water is directly left of the person who loves purple.**\n\n11. **The Butterscotch smoothie drinker and the Darkness smoothie drinker are next to each other.**\n\nNow, let's use these clues to fill in the details:\n\n- Since Alice is in House 4 and loves white, House 4 is white.\n- Alice drinks coffee, so House 4 is the coffee drinker.\n- Arnold is in House 2.\n- Bob must be in House 3 or House 1 because he is next to the milk drinker.\n- Alice is next to Carol, so Carol must be in House 3.\n- The Darkness smoothie drinker is next to Alice, so they must be in House 3.\n- The Butterscotch and Desert smoothie drinkers are next to each other, so they must be in Houses 1 and 2 or Houses 2 and 3.\n- The person who loves blue drinks water and is directly left of the person who loves purple. This means the blue lover is in House 1 or House 3, and the purple lover is in House 2 or House 4.\n\nLet's try to place the remaining people and characteristics:\n\n- Since Carol is in House 3, and she is next to Alice, Bob must be in House 1.\n- Bob is next to the milk drinker, so the milk drinker is in House 2.\n- The person who loves blue and drinks water must be in House 1, as they are directly left of the person who loves purple in House 2.\n- The Butterscotch smoothie drinker must be in House 1 or House 3, and the Desert smoothie drinker must be in House 2 or House 3.\n- Since the Darkness smoothie drinker is in House 3, the Butterscotch smoothie drinker must be in House 1, and the Desert smoothie drinker must be in House 2.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- House 1: Bob, Blue, Water, Butterscotch\n- House 2: Arnold, Purple, Milk, Desert\n- House 3: Carol, Darkness\n- House 4: Alice, White, Coffee\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<bob>>>."
