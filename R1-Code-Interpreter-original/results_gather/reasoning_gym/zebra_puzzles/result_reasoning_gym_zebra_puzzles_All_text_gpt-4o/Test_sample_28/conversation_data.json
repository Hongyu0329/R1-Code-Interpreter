    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 8**: The person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the first house.\n   - **Clue 5**: The person who loves the bouquet of iris is the person who loves purple.\n   - Therefore, the person in House 1 loves iris and purple.\n\n2. **Clue 6**: The person who loves brown is in the third house.\n\n3. **Clue 4**: The person who loves blue is Arnold.\n   - **Clue 9**: Arnold is the person who loves the bouquet of lilies.\n   - Therefore, Arnold loves blue and lilies.\n\n4. **Clue 10**: The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is directly left of Arnold.\n   - Since Arnold loves lilies, the person who loves daffodils must be in the house directly to the left of Arnold.\n\n5. **Clue 1**: The person who is a pizza lover and the person who loves the bouquet of lilies are next to each other.\n   - Since Arnold loves lilies, the pizza lover must be in a house next to Arnold.\n\n6. **Clue 2**: Alice and the person who loves brown are next to each other.\n   - Since the person who loves brown is in House 3, Alice must be in House 2 or House 4.\n\n7. **Clue 7**: The person who loves the soup is Alice.\n   - Therefore, Alice loves soup.\n\n8. **Clue 3**: The person who loves stir fry is Carol.\n   - Therefore, Carol loves stir fry.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- **House 1**: Loves iris and purple. (From Clue 8 and Clue 5)\n- **House 3**: Loves brown. (From Clue 6)\n- **House 4**: Must be Arnold, as he loves lilies and blue. (From Clue 4 and Clue 9)\n\nSince the person who loves daffodils is directly left of Arnold (House 4), they must be in House 3. Therefore, the person in House 3 loves daffodils and brown.\n\nSince Alice and the person who loves brown are next to each other, Alice must be in House 2. Alice loves soup (Clue 7).\n\n- **House 2**: Alice, loves soup.\n\nNow, we know:\n- **House 1**: Loves iris and purple.\n- **House 2**: Alice, loves soup.\n- **House 3**: Loves daffodils and brown.\n- **House 4**: Arnold, loves lilies and blue.\n\nSince Carol loves stir fry, and Alice is in House 2, Carol must be in House 1.\n\n- **House 1**: Carol, loves iris, purple, and stir fry.\n\nFinally, the person who loves pizza must be in House 3, as they are next to Arnold (House 4).\n\n- **House 3**: Loves daffodils, brown, and pizza.\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Carol>>>."
