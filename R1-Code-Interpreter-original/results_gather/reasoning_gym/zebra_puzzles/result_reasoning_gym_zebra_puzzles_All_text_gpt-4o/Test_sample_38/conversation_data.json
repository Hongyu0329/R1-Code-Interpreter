    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of people, their lunches, children, and favorite flowers in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 1**: The person's child named Alice is in the third house.\n   - House 3: Child = Alice\n\n2. **Clue 2**: The person who is the mother of Billy loves the bouquet of iris.\n   - Mother of Billy = Iris lover\n\n3. **Clue 3**: Arnold is the person who is a pizza lover.\n   - Arnold = Pizza lover\n\n4. **Clue 4**: The person who is the mother of Timothy is in the fourth house.\n   - House 4: Mother of Timothy\n\n5. **Clue 5**: The person who loves stir fry has a child named Bella.\n   - Stir fry lover = Mother of Bella\n\n6. **Clue 6**: Alice is the person who loves eating grilled cheese.\n   - Alice = Grilled cheese lover\n\n7. **Clue 7**: The person who is the mother of Billy is directly left of the person who loves the bouquet of lilies.\n   - Mother of Billy is left of Lilies lover\n\n8. **Clue 8**: The person who loves the soup is the mother of Timothy.\n   - Soup lover = Mother of Timothy\n\n9. **Clue 9**: The person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the first house.\n   - House 1: Iris lover\n\n10. **Clue 10**: The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is Carol.\n    - Carol = Daffodils lover\n\n11. **Clue 11**: The person who is the mother of Billy is the pizza lover.\n    - Mother of Billy = Pizza lover = Arnold\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- From Clue 9, the Iris lover is in House 1.\n- From Clue 2 and Clue 11, Arnold is the mother of Billy and loves pizza and iris. Therefore, Arnold is in House 1.\n- From Clue 10, Carol loves daffodils. Since Arnold is in House 1, Carol cannot be in House 1.\n- From Clue 4 and Clue 8, the mother of Timothy is in House 4 and loves soup.\n- From Clue 6, Alice loves grilled cheese. Alice cannot be in House 1 or House 4.\n- From Clue 1, the child named Alice is in House 3. Therefore, Alice cannot be in House 3.\n- From Clue 5, the stir fry lover is the mother of Bella. This person cannot be in House 1 or House 4.\n- From Clue 7, the mother of Billy (Arnold) is directly left of the lilies lover. Therefore, the lilies lover is in House 2.\n- Since Carol loves daffodils and cannot be in House 1, she must be in House 3.\n- Alice, who loves grilled cheese, must be in House 2.\n- The only person left for House 4 is Bob, who is the mother of Timothy and loves soup.\n\nFinal arrangement:\n- House 1: Arnold, Pizza, Billy, Iris\n- House 2: Alice, Grilled Cheese, Bella, Lilies\n- House 3: Carol, Stir Fry, Alice, Daffodils\n- House 4: Bob, Soup, Timothy, Carnations\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Arnold>>>."
