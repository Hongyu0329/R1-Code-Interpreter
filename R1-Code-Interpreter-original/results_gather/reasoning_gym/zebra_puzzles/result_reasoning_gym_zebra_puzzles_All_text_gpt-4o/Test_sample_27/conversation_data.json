    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, their lunches, favorite smoothies, and favorite cigars in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The person who is a pizza lover is in the fourth house.**\n   - House 4: Pizza\n\n2. **The Darkness smoothie drinker is the person who is a pizza lover.**\n   - House 4: Pizza, Darkness\n\n3. **The Desert smoothie lover is Alice.**\n   - Alice: Desert\n\n4. **The Dunhill smoker is directly left of the person who smokes Blue Master.**\n   - Dunhill is in a house directly to the left of Blue Master.\n\n5. **Arnold is directly left of the person who is a pizza lover.**\n   - Arnold is in House 3.\n\n6. **Bob is the person who loves the soup.**\n   - Bob: Soup\n\n7. **The Dunhill smoker is the Desert smoothie lover.**\n   - Alice smokes Dunhill.\n\n8. **The person who loves the soup is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.**\n   - Bob: Soup, Butterscotch\n\n9. **The Prince smoker is the person who loves eating grilled cheese.**\n   - Grilled Cheese: Prince\n\nNow, let's place these pieces of information into the houses:\n\n- **House 4**: Pizza, Darkness\n- **House 3**: Arnold (directly left of House 4)\n- **Alice**: Desert, Dunhill\n\nSince Alice smokes Dunhill and is the Desert smoothie lover, and Dunhill is directly left of Blue Master, Alice must be in House 2, and Blue Master must be in House 3.\n\n- **House 2**: Alice, Desert, Dunhill\n- **House 3**: Arnold, Blue Master\n\nBob, who loves soup and Butterscotch, must be in House 1 because he cannot be in House 3 or 4, and House 2 is occupied by Alice.\n\n- **House 1**: Bob, Soup, Butterscotch\n\nNow, we need to determine the remaining characteristics:\n\n- **House 3**: Arnold, Blue Master, Grilled Cheese, Prince\n\nSince the Prince smoker loves grilled cheese, and House 3 is the only house left for grilled cheese, Arnold must love grilled cheese and smoke Prince.\n\nFinally, we have:\n\n- **House 1**: Bob, Soup, Butterscotch\n- **House 2**: Alice, Desert, Dunhill\n- **House 3**: Arnold, Grilled Cheese, Blue Master, Prince\n- **House 4**: Pizza, Darkness\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Bob>>>."
