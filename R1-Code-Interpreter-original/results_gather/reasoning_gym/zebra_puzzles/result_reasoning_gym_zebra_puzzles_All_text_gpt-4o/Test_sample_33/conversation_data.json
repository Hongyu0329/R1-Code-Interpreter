    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, their favorite colors, lunches, and pets in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The cat lover is directly left of Arnold.**\n   - This means Arnold cannot be in House 1, and the cat lover cannot be in House 4.\n\n2. **The person who loves stir fry is in the fourth house.**\n   - This means the person in House 4 loves stir fry.\n\n3. **The bird keeper is Bob.**\n   - Bob keeps a bird.\n\n4. **The person who loves the soup is Alice.**\n   - Alice loves soup.\n\n5. **The person who loves eating grilled cheese is directly left of the bird keeper.**\n   - Since Bob is the bird keeper, the person who loves grilled cheese is directly to the left of Bob.\n\n6. **The person who loves white is the fish enthusiast.**\n   - The person who loves white keeps a fish.\n\n7. **Arnold and the person who loves brown are next to each other.**\n   - Arnold is next to the person who loves brown.\n\n8. **The person who loves purple is the cat lover.**\n   - The cat lover loves purple.\n\n9. **Carol is in the third house.**\n   - Carol is in House 3.\n\nNow, let's use these clues to fill in the details:\n\n- Since Carol is in House 3, and the person who loves stir fry is in House 4, Carol cannot love stir fry.\n- Bob, the bird keeper, cannot be in House 1 because the grilled cheese lover is directly left of him. Bob also cannot be in House 4 because the stir fry lover is there. Therefore, Bob must be in House 2.\n- The grilled cheese lover must be in House 1, as they are directly left of Bob in House 2.\n- Since Carol is in House 3, and Bob is in House 2, Arnold must be in House 4.\n- The cat lover, who loves purple, must be in House 1, as they are directly left of Arnold in House 4.\n- Since the person who loves white keeps a fish, and the cat lover loves purple, the person who loves white cannot be in House 1. Therefore, the person who loves white must be in House 3 (Carol's house).\n- Since Arnold is in House 4 and is next to the person who loves brown, the person who loves brown must be in House 3 (Carol's house).\n- Since Carol is in House 3 and loves brown, Alice must be in House 1, as she loves soup and is not in House 3 or 4.\n\nThus, the person in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Alice>>>."
