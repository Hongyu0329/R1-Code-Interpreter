    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The Chinese is directly left of Arnold.**\n   - This means the Chinese person must be in a house to the left of Arnold's house.\n\n2. **The cat lover is in the second house.**\n   - The person in the second house loves cats.\n\n3. **Alice is the dog owner.**\n   - Alice owns a dog.\n\n4. **The cat lover is the British person.**\n   - The person in the second house, who loves cats, is British.\n\n5. **The Dragonfruit smoothie lover and the Butterscotch smoothie drinker are next to each other.**\n   - These two people live in adjacent houses.\n\n6. **The bird keeper is in the third house.**\n   - The person in the third house keeps birds.\n\n7. **The German is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.**\n   - The German person is in a house immediately to the left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n\n8. **The Chinese is Carol.**\n   - Carol is Chinese.\n\n9. **The Darkness smoothie drinker is in the second house.**\n   - The person in the second house drinks Darkness smoothie.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- From clue 2 and 9, the second house is occupied by the British person who loves cats and drinks Darkness smoothie.\n- From clue 6, the third house is occupied by the bird keeper.\n- From clue 8, Carol is Chinese. From clue 1, Carol (Chinese) is directly left of Arnold. Therefore, Carol must be in house 1, and Arnold must be in house 2.\n- From clue 3, Alice is the dog owner. Since the second house is occupied by Arnold, Alice cannot be in house 2. Alice cannot be in house 3 because the bird keeper is there. Therefore, Alice must be in house 4.\n- From clue 7, the German is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker. Since house 2 is occupied by Arnold (British), the German must be in house 3, and the Butterscotch smoothie drinker must be in house 4.\n- From clue 5, the Dragonfruit smoothie lover must be in house 3, next to the Butterscotch smoothie drinker in house 4.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining characteristics:\n- House 1: Carol (Chinese), unknown smoothie, unknown animal.\n- House 2: Arnold (British), Darkness smoothie, cat.\n- House 3: German, Dragonfruit smoothie, bird.\n- House 4: Alice, Butterscotch smoothie, dog.\n\nSince we know Carol is in house 1, the name of the person who lives in house 1 is Carol.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Carol>>>."
