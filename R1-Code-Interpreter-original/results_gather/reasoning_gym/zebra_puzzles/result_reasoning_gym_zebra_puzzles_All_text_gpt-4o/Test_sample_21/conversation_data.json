    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The German is the person who loves purple.**\n   - This tells us that the German's favorite color is purple.\n\n2. **The person who loves a carnations arrangement is Carol.**\n   - Carol's favorite flower is carnations.\n\n3. **The person who loves a carnations arrangement and the British person are next to each other.**\n   - Carol and the British person live in adjacent houses.\n\n4. **Alice is directly left of the Chinese.**\n   - Alice's house is immediately to the left of the Chinese person's house.\n\n5. **The person who loves blue is Arnold.**\n   - Arnold's favorite color is blue.\n\n6. **The person who loves a carnations arrangement is the German.**\n   - From this, we know Carol is the German, and her favorite color is purple (from clue 1).\n\n7. **The person who loves brown is directly left of the person who loves the bouquet of lilies.**\n   - The person who loves brown lives immediately to the left of the person who loves lilies.\n\n8. **The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is in the fourth house.**\n   - The person in the fourth house loves daffodils.\n\n9. **The Dane is Bob.**\n   - Bob's nationality is Dane.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- Since Carol is the German and loves carnations and purple, and she must be next to the British person, she cannot be in house 4 (since house 4 loves daffodils). Therefore, Carol must be in house 2 or 3.\n\n- Alice is directly left of the Chinese, so Alice cannot be in house 4. Alice must be in house 1, 2, or 3.\n\n- Arnold loves blue, and since Carol loves purple, Arnold cannot be in the same house as Carol. Arnold must be in house 1 or 3.\n\n- Bob is the Dane. Since Carol is the German, Bob cannot be in the same house as Carol. Bob must be in house 1 or 3.\n\n- The person who loves brown is directly left of the person who loves lilies. This means the person who loves brown cannot be in house 4.\n\nLet's try to place them:\n\n- If Carol (German, purple, carnations) is in house 2, then the British person must be in house 1 or 3. Since Alice is directly left of the Chinese, Alice cannot be in house 3. Therefore, Alice must be in house 1, and the Chinese person must be in house 2.\n\n- If Alice is in house 1, then Arnold (blue) must be in house 3, and Bob (Dane) must be in house 1.\n\n- The person who loves brown must be in house 1, and the person who loves lilies must be in house 2.\n\n- The person in house 4 loves daffodils, so the British person must be in house 3.\n\n- Therefore, the person in house 1 is Bob, who is the Dane, loves brown, and is Alice.\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Alice>>>"
