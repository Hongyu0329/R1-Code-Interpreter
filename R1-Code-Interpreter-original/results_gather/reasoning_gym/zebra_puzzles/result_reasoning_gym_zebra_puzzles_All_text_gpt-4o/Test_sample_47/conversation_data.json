    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, their favorite colors, drinks, and smoothies in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Arnold is in the fourth house.**  \n   - House 4: Arnold\n\n2. **The person who loves blue is Arnold.**  \n   - Arnold loves blue.\n\n3. **The boba tea drinker is the person who loves blue.**  \n   - Arnold drinks boba tea.\n\n4. **The Desert smoothie lover is directly left of Arnold.**  \n   - House 3: Desert smoothie lover\n\n5. **The Desert smoothie lover is the person who loves white.**  \n   - House 3: Loves white, Desert smoothie\n\n6. **The person who likes milk is the person who loves white.**  \n   - House 3: Drinks milk\n\n7. **The one who only drinks water is directly left of the person who loves white.**  \n   - House 2: Drinks water\n\n8. **The one who only drinks water is the person who loves purple.**  \n   - House 2: Loves purple, Drinks water\n\n9. **The Darkness smoothie drinker is directly left of Alice.**  \n   - House 1: Darkness smoothie drinker  \n   - House 2: Alice\n\n10. **Bob is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.**  \n    - Bob is not in House 3 (Desert smoothie) or House 1 (Darkness smoothie).  \n    - Bob must be in House 2 or House 4.  \n    - Since House 2 is Alice, Bob must be in House 4.  \n    - House 4: Bob, Dragonfruit smoothie\n\nNow, let's summarize the information:\n\n- **House 1:** Darkness smoothie drinker  \n- **House 2:** Alice, Loves purple, Drinks water  \n- **House 3:** Loves white, Drinks milk, Desert smoothie  \n- **House 4:** Arnold, Loves blue, Drinks boba tea, Bob, Dragonfruit smoothie\n\nSince House 1 is the only house left without a name, and Alice is in House 2, Bob is in House 4, and Arnold is in House 4, the person in House 1 must be Carol.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<carol>>>"
