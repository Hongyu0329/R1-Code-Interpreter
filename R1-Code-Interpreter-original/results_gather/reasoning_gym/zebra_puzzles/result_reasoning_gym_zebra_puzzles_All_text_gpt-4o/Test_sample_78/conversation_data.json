    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the characteristics of each person in the four houses based on the given clues. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Arnold is in the first house.**\n   - House 1: Arnold\n\n2. **The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is Bob.**\n   - Bob uses OnePlus 9.\n\n3. **The Chinese is directly left of Alice.**\n   - This means Alice cannot be in House 1, and the Chinese person cannot be in House 4.\n\n4. **The person who uses a Huawei P50 is directly left of Bob.**\n   - Bob cannot be in House 1, so he must be in House 3 or 4. The Huawei P50 user must be in House 2 or 3.\n\n5. **The person who smokes Blue Master is directly left of the person who uses a OnePlus 9.**\n   - Since Bob uses OnePlus 9, the Blue Master smoker must be in the house directly left of Bob.\n\n6. **The Dane is directly left of the person who smokes Blue Master.**\n   - The Dane cannot be in House 4, and the Blue Master smoker cannot be in House 1.\n\n7. **The Prince smoker is the British person.**\n   - The British person smokes Prince.\n\n8. **The Dunhill smoker and the Dane are next to each other.**\n   - They must be in adjacent houses.\n\n9. **The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the Dane.**\n   - The Dane uses Samsung Galaxy S21.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- Since Arnold is in House 1, and the Dane uses Samsung Galaxy S21, the Dane cannot be in House 1. Therefore, the Dane must be in House 2.\n- The Dane is directly left of the Blue Master smoker, so the Blue Master smoker must be in House 3.\n- Bob, who uses OnePlus 9, must be in House 4, as the Blue Master smoker is directly left of him.\n- The Huawei P50 user is directly left of Bob, so the Huawei P50 user must be in House 3.\n- The Chinese person is directly left of Alice, so the Chinese person must be in House 3, and Alice must be in House 4.\n- The British person smokes Prince, and since Bob is in House 4, Bob cannot be British. Therefore, the British person must be in House 3.\n- The Dunhill smoker and the Dane are next to each other. Since the Dane is in House 2, the Dunhill smoker must be in House 1.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining characteristics:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Dunhill smoker\n- House 2: Dane, Samsung Galaxy S21 user\n- House 3: British, Blue Master smoker, Huawei P50 user\n- House 4: Bob, OnePlus 9 user, Alice\n\nSince Arnold is in House 1, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<arnold>>>"
