    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of people, their children, favorite drinks, and favorite colors in the four houses.\n\n1. **Bob and the one who only drinks water are next to each other.**\n   - Water is in house 3 (from clue 10), so Bob must be in house 2 or 4.\n\n2. **The person who loves brown and the person who is the mother of Timothy are next to each other.**\n   - This means one of them is in house 1 and the other in house 2, or one in house 3 and the other in house 4.\n\n3. **The person who is the mother of Billy is in the second house.**\n   - This places the mother of Billy in house 2.\n\n4. **The person's child is named Alice is Carol.**\n   - Carol's child is Alice.\n\n5. **The boba tea drinker is the person's child is named Alice.**\n   - Carol drinks boba tea.\n\n6. **Arnold and the person who is the mother of Billy are next to each other.**\n   - Arnold must be in house 1 or 3, since the mother of Billy is in house 2.\n\n7. **Arnold is the person's child is named Bella.**\n   - Arnold's child is Bella.\n\n8. **The person who loves blue is Carol.**\n   - Carol loves blue.\n\n9. **The person who is the mother of Billy is directly left of the person who loves white.**\n   - The person who loves white is in house 3.\n\n10. **The one who only drinks water is in the third house.**\n    - Water is in house 3.\n\n11. **The coffee drinker is the person's child is named Bella.**\n    - Arnold drinks coffee.\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- House 2: Mother of Billy, next to Arnold (house 1 or 3), and Bob (house 2 or 4).\n- House 3: Drinks water, loves white.\n- House 4: Bob (since house 2 is the mother of Billy and house 3 drinks water).\n\nFrom clues 6 and 9, Arnold must be in house 1, next to the mother of Billy in house 2. Therefore, the arrangement is:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, child Bella, drinks coffee, loves brown (since house 3 loves white).\n- House 2: Mother of Billy, drinks milk (since house 3 drinks water and house 1 drinks coffee), loves purple (since house 3 loves white and house 1 loves brown).\n- House 3: Drinks water, loves white.\n- House 4: Bob, drinks boba tea (since Carol drinks boba tea and loves blue), loves blue.\n\nSince Carol loves blue and drinks boba tea, she must be in house 4. Therefore, the mother of Billy in house 2 must be Alice, and the mother of Timothy in house 1 must be Arnold.\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Arnold>>>."
