    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of the four people, their favorite cigars, lunches, and drinks in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Clue 1**: The person who is a pizza lover is the one who only drinks water.\n   - This means the person who likes pizza and drinks water is the same person.\n\n2. **Clue 2**: The person who smokes Blue Master is the person who loves stir fry.\n   - This means the person who smokes Blue Master also loves stir fry.\n\n3. **Clue 3**: Bob is directly left of Arnold.\n   - This means Bob is in a house immediately to the left of Arnold's house.\n\n4. **Clue 4**: The Dunhill smoker and the person who loves the soup are next to each other.\n   - This means the Dunhill smoker's house is adjacent to the house of the person who loves soup.\n\n5. **Clue 5**: The person who loves the soup and the boba tea drinker are next to each other.\n   - This means the soup lover's house is adjacent to the boba tea drinker's house.\n\n6. **Clue 6**: The Prince smoker is the person who likes milk.\n   - This means the person who smokes Prince also drinks milk.\n\n7. **Clue 7**: The person partial to Pall Mall is in the second house.\n   - This means the person who smokes Pall Mall is in House 2.\n\n8. **Clue 8**: The coffee drinker is Bob.\n   - This means Bob drinks coffee.\n\n9. **Clue 9**: The person who loves stir fry and Carol are next to each other.\n   - This means the stir fry lover's house is adjacent to Carol's house.\n\nNow, let's use these clues to deduce the arrangement:\n\n- From Clue 7, we know the person who smokes Pall Mall is in House 2.\n- From Clue 8, Bob drinks coffee. Since Bob is directly left of Arnold (Clue 3), Bob must be in House 1 and Arnold in House 2.\n- From Clue 6, the Prince smoker drinks milk. Since House 2 is occupied by Arnold who smokes Pall Mall, the Prince smoker must be in another house.\n- From Clue 1, the pizza lover drinks water. This person cannot be in House 2 (Arnold) or House 1 (Bob), so they must be in House 3 or 4.\n- From Clue 2, the Blue Master smoker loves stir fry. This person cannot be in House 2 (Arnold) or House 1 (Bob), so they must be in House 3 or 4.\n- From Clue 9, the stir fry lover and Carol are next to each other. Since the stir fry lover is in House 3 or 4, Carol must be in House 2 or 3.\n- From Clue 4 and Clue 5, the soup lover and the boba tea drinker are next to each other, and the Dunhill smoker is next to the soup lover. This means the soup lover and boba tea drinker must be in Houses 3 and 4, with the Dunhill smoker in House 1 or 2.\n- Since Bob is in House 1 and drinks coffee, the Dunhill smoker must be in House 2 (Arnold), and the soup lover in House 3 or 4.\n- The only remaining person for House 1 is Alice, as Carol must be in House 2 or 3, and Arnold is in House 2.\n\nThus, the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<alice>>>."
