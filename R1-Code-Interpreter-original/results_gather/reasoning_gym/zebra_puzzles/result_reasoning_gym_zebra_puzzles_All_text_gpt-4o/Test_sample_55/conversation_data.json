    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Clue 1**: The person who loves white is directly left of the person's child is named Alice.\n   - This means the person who loves white is in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person whose child is named Alice is in House 2, 3, or 4.\n\n2. **Clue 2**: The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the person who is the mother of Billy.\n   - This tells us that the Samsung Galaxy S21 user is Billy's mother.\n\n3. **Clue 3**: The person's child is named Alice is Arnold.\n   - Arnold's child is named Alice.\n\n4. **Clue 4**: Carol is the person who loves brown.\n   - Carol's favorite color is brown.\n\n5. **Clue 5**: The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is the person who is the mother of Timothy.\n   - The Google Pixel 6 user is Timothy's mother.\n\n6. **Clue 6**: The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is directly left of the person who uses a OnePlus 9.\n   - The Samsung Galaxy S21 user is in a house directly to the left of the OnePlus 9 user.\n\n7. **Clue 7**: Alice is the person who loves purple.\n   - Alice's favorite color is purple.\n\n8. **Clue 8**: Carol is the person who is the mother of Billy.\n   - Carol is Billy's mother.\n\n9. **Clue 9**: The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is in the third house.\n   - The Samsung Galaxy S21 user is in House 3.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- From Clue 9, the Samsung Galaxy S21 user is in House 3.\n- From Clue 2 and Clue 8, Carol is in House 3, as she is Billy's mother and uses the Samsung Galaxy S21.\n- From Clue 4, Carol loves brown.\n- From Clue 6, the OnePlus 9 user is in House 4.\n- From Clue 1, the person who loves white is in House 2, as they are directly left of Arnold (whose child is named Alice) in House 3.\n- From Clue 3, Arnold is in House 3.\n- From Clue 5, the Google Pixel 6 user is the mother of Timothy, and since Carol is in House 3, the Google Pixel 6 user must be in House 1 or 2.\n- From Clue 7, Alice loves purple, so Alice is not in House 2 (white) or House 3 (brown), so Alice must be in House 1 or 4.\n- Since the OnePlus 9 user is in House 4, Alice must be in House 1.\n- Therefore, the Google Pixel 6 user is in House 2, and they are the mother of Timothy.\n\nNow, we have:\n- House 1: Alice, loves purple, uses Huawei P50 (since Google Pixel 6 is in House 2 and Samsung Galaxy S21 is in House 3, and OnePlus 9 is in House 4).\n- House 2: Bob, loves white, uses Google Pixel 6, mother of Timothy.\n- House 3: Carol, loves brown, uses Samsung Galaxy S21, mother of Billy.\n- House 4: Arnold, loves blue, uses OnePlus 9, child named Alice.\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Alice>>>."
