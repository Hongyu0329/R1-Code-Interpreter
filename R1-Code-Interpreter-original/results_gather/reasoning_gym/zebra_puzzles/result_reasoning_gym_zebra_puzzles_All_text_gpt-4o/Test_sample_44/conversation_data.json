    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the characteristics of each person in the four houses based on the given clues. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. Alice is the person's child is named Bella.\n   - This means Alice is not a mother, but a child.\n\n2. The Prince smoker is the person who is the mother of Timothy.\n   - The Prince smoker has Timothy as a child.\n\n3. The Desert smoothie lover is in the first house.\n   - House 1 has the Desert smoothie lover.\n\n4. Arnold is in the fourth house.\n   - Arnold is in House 4.\n\n5. Bob is in the second house.\n   - Bob is in House 2.\n\n6. The Butterscotch smoothie drinker is the Dunhill smoker.\n   - The person who drinks Butterscotch also smokes Dunhill.\n\n7. The Darkness smoothie drinker is the Prince smoker.\n   - The person who drinks Darkness also smokes Prince and is the mother of Timothy.\n\n8. Bob is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n   - Bob drinks Butterscotch and smokes Dunhill (from clue 6).\n\n9. The person who is the mother of Billy is in the fourth house.\n   - The mother of Billy is in House 4, which is Arnold.\n\n10. The person who smokes Blue Master is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n    - The Blue Master smoker loves Dragonfruit smoothie.\n\nNow, let's deduce the information:\n\n- House 1: Desert smoothie lover.\n- House 2: Bob, Butterscotch smoothie, Dunhill smoker.\n- House 3: By elimination, this must be the house of the Prince smoker (mother of Timothy) who drinks Darkness smoothie.\n- House 4: Arnold, mother of Billy.\n\nFrom clue 1, Alice is a child, so Alice cannot be in any house as a mother. Therefore, Alice must be the child of someone else. Since Arnold is the mother of Billy, Alice must be the child of the person in House 3 (the Prince smoker).\n\nThus, the person in House 1, who loves Desert smoothie, must be Carol, as she is the only person left.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nFinal answer: <<<carol>>>"
