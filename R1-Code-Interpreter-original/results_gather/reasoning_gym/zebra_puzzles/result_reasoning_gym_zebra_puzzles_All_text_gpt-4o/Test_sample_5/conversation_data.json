    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. The person's child named Alice is in the second house.\n   - House 2: Child is Alice.\n\n2. The person who is the mother of Billy and the Prince smoker are next to each other.\n   - This means Billy's mother is either in House 1 and Prince smoker in House 2, or Billy's mother is in House 3 and Prince smoker in House 4.\n\n3. The person who is the mother of Timothy and the Dunhill smoker are next to each other.\n   - This means Timothy's mother is either in House 1 and Dunhill smoker in House 2, or Timothy's mother is in House 3 and Dunhill smoker in House 4.\n\n4. The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is the person who is the mother of Billy.\n   - Billy's mother loves daffodils.\n\n5. Bob is directly left of the person who loves the bouquet of iris.\n   - Bob is in House 1 or House 3, and the person who loves iris is in House 2 or House 4.\n\n6. Carol is directly left of Arnold.\n   - Carol is in House 1 or House 3, and Arnold is in House 2 or House 4.\n\n7. The person who loves the bouquet of iris is the person who smokes Blue Master.\n   - The person who loves iris smokes Blue Master.\n\n8. Arnold is the person's child named Bella.\n   - Arnold's child is Bella.\n\n9. Alice and the person who loves the bouquet of lilies are next to each other.\n   - The person who loves lilies is in House 1 or House 3.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- From clues 5 and 7, the person who loves iris and smokes Blue Master must be in House 2 or House 4. Since Bob is directly left of this person, Bob must be in House 1 or House 3.\n- From clue 6, Carol is directly left of Arnold. So, Carol is in House 1 or House 3, and Arnold is in House 2 or House 4.\n- From clue 8, Arnold's child is Bella. So, Arnold is in House 2 or House 4.\n- From clue 1, the child named Alice is in House 2. So, Arnold cannot be in House 2, and must be in House 4.\n- Therefore, Carol must be in House 3, and Bob must be in House 1.\n- From clue 9, Alice and the person who loves lilies are next to each other. Since Alice is in House 2, the person who loves lilies must be in House 1 or House 3. Since Bob is in House 1, the person who loves lilies must be in House 3.\n- From clue 4, Billy's mother loves daffodils. Since Carol is in House 3 and loves lilies, Billy's mother must be in House 1.\n- From clue 2, Billy's mother and the Prince smoker are next to each other. Since Billy's mother is in House 1, the Prince smoker must be in House 2.\n- From clue 3, Timothy's mother and the Dunhill smoker are next to each other. Since Carol is in House 3 and loves lilies, Timothy's mother must be in House 4, and the Dunhill smoker must be in House 3.\n\nNow, we have:\n- House 1: Bob, Billy's mother, loves daffodils.\n- House 2: Prince smoker, child Alice.\n- House 3: Carol, loves lilies, Dunhill smoker.\n- House 4: Arnold, child Bella, Timothy's mother.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Bob>>>"
