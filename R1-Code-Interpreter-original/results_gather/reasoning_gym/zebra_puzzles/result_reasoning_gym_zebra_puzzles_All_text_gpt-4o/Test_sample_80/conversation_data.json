    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of the people, their favorite flowers, their children, and their favorite colors in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Clue 5**: Arnold is in the fourth house.\n2. **Clue 7**: Arnold loves the bouquet of iris.\n3. **Clue 4**: The person who loves the bouquet of iris has a child named Bella. Therefore, Arnold's child is Bella.\n4. **Clue 6**: Bob loves blue.\n5. **Clue 2**: Carol loves the bouquet of lilies.\n6. **Clue 8**: Carol loves white.\n7. **Clue 9**: The person who loves white (Carol) is directly left of the person who is the mother of Billy. This means Carol is in House 3, and the mother of Billy is in House 4.\n8. Since Arnold is in House 4, and his child is Bella, the mother of Billy cannot be Arnold. Therefore, the mother of Billy must be in House 2.\n9. **Clue 3**: The person who loves carnations is in the second house. Therefore, the mother of Billy loves carnations.\n10. Since Carol is in House 3, and Arnold is in House 4, the remaining people for House 1 and House 2 are Alice and Bob.\n11. **Clue 1**: The person who loves purple has a child named Alice. Since Bob loves blue, Alice must love purple, and her child is named Alice.\n12. Since Alice loves purple, she cannot be in House 2 (carnations). Therefore, Alice must be in House 1.\n13. This leaves Bob for House 2, who loves blue and is the mother of Billy.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n- House 1: Alice, loves purple, child named Alice.\n- House 2: Bob, loves blue, child named Billy.\n- House 3: Carol, loves white, child not specified.\n- House 4: Arnold, loves iris, child named Bella.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Alice>>>."
