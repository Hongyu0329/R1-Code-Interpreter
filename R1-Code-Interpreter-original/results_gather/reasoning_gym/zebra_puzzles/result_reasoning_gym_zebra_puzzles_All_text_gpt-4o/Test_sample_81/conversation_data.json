    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the characteristics of each person in each house. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Alice is the person who is a pizza lover.**\n   - Alice has pizza for lunch.\n\n2. **The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is directly left of the person who uses a Huawei P50.**\n   - This means the daffodils lover is in a house number that is one less than the Huawei P50 user.\n\n3. **The person who loves the soup is in the second house.**\n   - House 2 has the person who loves soup.\n\n4. **Carol and the person who loves a carnations arrangement are next to each other.**\n   - Carol is either directly left or right of the carnations lover.\n\n5. **The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is directly left of the person who loves stir fry.**\n   - The Google Pixel 6 user is in a house number that is one less than the stir fry lover.\n\n6. **The person who is a pizza lover and the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 are next to each other.**\n   - Alice (pizza lover) is next to the Samsung Galaxy S21 user.\n\n7. **Bob is directly left of the person who is a pizza lover.**\n   - Bob is in the house directly to the left of Alice.\n\n8. **The person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the third house.**\n   - House 3 has the person who loves iris.\n\nNow, let's use these clues to fill in the houses:\n\n- From clue 3, we know House 2 has the soup lover.\n- From clue 8, we know House 3 has the iris lover.\n- From clue 7, Bob is directly left of Alice, so Bob is in House 1 and Alice is in House 2.\n- From clue 1, Alice is the pizza lover, so House 2 has Alice and pizza.\n- From clue 6, Alice (House 2) is next to the Samsung Galaxy S21 user, so House 3 has the Samsung Galaxy S21 user.\n- From clue 5, the Google Pixel 6 user is directly left of the stir fry lover. Since House 2 has Alice and House 3 has the Samsung Galaxy S21 user, House 1 must have the Google Pixel 6 user, and House 2 (Alice) must have stir fry. But this contradicts Alice having pizza, so House 1 has the Google Pixel 6 user and House 2 has the stir fry lover.\n- From clue 2, the daffodils lover is directly left of the Huawei P50 user. Since House 1 has the Google Pixel 6 user, House 2 has Alice, and House 3 has the Samsung Galaxy S21 user, House 4 must have the Huawei P50 user, and House 3 must have the daffodils lover.\n- From clue 4, Carol and the carnations lover are next to each other. Since House 3 has the daffodils lover and House 4 has the Huawei P50 user, House 1 must have Carol, and House 2 must have the carnations lover.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n\n- House 1: Bob, Google Pixel 6, Carol\n- House 2: Alice, Pizza, Stir Fry, Carnations\n- House 3: Samsung Galaxy S21, Daffodils, Iris\n- House 4: Huawei P50\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Bob>>>."
