    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the houses.\n\n1. The person who loves purple is in the second house.\n   - House 2: Favorite color is purple.\n\n2. Arnold is directly left of the person who loves eating grilled cheese.\n   - Arnold is in House 1 or House 2, and the grilled cheese lover is in House 2 or House 3.\n\n3. The person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the first house.\n   - House 1: Favorite flower is iris.\n\n4. The person who loves purple and the person who loves white are next to each other.\n   - House 1 or House 3: Favorite color is white.\n\n5. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is the person who loves stir fry.\n   - Favorite flower is lilies and lunch is stir fry.\n\n6. The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is Carol.\n   - Carol's favorite flower is daffodils.\n\n7. Bob is the person who loves eating grilled cheese.\n   - Bob loves grilled cheese.\n\n8. The person who loves brown is the person who is a pizza lover.\n   - Favorite color is brown and lunch is pizza.\n\n9. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is in the third house.\n   - House 3: Favorite flower is lilies and lunch is stir fry.\n\n10. Arnold is the person who loves brown.\n    - Arnold's favorite color is brown and lunch is pizza.\n\nNow, let's place the information:\n\n- House 1: Favorite flower is iris.\n- House 2: Favorite color is purple.\n- House 3: Favorite flower is lilies and lunch is stir fry.\n- House 4: By elimination, this house must have the remaining characteristics.\n\nFrom clues 2 and 7, Arnold is directly left of Bob, who loves grilled cheese. Therefore, Arnold is in House 1 and Bob is in House 2.\n\nFrom clue 10, Arnold loves brown and pizza. Therefore, House 1: Arnold, brown, pizza, iris.\n\nFrom clue 4, the person who loves white is next to the person who loves purple. Since House 2 is purple, House 3 must be white.\n\nFrom clue 5, House 3: Favorite flower is lilies and lunch is stir fry. Therefore, House 3: White, lilies, stir fry.\n\nFrom clue 6, Carol loves daffodils. Since House 1 is iris and House 3 is lilies, Carol must be in House 4.\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, brown, pizza, iris.\n- House 2: Bob, purple, grilled cheese.\n- House 3: White, lilies, stir fry.\n- House 4: Carol, daffodils.\n\nThe only person left is Alice, who must be in House 3.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Arnold>>>"
