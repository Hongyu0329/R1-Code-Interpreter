    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to analyze the given clues step by step and deduce the correct arrangement of people, phone models, drinks, and animals in each house.\n\n1. **Alice is the cat lover.**\n   - From this, we know Alice has a cat.\n\n2. **The person who likes milk is in the third house.**\n   - House 3's favorite drink is milk.\n\n3. **The person who uses a Huawei P50 is Bob.**\n   - Bob uses a Huawei P50.\n\n4. **The one who only drinks water is the bird keeper.**\n   - The person who drinks water has a bird.\n\n5. **The cat lover is in the second house.**\n   - Alice, the cat lover, is in House 2.\n\n6. **The boba tea drinker is the dog owner.**\n   - The person who drinks boba tea has a dog.\n\n7. **The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is directly left of Carol.**\n   - The person with a Google Pixel 6 is in the house immediately to the left of Carol's house.\n\n8. **The one who only drinks water is Carol.**\n   - Carol drinks water and, from clue 4, has a bird.\n\n9. **Carol is the person who uses a OnePlus 9.**\n   - Carol uses a OnePlus 9.\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- **House 2**: Alice is the cat lover (from clues 1 and 5).\n\n- **House 3**: The person drinks milk (from clue 2).\n\n- **Carol**: Drinks water, has a bird, and uses a OnePlus 9 (from clues 8 and 9).\n\n- **Bob**: Uses a Huawei P50 (from clue 3).\n\n- **Boba tea drinker**: Has a dog (from clue 6).\n\n- **Google Pixel 6 user**: Is directly left of Carol (from clue 7).\n\nSince Carol drinks water and has a bird, and Alice is in House 2, Carol cannot be in House 2. Carol must be in House 4 because the Google Pixel 6 user is directly left of Carol, which means the Google Pixel 6 user is in House 3.\n\n- **House 4**: Carol (drinks water, has a bird, uses OnePlus 9).\n\n- **House 3**: Google Pixel 6 user, drinks milk.\n\nSince Bob uses a Huawei P50, and Carol is in House 4, Bob cannot be in House 4. Bob must be in House 1 or House 3. However, House 3 is already occupied by the Google Pixel 6 user, so Bob must be in House 1.\n\n- **House 1**: Bob (uses Huawei P50).\n\nNow, we know:\n\n- **House 1**: Bob, Huawei P50.\n- **House 2**: Alice, cat lover.\n- **House 3**: Google Pixel 6 user, drinks milk.\n- **House 4**: Carol, drinks water, has a bird, uses OnePlus 9.\n\nThe boba tea drinker, who has a dog, must be in House 3 because House 1 is occupied by Bob, House 2 by Alice, and House 4 by Carol.\n\nTherefore, the person in House 3 drinks milk, uses a Google Pixel 6, and has a dog.\n\nFinally, since Bob is in House 1, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is:\n\n<<<Bob>>>"
