    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement of people, their pets, children, and favorite cigars in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 8**: The Prince smoker is in the fourth house.\n\n2. **Clue 2**: The bird keeper is directly left of the Prince smoker.  \n   - Therefore, the bird keeper is in the third house.\n\n3. **Clue 9**: The person partial to Pall Mall is the person who is the mother of Timothy.  \n   - Since the Prince smoker is in the fourth house, the Pall Mall smoker cannot be in the fourth house.  \n   - Therefore, the Pall Mall smoker is in the third house, and this person is the mother of Timothy.\n\n4. **Clue 4**: Bob is the person who is the mother of Timothy.  \n   - Therefore, Bob is in the third house.\n\n5. **Clue 1**: The cat lover is directly left of the person's child named Alice.  \n   - Since Bob is in the third house, the cat lover must be in the second house, and the person's child named Alice must be in the third house.\n\n6. **Clue 5**: The fish enthusiast is the person's child named Alice.  \n   - Therefore, the fish enthusiast is in the third house.\n\n7. **Clue 3**: The person's child named Bella is directly left of the Dunhill smoker.  \n   - Since the Prince smoker is in the fourth house, the Dunhill smoker must be in the second house.  \n   - Therefore, the person's child named Bella is in the first house.\n\n8. **Clue 7**: Arnold is the person's child named Bella.  \n   - Therefore, Arnold is in the first house.\n\n9. **Clue 6**: The cat lover is directly left of Carol.  \n   - Since the cat lover is in the second house, Carol must be in the third house.  \n   - However, Bob is already in the third house, so Carol must be in the fourth house.\n\n10. **Remaining Deductions**:  \n    - Since Arnold is in the first house and Bob is in the third house, the only remaining names for the second house are Alice and Carol.  \n    - Since Carol is in the fourth house, Alice must be in the second house.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Arnold>>>."
