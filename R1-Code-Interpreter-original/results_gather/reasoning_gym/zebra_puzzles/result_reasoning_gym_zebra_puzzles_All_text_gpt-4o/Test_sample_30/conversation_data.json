    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the characteristics of each person in each house. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Carol loves soup.**\n   - Carol is associated with soup.\n\n2. **Carol is directly left of the Dunhill smoker.**\n   - Carol is not in the last house (House 4) because there must be someone to her right.\n\n3. **The person who loves purple is partial to Pall Mall.**\n   - The person who loves purple smokes Pall Mall.\n\n4. **The person who loves white is in the first house.**\n   - House 1 has the person who loves white.\n\n5. **The person who loves blue is directly left of the person who loves purple.**\n   - The person who loves blue cannot be in House 4, and the person who loves purple cannot be in House 1.\n\n6. **The person who loves stir fry is in the third house.**\n   - House 3 has the person who loves stir fry.\n\n7. **The Prince smoker is the person who is a pizza lover.**\n   - The Prince smoker eats pizza.\n\n8. **Arnold is the Prince smoker.**\n   - Arnold smokes Prince and eats pizza.\n\n9. **The Dunhill smoker is Bob.**\n   - Bob smokes Dunhill.\n\n10. **The person who smokes Blue Master loves brown.**\n    - The Blue Master smoker loves brown.\n\nNow, let's place these clues into the houses:\n\n- **House 1:** Loves white.\n- **House 3:** Loves stir fry.\n- **Carol:** Loves soup and is directly left of Bob (Dunhill smoker).\n\nFrom clues 2 and 9, Carol must be in House 2, and Bob must be in House 3.\n\n- **House 2:** Carol, loves soup.\n- **House 3:** Bob, smokes Dunhill, loves stir fry.\n\nArnold smokes Prince and eats pizza, so he cannot be in House 3. He must be in House 4.\n\n- **House 4:** Arnold, smokes Prince, eats pizza.\n\nNow, we know:\n\n- **House 1:** Loves white.\n- **House 2:** Carol, loves soup.\n- **House 3:** Bob, smokes Dunhill, loves stir fry.\n- **House 4:** Arnold, smokes Prince, eats pizza.\n\nFrom clue 5, the person who loves blue is directly left of the person who loves purple. Since House 4 is Arnold, the person who loves purple must be in House 3, and the person who loves blue must be in House 2.\n\n- **House 2:** Carol, loves soup, loves blue.\n- **House 3:** Bob, smokes Dunhill, loves stir fry, loves purple.\n\nFrom clue 3, the person who loves purple smokes Pall Mall. Therefore, Bob smokes Pall Mall.\n\n- **House 3:** Bob, smokes Pall Mall, loves stir fry, loves purple.\n\nFrom clue 10, the person who smokes Blue Master loves brown. Since Carol loves blue, the person in House 1 must love brown and smoke Blue Master.\n\n- **House 1:** Loves white, loves brown, smokes Blue Master.\n\nThe only name left for House 1 is Alice.\n\n- **House 1:** Alice, loves white, loves brown, smokes Blue Master.\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is:\n\n<<<Alice>>>"
