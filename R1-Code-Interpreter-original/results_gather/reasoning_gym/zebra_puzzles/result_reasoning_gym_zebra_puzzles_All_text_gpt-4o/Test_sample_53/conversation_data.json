    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the characteristics of each person in each house. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Clue 1**: The person who smokes Blue Master is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.\n2. **Clue 2**: The person who loves brown and Carol are next to each other.\n3. **Clue 3**: Alice is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.\n   - From Clue 1 and Clue 3, Alice smokes Blue Master.\n4. **Clue 4**: The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is the person who loves brown.\n5. **Clue 5**: The Prince smoker is the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n6. **Clue 6**: The person who loves purple is the Prince smoker.\n   - From Clue 5 and Clue 6, the person who loves purple uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n7. **Clue 7**: The person partial to Pall Mall is in the third house.\n8. **Clue 8**: The person who loves white is directly left of the person who loves brown.\n9. **Clue 9**: The person who loves blue is Arnold.\n\nLet's start placing these clues:\n\n- **House 3**: From Clue 7, the person in House 3 smokes Pall Mall.\n- **House 2 and House 3**: From Clue 8, the person who loves white is directly left of the person who loves brown. Therefore, House 2 loves white, and House 3 loves brown.\n- **House 3**: From Clue 4, the person who uses a OnePlus 9 loves brown. Therefore, the person in House 3 uses a OnePlus 9.\n- **House 2**: From Clue 2, Carol is next to the person who loves brown. Therefore, Carol is in House 2.\n- **House 1**: From Clue 8, the person who loves white is in House 2, so House 1 cannot love brown or white. From Clue 9, Arnold loves blue, so Arnold is in House 1.\n- **House 4**: From Clue 9, Arnold loves blue, so House 4 cannot love blue. House 4 must love purple (from Clue 6).\n- **House 4**: From Clue 5 and Clue 6, the person who loves purple uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 and smokes Prince.\n- **House 1**: Since House 1 is Arnold and loves blue, the only remaining phone is Huawei P50, and the only remaining cigar is Dunhill.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining characteristics:\n\n- **House 1**: Arnold, Huawei P50, Blue, Dunhill\n- **House 2**: Carol, ?, White, ?\n- **House 3**: ?, OnePlus 9, Brown, Pall Mall\n- **House 4**: ?, Samsung Galaxy S21, Purple, Prince\n\nFrom Clue 3, Alice uses a Google Pixel 6 and smokes Blue Master. Since House 3 and House 4 already have their phones and cigars assigned, Alice must be in House 2.\n\n- **House 2**: Carol, Google Pixel 6, White, Blue Master\n\nThis leaves Bob for House 3 and the Google Pixel 6 for House 2.\n\n- **House 3**: Bob, OnePlus 9, Brown, Pall Mall\n- **House 4**: Alice, Samsung Galaxy S21, Purple, Prince\n\nFinally, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Arnold>>>."
