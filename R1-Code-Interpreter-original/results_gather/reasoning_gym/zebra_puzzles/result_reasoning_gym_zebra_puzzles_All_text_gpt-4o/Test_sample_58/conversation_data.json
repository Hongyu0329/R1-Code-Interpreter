    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of the people, their favorite colors, their children, and their favorite smoothies in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The person's child is named Alice is directly left of Arnold.**\n   - This means Arnold cannot be in House 1, as there is no house to the left of House 1.\n\n2. **The Darkness smoothie drinker is the person who loves white.**\n   - This links the Darkness smoothie with the color white.\n\n3. **The person who is the mother of Timothy is directly left of the person who loves brown.**\n   - This means the person who loves brown cannot be in House 1.\n\n4. **Bob is the person who loves white.**\n   - From this, we know Bob loves white and drinks the Darkness smoothie (from clue 2).\n\n5. **The person's child is named Bella is in the second house.**\n   - Bella's mother is in House 2.\n\n6. **The Desert smoothie lover is directly left of the person's child is named Bella.**\n   - The Desert smoothie lover is in House 1.\n\n7. **The person who loves blue is directly left of the person who loves purple.**\n   - This means the person who loves purple cannot be in House 1.\n\n8. **Carol is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.**\n   - Carol drinks the Dragonfruit smoothie.\n\nNow, let's use these clues to fill in the houses:\n\n- **House 2**: Bella's mother is here.\n- **House 1**: The Desert smoothie lover is here.\n- **House 3**: The person who loves brown is here (since House 2 is Bella's mother and House 1 is the Desert smoothie lover).\n- **House 4**: Arnold is here (since the person whose child is Alice is directly left of Arnold).\n\nFrom clue 4, Bob loves white and drinks the Darkness smoothie. Since the person who loves white cannot be in House 1 (Desert smoothie), House 2 (Bella's mother), or House 3 (brown), Bob must be in House 4.\n\nSince Bob is in House 4, and Arnold is also in House 4, Bob must be Arnold. This means Arnold loves white and drinks the Darkness smoothie.\n\n- **House 4**: Arnold (Bob), loves white, drinks Darkness, child is Alice.\n\nFrom clue 5, Bella's mother is in House 2. From clue 6, the Desert smoothie lover is in House 1. From clue 8, Carol drinks the Dragonfruit smoothie, so Carol cannot be in House 1. Therefore, Carol must be in House 2.\n\n- **House 2**: Carol, child is Bella, drinks Dragonfruit.\n\nFrom clue 7, the person who loves blue is directly left of the person who loves purple. Since House 3 is the only house left for the person who loves blue, and House 4 is Arnold who loves white, the person who loves purple must be in House 2.\n\n- **House 2**: Carol, loves purple, child is Bella, drinks Dragonfruit.\n\nThis leaves House 1 for the person who loves blue and drinks the Desert smoothie.\n\n- **House 1**: Alice, loves blue, drinks Desert.\n\nFinally, House 3 must be the person who loves brown and is the mother of Timothy.\n\n- **House 3**: The person who loves brown, child is Timothy.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- **House 1**: Alice, loves blue, drinks Desert.\n- **House 2**: Carol, loves purple, child is Bella, drinks Dragonfruit.\n- **House 3**: The person who loves brown, child is Timothy.\n- **House 4**: Arnold (Bob), loves white, drinks Darkness, child is Alice.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Alice>>>."
