    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, animals, cigars, and smoothies in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The Desert smoothie lover is the bird keeper.**\n   - This means the person who loves Desert smoothies also keeps a bird.\n\n2. **The bird keeper is Arnold.**\n   - Therefore, Arnold loves Desert smoothies and keeps a bird.\n\n3. **The Dunhill smoker is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.**\n   - The person who smokes Dunhill cigars loves Dragonfruit smoothies.\n\n4. **The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in the first house.**\n   - The person in House 1 loves Dragonfruit smoothies and smokes Dunhill cigars.\n\n5. **Bob is the Prince smoker.**\n   - Bob smokes Prince cigars.\n\n6. **The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.**\n   - The person in House 1 (Dragonfruit smoothie lover) is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker, who must be in House 2.\n\n7. **The Desert smoothie lover and Carol are next to each other.**\n   - Arnold (Desert smoothie lover) and Carol are in adjacent houses.\n\n8. **The cat lover is the person partial to Pall Mall.**\n   - The person who loves cats smokes Pall Mall cigars.\n\n9. **The Butterscotch smoothie drinker and the Desert smoothie lover are next to each other.**\n   - The Butterscotch smoothie drinker (House 2) is next to Arnold (Desert smoothie lover).\n\n10. **Alice and the dog owner are next to each other.**\n    - Alice and the dog owner are in adjacent houses.\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- House 1: Dragonfruit smoothie, Dunhill cigars.\n- House 2: Butterscotch smoothie.\n- House 3: Desert smoothie, Arnold, bird.\n- House 4: Carol (next to Arnold).\n\nSince Bob smokes Prince cigars, he cannot be in House 1 (Dunhill) or House 3 (Arnold). Therefore, Bob must be in House 2 or 4. But House 2 is Butterscotch, and House 4 is Carol, so Bob must be in House 2.\n\n- House 2: Bob, Butterscotch smoothie, Prince cigars.\n\nSince Arnold is in House 3, and Carol is in House 4, Alice must be in House 1.\n\n- House 1: Alice, Dragonfruit smoothie, Dunhill cigars.\n\nThe dog owner must be next to Alice, so the dog owner is in House 2.\n\n- House 2: Bob, Butterscotch smoothie, Prince cigars, dog.\n\nThe cat lover (Pall Mall) must be in House 4, as House 3 is Arnold with a bird.\n\n- House 4: Carol, cat, Pall Mall cigars.\n\nFinally, the fish must be in House 3 with Arnold.\n\n- House 3: Arnold, Desert smoothie, bird, fish.\n\nThus, the person in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Alice>>>."
