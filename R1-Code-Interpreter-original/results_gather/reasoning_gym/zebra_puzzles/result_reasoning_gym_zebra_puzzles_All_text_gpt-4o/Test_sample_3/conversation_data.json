    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of people, colors, drinks, and cigars in the four houses.\n\n1. **Bob is the person who loves white.**\n   - Bob's favorite color is white.\n\n2. **The person who loves brown is the person who smokes Blue Master.**\n   - The person who loves brown smokes Blue Master.\n\n3. **The person who loves purple and Arnold are next to each other.**\n   - Arnold is next to the person who loves purple.\n\n4. **The coffee drinker is in the third house.**\n   - House 3 has the coffee drinker.\n\n5. **The person who loves purple is the person who likes milk.**\n   - The person who loves purple drinks milk.\n\n6. **The one who only drinks water and the Prince smoker are next to each other.**\n   - The water drinker and the Prince smoker are neighbors.\n\n7. **The Prince smoker is the person who loves white.**\n   - Bob, who loves white, smokes Prince.\n\n8. **The one who only drinks water is the person who loves blue.**\n   - The water drinker loves blue.\n\n9. **The person who loves blue is the person partial to Pall Mall.**\n   - The person who loves blue smokes Pall Mall.\n\n10. **Alice is the person who loves brown.**\n    - Alice loves brown and smokes Blue Master.\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- From clues 1 and 7, Bob loves white and smokes Prince.\n- From clue 10, Alice loves brown and smokes Blue Master.\n- From clue 2, Alice smokes Blue Master.\n- From clue 4, the coffee drinker is in house 3.\n- From clue 5, the person who loves purple drinks milk.\n- From clue 8, the water drinker loves blue.\n- From clue 9, the person who loves blue smokes Pall Mall.\n\nLet's place these in the houses:\n\n- **House 3**: Coffee drinker (from clue 4).\n- **House 2 or 4**: Bob (loves white, smokes Prince) because he is not in house 3.\n- **House 1 or 3**: Alice (loves brown, smokes Blue Master) because she is not next to the person who loves purple (clue 3).\n\nSince Bob cannot be in house 3 (coffee drinker), he must be in house 2 or 4. Alice cannot be in house 3 either, so she must be in house 1 or 3. Since Alice loves brown and is not next to the person who loves purple, she must be in house 1.\n\n- **House 1**: Alice (loves brown, smokes Blue Master).\n- **House 2**: Bob (loves white, smokes Prince).\n- **House 3**: Coffee drinker.\n- **House 4**: The person who loves purple and drinks milk.\n\nFrom clue 6, the water drinker (loves blue, smokes Pall Mall) must be next to Bob. Since Bob is in house 2, the water drinker must be in house 1 or 3. Since Alice is in house 1, the water drinker must be in house 3.\n\n- **House 3**: Water drinker (loves blue, smokes Pall Mall).\n\nFinally, the person in house 4 loves purple and drinks milk, which must be Arnold (from clue 3).\n\nThus, the arrangement is:\n- **House 1**: Alice (loves brown, smokes Blue Master).\n- **House 2**: Bob (loves white, smokes Prince).\n- **House 3**: Water drinker (loves blue, smokes Pall Mall).\n- **House 4**: Arnold (loves purple, drinks milk).\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Alice>>>."
