    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, their favorite cigars, drinks, and lunches in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Arnold is in the third house.**  \n   - House 3: Arnold\n\n2. **The person partial to Pall Mall is in the third house.**  \n   - House 3: Arnold, Pall Mall\n\n3. **The person partial to Pall Mall is the person who likes milk.**  \n   - House 3: Arnold, Pall Mall, Milk\n\n4. **Bob is directly left of Arnold.**  \n   - House 2: Bob  \n   - House 3: Arnold, Pall Mall, Milk\n\n5. **The coffee drinker is Carol.**  \n   - Carol drinks coffee.\n\n6. **The coffee drinker is the person who is a pizza lover.**  \n   - Carol drinks coffee and loves pizza.\n\n7. **Carol and the boba tea drinker are next to each other.**  \n   - Since Arnold is in House 3 and Bob is in House 2, Carol must be in House 4.  \n   - House 4: Carol, Coffee, Pizza\n\n8. **The boba tea drinker is the person who loves the soup.**  \n   - The boba tea drinker loves soup and is next to Carol, so they must be in House 3 or House 2.  \n   - Since House 3 is Arnold, the boba tea drinker must be in House 1.  \n   - House 1: Boba Tea, Soup\n\n9. **The Prince smoker is the one who only drinks water.**  \n   - The Prince smoker drinks water and must be in House 2 or House 4.  \n   - House 2: Bob, Prince, Water\n\n10. **The person who smokes Blue Master and the person who loves stir fry are next to each other.**  \n    - Since House 2 is Bob and House 3 is Arnold, the Blue Master smoker and stir fry lover must be in Houses 1 and 2 or Houses 3 and 4.  \n    - House 1: Blue Master, Stir Fry\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining details:\n\n- House 1: Alice (since Bob is in House 2, Arnold in House 3, and Carol in House 4), Blue Master, Boba Tea, Soup, Stir Fry\n- House 2: Bob, Prince, Water\n- House 3: Arnold, Pall Mall, Milk\n- House 4: Carol, Coffee, Pizza\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<alice>>>"
