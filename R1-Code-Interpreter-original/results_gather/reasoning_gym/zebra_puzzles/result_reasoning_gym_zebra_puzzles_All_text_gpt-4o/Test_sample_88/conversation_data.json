    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The Chinese is in the third house.**\n   - House 3: Chinese\n\n2. **The cat lover is the Chinese.**\n   - House 3: Chinese, Cat\n\n3. **Carol is the bird keeper.**\n   - Carol: Bird\n\n4. **The British person is directly left of the person who loves blue.**\n   - This means the British person is in a house directly to the left of the house where the favorite color is blue.\n\n5. **The dog owner is Arnold.**\n   - Arnold: Dog\n\n6. **The person who loves brown and the dog owner are next to each other.**\n   - Arnold (Dog) is next to the person who loves brown.\n\n7. **The person who loves purple is directly left of the German.**\n   - This means the person who loves purple is in a house directly to the left of the house where the German lives.\n\n8. **Carol is the person who loves blue.**\n   - Carol: Blue, Bird\n\n9. **Alice is directly left of the Dane.**\n   - Alice is in a house directly to the left of the house where the Dane lives.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- From clue 1, the Chinese is in House 3.\n- From clue 2, the Chinese is also the cat lover, so House 3: Chinese, Cat.\n- From clue 8, Carol loves blue, so Carol must be in a house where the favorite color is blue.\n- From clue 4, the British person is directly left of the person who loves blue. Therefore, the British person must be in House 2, and Carol (who loves blue) must be in House 3.\n- From clue 3, Carol is the bird keeper, so House 3: Carol, Chinese, Cat, Blue, Bird.\n- From clue 5, Arnold is the dog owner. Since House 3 is already occupied by Carol, Arnold must be in House 4.\n- From clue 6, the person who loves brown is next to Arnold. Therefore, the person who loves brown must be in House 3 or House 2. Since House 3 is already occupied, the person who loves brown must be in House 2.\n- From clue 7, the person who loves purple is directly left of the German. Since House 3 is occupied by Carol, the person who loves purple must be in House 1, and the German must be in House 2.\n- From clue 9, Alice is directly left of the Dane. Since House 1 is the only house left for Alice, Alice must be in House 1, and the Dane must be in House 2.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n\n- House 1: Alice, Purple\n- House 2: British, Brown, German, Dane\n- House 3: Carol, Chinese, Cat, Blue, Bird\n- House 4: Arnold, Dog\n\nFrom the above deductions, the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Alice>>>."
