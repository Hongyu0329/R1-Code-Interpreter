    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the information step by step.\n\n1. **Clue 1**: Bob loves stir fry.\n2. **Clue 2**: The person who loves the bouquet of iris is the mother of Billy.\n3. **Clue 3**: Carol is in the third house.\n4. **Clue 4**: The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is the mother of Timothy.\n5. **Clue 5**: The person whose child is named Bella is directly left of the person who loves a carnations arrangement.\n6. **Clue 6**: The person who loves eating grilled cheese has a child named Bella.\n7. **Clue 7**: The person who loves a carnations arrangement is a pizza lover.\n8. **Clue 8**: Alice is the mother of Timothy.\n9. **Clue 9**: The mother of Billy is in the fourth house.\n\nLet's analyze the clues:\n\n- From **Clue 3**, Carol is in the third house.\n- From **Clue 9**, the mother of Billy is in the fourth house.\n- From **Clue 2**, the person who loves iris is the mother of Billy, so the person in the fourth house loves iris.\n- From **Clue 8**, Alice is the mother of Timothy, and from **Clue 4**, the person who loves lilies is the mother of Timothy. Therefore, Alice loves lilies.\n- Since Alice loves lilies and is the mother of Timothy, she cannot be in the fourth house (where the person loves iris), so Alice must be in a different house.\n- From **Clue 1**, Bob loves stir fry. Bob cannot be in the third house (Carol) or the fourth house (mother of Billy), so Bob must be in either the first or second house.\n- From **Clue 6**, the person who loves grilled cheese has a child named Bella. From **Clue 5**, this person is directly left of the person who loves carnations.\n- From **Clue 7**, the person who loves carnations also loves pizza. Therefore, the person who loves grilled cheese (and has Bella) must be in the first house, and the person who loves carnations and pizza must be in the second house.\n- Since Bob loves stir fry, he cannot be in the first house (grilled cheese) or the second house (carnations/pizza), so Bob must be in the first house.\n- Therefore, the person in the first house loves grilled cheese and has a child named Bella. This person cannot be Bob, so it must be Alice, as Carol is in the third house and the mother of Billy is in the fourth house.\n- Therefore, Alice is in the first house, loves grilled cheese, and has a child named Bella.\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Alice>>>."
