    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. \"The person who loves white is the person's child is named Alice.\"  \n   - This means the person who loves white has a child named Alice.\n\n2. \"Carol is in the fourth house.\"  \n   - We can place Carol in House 4.\n\n3. \"The person who loves brown is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\"  \n   - This means the person who loves brown is in a house immediately to the left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n\n4. \"Bob is the person who loves purple.\"  \n   - Bob's favorite color is purple.\n\n5. \"The Butterscotch smoothie drinker is the person who is the mother of Timothy.\"  \n   - The person who drinks Butterscotch smoothie has a child named Timothy.\n\n6. \"The person's child is named Alice is the Desert smoothie lover.\"  \n   - The person whose child is Alice loves the Desert smoothie.\n\n7. \"The person who loves blue is Arnold.\"  \n   - Arnold's favorite color is blue.\n\n8. \"Arnold is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\"  \n   - Arnold's favorite smoothie is Dragonfruit.\n\n9. \"The person who is the mother of Billy is in the second house.\"  \n   - The person in House 2 is the mother of Billy.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- Since Carol is in House 4, and Arnold loves blue and Dragonfruit, Arnold cannot be in House 4. Therefore, Arnold must be in House 3.\n- Since Arnold is in House 3, and the person who loves brown is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker, the Butterscotch smoothie drinker must be in House 3 or 4. But since Arnold is in House 3, the Butterscotch smoothie drinker must be in House 4, and the person who loves brown must be in House 3.\n- Since the Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in House 4 and is the mother of Timothy, Carol must be the mother of Timothy.\n- Since the person who loves brown is in House 3, and Arnold is in House 3, Arnold must love brown.\n- Since Bob loves purple, and Arnold is in House 3, Bob cannot be in House 3. Bob must be in House 1 or 2.\n- Since the person who is the mother of Billy is in House 2, and Bob cannot be in House 2 (as he loves purple), Bob must be in House 1.\n- Since Bob is in House 1 and loves purple, the person in House 2 must be the mother of Billy and cannot be Bob.\n- Since the person whose child is Alice loves the Desert smoothie, and the person who loves white has a child named Alice, the person in House 1 must love white and Desert smoothie.\n\nThus, the person in House 1 is Bob, who loves white and Desert smoothie, and has a child named Alice.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Bob>>>."
