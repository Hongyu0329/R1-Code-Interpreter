    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, animals, cigars, and phone models in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Arnold uses a Huawei P50.**  \n   - Arnold is associated with the Huawei P50.\n\n2. **The fish enthusiast is directly left of Arnold.**  \n   - The person with the fish is in the house immediately to the left of Arnold.\n\n3. **Bob is in the second house.**  \n   - Bob is in House 2.\n\n4. **The person who smokes Blue Master is directly left of the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.**  \n   - The Blue Master smoker is immediately to the left of the Samsung Galaxy S21 user.\n\n5. **The bird keeper is the person who uses a OnePlus 9.**  \n   - The bird keeper uses a OnePlus 9.\n\n6. **Arnold is the person who smokes Blue Master.**  \n   - Arnold smokes Blue Master.\n\n7. **The cat lover is Carol.**  \n   - Carol loves cats.\n\n8. **The person partial to Pall Mall and Arnold are next to each other.**  \n   - The Pall Mall smoker is next to Arnold.\n\n9. **The Dunhill smoker is the cat lover.**  \n   - The Dunhill smoker is Carol, who loves cats.\n\nNow, let's use these clues to deduce the arrangement:\n\n- **House 2:** Bob is in House 2.  \n- **Arnold's Position:** Arnold smokes Blue Master and uses a Huawei P50. He cannot be in House 1 because the fish enthusiast is directly left of him. Therefore, Arnold must be in House 3 or 4.\n- **Fish Enthusiast:** The fish enthusiast is directly left of Arnold. If Arnold is in House 3, the fish enthusiast is in House 2. If Arnold is in House 4, the fish enthusiast is in House 3.\n- **Carol's Position:** Carol loves cats and smokes Dunhill. She cannot be in House 2 (Bob) or House 3 (if Arnold is there). Therefore, Carol must be in House 1 or 4.\n- **Arnold's Final Position:** Since Carol cannot be in House 3, Arnold must be in House 3. Therefore, the fish enthusiast is in House 2.\n- **Carol's Final Position:** Since Arnold is in House 3, Carol must be in House 1.\n- **Samsung Galaxy S21 User:** The Blue Master smoker (Arnold) is directly left of the Samsung Galaxy S21 user. Therefore, the Samsung Galaxy S21 user is in House 4.\n- **Pall Mall Smoker:** The Pall Mall smoker is next to Arnold. Since House 2 is the fish enthusiast, the Pall Mall smoker must be in House 4.\n- **Remaining Assignments:** \n  - House 1: Carol (cat, Dunhill)\n  - House 2: Bob (fish)\n  - House 3: Arnold (Blue Master, Huawei P50)\n  - House 4: The remaining person (not yet named, smokes Pall Mall, uses Samsung Galaxy S21)\n\nSince Alice is the only name not yet assigned, Alice must be in House 4.\n\nTherefore, the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<carol>>>."
