    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, their favorite flowers, animals, and smoothies in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Bob drinks the Butterscotch smoothie.**\n   - Bob is associated with Butterscotch.\n\n2. **The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in the third house.**\n   - House 3 has the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n\n3. **Carol is the Darkness smoothie drinker.**\n   - Carol is associated with Darkness.\n\n4. **The cat lover is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.**\n   - House 3 has the cat lover.\n\n5. **The person who loves a carnations arrangement is the bird keeper.**\n   - Carnations are associated with the bird keeper.\n\n6. **The Desert smoothie lover is in the fourth house.**\n   - House 4 has the Desert smoothie lover.\n\n7. **The person who loves the bouquet of iris is Alice.**\n   - Alice is associated with iris.\n\n8. **The bird keeper is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.**\n   - Bob is the bird keeper and loves carnations (from clue 5).\n\n9. **The Desert smoothie lover is the dog owner.**\n   - House 4 has the dog owner.\n\n10. **Alice is directly left of the person who loves the bouquet of lilies.**\n    - Alice is not in House 4, and the lilies lover is not in House 1.\n\n11. **The person who loves a carnations arrangement is directly left of the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.**\n    - Bob (carnations) is in House 2, and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in House 3.\n\nNow, let's place the information:\n\n- **House 1:**\n  - Cannot be Alice (since she is left of lilies).\n  - Cannot be Bob (since Bob is in House 2).\n  - Must be Carol (since Carol is not in House 3 or 4).\n\n- **House 2:**\n  - Bob (Butterscotch, bird keeper, carnations).\n\n- **House 3:**\n  - Dragonfruit smoothie lover, cat lover.\n\n- **House 4:**\n  - Desert smoothie lover, dog owner.\n\nFrom the above deductions:\n- Alice must be in House 3 (since she is left of lilies in House 4).\n- Therefore, House 4 has lilies.\n\nFinal arrangement:\n- **House 1:** Carol (Darkness)\n- **House 2:** Bob (Butterscotch, bird, carnations)\n- **House 3:** Alice (Dragonfruit, cat, iris)\n- **House 4:** Arnold (Desert, dog, lilies)\n\nThus, the person in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Carol>>>."
