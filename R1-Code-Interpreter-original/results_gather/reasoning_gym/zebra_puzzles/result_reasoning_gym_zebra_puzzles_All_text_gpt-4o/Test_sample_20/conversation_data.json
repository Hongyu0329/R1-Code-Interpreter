    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of people, nationalities, lunches, and favorite smoothies in the four houses.\n\n1. **Alice is the Chinese.**\n   - Alice's nationality is Chinese.\n\n2. **Bob is in the first house.**\n   - Bob is in House 1.\n\n3. **The Dane is in the first house.**\n   - Since Bob is in House 1, Bob is the Dane.\n\n4. **The German is the person who is a pizza lover.**\n   - The German loves pizza.\n\n5. **The Darkness smoothie drinker is the person who loves stir fry.**\n   - The person who drinks Darkness smoothie also loves stir fry.\n\n6. **Carol is in the fourth house.**\n   - Carol is in House 4.\n\n7. **The British person is directly left of the person who loves eating grilled cheese.**\n   - The British person is in a house immediately to the left of the house where grilled cheese is loved.\n\n8. **The Desert smoothie lover is the person who is a pizza lover.**\n   - The person who loves pizza also loves Desert smoothie.\n\n9. **The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is the British person.**\n   - The British person loves Dragonfruit smoothie.\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- From clues 2 and 3, Bob is the Dane and is in House 1.\n- From clue 6, Carol is in House 4.\n- From clue 1, Alice is Chinese, so Alice cannot be Bob or Carol. Alice must be in House 2 or 3.\n- From clue 4, the German loves pizza and Desert smoothie (clue 8). This person cannot be Bob (Dane) or Alice (Chinese), so it must be Arnold.\n- Since Carol is in House 4, Arnold must be in House 3.\n- From clue 9, the British person loves Dragonfruit smoothie. This person cannot be Bob (Dane) or Alice (Chinese), so it must be Carol.\n- From clue 7, the British person (Carol) is directly left of the person who loves grilled cheese. Therefore, the person in House 3 (Arnold) loves grilled cheese.\n- From clue 5, the Darkness smoothie drinker loves stir fry. Since Arnold loves grilled cheese, the Darkness smoothie drinker must be Alice in House 2.\n\nNow, we have:\n- House 1: Bob (Dane)\n- House 2: Alice (Chinese, Darkness smoothie, stir fry)\n- House 3: Arnold (German, pizza, Desert smoothie, grilled cheese)\n- House 4: Carol (British, Dragonfruit smoothie)\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Bob>>>."
