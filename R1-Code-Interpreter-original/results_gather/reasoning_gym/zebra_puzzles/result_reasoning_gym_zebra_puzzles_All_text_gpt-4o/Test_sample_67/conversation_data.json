    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, their phone models, pets, and favorite colors in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is the person who loves purple.**\n   - This means the Google Pixel 6 user and the purple lover are the same person.\n\n2. **The person who loves purple is directly left of the bird keeper.**\n   - The purple lover is in a house directly to the left of the bird keeper.\n\n3. **The cat lover is the person who loves purple.**\n   - The purple lover also loves cats.\n\n4. **The person who uses a Huawei P50 is Arnold.**\n   - Arnold uses a Huawei P50.\n\n5. **The bird keeper is Bob.**\n   - Bob keeps birds.\n\n6. **The person who loves blue is the fish enthusiast.**\n   - The blue lover also loves fish.\n\n7. **Bob is the person who loves brown.**\n   - Bob loves brown.\n\n8. **The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 and Arnold are next to each other.**\n   - The Samsung Galaxy S21 user is in a house next to Arnold.\n\n9. **Alice is directly left of the person who uses a Huawei P50.**\n   - Alice is in a house directly to the left of Arnold.\n\n10. **The fish enthusiast is directly left of the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.**\n    - The fish lover is in a house directly to the left of the Google Pixel 6 user.\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- From clues 5 and 7, Bob loves brown and keeps birds. Therefore, Bob cannot be in house 1 because he needs someone to his left (the purple lover).\n- From clue 2, the purple lover is directly left of Bob. Therefore, the purple lover must be in house 2, and Bob must be in house 3.\n- From clue 3, the purple lover also loves cats. Therefore, the person in house 2 loves cats.\n- From clue 1, the purple lover uses a Google Pixel 6. Therefore, the person in house 2 uses a Google Pixel 6.\n- From clue 10, the fish enthusiast is directly left of the Google Pixel 6 user. Therefore, the fish enthusiast is in house 1.\n- From clue 6, the fish enthusiast loves blue. Therefore, the person in house 1 loves blue.\n- From clue 4, Arnold uses a Huawei P50. Since Bob is in house 3, Arnold must be in house 4.\n- From clue 9, Alice is directly left of Arnold. Therefore, Alice is in house 3, and Bob is in house 2.\n- From clue 8, the Samsung Galaxy S21 user is next to Arnold. Since Arnold is in house 4, the Samsung Galaxy S21 user must be in house 3.\n\nNow, we have:\n- House 1: Fish enthusiast, loves blue.\n- House 2: Purple lover, cat lover, Google Pixel 6 user.\n- House 3: Bob, bird keeper, loves brown, Samsung Galaxy S21 user.\n- House 4: Arnold, Huawei P50 user.\n\nSince Alice is in house 3, the only person left for house 1 is Carol.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nFinal answer: <<<carol>>>"
