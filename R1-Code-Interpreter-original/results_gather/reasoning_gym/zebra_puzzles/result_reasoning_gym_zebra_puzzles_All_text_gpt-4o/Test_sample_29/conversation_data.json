    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of people, their nationalities, favorite colors, and favorite smoothies in each house.\n\n1. **Clue 7**: Arnold is in the third house.\n   - House 3: Arnold\n\n2. **Clue 6**: The Chinese is directly left of Arnold.\n   - House 2: Chinese\n\n3. **Clue 8**: The Desert smoothie lover is in the fourth house.\n   - House 4: Desert smoothie\n\n4. **Clue 3**: The person who loves purple is in the fourth house.\n   - House 4: Purple, Desert smoothie\n\n5. **Clue 4**: The British person is Carol.\n   - Carol is British.\n\n6. **Clue 9**: The person who loves blue is Alice.\n   - Alice loves blue.\n\n7. **Clue 1**: The person who loves brown is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n   - Brown, Butterscotch smoothie\n\n8. **Clue 2**: The German is directly left of the person who loves brown.\n   - Since Arnold is in House 3, the person who loves brown must be in House 2 or 4. But House 4 is already occupied by the person who loves purple, so:\n   - House 2: Brown, Butterscotch smoothie\n   - House 1: German\n\n9. **Clue 5**: The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is the German.\n   - House 1: German, Dragonfruit smoothie\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining details:\n\n- House 1: German, Dragonfruit smoothie\n- House 2: Chinese, Brown, Butterscotch smoothie\n- House 3: Arnold\n- House 4: Purple, Desert smoothie\n\nSince Carol is British and not in House 3 or 4, she must be in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is German, so:\n\n- House 2: Chinese, Brown, Butterscotch smoothie, Carol\n\nAlice loves blue and is not in House 2 or 4, so:\n\n- House 1: German, Dragonfruit smoothie, Alice\n\nFinally, the only person left is Bob, who must be in House 3:\n\n- House 3: Arnold, Bob\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Alice>>>."
