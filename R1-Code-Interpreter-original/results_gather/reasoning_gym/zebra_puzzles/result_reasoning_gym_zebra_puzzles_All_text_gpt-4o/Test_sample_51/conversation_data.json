    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the clues and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. The person who is a pizza lover is the cat lover.\n2. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is the bird keeper.\n3. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies and Arnold are next to each other.\n4. Bob is directly left of the person who loves the bouquet of iris.\n5. The cat lover is in the first house.\n6. Carol is the person who loves the bouquet of iris.\n7. The fish enthusiast is the person who loves eating grilled cheese.\n8. The bird keeper is directly left of the person who loves a carnations arrangement.\n9. The person who loves the soup is Arnold.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know:\n\n- From clue 5, the cat lover is in the first house.\n- From clue 1, the pizza lover is also the cat lover, so the pizza lover is in the first house.\n- From clue 9, Arnold loves soup.\n- From clue 6, Carol loves the bouquet of iris.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- Since the cat lover is in the first house, and Arnold loves soup, Arnold cannot be in the first house.\n- From clue 4, Bob is directly left of the person who loves the bouquet of iris. Since Carol loves the bouquet of iris, Bob must be in the house directly to the left of Carol.\n- Since the cat lover is in the first house, Bob cannot be in the first house. Therefore, Bob must be in the second house, and Carol must be in the third house.\n- From clue 3, the person who loves the bouquet of lilies and Arnold are next to each other. Since Carol is in the third house, Arnold must be in the fourth house.\n- From clue 2, the person who loves the bouquet of lilies is the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper is directly left of the person who loves a carnations arrangement (clue 8), and Carol is in the third house, the bird keeper must be in the second house (Bob's house), and the person who loves carnations must be in the third house (Carol's house).\n- Since Arnold is in the fourth house, and he loves soup, the person in the first house cannot love soup. Therefore, the person in the first house must love pizza, which we already know from clue 1.\n- From clue 7, the fish enthusiast loves grilled cheese. Since the first house is occupied by the pizza lover, the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house (Arnold's house).\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n\n- House 1: Pizza lover, Cat lover\n- House 2: Bob, Bird keeper, Lilies lover\n- House 3: Carol, Carnations lover, Iris lover\n- House 4: Arnold, Soup lover, Fish enthusiast, Grilled cheese lover\n\nSince the person in House 1 is the pizza lover and cat lover, and we have identified Bob, Carol, and Arnold in other houses, the person in House 1 must be Alice.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is:\n\n<<<alice>>>"
