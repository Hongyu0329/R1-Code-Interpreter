    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, their favorite cigars, phone models, and colors in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. The person who loves brown is in the second house.\n   - House 2: Brown\n\n2. The person who loves purple is directly left of the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n   - House X: Purple\n   - House X+1: Samsung Galaxy S21\n\n3. Alice is directly left of Bob.\n   - House X: Alice\n   - House X+1: Bob\n\n4. Bob and the person who loves blue are next to each other.\n   - House X: Bob\n   - House X+1: Blue\n\n5. Carol is the person who loves blue.\n   - Carol loves blue.\n\n6. Carol is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.\n   - Carol uses Google Pixel 6.\n\n7. The person who loves purple is the Prince smoker.\n   - Purple: Prince\n\n8. The person who uses a Huawei P50 is Alice.\n   - Alice uses Huawei P50.\n\n9. The person who smokes Blue Master is Bob.\n   - Bob smokes Blue Master.\n\n10. The Dunhill smoker is the person who loves white.\n    - White: Dunhill\n\nNow, let's use these clues to fill in the houses:\n\n- House 2 is Brown.\n- Alice is directly left of Bob, so Alice is in House 1 and Bob is in House 2.\n- Bob smokes Blue Master, so House 2 is Blue Master.\n- Carol loves blue and uses a Google Pixel 6. Since Bob is next to the person who loves blue, Carol must be in House 3.\n- Carol uses a Google Pixel 6, so House 3 is Google Pixel 6.\n- The person who loves purple is directly left of the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21. Since House 3 is Google Pixel 6, House 4 must be Samsung Galaxy S21, and House 3 must be Purple.\n- The person who loves purple smokes Prince, so House 3 is Prince.\n- The person who loves white smokes Dunhill. Since House 2 is Brown and House 3 is Purple, House 4 must be White and Dunhill.\n- Alice uses a Huawei P50, so House 1 is Huawei P50.\n- The only remaining phone model is OnePlus 9, which must be in House 2.\n\nNow, let's assign the names:\n- House 1: Alice, Huawei P50\n- House 2: Bob, Blue Master, Brown, OnePlus 9\n- House 3: Carol, Google Pixel 6, Blue, Prince, Purple\n- House 4: Arnold, Samsung Galaxy S21, White, Dunhill\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nFinal answer: <<<alice>>>"
