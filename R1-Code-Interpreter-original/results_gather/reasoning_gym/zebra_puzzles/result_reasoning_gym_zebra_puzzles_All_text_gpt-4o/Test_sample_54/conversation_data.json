    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. The person who smokes Blue Master is the coffee drinker.\n2. Alice is directly left of the boba tea drinker.\n3. The Prince smoker is the one who only drinks water.\n4. The coffee drinker is the Chinese.\n5. The British person is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n6. The person who smokes Blue Master is Carol.\n7. The boba tea drinker is the Dane.\n8. The person partial to Pall Mall is in the fourth house.\n9. Bob and the person who likes milk are next to each other.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know:\n\n- From clue 8, the person who smokes Pall Mall is in the fourth house. From clue 5, this person is British.\n- From clue 6, Carol smokes Blue Master. From clue 1, Carol drinks coffee. From clue 4, Carol is Chinese.\n- From clue 7, the boba tea drinker is the Dane.\n\nNow, let's place Carol:\n\n- Carol is Chinese, drinks coffee, and smokes Blue Master. She cannot be in house 4 (British), so she must be in house 3.\n\nNow, let's place the Dane:\n\n- The Dane drinks boba tea. From clue 2, Alice is directly left of the boba tea drinker. Therefore, Alice must be in house 2, and the Dane must be in house 3.\n\nNow, let's place the British person:\n\n- The British person is in house 4, smokes Pall Mall, and we don't know their drink yet.\n\nNow, let's place the Prince smoker:\n\n- From clue 3, the Prince smoker drinks water. Since house 3 is occupied by Carol (coffee drinker), and house 4 is occupied by the British person, the Prince smoker must be in house 1.\n\nNow, let's place Bob and the milk drinker:\n\n- From clue 9, Bob and the milk drinker are next to each other. Since house 3 is occupied by Carol and house 4 by the British person, Bob and the milk drinker must be in houses 1 and 2.\n\nSince house 1 is occupied by the Prince smoker (who drinks water), Bob must be in house 2, and the milk drinker must be in house 1.\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n\n- House 1: Bob, drinks water, smokes Prince, nationality unknown.\n- House 2: Alice, drinks milk, nationality unknown.\n- House 3: Carol, drinks coffee, smokes Blue Master, Chinese.\n- House 4: British, smokes Pall Mall, drink unknown.\n\nSince the Dane drinks boba tea and is in house 3, Bob must be the Dane.\n\nTherefore, the person in house 1 is Bob.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Bob>>>."
