    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Arnold is in the first house.** (Clue 6)\n   - House 1: Arnold\n\n2. **Arnold is the person who loves white.** (Clue 3)\n   - House 1: Arnold, White\n\n3. **The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the person who loves white.** (Clue 2)\n   - House 1: Arnold, White, Samsung Galaxy S21\n\n4. **The person who likes milk is Carol.** (Clue 4)\n   - Carol likes milk.\n\n5. **The person who likes milk is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.** (Clue 8)\n   - Carol uses a Google Pixel 6.\n\n6. **The person who loves purple is the person who uses a Huawei P50.** (Clue 1)\n   - Purple, Huawei P50\n\n7. **The boba tea drinker is the person who loves purple.** (Clue 9)\n   - Purple, Huawei P50, Boba Tea\n\n8. **The person who loves purple and the person who uses a Google Pixel 6 are next to each other.** (Clue 10)\n   - Since Carol uses a Google Pixel 6, she must be next to the person who loves purple.\n\n9. **The coffee drinker is directly left of Bob.** (Clue 5)\n   - Bob is not in House 1 because Arnold is there. Bob must be in House 3 or 4.\n\n10. **The person who loves blue is directly left of Bob.** (Clue 7)\n    - The person who loves blue must be in the house directly left of Bob.\n\nLet's try to place the remaining people and characteristics:\n\n- Since Arnold is in House 1, and Carol must be next to the person who loves purple, Carol cannot be in House 2. Therefore, Carol must be in House 3 or 4.\n- If Carol is in House 3, then the person who loves purple must be in House 2, and Bob must be in House 4.\n- If Carol is in House 4, then the person who loves purple must be in House 3, and Bob must be in House 2.\n\nLet's test the scenario where Carol is in House 3:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, White, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 2: Purple, Huawei P50, Boba Tea\n- House 3: Carol, Milk, Google Pixel 6\n- House 4: Bob\n\nIn this scenario:\n- The person who loves blue must be in House 3 (directly left of Bob in House 4), but Carol is in House 3 and loves milk, not blue. Therefore, this scenario is incorrect.\n\nNow, let's test the scenario where Carol is in House 4:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, White, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 2: Blue\n- House 3: Purple, Huawei P50, Boba Tea\n- House 4: Carol, Milk, Google Pixel 6\n\nIn this scenario:\n- Bob must be in House 3 (since the coffee drinker is directly left of Bob, and House 3 is directly left of House 4).\n- Therefore, the person who loves blue must be in House 2.\n\nFinal arrangement:\n- House 1: Arnold, White, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 2: Alice, Blue, Coffee\n- House 3: Bob, Purple, Huawei P50, Boba Tea\n- House 4: Carol, Milk, Google Pixel 6\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Arnold>>>."
