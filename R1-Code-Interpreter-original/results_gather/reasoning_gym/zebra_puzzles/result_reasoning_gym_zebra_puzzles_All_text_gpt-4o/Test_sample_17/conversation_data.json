    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of people, their favorite smoothies, drinks, and their children's names in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 1**: The Butterscotch smoothie drinker is Arnold.\n   - Arnold likes Butterscotch smoothie.\n\n2. **Clue 2**: The person who likes milk and the person's child is named Alice are next to each other.\n   - The person who likes milk is next to the person whose child is Alice.\n\n3. **Clue 3**: The Desert smoothie lover is directly left of Arnold.\n   - The person who likes Desert smoothie is in the house directly to the left of Arnold.\n\n4. **Clue 4**: Carol and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover are next to each other.\n   - Carol is next to the person who likes Dragonfruit smoothie.\n\n5. **Clue 5**: The person who is the mother of Billy is the coffee drinker.\n   - The coffee drinker is Billy's mother.\n\n6. **Clue 6**: The boba tea drinker is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n   - Arnold, who likes Butterscotch smoothie, also drinks boba tea.\n\n7. **Clue 7**: The coffee drinker is in the third house.\n   - The person in the third house drinks coffee.\n\n8. **Clue 8**: The Darkness smoothie drinker is in the third house.\n   - The person in the third house likes Darkness smoothie.\n\n9. **Clue 9**: The person's child is named Bella is the person who likes milk.\n   - The person who likes milk is Bella's parent.\n\n10. **Clue 10**: The person who likes milk is Bob.\n    - Bob likes milk.\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- From Clue 7 and Clue 8, the person in the third house drinks coffee and likes Darkness smoothie. From Clue 5, this person is Billy's mother. Therefore, the person in the third house is the coffee drinker, likes Darkness smoothie, and is Billy's mother.\n\n- From Clue 10, Bob likes milk. From Clue 9, Bob is Bella's parent. From Clue 2, Bob (who likes milk) is next to the person whose child is Alice.\n\n- From Clue 1 and Clue 6, Arnold likes Butterscotch smoothie and drinks boba tea. From Clue 3, the Desert smoothie lover is directly left of Arnold.\n\n- From Clue 4, Carol is next to the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n\nLet's place the people in the houses:\n\n- House 3: Coffee drinker, Darkness smoothie, Billy's mother. This person cannot be Bob (since Bob likes milk), so it must be Carol or Alice. Let's assume it's Carol for now.\n\n- House 2: Bob likes milk and is Bella's parent. Bob must be in House 2 because he is next to the person whose child is Alice (House 1 or 3).\n\n- House 4: Arnold likes Butterscotch smoothie and drinks boba tea. The Desert smoothie lover is directly left of Arnold, so Arnold must be in House 4.\n\n- House 1: The only person left is Alice. Alice must be in House 1, and Alice's child is named Alice (from Clue 2).\n\nNow, let's verify:\n\n- House 1: Alice, Desert smoothie (since directly left of Arnold), Alice's child.\n- House 2: Bob, Milk, Bella's parent.\n- House 3: Carol, Coffee, Darkness smoothie, Billy's mother.\n- House 4: Arnold, Butterscotch smoothie, Boba tea.\n\nEverything checks out with the clues. Therefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Alice>>>."
