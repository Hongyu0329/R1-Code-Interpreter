    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, their phone models, favorite cigars, and favorite colors in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the person who loves brown.**\n   - This means the Samsung Galaxy S21 user and the person who loves brown are the same.\n\n2. **Bob is directly left of Carol.**\n   - This means Bob is in a house immediately to the left of Carol's house.\n\n3. **The Prince smoker is directly left of the person who smokes Blue Master.**\n   - This means the Prince smoker's house is immediately to the left of the Blue Master smoker's house.\n\n4. **The person who uses a Huawei P50 is the person who loves blue.**\n   - This means the Huawei P50 user and the person who loves blue are the same.\n\n5. **The Dunhill smoker is the person who loves white.**\n   - This means the Dunhill smoker and the person who loves white are the same.\n\n6. **The person who loves blue is in the second house.**\n   - This places the person who loves blue (and uses a Huawei P50) in House 2.\n\n7. **Bob is the person who loves brown.**\n   - This means Bob is the Samsung Galaxy S21 user and is in the house with the brown color.\n\n8. **The person partial to Pall Mall is directly left of the person who uses a OnePlus 9.**\n   - This means the Pall Mall smoker's house is immediately to the left of the OnePlus 9 user's house.\n\n9. **The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is Alice.**\n   - This places Alice in the house with the OnePlus 9.\n\nNow, let's use these clues to determine the arrangement:\n\n- From clue 6, the person who loves blue is in House 2, and from clue 4, this person uses a Huawei P50.\n- From clue 7, Bob loves brown and uses a Samsung Galaxy S21. Since the person who loves blue is in House 2, Bob must be in House 1.\n- From clue 2, Bob is directly left of Carol, so Carol must be in House 2.\n- From clue 9, Alice uses a OnePlus 9. From clue 8, the Pall Mall smoker is directly left of Alice. Therefore, Alice must be in House 3, and the Pall Mall smoker must be in House 2.\n- This leaves House 4 for Arnold.\n- From clue 5, the Dunhill smoker loves white. Since House 2 is blue, House 1 is brown, and House 3 is not white (as Alice is there), House 4 must be white, and Arnold must be the Dunhill smoker.\n- From clue 3, the Prince smoker is directly left of the Blue Master smoker. Since House 2 is blue and House 3 is Alice's, the Prince smoker must be in House 3, and the Blue Master smoker must be in House 4.\n\nNow, we have:\n- House 1: Bob, Samsung Galaxy S21, Brown\n- House 2: Carol, Huawei P50, Blue, Pall Mall\n- House 3: Alice, OnePlus 9, Prince\n- House 4: Arnold, Dunhill, White, Blue Master\n\nThe person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<bob>>>."
