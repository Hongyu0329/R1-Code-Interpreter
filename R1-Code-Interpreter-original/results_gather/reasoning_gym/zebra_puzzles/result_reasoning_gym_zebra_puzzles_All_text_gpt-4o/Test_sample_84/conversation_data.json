    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the characteristics of each person in each house. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Clue 6**: Carol is in the second house.\n   - House 2: Carol\n\n2. **Clue 7**: Carol uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n   - House 2: Carol, Samsung Galaxy S21\n\n3. **Clue 8**: Arnold is in the third house.\n   - House 3: Arnold\n\n4. **Clue 9**: The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 and Bob are next to each other.\n   - Since Carol is in House 2 and uses a Samsung Galaxy S21, the Google Pixel 6 user must be in either House 1 or House 3. Bob must be in the house next to the Google Pixel 6 user.\n\n5. **Clue 3**: The cat lover is Alice.\n   - Alice is the cat lover.\n\n6. **Clue 4**: The cat lover is the one who only drinks water.\n   - Alice drinks water.\n\n7. **Clue 5**: The person who likes milk and the bird keeper are next to each other.\n   - This means the milk drinker and the bird keeper are in adjacent houses.\n\n8. **Clue 1**: The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is the coffee drinker.\n   - The OnePlus 9 user drinks coffee.\n\n9. **Clue 2**: The boba tea drinker is the fish enthusiast.\n   - The boba tea drinker keeps fish.\n\nNow, let's place these clues into the houses:\n\n- **House 2**: Carol, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- **House 3**: Arnold\n\nSince Alice is the cat lover and drinks water, she cannot be in House 2 or House 3. Therefore, Alice must be in House 1 or House 4.\n\n- If Alice is in House 1, then:\n  - House 1: Alice, Cat, Water\n  - House 2: Carol, Samsung Galaxy S21\n  - House 3: Arnold\n  - House 4: Bob (since Bob must be next to the Google Pixel 6 user, and House 4 is the only option left for Bob)\n\n- If Alice is in House 4, then:\n  - House 4: Alice, Cat, Water\n  - House 2: Carol, Samsung Galaxy S21\n  - House 3: Arnold\n  - House 1: Bob (since Bob must be next to the Google Pixel 6 user, and House 1 is the only option left for Bob)\n\nHowever, placing Alice in House 4 would mean Bob is in House 1, and the Google Pixel 6 user would have to be in House 2 or House 3, which is not possible because Carol is in House 2 and Arnold is in House 3. Therefore, Alice must be in House 1.\n\nThus, the configuration is:\n- **House 1**: Alice, Cat, Water\n- **House 2**: Carol, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- **House 3**: Arnold\n- **House 4**: Bob\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Alice>>>"
