    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The person who loves white is in the first house.**\n   - House 1: White\n\n2. **The Prince smoker is the person who loves eating grilled cheese.**\n   - Prince = Grilled Cheese\n\n3. **The person who loves stir fry is directly left of the person who loves brown.**\n   - Since there are only four houses, the person who loves brown cannot be in House 1. Therefore, the person who loves stir fry must be in House 3, and the person who loves brown must be in House 4.\n\n4. **Alice is the person who loves stir fry.**\n   - House 3: Alice, Stir Fry\n\n5. **The person who loves eating grilled cheese and the person who smokes Blue Master are next to each other.**\n   - Since Alice is in House 3, the person who loves grilled cheese must be in House 2, and the person who smokes Blue Master must be in House 3 or House 4.\n\n6. **The Dunhill smoker is the person who loves the soup.**\n   - Dunhill = Soup\n\n7. **Bob is the person who loves brown.**\n   - House 4: Bob, Brown\n\n8. **The person who loves blue is the person who loves the soup.**\n   - Since the person who loves brown is in House 4, the person who loves blue must be in House 2 or House 3. However, since Alice is in House 3 and loves stir fry, the person who loves blue and soup must be in House 2.\n\n9. **Arnold is the person who smokes Blue Master.**\n   - Since the person who smokes Blue Master is next to the person who loves grilled cheese (House 2), Arnold must be in House 3.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information:\n\n- House 1: White\n- House 2: Grilled Cheese, Blue, Soup, Prince\n- House 3: Alice, Stir Fry, Arnold, Blue Master\n- House 4: Bob, Brown\n\nSince House 1 is the only house left without a name, and the only name left is Carol, Carol must be in House 1.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<carol>>>."
