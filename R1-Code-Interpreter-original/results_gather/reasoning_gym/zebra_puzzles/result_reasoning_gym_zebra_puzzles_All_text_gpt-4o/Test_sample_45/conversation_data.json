    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of people, phones, smoothies, and children in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 5**: Bob is in the third house.\n   - House 3: Bob\n\n2. **Clue 10**: The person's child named Alice is in the first house.\n   - House 1: Child is Alice\n\n3. **Clue 8**: The person's child named Alice is Arnold.\n   - House 1: Arnold, Child is Alice\n\n4. **Clue 9**: Arnold is the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n   - House 1: Arnold, Huawei P50, Child is Alice\n\n5. **Clue 7**: Alice is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n   - Since Arnold is in House 1 and Alice is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker, Arnold cannot be Alice. Therefore, Alice must be in another house.\n\n6. **Clue 1**: The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n   - Alice uses a OnePlus 9.\n\n7. **Clue 3**: The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n   - Since Bob is in House 3, Alice must be in House 2 (because House 4 is to the right of House 3, and House 1 is already occupied by Arnold).\n   - House 2: Alice, OnePlus 9, Butterscotch\n\n8. **Clue 6**: The person's child named Bella is directly left of Alice.\n   - House 1: Arnold, Huawei P50, Child is Alice\n   - House 2: Alice, OnePlus 9, Butterscotch\n   - House 3: Bob, Child is Bella\n\n9. **Clue 4**: The Dragonfruit smoothie lover's child is named Alice.\n   - Arnold (House 1) is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n\n10. **Clue 2**: The person who is the mother of Timothy is the Desert smoothie lover.\n    - Since Bob is in House 3 and his child is Bella, Bob cannot be the mother of Timothy.\n    - Therefore, the mother of Timothy must be in House 4.\n\n11. **Remaining Assignments**:\n    - House 4: Carol (since Arnold, Alice, and Bob are already assigned), Samsung Galaxy S21, Desert, Child is Timothy\n\nNow, we have the following arrangement:\n- House 1: Arnold, Huawei P50, Dragonfruit, Child is Alice\n- House 2: Alice, OnePlus 9, Butterscotch\n- House 3: Bob, Child is Bella\n- House 4: Carol, Samsung Galaxy S21, Desert, Child is Timothy\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<Arnold>>>"
