    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The Desert smoothie lover is Alice.**\n   - Alice loves the Desert smoothie.\n\n2. **The Darkness smoothie drinker is directly left of the person who loves the bouquet of lilies.**\n   - This means the Darkness smoothie drinker is in a house number that is one less than the house of the person who loves lilies.\n\n3. **The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is Bob.**\n   - Bob loves lilies.\n\n4. **Carol is in the first house.**\n   - Carol is in House 1.\n\n5. **The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is in the first house.**\n   - Since Carol is in House 1, Carol loves daffodils.\n\n6. **The Desert smoothie lover is directly left of the Chinese.**\n   - Alice, who loves the Desert smoothie, is directly left of the Chinese person.\n\n7. **The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is the Dane.**\n   - Since Carol loves daffodils, Carol is the Dane.\n\n8. **The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is the person who loves a carnations arrangement.**\n   - The person who loves Dragonfruit also loves carnations.\n\n9. **The Darkness smoothie drinker is directly left of the German.**\n   - The Darkness smoothie drinker is in a house number that is one less than the house of the German.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- From clue 4 and 5, we know Carol is in House 1 and loves daffodils, and from clue 7, Carol is the Dane.\n- From clue 1, Alice loves the Desert smoothie.\n- From clue 6, Alice is directly left of the Chinese, so Alice cannot be in House 4.\n- From clue 3, Bob loves lilies, and from clue 2, the Darkness smoothie drinker is directly left of Bob.\n- From clue 9, the Darkness smoothie drinker is directly left of the German.\n\nLet's place the people:\n\n- House 1: Carol (Dane, Daffodils)\n- House 2: Alice (Desert smoothie)\n- House 3: Bob (Lilies)\n- House 4: The Chinese (since Alice is directly left of the Chinese)\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining characteristics:\n\n- Since the Darkness smoothie drinker is directly left of Bob (House 3), the Darkness smoothie drinker must be in House 2.\n- Therefore, Alice drinks the Darkness smoothie, which contradicts clue 1. So, Alice must be in House 3, and Bob must be in House 4.\n- Therefore, the Chinese is in House 4, and the German is in House 3.\n- The Darkness smoothie drinker is in House 2, and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in House 1.\n\nFinal arrangement:\n- House 1: Carol (Dane, Daffodils, Dragonfruit, Carnations)\n- House 2: Arnold (Darkness)\n- House 3: Alice (Desert, German)\n- House 4: Bob (Lilies, Chinese)\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Carol>>>."
