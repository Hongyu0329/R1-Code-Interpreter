    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The person who loves the bouquet of iris is directly left of Arnold.**\n   - This means Arnold cannot be in House 1, as there is no house to the left of House 1.\n\n2. **The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the person who loves the bouquet of lilies.**\n   - This links the Samsung Galaxy S21 user with the lilies lover.\n\n3. **The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is Carol.**\n   - Carol loves daffodils.\n\n4. **The person who uses a Huawei P50 and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover are next to each other.**\n   - These two people are in adjacent houses.\n\n5. **Alice is the Desert smoothie lover.**\n   - Alice's favorite smoothie is Desert.\n\n6. **The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is in the second house.**\n   - The OnePlus 9 user is in House 2.\n\n7. **The person who loves a carnations arrangement is in the fourth house.**\n   - The carnations lover is in House 4.\n\n8. **The Darkness smoothie drinker is directly left of the person who loves a carnations arrangement.**\n   - The Darkness smoothie lover is in House 3, as they are directly left of the carnations lover in House 4.\n\n9. **The person who uses a Huawei P50 is the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.**\n   - The Huawei P50 user is Carol, who loves daffodils.\n\nNow, let's place these pieces of information:\n\n- **House 4**: Carnations lover.\n- **House 3**: Darkness smoothie lover (directly left of House 4).\n- **House 2**: OnePlus 9 user.\n- **Carol**: Loves daffodils and uses Huawei P50.\n\nFrom clue 9, Carol uses the Huawei P50 and loves daffodils. Since the Huawei P50 user and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover are next to each other, and Carol cannot be in House 4 (as she loves daffodils, not carnations), Carol must be in House 1 or House 3.\n\n- If Carol is in House 1, then the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in House 2.\n- If Carol is in House 3, then the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in House 4, which is not possible because House 4 is the carnations lover.\n\nTherefore, Carol must be in House 1, and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in House 2.\n\nNow, let's fill in the rest:\n\n- **House 1**: Carol (Daffodils, Huawei P50)\n- **House 2**: OnePlus 9 user, Dragonfruit smoothie lover\n- **House 3**: Darkness smoothie lover\n- **House 4**: Carnations lover\n\nSince Alice is the Desert smoothie lover, and the Darkness smoothie lover is in House 3, Alice cannot be in House 3. Therefore, Alice must be in House 2.\n\n- **House 2**: Alice (Desert smoothie, OnePlus 9, Dragonfruit smoothie lover)\n\nArnold cannot be in House 1 (as the iris lover is directly left of him), so Arnold must be in House 3.\n\n- **House 3**: Arnold (Darkness smoothie)\n\nFinally, Bob must be in House 4.\n\n- **House 4**: Bob (Carnations)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- **House 1**: Carol (Daffodils, Huawei P50)\n- **House 2**: Alice (Desert smoothie, OnePlus 9)\n- **House 3**: Arnold (Darkness smoothie)\n- **House 4**: Bob (Carnations)\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Carol>>>."
