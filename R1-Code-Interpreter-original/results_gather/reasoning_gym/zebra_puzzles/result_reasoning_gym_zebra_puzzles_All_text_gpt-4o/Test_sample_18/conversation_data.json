    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of people, their children, favorite flowers, and favorite colors in the four houses.\n\n1. **Arnold is the person's child is named Bella.**\n   - Arnold's child is Bella.\n\n2. **The person who loves purple is the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.**\n   - Purple and daffodils go together.\n\n3. **Bob is the person who loves a carnations arrangement.**\n   - Bob loves carnations.\n\n4. **Carol is directly left of the person who loves white.**\n   - Carol is in a house immediately to the left of the person who loves white.\n\n5. **Arnold is in the first house.**\n   - Arnold is in House 1.\n\n6. **The person who loves white is in the third house.**\n   - White is in House 3.\n\n7. **The person who loves white is the person who is the mother of Billy.**\n   - The person in House 3 is Billy's mother.\n\n8. **The person who loves brown is in the second house.**\n   - Brown is in House 2.\n\n9. **The person who loves purple and the person's child is named Alice are next to each other.**\n   - Purple and Alice's mother are in adjacent houses.\n\n10. **The person who loves blue is the person who loves the bouquet of iris.**\n    - Blue and iris go together.\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- **House 1:** Arnold, child is Bella.\n- **House 2:** Loves brown.\n- **House 3:** Loves white, mother of Billy.\n- **House 4:** By elimination, this house must be the one with the remaining characteristics.\n\nFrom clues 4 and 6, Carol must be in House 2, because she is directly left of the person who loves white (House 3).\n\nFrom clue 3, Bob loves carnations, so he cannot be in House 2 (brown) or House 3 (white). Therefore, Bob must be in House 4.\n\nSince Bob is in House 4, and Arnold is in House 1, the only remaining house for Carol is House 2. Therefore, Alice must be in House 3.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining characteristics:\n\n- **House 1:** Arnold, child is Bella, loves lilies (since carnations, daffodils, and iris are taken).\n- **House 2:** Carol, loves brown, child is Timothy (since Billy and Alice are taken).\n- **House 3:** Alice, loves white, mother of Billy.\n- **House 4:** Bob, loves carnations, loves blue and iris (from clue 10).\n\nFinally, from clue 9, the person who loves purple and the person's child is named Alice are next to each other. Since Alice is in House 3, the person who loves purple must be in House 2 (Carol).\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Arnold>>>."
