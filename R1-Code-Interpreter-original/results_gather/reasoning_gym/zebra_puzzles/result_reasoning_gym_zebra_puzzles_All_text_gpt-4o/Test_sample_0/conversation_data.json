    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and determine the arrangement of people, cigars, flowers, and colors in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 2**: Arnold is the Prince smoker.\n2. **Clue 4**: Arnold loves daffodils.\n3. **Clue 8**: The person who loves daffodils is directly left of Alice. Therefore, Arnold is directly left of Alice.\n4. **Clue 10**: Carol loves white.\n5. **Clue 3**: The person who loves white is the Dunhill smoker. Therefore, Carol is the Dunhill smoker.\n6. **Clue 7**: The person who loves carnations is the Dunhill smoker. Therefore, Carol loves carnations.\n7. **Clue 1**: Bob and the person who loves brown are next to each other.\n8. **Clue 5**: The person who smokes Blue Master is in the fourth house.\n9. **Clue 6**: The person who loves iris is in the fourth house. Therefore, the person in the fourth house smokes Blue Master and loves iris.\n10. **Clue 9**: The person who smokes Pall Mall loves blue.\n\nNow, let's place these clues into the houses:\n\n- **House 4**: The person smokes Blue Master and loves iris. This person cannot be Arnold (since Arnold smokes Prince and loves daffodils), Carol (since Carol smokes Dunhill and loves carnations), or Alice (since Alice is to the right of Arnold). Therefore, the person in House 4 must be Bob.\n\n- **House 3**: Since Arnold is directly left of Alice, Arnold must be in House 3, and Alice must be in House 4.\n\n- **House 2**: Since Carol loves white and is the Dunhill smoker, and Arnold is in House 3, Carol must be in House 2.\n\n- **House 1**: The only person left is Bob, who must be in House 1.\n\nNow, let's verify the arrangement:\n\n- **House 1**: Bob, who loves brown (since Bob and the person who loves brown are next to each other).\n- **House 2**: Carol, who loves white, smokes Dunhill, and loves carnations.\n- **House 3**: Arnold, who smokes Prince and loves daffodils.\n- **House 4**: Alice, who smokes Blue Master and loves iris.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Bob>>>."
