    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and determine the arrangement of people, their children, favorite flowers, and favorite colors in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 1**: The person who loves carnations also loves white.\n2. **Clue 2**: Arnold is directly left of the person whose child is named Alice.\n3. **Clue 3**: The person who loves brown has a child named Bella.\n4. **Clue 4**: The person who loves blue is directly left of the person whose child is named Alice.\n5. **Clue 5**: The mother of Billy loves lilies.\n6. **Clue 6**: Alice is the mother of Billy.\n7. **Clue 7**: The person who loves iris is in the third house.\n8. **Clue 8**: The mother of Billy is directly left of the person who loves iris.\n9. **Clue 9**: Bob's child is named Alice.\n\nLet's analyze these clues step by step:\n\n- From **Clue 6**, Alice is the mother of Billy.\n- From **Clue 5**, Alice loves lilies.\n- From **Clue 8**, Alice (mother of Billy) is directly left of the person who loves iris.\n- From **Clue 7**, the person who loves iris is in the third house. Therefore, Alice must be in the second house.\n- From **Clue 9**, Bob's child is named Alice. Therefore, Bob is in the fourth house (since Alice is in the second house and Bob is directly right of Arnold).\n- From **Clue 2**, Arnold is directly left of Bob. Therefore, Arnold is in the third house.\n- From **Clue 4**, the person who loves blue is directly left of Bob. Therefore, the person in the third house (Arnold) loves blue.\n- From **Clue 3**, the person who loves brown has a child named Bella. Since Bob is in the fourth house and his child is Alice, the person in the first house must love brown and have a child named Bella.\n- From **Clue 1**, the person who loves carnations also loves white. Since the person in the first house loves brown, the person in the fourth house (Bob) must love carnations and white.\n\nNow, we have the following arrangement:\n- House 1: Loves brown, child is Bella.\n- House 2: Alice, loves lilies, mother of Billy.\n- House 3: Arnold, loves blue.\n- House 4: Bob, loves carnations and white, child is Alice.\n\nThe only name left for the person in House 1 is Carol.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Carol>>>."
