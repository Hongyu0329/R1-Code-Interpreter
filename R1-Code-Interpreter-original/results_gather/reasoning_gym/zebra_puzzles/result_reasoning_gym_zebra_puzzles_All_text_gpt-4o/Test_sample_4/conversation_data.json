    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to determine the arrangement of people, their nationalities, drinks, and smoothies in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Alice is directly left of Carol.**\n   - This means Alice is in House 1, 2, or 3, and Carol is in House 2, 3, or 4.\n\n2. **The boba tea drinker is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.**\n   - This links the drink and smoothie to one person.\n\n3. **The boba tea drinker is the German.**\n   - This links the drink, smoothie, and nationality to one person.\n\n4. **The Darkness smoothie drinker is the Dane.**\n   - This links the smoothie and nationality to one person.\n\n5. **Alice is the British person.**\n   - This gives us Alice's nationality.\n\n6. **The person who likes milk is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.**\n   - This links the drink and smoothie to one person.\n\n7. **The Darkness smoothie drinker is in the second house.**\n   - This places the Dane in House 2.\n\n8. **Bob is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.**\n   - This links Bob to the boba tea drinker and the German.\n\n9. **The one who only drinks water is directly left of the Desert smoothie lover.**\n   - This gives a positional relationship between two people.\n\n10. **Carol is the Darkness smoothie drinker.**\n    - This places Carol in House 2, as the Darkness smoothie drinker is in House 2.\n\nNow, let's use these clues to fill in the details:\n\n- From clues 1 and 10, Alice is directly left of Carol, and Carol is in House 2. Therefore, Alice is in House 1.\n- From clue 5, Alice is the British person.\n- From clue 4 and 10, Carol is the Dane and drinks the Darkness smoothie.\n- From clue 8, Bob is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker, and from clue 3, Bob is the German and drinks boba tea.\n- Since Bob is the German and drinks boba tea, he cannot be in House 1 or 2. Therefore, Bob must be in House 3 or 4.\n- From clue 9, the person who drinks water is directly left of the Desert smoothie lover. Since Alice is in House 1, she must drink water, and the Desert smoothie lover must be in House 2 or 3.\n- Since Carol is in House 2 and drinks the Darkness smoothie, the Desert smoothie lover must be in House 3.\n- Therefore, Bob, who drinks boba tea and is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker, must be in House 3.\n- This leaves House 4 for the remaining person, Arnold, who must be the Chinese person.\n- From clue 6, the person who likes milk is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover. Since Bob is in House 3 and drinks boba tea, Arnold in House 4 must drink milk and love the Dragonfruit smoothie.\n\nNow, we have:\n- House 1: Alice, British, drinks water, unknown smoothie\n- House 2: Carol, Dane, drinks unknown, Darkness smoothie\n- House 3: Bob, German, drinks boba tea, Butterscotch smoothie\n- House 4: Arnold, Chinese, drinks milk, Dragonfruit smoothie\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Alice>>>."
