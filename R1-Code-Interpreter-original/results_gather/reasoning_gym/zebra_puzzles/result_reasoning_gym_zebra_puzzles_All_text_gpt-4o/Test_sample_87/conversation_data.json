    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, their children, favorite smoothies, and lunch preferences in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Clue 4**: Arnold loves the soup.\n2. **Clue 1**: The person who loves the soup is directly left of the Darkness smoothie drinker. Therefore, Arnold is directly left of the Darkness smoothie drinker.\n3. **Clue 5**: Carol is directly left of the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n4. **Clue 6**: The person whose child is named Bella is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n5. **Clue 10**: The pizza lover is directly left of the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n6. **Clue 7**: The Desert smoothie lover and the Darkness smoothie drinker are next to each other.\n7. **Clue 2**: Bob is the mother of Timothy.\n8. **Clue 8**: Bob is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n9. **Clue 9**: Bob loves stir fry.\n10. **Clue 3**: The mother of Billy is in the third house.\n\nLet's start placing these clues:\n\n- Since Bob is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker and loves stir fry, and is the mother of Timothy, we can place Bob in one of the houses.\n- Bob cannot be in house 3 because the mother of Billy is in house 3.\n- Bob cannot be in house 1 because Arnold (soup lover) must be directly left of the Darkness smoothie drinker, and Bob's smoothie is Butterscotch.\n- Therefore, Bob must be in house 2 or 4.\n\nLet's assume Bob is in house 2:\n- Bob (house 2): Butterscotch, Stir Fry, Timothy\n- House 3: Mother of Billy\n- House 1: Arnold (soup lover)\n- House 4: Darkness smoothie drinker\n\nNow, let's place Carol:\n- Carol is directly left of the Dragonfruit smoothie lover (Clue 5).\n- The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is also the mother of Bella (Clue 6).\n- The pizza lover is directly left of the Dragonfruit smoothie lover (Clue 10).\n\nIf Carol is in house 1, then:\n- House 1: Carol\n- House 2: Bob\n- House 3: Mother of Billy\n- House 4: Dragonfruit smoothie lover (mother of Bella)\n\nThis doesn't work because Arnold (soup lover) must be in house 1, and Carol cannot be in house 1.\n\nIf Carol is in house 2, then:\n- House 1: Arnold (soup lover)\n- House 2: Carol\n- House 3: Mother of Billy\n- House 4: Dragonfruit smoothie lover (mother of Bella)\n\nThis doesn't work because Bob is in house 2.\n\nIf Carol is in house 3, then:\n- House 1: Arnold (soup lover)\n- House 2: Bob\n- House 3: Carol\n- House 4: Dragonfruit smoothie lover (mother of Bella)\n\nThis works because:\n- Arnold (soup lover) is directly left of the Darkness smoothie drinker (house 4).\n- Carol is directly left of the Dragonfruit smoothie lover (house 4).\n- The pizza lover (house 3) is directly left of the Dragonfruit smoothie lover (house 4).\n\nNow, let's finalize the arrangement:\n- House 1: Arnold (soup lover)\n- House 2: Bob (Butterscotch, Stir Fry, Timothy)\n- House 3: Carol (pizza lover, mother of Billy)\n- House 4: Dragonfruit smoothie lover (mother of Bella)\n\nThe only person left is Alice, who must be in house 4.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Arnold>>>."
