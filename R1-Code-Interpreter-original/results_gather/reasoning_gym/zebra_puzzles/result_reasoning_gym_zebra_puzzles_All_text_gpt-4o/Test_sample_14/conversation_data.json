    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, their favorite drinks, phone models, and pets in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Bob is the coffee drinker.**\n   - Bob drinks coffee.\n\n2. **The fish enthusiast and the person who uses a OnePlus 9 are next to each other.**\n   - These two people are in adjacent houses.\n\n3. **Alice is the person who likes milk.**\n   - Alice drinks milk.\n\n4. **The bird keeper is Carol.**\n   - Carol keeps birds.\n\n5. **The bird keeper and the person who uses a Google Pixel 6 are next to each other.**\n   - Carol and the Google Pixel 6 user are in adjacent houses.\n\n6. **The fish enthusiast is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.**\n   - The fish enthusiast uses a Google Pixel 6.\n\n7. **The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is directly left of the boba tea drinker.**\n   - The Samsung Galaxy S21 user is immediately to the left of the boba tea drinker.\n\n8. **The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the one who only drinks water.**\n   - The Samsung Galaxy S21 user drinks water.\n\n9. **The bird keeper is in the first house.**\n   - Carol is in House 1.\n\n10. **The fish enthusiast and the cat lover are next to each other.**\n    - These two people are in adjacent houses.\n\n11. **The person who likes milk is in the third house.**\n    - Alice is in House 3.\n\nNow, let's use these clues to fill in the details:\n\n- **House 1:** Carol (bird keeper)\n- **House 3:** Alice (milk drinker)\n\nFrom clue 9, Carol is in House 1. From clue 11, Alice is in House 3.\n\nSince Carol is in House 1, and she is the bird keeper, the Google Pixel 6 user (fish enthusiast) must be in House 2 (clue 5 and 6).\n\n- **House 2:** Google Pixel 6 user (fish enthusiast)\n\nFrom clue 7 and 8, the Samsung Galaxy S21 user drinks water and is directly left of the boba tea drinker. Since Alice is in House 3, the Samsung Galaxy S21 user must be in House 2, and the boba tea drinker must be in House 3.\n\n- **House 2:** Samsung Galaxy S21 user (water drinker)\n- **House 3:** Alice (milk drinker, boba tea drinker)\n\nSince the fish enthusiast is in House 2, and they use a Google Pixel 6, the cat lover must be in House 3 or House 4 (clue 10).\n\nBob, the coffee drinker, must be in House 4, as Alice is in House 3 and Carol is in House 1.\n\n- **House 4:** Bob (coffee drinker)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- **House 1:** Carol (bird keeper)\n- **House 2:** Samsung Galaxy S21 user (water drinker, fish enthusiast, Google Pixel 6 user)\n- **House 3:** Alice (milk drinker, boba tea drinker)\n- **House 4:** Bob (coffee drinker)\n\nSince the fish enthusiast is in House 2, and they use a Google Pixel 6, the cat lover must be in House 3 or House 4. Since Alice is in House 3, the cat lover must be in House 4.\n\nTherefore, the person in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Carol>>>."
