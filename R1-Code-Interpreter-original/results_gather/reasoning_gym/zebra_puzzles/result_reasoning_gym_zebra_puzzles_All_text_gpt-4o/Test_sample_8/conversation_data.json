    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and preferences of each person. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The person who loves stir fry is Arnold.**\n   - Arnold loves stir fry.\n\n2. **The person who loves stir fry is the person who likes milk.**\n   - Arnold likes milk.\n\n3. **Alice is in the second house.**\n   - Alice is in House 2.\n\n4. **Bob and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover are next to each other.**\n   - Bob is next to the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n\n5. **The person who is a pizza lover is the one who only drinks water.**\n   - Pizza lover drinks water.\n\n6. **The Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in the third house.**\n   - Butterscotch smoothie is in House 3.\n\n7. **Arnold is in the third house.**\n   - Arnold is in House 3.\n\n8. **The person who loves eating grilled cheese is directly left of the boba tea drinker.**\n   - Grilled cheese is directly left of boba tea.\n\n9. **The Desert smoothie lover is in the first house.**\n   - Desert smoothie is in House 1.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- From clues 6 and 7, Arnold is in House 3 and loves Butterscotch smoothie.\n- From clue 3, Alice is in House 2.\n- From clue 9, the Desert smoothie lover is in House 1.\n- From clue 5, the pizza lover drinks water. Since Arnold drinks milk, the pizza lover is not Arnold.\n- From clue 4, Bob is next to the Dragonfruit smoothie lover. Since Arnold is in House 3, Bob must be in House 2 or 4.\n- From clue 8, the grilled cheese lover is directly left of the boba tea drinker. This means the grilled cheese lover cannot be in House 4.\n\nLet's assign the remaining positions:\n\n- House 1: Desert smoothie lover (not Arnold, not Alice, not Butterscotch, not Dragonfruit)\n- House 2: Alice (unknown smoothie, unknown lunch, unknown drink)\n- House 3: Arnold (Butterscotch smoothie, stir fry, milk)\n- House 4: Bob or Dragonfruit smoothie lover\n\nSince Alice is in House 2 and Arnold is in House 3, Bob must be in House 4. Therefore, the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in House 2.\n\n- House 1: Carol (Desert smoothie, unknown lunch, unknown drink)\n- House 2: Alice (Dragonfruit smoothie, unknown lunch, unknown drink)\n- House 3: Arnold (Butterscotch smoothie, stir fry, milk)\n- House 4: Bob (unknown smoothie, unknown lunch, unknown drink)\n\nFrom clue 5, the pizza lover drinks water. Since Arnold drinks milk, Bob must drink water and love pizza.\n\n- House 1: Carol (Desert smoothie, unknown lunch, unknown drink)\n- House 2: Alice (Dragonfruit smoothie, unknown lunch, unknown drink)\n- House 3: Arnold (Butterscotch smoothie, stir fry, milk)\n- House 4: Bob (unknown smoothie, pizza, water)\n\nFrom clue 8, the grilled cheese lover is directly left of the boba tea drinker. Since Bob is in House 4, the boba tea drinker must be in House 4, and the grilled cheese lover must be in House 3.\n\n- House 1: Carol (Desert smoothie, soup, boba tea)\n- House 2: Alice (Dragonfruit smoothie, grilled cheese, coffee)\n- House 3: Arnold (Butterscotch smoothie, stir fry, milk)\n- House 4: Bob (unknown smoothie, pizza, water)\n\nFinally, since Carol is the only one left for House 1, and she loves the Desert smoothie, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Carol>>>."
