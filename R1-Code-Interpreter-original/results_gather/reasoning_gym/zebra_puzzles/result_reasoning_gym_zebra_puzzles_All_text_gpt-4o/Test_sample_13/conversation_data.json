    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of people, their nationalities, drinks, and lunch preferences in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 1**: The coffee drinker is the German.\n2. **Clue 2**: The person who is a pizza lover is the one who only drinks water.\n3. **Clue 3**: The Dane is in the second house.\n4. **Clue 4**: Bob is the person who loves the soup.\n5. **Clue 5**: Carol is the person who loves stir fry.\n6. **Clue 6**: The one who only drinks water is in the second house.\n7. **Clue 7**: The Dane and the person who loves eating grilled cheese are next to each other.\n8. **Clue 8**: The boba tea drinker is Arnold.\n9. **Clue 9**: The Chinese is directly left of the British person.\n10. **Clue 10**: The coffee drinker is Bob.\n\nLet's analyze these clues step by step:\n\n- From **Clue 6**, the person who drinks water is in the second house.\n- From **Clue 2**, the person who drinks water is also the pizza lover.\n- From **Clue 3**, the Dane is in the second house.\n- Therefore, the Dane drinks water and loves pizza.\n\n- From **Clue 7**, the Dane (House 2) and the person who loves grilled cheese are next to each other. Therefore, the grilled cheese lover is in either House 1 or House 3.\n\n- From **Clue 10**, Bob is the coffee drinker and is also the German (from Clue 1). Therefore, Bob is not in House 2. Bob must be in House 3 or 4.\n\n- From **Clue 4**, Bob loves soup. Therefore, Bob is in House 3 or 4.\n\n- From **Clue 5**, Carol loves stir fry. Carol is not in House 2. Carol must be in House 1 or 4.\n\n- From **Clue 8**, Arnold drinks boba tea. Arnold is not in House 2. Arnold must be in House 1 or 4.\n\n- From **Clue 9**, the Chinese is directly left of the British person. Therefore, the Chinese person cannot be in House 4.\n\nNow, let's try to place the people:\n\n- Since the Dane is in House 2, and Bob (German, coffee, soup) is not in House 2, Bob must be in House 3 or 4. Since Bob drinks coffee, he cannot be in House 2 (water drinker).\n\n- If Bob is in House 3, then House 4 must be the British person (since the Chinese is directly left of the British person). This means House 3 is the German (Bob, coffee, soup).\n\n- If Carol is in House 1, then Arnold must be in House 4 (since Arnold drinks boba tea and is not in House 2).\n\n- Therefore, House 1 is Carol (stir fry), House 2 is the Dane (water, pizza), House 3 is Bob (German, coffee, soup), and House 4 is Arnold (boba tea).\n\n- The Chinese person must be in House 3 (left of the British person in House 4).\n\nThus, the person in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Carol>>>."
