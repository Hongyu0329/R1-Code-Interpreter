    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 7**: The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is Alice. This means Alice uses a Google Pixel 6.\n\n2. **Clue 8**: The person who is the mother of Timothy is in the fourth house. So, Timothy's mother is in House 4.\n\n3. **Clue 9**: The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the mother of Billy. This means Billy's mother uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n\n4. **Clue 5**: Alice is directly left of the person who uses a OnePlus 9. Since Alice uses a Google Pixel 6, the person with the OnePlus 9 must be in the house directly to the right of Alice.\n\n5. **Clue 1**: The person who loves the bouquet of lilies uses a OnePlus 9. Therefore, the person who loves lilies is in the house directly to the right of Alice.\n\n6. **Clue 4**: The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is directly left of the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils. This means the person who loves daffodils is in the house directly to the right of the person who loves lilies.\n\n7. **Clue 3**: The person who loves the bouquet of iris and the person who loves the bouquet of lilies are next to each other. This means the person who loves iris is in the house directly to the left or right of the person who loves lilies.\n\n8. **Clue 6**: Arnold is directly left of Carol. This means Arnold is in the house directly to the left of Carol.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- Since Alice uses a Google Pixel 6 and is directly left of the person with a OnePlus 9, Alice cannot be in House 4. Alice must be in House 1, 2, or 3.\n\n- If Alice is in House 1, then the person with the OnePlus 9 is in House 2, and the person who loves daffodils is in House 3. This would mean the person who loves iris is in House 1 or 3, but since Alice is in House 1, the person who loves iris must be in House 3.\n\n- Since Arnold is directly left of Carol, and Alice is in House 1, Arnold must be in House 2, and Carol must be in House 3.\n\n- Therefore, Alice is in House 1, Arnold is in House 2, Carol is in House 3, and the mother of Timothy is in House 4.\n\n- Since the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the mother of Billy, and the mother of Timothy is in House 4, the mother of Billy must be in House 4.\n\n- The person who loves lilies is in House 2 (OnePlus 9), the person who loves iris is in House 3, and the person who loves daffodils is in House 3.\n\n- The only person left is Bob, who must be in House 4.\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Alice>>>."
