    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of people, their children, favorite flowers, and drinks in the four houses.\n\n1. **Arnold is the person who is the mother of Timothy.**\n   - Arnold is a mother, and her child is Timothy.\n\n2. **The coffee drinker is in the fourth house.**\n   - House 4 has the coffee drinker.\n\n3. **Bob is the person who likes milk.**\n   - Bob drinks milk.\n\n4. **The person who is the mother of Billy is directly left of the person who loves a carnations arrangement.**\n   - The mother of Billy is in a house directly to the left of the carnations lover.\n\n5. **The person's child is named Alice and the person who loves the bouquet of lilies are next to each other.**\n   - The person whose child is Alice is next to the lilies lover.\n\n6. **The one who only drinks water is Arnold.**\n   - Arnold drinks water.\n\n7. **The boba tea drinker is Carol.**\n   - Carol drinks boba tea.\n\n8. **The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is the person who is the mother of Timothy.**\n   - Arnold, who is the mother of Timothy, loves daffodils.\n\n9. **The person who likes milk is the person's child is named Alice.**\n   - Bob, who drinks milk, has a child named Alice.\n\n10. **Carol is the person who loves the bouquet of iris.**\n    - Carol loves iris.\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- **House 4**: The coffee drinker is here. This cannot be Arnold (drinks water), Bob (drinks milk), or Carol (drinks boba tea). Therefore, the coffee drinker must be the fourth person, Alice.\n\n- **House 3**: Carol drinks boba tea and loves iris. She cannot be in House 4 (coffee) or House 1 (since she needs to be next to the lilies lover, and House 1 is on the edge). Therefore, Carol is in House 3.\n\n- **House 2**: Arnold drinks water and loves daffodils. She cannot be in House 4 (coffee) or House 3 (Carol is there). Therefore, Arnold is in House 2.\n\n- **House 1**: Bob drinks milk and has a child named Alice. Since Bob cannot be in House 2 (Arnold) or House 3 (Carol), Bob must be in House 1.\n\nNow, let's verify the arrangement:\n\n- **House 1**: Bob, drinks milk, child Alice.\n- **House 2**: Arnold, drinks water, child Timothy, loves daffodils.\n- **House 3**: Carol, drinks boba tea, loves iris.\n- **House 4**: Alice, drinks coffee.\n\nThe mother of Billy must be in House 1 (Bob), and the carnations lover must be in House 2 (Arnold), which fits the clue that the mother of Billy is directly left of the carnations lover.\n\nThe lilies lover must be in House 4 (Alice), which fits the clue that the person whose child is Alice (Bob) is next to the lilies lover.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Bob>>>"
