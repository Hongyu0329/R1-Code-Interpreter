    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the characteristics of each person in the four houses based on the given clues. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Clue 6**: The Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in the first house.\n   - House 1: Butterscotch smoothie\n\n2. **Clue 2**: The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n   - House 1: Butterscotch smoothie, Google Pixel 6\n\n3. **Clue 7**: The Darkness smoothie drinker is in the third house.\n   - House 3: Darkness smoothie\n\n4. **Clue 5**: The person who loves purple is the Darkness smoothie drinker.\n   - House 3: Darkness smoothie, loves purple\n\n5. **Clue 9**: The person who loves purple is directly left of the person who loves blue.\n   - House 3: Darkness smoothie, loves purple\n   - House 4: loves blue\n\n6. **Clue 3**: The person who loves white is Carol.\n   - Carol loves white\n\n7. **Clue 8**: The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the person who loves white.\n   - Carol uses Samsung Galaxy S21, loves white\n\n8. **Clue 4**: Alice is directly left of the person who uses a OnePlus 9.\n   - Alice is in a house directly left of a house with OnePlus 9\n\n9. **Clue 1**: Bob and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover are next to each other.\n\nNow, let's try to place these details into the houses:\n\n- **House 1**: Butterscotch smoothie, Google Pixel 6\n- **House 2**: (unknown)\n- **House 3**: Darkness smoothie, loves purple\n- **House 4**: loves blue\n\nSince Carol loves white and uses a Samsung Galaxy S21, and the person who loves purple is in House 3, Carol cannot be in House 3 or 4. Therefore, Carol must be in House 2.\n\n- **House 2**: Carol, loves white, Samsung Galaxy S21\n\nSince Alice is directly left of the person who uses a OnePlus 9, Alice must be in House 3, and the OnePlus 9 user must be in House 4.\n\n- **House 3**: Alice, Darkness smoothie, loves purple\n- **House 4**: OnePlus 9, loves blue\n\nNow, we know:\n- House 1: Butterscotch smoothie, Google Pixel 6\n- House 2: Carol, loves white, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 3: Alice, Darkness smoothie, loves purple\n- House 4: OnePlus 9, loves blue\n\nSince Bob and the Dragonfruit smoothie lover are next to each other, and the only house left for Bob is House 1, the Dragonfruit smoothie lover must be in House 2 or 3. But since House 2 is Carol's, the Dragonfruit smoothie lover must be in House 3.\n\n- **House 1**: Bob, Butterscotch smoothie, Google Pixel 6\n- **House 2**: Carol, loves white, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- **House 3**: Alice, Darkness smoothie, loves purple, Dragonfruit smoothie\n- **House 4**: OnePlus 9, loves blue\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<bob>>>"
