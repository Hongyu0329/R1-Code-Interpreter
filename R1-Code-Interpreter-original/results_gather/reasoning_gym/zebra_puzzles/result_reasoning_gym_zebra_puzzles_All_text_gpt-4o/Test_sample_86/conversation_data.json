    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. The person who is the mother of Billy is in the fourth house.\n   - This means Billy's mother is in House 4.\n\n2. The person who likes milk is the person's child is named Alice.\n   - Alice is the child of the person who likes milk.\n\n3. The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is in the third house.\n   - Google Pixel 6 user is in House 3.\n\n4. Arnold and Bob are next to each other.\n   - Arnold and Bob must be in adjacent houses.\n\n5. Alice is the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n   - Alice uses a Huawei P50.\n\n6. The coffee drinker is the person who is the mother of Billy.\n   - The coffee drinker is in House 4.\n\n7. The person who likes milk is in the third house.\n   - The milk drinker is in House 3.\n\n8. The boba tea drinker is Arnold.\n   - Arnold drinks boba tea.\n\n9. Carol is the person who uses a OnePlus 9.\n   - Carol uses a OnePlus 9.\n\n10. The boba tea drinker is the person's child is named Bella.\n    - Bella is the child of the boba tea drinker, Arnold.\n\n11. Bob is directly left of the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n    - Bob is in the house directly to the left of Alice, who uses a Huawei P50.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- From clues 1 and 6, the coffee drinker and Billy's mother is in House 4.\n- From clue 3, the milk drinker is in House 3.\n- From clue 5, Alice uses a Huawei P50.\n- From clue 11, Bob is directly left of Alice, so Bob is in House 1 and Alice is in House 2.\n- From clue 8, Arnold drinks boba tea, and from clue 10, Bella is Arnold's child.\n- From clue 9, Carol uses a OnePlus 9.\n\nLet's assign the remaining characteristics:\n\n- House 1: Bob (left of Alice)\n- House 2: Alice (Huawei P50)\n- House 3: Milk drinker (child is Alice)\n- House 4: Coffee drinker (mother of Billy)\n\nSince Arnold and Bob are next to each other (clue 4), and Arnold drinks boba tea (clue 8), Arnold must be in House 3. Therefore, Carol must be in House 4.\n\nFinal assignments:\n- House 1: Bob\n- House 2: Alice (Huawei P50)\n- House 3: Arnold (boba tea, child is Bella)\n- House 4: Carol (coffee, mother of Billy, OnePlus 9)\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Bob>>>."
