    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. The person's child named Alice is in the third house.\n   - This means Alice's mother is in house 3.\n\n2. The person's child named Alice and the person who loves a carnations arrangement are next to each other.\n   - Therefore, the carnations lover is in house 2 or 4.\n\n3. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n   - This links lilies with Pall Mall.\n\n4. Bob is the Prince smoker.\n   - Bob smokes Prince cigars.\n\n5. The person's child named Bella is Alice.\n   - This means Alice's mother (house 3) is also Bella's mother.\n\n6. Bob is the person who loves a carnations arrangement.\n   - Bob loves carnations, so he must be in house 2 or 4.\n\n7. Carol and the Prince smoker are next to each other.\n   - Carol is next to Bob, who smokes Prince cigars.\n\n8. The person who smokes Blue Master is in the second house.\n   - Blue Master is in house 2.\n\n9. The Dunhill smoker is the person's child named Bella.\n   - Bella's mother (house 3) smokes Dunhill.\n\n10. The person who is the mother of Billy is the person who loves the bouquet of iris.\n    - The iris lover is Billy's mother.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- House 3: Alice's mother, who is also Bella's mother, smokes Dunhill.\n- House 2: Blue Master smoker, who cannot be Bob (since Bob smokes Prince).\n- Bob loves carnations, so he must be in house 4 (since house 2 is Blue Master).\n- Carol is next to Bob, so Carol must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 3 is Alice/Bella's mother, Carol must be in house 1.\n- Therefore, house 1 is Carol, who is next to Bob in house 4.\n- The person in house 1 (Carol) must be the iris lover, as they are Billy's mother.\n\nThus, the person in house 1 is Carol.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Carol>>>."
