    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The bird keeper is Arnold.**\n   - Arnold keeps birds.\n\n2. **The dog owner is the German.**\n   - The German owns a dog.\n\n3. **The person who loves purple is the Chinese.**\n   - The Chinese loves purple.\n\n4. **Carol is directly left of Alice.**\n   - Carol is in a house immediately to the left of Alice's house.\n\n5. **The cat lover is the person who loves brown.**\n   - The person who loves brown also loves cats.\n\n6. **Carol is directly left of the cat lover.**\n   - Carol is immediately to the left of the person who loves cats.\n\n7. **The Dane is Arnold.**\n   - Arnold is the Dane.\n\n8. **The cat lover is directly left of the person who loves blue.**\n   - The person who loves cats is immediately to the left of the person who loves blue.\n\n9. **The bird keeper is in the first house.**\n   - Arnold, who keeps birds, is in House 1.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- From clue 9, Arnold is in House 1.\n- From clue 7, Arnold is the Dane.\n- From clue 1, Arnold keeps birds.\n- From clue 4, Carol is directly left of Alice. This means Carol could be in House 2 and Alice in House 3, or Carol in House 3 and Alice in House 4.\n- From clue 6, Carol is directly left of the cat lover. This means Carol is in House 2 and the cat lover is in House 3.\n- From clue 5, the cat lover loves brown. So, the person in House 3 loves brown.\n- From clue 8, the cat lover is directly left of the person who loves blue. Therefore, the person in House 4 loves blue.\n- From clue 3, the person who loves purple is the Chinese. Since House 4 loves blue, House 2 must love purple, making the person in House 2 Chinese.\n- From clue 2, the German owns a dog. Since House 1 has birds and House 3 has cats, the German must be in House 4.\n- This leaves House 2 for the Chinese, who loves purple.\n- Since Carol is in House 2, Alice must be in House 3.\n- Bob is the only name left, so Bob must be in House 4.\n\nSummarizing:\n- House 1: Arnold (Dane, birds, any color)\n- House 2: Carol (Chinese, purple, any animal)\n- House 3: Alice (brown, cats)\n- House 4: Bob (German, blue, dogs)\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Arnold>>>"
