    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to determine the arrangement of people, cigars, animals, and phone models in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Bob is the Prince smoker.**\n   - Bob smokes Prince cigars.\n\n2. **Alice and the Dunhill smoker are next to each other.**\n   - Alice is next to the person who smokes Dunhill cigars.\n\n3. **Bob is directly left of the bird keeper.**\n   - Bob's house is immediately to the left of the house where the bird is kept.\n\n4. **Alice is in the second house.**\n   - Alice lives in House 2.\n\n5. **The dog owner is Arnold.**\n   - Arnold owns the dog.\n\n6. **The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is the Dunhill smoker.**\n   - The Dunhill smoker uses a OnePlus 9 phone.\n\n7. **Alice is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.**\n   - Alice uses a Google Pixel 6 phone.\n\n8. **The Dunhill smoker is the fish enthusiast.**\n   - The Dunhill smoker keeps fish.\n\n9. **The person who uses a Huawei P50 is the person partial to Pall Mall.**\n   - The person who smokes Pall Mall cigars uses a Huawei P50 phone.\n\nNow, let's use these clues to fill in the details:\n\n- Since Alice is in House 2 and uses a Google Pixel 6, we know:\n  - House 2: Alice, Google Pixel 6\n\n- Bob is the Prince smoker and is directly left of the bird keeper. Since Alice is in House 2, Bob cannot be in House 2. Therefore, Bob must be in House 1 or House 3. However, since Bob is directly left of the bird keeper, Bob must be in House 3, and the bird keeper must be in House 4.\n  - House 3: Bob, Prince\n  - House 4: Bird\n\n- Alice and the Dunhill smoker are next to each other. Since Alice is in House 2, the Dunhill smoker must be in House 1.\n  - House 1: Dunhill, OnePlus 9, Fish\n\n- The dog owner is Arnold. Since House 1 is occupied by the Dunhill smoker and House 2 by Alice, Arnold must be in House 3 or House 4. Since Bob is in House 3, Arnold must be in House 4.\n  - House 4: Arnold, Dog, Bird\n\n- The person who uses a Huawei P50 is the person partial to Pall Mall. Since House 1 has a OnePlus 9 and House 2 has a Google Pixel 6, the Huawei P50 must be in House 3 or House 4. Since House 4 has Arnold and the dog, the Huawei P50 and Pall Mall must be in House 3.\n  - House 3: Bob, Prince, Huawei P50, Pall Mall\n\nNow, we have:\n- House 1: Dunhill, OnePlus 9, Fish\n- House 2: Alice, Google Pixel 6\n- House 3: Bob, Prince, Huawei P50, Pall Mall\n- House 4: Arnold, Dog, Bird\n\nThe only person left is Carol, who must be in House 1.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nFinal answer: <<<carol>>>"
