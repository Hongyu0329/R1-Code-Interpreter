    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The person who loves white is the Chinese.**\n   - This means the Chinese person's favorite color is white.\n\n2. **Arnold is the coffee drinker.**\n   - Arnold's favorite drink is coffee.\n\n3. **The German is directly left of the Dane.**\n   - This means the German is in a house immediately to the left of the Dane.\n\n4. **The person who loves white is Carol.**\n   - Since the person who loves white is Chinese, Carol is Chinese and loves white.\n\n5. **The British person is the person who loves brown.**\n   - The British person's favorite color is brown.\n\n6. **Arnold is the person who loves purple.**\n   - Arnold's favorite color is purple.\n\n7. **The boba tea drinker is Bob.**\n   - Bob's favorite drink is boba tea.\n\n8. **Bob is directly left of Alice.**\n   - Bob is in a house immediately to the left of Alice.\n\n9. **The person who loves purple is directly left of the person who likes milk.**\n   - Since Arnold loves purple, Arnold is directly left of the person who likes milk.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- From clues 6 and 9, Arnold (purple) is directly left of the person who likes milk.\n- From clues 7 and 8, Bob (boba tea) is directly left of Alice.\n- From clue 3, the German is directly left of the Dane.\n\nLet's try to place these people in the houses:\n\n- Since Arnold is directly left of the milk drinker, and Bob is directly left of Alice, we can try:\n  - House 1: Arnold (purple, coffee)\n  - House 2: Milk drinker\n  - House 3: Bob (boba tea)\n  - House 4: Alice\n\n- From clue 3, the German is directly left of the Dane. Since House 1 is Arnold, House 2 could be the German, and House 3 could be the Dane.\n\n- From clue 4, Carol is Chinese and loves white. Since House 2 is the German, Carol must be in House 3 or 4. But since House 3 is Bob, Carol must be in House 4.\n\n- From clue 5, the British person loves brown. Since House 1 is Arnold (purple), House 2 is the German, and House 4 is Carol (white), the British person must be in House 3 (Bob).\n\n- Now, let's finalize:\n  - House 1: Arnold (purple, coffee)\n  - House 2: German (milk)\n  - House 3: Bob (British, brown, boba tea)\n  - House 4: Carol (Chinese, white)\n\nThus, the person in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Arnold>>>."
