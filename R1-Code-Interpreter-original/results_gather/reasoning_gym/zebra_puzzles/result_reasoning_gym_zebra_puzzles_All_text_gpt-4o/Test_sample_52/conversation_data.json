    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 5**: The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is in the fourth house.\n2. **Clue 9**: The person who loves the soup is in the fourth house.\n   - From clues 5 and 9, we know that the person in the fourth house loves lilies and soup.\n\n3. **Clue 8**: The coffee drinker is the person who loves the soup.\n   - Therefore, the person in the fourth house drinks coffee.\n\n4. **Clue 4**: Arnold is directly left of the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.\n5. **Clue 10**: The one who only drinks water is the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.\n   - From clues 4 and 10, Arnold is directly left of the person who drinks water and loves daffodils.\n\n6. **Clue 2**: The one who only drinks water is Alice.\n   - Therefore, Alice loves daffodils and drinks water.\n\n7. **Clue 3**: The person who loves eating grilled cheese is directly left of the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.\n   - Therefore, Arnold loves grilled cheese.\n\n8. **Clue 1**: The person who loves a carnations arrangement is the person who loves eating grilled cheese.\n   - Therefore, Arnold loves carnations.\n\n9. **Clue 6**: Carol is directly left of Bob.\n   - Since Arnold is in house 2 (directly left of Alice in house 3), Carol must be in house 1, and Bob must be in house 2.\n\n10. **Clue 7**: The boba tea drinker is the person who loves stir fry.\n    - Since the fourth house drinks coffee, and Alice drinks water, the boba tea drinker must be in house 1 or 2. Since Arnold is in house 2 and drinks something else, Carol in house 1 must drink boba tea and love stir fry.\n\nNow, we have:\n- House 1: Carol, boba tea, stir fry\n- House 2: Arnold, carnations, grilled cheese\n- House 3: Alice, daffodils, water\n- House 4: Bob, lilies, soup, coffee\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Carol>>>."
