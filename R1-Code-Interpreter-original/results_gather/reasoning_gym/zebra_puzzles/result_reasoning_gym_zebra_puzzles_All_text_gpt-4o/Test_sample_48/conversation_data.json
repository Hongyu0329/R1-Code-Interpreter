    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the information step by step.\n\n1. **Clue 9**: The person who loves white is in the third house.\n2. **Clue 4**: The person who loves white is Arnold. Therefore, Arnold is in the third house.\n3. **Clue 1**: The person who loves white is the person who is a pizza lover. Therefore, Arnold loves pizza.\n4. **Clue 8**: Alice is in the second house.\n5. **Clue 10**: The person who loves stir fry is in the second house. Therefore, Alice loves stir fry.\n6. **Clue 5**: The person who loves stir fry and the British person are next to each other. Since Alice is in the second house, the British person must be in either the first or third house. But Arnold is in the third house, so the British person must be in the first house.\n7. **Clue 6**: The German is in the first house. This contradicts the British person being in the first house, so the British person must be in the fourth house.\n8. **Clue 7**: The person who loves brown is Bob. Since Arnold is in the third house and Alice is in the second house, Bob must be in the fourth house.\n9. **Clue 2**: The Chinese is the person who loves purple.\n10. **Clue 3**: The person who loves the soup is the Chinese. Therefore, the Chinese person loves soup and purple.\n11. Since Bob is in the fourth house and loves brown, the Chinese person must be in the first house.\n12. The German is in the first house, and since the Chinese person is also in the first house, the German must be the Chinese person.\n13. The only person left without a house is Carol, who must be in the first house.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Carol>>>."
