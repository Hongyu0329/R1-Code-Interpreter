    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to analyze the given clues step by step and deduce the arrangement of people, animals, flowers, and phone models in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 5**: Carol is the cat lover.\n2. **Clue 1**: The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the cat lover. Therefore, Carol uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n3. **Clue 4**: The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 loves the bouquet of lilies. Therefore, Carol loves lilies.\n4. **Clue 11**: The cat lover (Carol) is directly left of Alice. Therefore, Carol is in House 1 or House 3, and Alice is in House 2 or House 4.\n5. **Clue 8**: Alice is the bird keeper.\n6. **Clue 2**: The bird keeper (Alice) and the dog owner are next to each other. Therefore, the dog owner is in the house next to Alice.\n7. **Clue 10**: Bob uses a OnePlus 9.\n8. **Clue 9**: The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is the dog owner. Therefore, Bob is the dog owner.\n9. **Clue 11**: Since Carol is directly left of Alice, and Alice is in House 2 or House 4, Carol must be in House 1, and Alice must be in House 2.\n10. **Clue 3**: The person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the second house. Therefore, Alice loves iris.\n11. **Clue 6**: The person who loves the bouquet of iris uses a Huawei P50. Therefore, Alice uses a Huawei P50.\n12. **Clue 2**: Since Alice (House 2) is the bird keeper, and Bob (dog owner) must be next to Alice, Bob must be in House 3.\n13. **Clue 7**: The fish enthusiast loves a carnations arrangement. Since Carol loves lilies and Alice loves iris, the fish enthusiast must be in House 4.\n14. **Clue 11**: Since Carol is in House 1, Alice is in House 2, and Bob is in House 3, the only person left for House 4 is Arnold.\n15. Therefore, Arnold is the fish enthusiast and loves carnations.\n\nNow, we have the following arrangement:\n- House 1: Carol, Cat, Lilies, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 2: Alice, Bird, Iris, Huawei P50\n- House 3: Bob, Dog, (unknown flower), OnePlus 9\n- House 4: Arnold, Fish, Carnations, (unknown phone)\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Carol>>>"
