    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the houses.\n\n1. **Clue 7**: Carol is in the first house.\n   - House 1: Carol\n\n2. **Clue 3**: Bob is in the third house.\n   - House 3: Bob\n\n3. **Clue 6**: The fish enthusiast is Bob.\n   - House 3: Bob, Fish\n\n4. **Clue 5**: The bird keeper and the fish enthusiast are next to each other.\n   - House 2 or House 4 must have the bird keeper.\n\n5. **Clue 10**: Alice is the cat lover.\n   - Alice cannot be in House 3 (Bob) or House 1 (Carol), so Alice must be in House 2 or House 4.\n\n6. **Clue 1**: The Desert smoothie lover is the cat lover.\n   - Alice loves the Desert smoothie.\n\n7. **Clue 2**: The person who loves the bouquet of iris is the cat lover.\n   - Alice loves the bouquet of iris.\n\n8. **Clue 9**: The Butterscotch smoothie drinker is directly left of Bob.\n   - House 2: Butterscotch smoothie\n\n9. **Clue 4**: The dog owner is the person who loves a carnations arrangement.\n   - The dog owner cannot be Bob (fish) or Alice (cat), so it must be Carol or the person in House 4.\n\n10. **Clue 8**: The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils is the Dragonfruit smoothie lover.\n    - This person cannot be Bob (fish) or Alice (cat), so it must be Carol or the person in House 4.\n\nNow, let's deduce the remaining details:\n\n- Since Alice is the cat lover and loves the Desert smoothie and iris, she must be in House 2 or House 4. But since House 2 has the Butterscotch smoothie drinker, Alice must be in House 4.\n  - House 4: Alice, Cat, Desert smoothie, Iris\n\n- House 2 has the Butterscotch smoothie drinker and is directly left of Bob. Therefore, House 2 must have the bird keeper (since the bird keeper is next to the fish enthusiast, Bob).\n  - House 2: Bird, Butterscotch smoothie\n\n- Since Carol is in House 1 and the dog owner loves carnations, Carol must be the dog owner.\n  - House 1: Carol, Dog, Carnations\n\n- The only remaining option for House 2 is Arnold, as Alice is in House 4 and Bob is in House 3.\n  - House 2: Arnold, Bird, Butterscotch smoothie\n\n- The only remaining flower and smoothie for House 2 are lilies and darkness, respectively.\n  - House 2: Arnold, Bird, Butterscotch smoothie, Lilies\n\n- The only remaining flower and smoothie for House 1 are daffodils and dragonfruit, respectively.\n  - House 1: Carol, Dog, Carnations, Dragonfruit\n\nThus, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Carol.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Carol>>>"
