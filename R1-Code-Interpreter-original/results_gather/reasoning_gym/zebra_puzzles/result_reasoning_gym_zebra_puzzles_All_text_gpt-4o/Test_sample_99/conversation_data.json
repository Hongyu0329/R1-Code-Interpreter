    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Carol uses a Google Pixel 6.**\n   - Carol is associated with the Google Pixel 6.\n\n2. **The person who is the mother of Timothy uses a Google Pixel 6.**\n   - Therefore, Carol is the mother of Timothy.\n\n3. **Alice smokes Blue Master.**\n   - Alice is associated with Blue Master cigars.\n\n4. **The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is directly left of the Dunhill smoker.**\n   - This means the OnePlus 9 user is in a house immediately to the left of the Dunhill smoker.\n\n5. **The mother of Timothy is directly left of the person who uses a Huawei P50.**\n   - Since Carol is the mother of Timothy, Carol is directly left of the Huawei P50 user.\n\n6. **The person who uses a Huawei P50 is the mother of Billy.**\n   - The Huawei P50 user is the mother of Billy.\n\n7. **Arnold uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.**\n   - Arnold is associated with the Samsung Galaxy S21.\n\n8. **The person whose child is named Alice is partial to Pall Mall.**\n   - The Pall Mall smoker's child is named Alice.\n\n9. **The mother of Billy is directly left of the person who uses a OnePlus 9.**\n   - The Huawei P50 user (mother of Billy) is directly left of the OnePlus 9 user.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- Since Carol uses a Google Pixel 6 and is the mother of Timothy, she cannot be in House 4 (as she needs to be directly left of the Huawei P50 user). Therefore, Carol must be in House 2 or 3.\n- The Huawei P50 user (mother of Billy) must be in House 3 or 4, as they need to be directly left of the OnePlus 9 user.\n- Arnold uses a Samsung Galaxy S21, and since Carol is in House 2 or 3, Arnold must be in House 1.\n- Alice smokes Blue Master, and since Carol is in House 2 or 3, Alice must be in House 4.\n- The OnePlus 9 user must be in House 3, as they are directly left of the Dunhill smoker (House 4).\n\nLet's assign the houses:\n\n- **House 1:** Arnold (Samsung Galaxy S21)\n- **House 2:** Carol (Google Pixel 6, mother of Timothy)\n- **House 3:** Mother of Billy (Huawei P50, OnePlus 9 user)\n- **House 4:** Alice (Blue Master, Dunhill smoker)\n\nSince the mother of Billy is in House 3, and the OnePlus 9 user is in House 3, the Dunhill smoker must be in House 4. Therefore, Alice is the Dunhill smoker.\n\nFinally, the person in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Arnold>>>."
