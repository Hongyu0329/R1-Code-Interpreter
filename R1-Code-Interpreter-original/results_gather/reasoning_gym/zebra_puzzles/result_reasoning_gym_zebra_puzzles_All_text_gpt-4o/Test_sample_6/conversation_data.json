    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the relationships between the people, their phone models, favorite cigars, and their children. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Alice uses a Google Pixel 6.**\n   - Alice is associated with the Google Pixel 6.\n\n2. **The Prince smoker uses a Huawei P50.**\n   - The person who smokes Prince also uses a Huawei P50.\n\n3. **Bob smokes Blue Master.**\n   - Bob is associated with Blue Master cigars.\n\n4. **Bob and the person whose child is named Alice are next to each other.**\n   - Bob is next to the person whose child is Alice.\n\n5. **Carol's child is named Alice.**\n   - Carol is the mother of Alice.\n\n6. **The Blue Master smoker uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.**\n   - Bob, who smokes Blue Master, uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n\n7. **Bob is the mother of Billy.**\n   - Bob's child is Billy.\n\n8. **Carol is directly left of the Prince smoker.**\n   - Carol is immediately to the left of the person who smokes Prince.\n\n9. **The mother of Timothy and the Blue Master smoker are next to each other.**\n   - The mother of Timothy is next to Bob, who smokes Blue Master.\n\n10. **The Pall Mall smoker's child is named Alice.**\n    - The person who smokes Pall Mall is Carol, as her child is Alice.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- Since Bob smokes Blue Master and uses a Samsung Galaxy S21, and is the mother of Billy, Bob cannot be in House 1 because Bob needs to be next to Carol (whose child is Alice).\n- Carol, whose child is Alice, smokes Pall Mall and must be next to Bob. Therefore, Carol cannot be in House 4.\n- Since Carol is directly left of the Prince smoker, Carol must be in House 2, and the Prince smoker must be in House 3.\n- Bob, who smokes Blue Master, must be in House 3, as Bob is next to Carol and uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n- Alice, who uses a Google Pixel 6, must be in House 4, as Alice cannot be in House 1 or 2.\n- The only person left for House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThus, the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<arnold>>>."
