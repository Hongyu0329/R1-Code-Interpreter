    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 10**: Carol is in the third house.\n   - House 3: Carol\n\n2. **Clue 2**: The person who is the mother of Timothy is in the third house.\n   - House 3: Carol, mother of Timothy\n\n3. **Clue 4**: Carol is directly left of the person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n   - House 4: Samsung Galaxy S21\n\n4. **Clue 5**: The person who loves eating grilled cheese is in the fourth house.\n   - House 4: Samsung Galaxy S21, grilled cheese\n\n5. **Clue 3**: Bob is the person who uses a Huawei P50.\n   - Bob cannot be in House 3 or 4, so he must be in House 1 or 2.\n\n6. **Clue 6**: Arnold is the person who uses a OnePlus 9.\n   - Arnold cannot be in House 3 or 4, so he must be in House 1 or 2.\n\n7. **Clue 1**: The person who is a pizza lover is the person who uses a OnePlus 9.\n   - Arnold loves pizza.\n\n8. **Clue 8**: Arnold's child is named Bella.\n   - Arnold, Bella, pizza, OnePlus 9\n\n9. **Clue 9**: Bob and the person who loves stir fry are next to each other.\n   - Since Bob is in House 1 or 2, and House 3 is Carol, Bob must be in House 1, and the stir fry lover must be in House 2.\n\n10. **Clue 7**: The person who loves the soup is the person who is the mother of Billy.\n    - Since Carol is the mother of Timothy, the mother of Billy must be in House 1 or 2.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining characteristics:\n\n- **House 1**: Bob, Huawei P50\n- **House 2**: Arnold, Bella, pizza, OnePlus 9\n- **House 3**: Carol, Timothy, soup, Google Pixel 6\n- **House 4**: Samsung Galaxy S21, grilled cheese\n\nSince Bob is in House 1, and the mother of Billy must be in House 2, Alice must be in House 2, making Alice the mother of Billy.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Bob>>>"
