    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the characteristics of each person in each house based on the given clues. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. The person who loves the bouquet of iris uses a Samsung Galaxy S21.\n2. Arnold is the bird keeper.\n3. The fish enthusiast uses a Google Pixel 6.\n4. The dog owner is in the second house.\n5. The person who loves the bouquet of lilies uses a Huawei P50.\n6. The person who loves a bouquet of daffodils and Alice are next to each other.\n7. Bob uses a Huawei P50.\n8. The cat lover is in the third house.\n9. The dog owner is directly left of the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.\n\nLet's start by placing the information we know:\n\n- House 2: Dog owner (Clue 4)\n- House 3: Cat lover (Clue 8)\n\nFrom Clue 9, the dog owner is directly left of the person who loves daffodils, so:\n\n- House 3: Daffodils lover\n\nFrom Clue 6, Alice is next to the daffodils lover, so Alice must be in House 2 or House 4. Since House 2 is the dog owner, Alice must be in House 4.\n\n- House 4: Alice\n\nFrom Clue 7, Bob uses a Huawei P50, and from Clue 5, the lilies lover uses a Huawei P50. Therefore, Bob loves lilies.\n\n- House 4: Bob, Lilies lover, Huawei P50\n\nSince Alice is in House 4, Bob cannot be in House 4. Therefore, Bob must be in House 2.\n\n- House 2: Bob, Dog owner, Lilies lover, Huawei P50\n\nFrom Clue 1, the iris lover uses a Samsung Galaxy S21. Since Bob is in House 2 with a Huawei P50, the iris lover must be in House 1 or House 3.\n\nFrom Clue 3, the fish enthusiast uses a Google Pixel 6. Since House 2 is occupied by Bob with a Huawei P50, the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 or House 4.\n\nFrom Clue 2, Arnold is the bird keeper. Since House 2 is occupied by Bob, Arnold must be in House 1 or House 3.\n\nSince House 3 is the daffodils lover, and House 4 is Alice, the only place left for Arnold is House 1.\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Bird keeper\n\nSince Arnold is in House 1, and the fish enthusiast uses a Google Pixel 6, the fish enthusiast must be in House 4.\n\n- House 4: Alice, Fish enthusiast, Google Pixel 6\n\nNow, we know:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Bird keeper\n- House 2: Bob, Dog owner, Lilies lover, Huawei P50\n- House 3: Daffodils lover, Cat lover\n- House 4: Alice, Fish enthusiast, Google Pixel 6\n\nFrom Clue 1, the iris lover uses a Samsung Galaxy S21. Since House 2 is occupied by Bob with a Huawei P50, and House 4 is occupied by Alice with a Google Pixel 6, the iris lover must be in House 1 or House 3.\n\nSince House 1 is Arnold, the iris lover must be in House 3.\n\n- House 3: Iris lover, Cat lover, Samsung Galaxy S21\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Bird keeper\n- House 2: Bob, Dog owner, Lilies lover, Huawei P50\n- House 3: Iris lover, Cat lover, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 4: Alice, Fish enthusiast, Google Pixel 6\n\nThe only person left without a name is Carol, who must be in House 3.\n\n- House 3: Carol, Iris lover, Cat lover, Samsung Galaxy S21\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- House 1: Arnold, Bird keeper\n- House 2: Bob, Dog owner, Lilies lover, Huawei P50\n- House 3: Carol, Iris lover, Cat lover, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- House 4: Alice, Fish enthusiast, Google Pixel 6\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Arnold.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Arnold>>>."
