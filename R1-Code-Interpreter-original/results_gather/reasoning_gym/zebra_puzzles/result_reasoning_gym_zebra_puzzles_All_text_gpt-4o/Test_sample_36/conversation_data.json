    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions and characteristics of each person in the four houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The person who loves eating grilled cheese and Arnold are next to each other.**\n   - This means Arnold is not the grilled cheese lover.\n\n2. **The bird keeper is in the fourth house.**\n   - House 4 has the bird keeper.\n\n3. **The person who loves blue and the person who loves white are next to each other.**\n   - These two colors are adjacent.\n\n4. **The person who loves eating grilled cheese is the fish enthusiast.**\n   - The grilled cheese lover also keeps fish.\n\n5. **The dog owner is directly left of the person who loves blue.**\n   - The dog owner is in a house immediately to the left of the blue lover.\n\n6. **The cat lover and the person who loves purple are next to each other.**\n   - These two are adjacent.\n\n7. **The person who loves stir fry is Alice.**\n   - Alice loves stir fry.\n\n8. **The person who loves stir fry is directly left of the person who is a pizza lover.**\n   - Alice is directly left of the pizza lover.\n\n9. **Bob is the dog owner.**\n   - Bob owns the dog.\n\nNow, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- Since Bob is the dog owner and is directly left of the person who loves blue, Bob cannot be in House 4. Therefore, Bob must be in House 1, 2, or 3.\n- Alice, who loves stir fry, is directly left of the pizza lover. Therefore, Alice cannot be in House 4.\n- The bird keeper is in House 4, so Alice cannot be in House 4.\n- Since Alice is directly left of the pizza lover, Alice must be in House 2 or 3.\n- If Alice is in House 2, the pizza lover is in House 3. If Alice is in House 3, the pizza lover is in House 4.\n- Bob, the dog owner, must be in House 1 or 2 because he is directly left of the blue lover.\n- If Bob is in House 1, the blue lover is in House 2. If Bob is in House 2, the blue lover is in House 3.\n\nLet's try placing Bob in House 2:\n- Bob (dog owner) is in House 2.\n- The blue lover is in House 3.\n- Alice (stir fry) is in House 1.\n- The pizza lover is in House 2.\n- The bird keeper is in House 4.\n- The grilled cheese lover (fish enthusiast) is in House 3 or 4.\n- The cat lover and the purple lover are adjacent.\n\nNow, let's try placing Bob in House 1:\n- Bob (dog owner) is in House 1.\n- The blue lover is in House 2.\n- Alice (stir fry) is in House 3.\n- The pizza lover is in House 4.\n- The bird keeper is in House 4.\n- The grilled cheese lover (fish enthusiast) is in House 2.\n- The cat lover and the purple lover are adjacent.\n\nThis configuration satisfies all the conditions:\n- Bob is in House 1, directly left of the blue lover in House 2.\n- Alice is in House 3, directly left of the pizza lover in House 4.\n- The bird keeper is in House 4.\n- The grilled cheese lover (fish enthusiast) is in House 2.\n- The cat lover and the purple lover are adjacent.\n\nTherefore, the person who lives in House 1 is Bob.\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Bob>>>."
