    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of people, their nationalities, phone models, and favorite cigars in the four houses. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The Dunhill smoker is in the fourth house.**\n   - House 4: Dunhill smoker\n\n2. **The Chinese is Arnold.**\n   - Arnold is Chinese.\n\n3. **The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is the Dunhill smoker.**\n   - House 4: Samsung Galaxy S21, Dunhill smoker\n\n4. **The Dane is the person who uses a Google Pixel 6.**\n   - Dane uses Google Pixel 6.\n\n5. **The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is directly left of the British person.**\n   - OnePlus 9 user is in a house directly left of the Brit.\n\n6. **The German is the person who smokes Blue Master.**\n   - German smokes Blue Master.\n\n7. **The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is Alice.**\n   - Alice uses OnePlus 9.\n\n8. **Arnold and the person who uses a OnePlus 9 are next to each other.**\n   - Arnold is next to Alice.\n\n9. **Arnold is the person partial to Pall Mall.**\n   - Arnold smokes Pall Mall.\n\n10. **The Dane is Bob.**\n    - Bob is Dane.\n\nNow, let's place these pieces of information into the houses:\n\n- **House 4**: Dunhill smoker, Samsung Galaxy S21\n- **Arnold**: Chinese, Pall Mall\n- **Alice**: OnePlus 9\n- **Bob**: Dane, Google Pixel 6\n\nFrom clues 5 and 7, Alice (OnePlus 9) is directly left of the Brit. Therefore, Alice must be in House 1 or House 3, and the Brit must be in House 2 or House 4.\n\nFrom clue 8, Arnold is next to Alice. Therefore, Arnold must be in House 2 or House 4.\n\nSince House 4 is already occupied by the Dunhill smoker with a Samsung Galaxy S21, Arnold cannot be in House 4. Therefore, Arnold must be in House 2.\n\nSince Arnold is in House 2, Alice must be in House 1 (directly left of the Brit in House 2).\n\nNow, we have:\n- **House 1**: Alice, OnePlus 9\n- **House 2**: Arnold, Chinese, Pall Mall\n- **House 3**: Bob, Dane, Google Pixel 6\n- **House 4**: Dunhill smoker, Samsung Galaxy S21\n\nFrom clue 6, the German smokes Blue Master. Since House 4 is the only house left without a nationality, the German must be in House 4.\n\nNow, we can determine the Brit must be in House 2 (since House 3 is occupied by Bob, the Dane).\n\nThus, the arrangement is:\n- **House 1**: Alice, OnePlus 9\n- **House 2**: Arnold, Chinese, Pall Mall, Brit\n- **House 3**: Bob, Dane, Google Pixel 6\n- **House 4**: German, Dunhill, Samsung Galaxy S21\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Alice>>>"
