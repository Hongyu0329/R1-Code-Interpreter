    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to determine the characteristics of each person in each house. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Bob is the one who only drinks water.**\n   - Bob's favorite drink is water.\n\n2. **Carol is the boba tea drinker.**\n   - Carol's favorite drink is boba tea.\n\n3. **The person who uses a Samsung Galaxy S21 is directly left of the person who loves a bouquet of daffodils.**\n   - This means the Samsung user is in a house immediately to the left of the daffodils lover.\n\n4. **The boba tea drinker is in the third house.**\n   - Carol is in the third house.\n\n5. **The person who uses a OnePlus 9 is in the fourth house.**\n   - The OnePlus 9 user is in house 4.\n\n6. **The person who loves the bouquet of lilies is in the first house.**\n   - The lilies lover is in house 1.\n\n7. **Arnold is the person who loves a carnations arrangement.**\n   - Arnold's favorite flower is carnations.\n\n8. **The person who loves the bouquet of lilies and Alice are next to each other.**\n   - Since the lilies lover is in house 1, Alice must be in house 2.\n\n9. **The person who uses a Google Pixel 6 is the person who likes milk.**\n   - The Google Pixel 6 user drinks milk.\n\nNow, let's place the information into the houses:\n\n- **House 1:**\n  - Loves lilies\n  - Not Alice (Alice is in house 2)\n\n- **House 2:**\n  - Alice\n  - Next to lilies lover\n\n- **House 3:**\n  - Carol\n  - Drinks boba tea\n\n- **House 4:**\n  - Uses OnePlus 9\n\nFrom the clues, we know:\n- Bob drinks water, so he cannot be in house 3 (Carol) or house 4 (OnePlus 9 user).\n- Bob must be in house 2, since house 1 is the lilies lover and house 3 is Carol.\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining details:\n- House 1: Loves lilies, not Alice, not Bob, so must be Arnold (since Arnold loves carnations, and carnations are not mentioned for house 1, this is a contradiction, so let's re-evaluate).\n- House 2: Alice, drinks water (Bob), so Alice must be the Samsung user (since Samsung is left of daffodils, and daffodils must be in house 3 or 4).\n- House 3: Carol, drinks boba tea, must love daffodils (since Samsung is left of daffodils, and house 3 is right of house 2).\n- House 4: Uses OnePlus 9, must be Arnold (since Arnold loves carnations, and house 4 is the only house left).\n\nRe-evaluating:\n- House 1: Must be the Google Pixel 6 user (drinks milk), loves lilies, must be Alice (since Alice is next to lilies lover, and house 1 is the only house left for Alice).\n\nFinal arrangement:\n- **House 1:** Alice, drinks milk, loves lilies, uses Google Pixel 6\n- **House 2:** Bob, drinks water, uses Samsung Galaxy S21\n- **House 3:** Carol, drinks boba tea, loves daffodils\n- **House 4:** Arnold, uses OnePlus 9, loves carnations\n\nThe name of the person who lives in House 1 is Alice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Alice>>>."
