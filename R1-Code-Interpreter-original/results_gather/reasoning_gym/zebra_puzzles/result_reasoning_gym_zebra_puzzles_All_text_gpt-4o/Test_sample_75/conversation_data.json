    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues to determine the characteristics of each person in each house. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. The person who loves white is in the fourth house.\n   - House 4: Color = White\n\n2. The person who is a pizza lover is Alice.\n   - Alice: Lunch = Pizza\n\n3. The person who loves purple is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n   - Color = Purple, Cigar = Pall Mall\n\n4. The person who loves brown is Carol.\n   - Carol: Color = Brown\n\n5. Bob is the person who loves eating grilled cheese.\n   - Bob: Lunch = Grilled Cheese\n\n6. Bob is in the second house.\n   - House 2: Name = Bob\n\n7. The person who loves brown and the person who loves white are next to each other.\n   - Since the person who loves white is in House 4, Carol (who loves brown) must be in House 3.\n\n8. The person who loves the soup and the person who is a pizza lover are next to each other.\n   - Alice (Pizza) must be in House 1 or House 3, but since Carol is in House 3, Alice must be in House 1.\n   - House 1: Name = Alice, Lunch = Pizza\n\n9. The person who smokes Blue Master is the person who loves eating grilled cheese.\n   - Bob: Cigar = Blue Master\n\n10. The person who smokes Blue Master and the Dunhill smoker are next to each other.\n    - Since Bob is in House 2, the Dunhill smoker must be in House 1 or House 3. Since Alice is in House 1, the Dunhill smoker must be in House 3.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information we have:\n\n- House 1: Name = Alice, Lunch = Pizza, Cigar = Dunhill\n- House 2: Name = Bob, Lunch = Grilled Cheese, Cigar = Blue Master\n- House 3: Name = Carol, Color = Brown, Cigar = Dunhill\n- House 4: Color = White\n\nFrom the above deductions, we can see that the person in House 1 is Alice.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is <<<Alice>>>."
