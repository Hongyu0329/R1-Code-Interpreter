    "To solve this logic puzzle, we need to analyze the given clues step by step and deduce the arrangement of people, cigars, colors, and animals in the four houses.\n\n1. **Clue 1**: The Prince smoker is in the fourth house.\n   - House 4: Prince smoker\n\n2. **Clue 2**: The person who smokes Blue Master is in the first house.\n   - House 1: Blue Master smoker\n\n3. **Clue 3**: The dog owner is directly left of the person partial to Pall Mall.\n   - This means the dog owner is in a house immediately to the left of the Pall Mall smoker.\n\n4. **Clue 4**: The person who loves brown is the cat lover.\n   - Brown lover = Cat lover\n\n5. **Clue 5**: The cat lover is the person partial to Pall Mall.\n   - Therefore, the Pall Mall smoker loves brown and owns a cat.\n\n6. **Clue 6**: The dog owner is the person who loves blue.\n   - Blue lover = Dog owner\n\n7. **Clue 7**: Bob is directly left of Carol.\n   - Bob's house is immediately to the left of Carol's house.\n\n8. **Clue 8**: The person who loves white is Arnold.\n   - Arnold loves white.\n\n9. **Clue 9**: The bird keeper is Carol.\n   - Carol owns a bird.\n\n10. **Clue 10**: The Prince smoker is Carol.\n    - From Clue 1, Carol is in House 4.\n\nNow, let's deduce the arrangement:\n\n- **House 4**: Carol (Prince smoker, bird keeper)\n- **House 3**: Since Bob is directly left of Carol, Bob must be in House 3.\n- **House 2**: The Pall Mall smoker (cat lover, brown lover) must be in House 2 because the dog owner (blue lover) is directly left of them.\n- **House 1**: The Blue Master smoker is in House 1.\n\nFrom Clue 6, the dog owner (blue lover) is in House 3. Therefore, Bob loves blue and owns a dog.\n\nFrom Clue 8, Arnold loves white. Since House 2 is the only house left for Arnold, Arnold must be in House 2.\n\nNow, we have:\n- **House 1**: Blue Master smoker\n- **House 2**: Arnold (Pall Mall smoker, cat lover, brown lover)\n- **House 3**: Bob (Blue lover, dog owner)\n- **House 4**: Carol (Prince smoker, bird keeper)\n\nThe only name left for House 1 is Alice.\n\nTherefore, the name of the person who lives in House 1 is:\n\n<<<Alice>>>"
