    "To solve the problem (7.121 - 4.818), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers involved**: The numbers we are dealing with are 7.121 and 4.818.\n\n2. **Understand the operation**: The operation to be performed is subtraction.\n\n3. **Perform the subtraction**: Subtract 4.818 from 7.121.\n\n   \\[\n   7.121 - 4.818 = 2.303\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rounding**: The problem specifies rounding up from the half to a maximum of 12 significant digits. The result 2.303 already has fewer than 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\n5. **Format the answer**: The final answer should be presented in the format specified: <<<answer>>>.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2.303>>>"
