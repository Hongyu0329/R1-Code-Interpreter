    "To solve the expression step by step, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: \n   - Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first: \\( (8.832 - 3.282) \\).\n   - Calculate: \\( 8.832 - 3.282 = 5.550 \\).\n\n2. **Division**:\n   - Evaluate the division in the expression: \\( 9.471 / 2.872 / 3.752 \\).\n   - First, calculate \\( 9.471 / 2.872 \\).\n   - \\( 9.471 / 2.872 \\approx 3.298 \\).\n   - Then, divide the result by 3.752: \\( 3.298 / 3.752 \\).\n   - \\( 3.298 / 3.752 \\approx 0.8786 \\).\n\n3. **Subtraction and Addition**:\n   - Substitute the results back into the expression: \\( 0.8786 - 7.977 + 5.550 \\).\n   - First, perform the subtraction: \\( 0.8786 - 7.977 = -7.0984 \\).\n   - Then, perform the addition: \\( -7.0984 + 5.550 = -1.5484 \\).\n\n4. **Rounding**:\n   - Round the final result to 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half: \\(-1.5484\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<-1.5484>>>"
