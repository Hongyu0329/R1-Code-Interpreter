    "To solve the expression \\(6.619 + \\left(4.402 - \\frac{1.308}{3.249 + 6.602}\\right)\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the denominator of the fraction:**\n   - Add 3.249 and 6.602.\n   - \\(3.249 + 6.602 = 9.851\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the fraction:**\n   - Divide 1.308 by the result from step 1.\n   - \\(\\frac{1.308}{9.851} \\approx 0.132799796\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the expression inside the parentheses:**\n   - Subtract the result from step 2 from 4.402.\n   - \\(4.402 - 0.132799796 \\approx 4.269200204\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the final expression:**\n   - Add 6.619 to the result from step 3.\n   - \\(6.619 + 4.269200204 \\approx 10.888200204\\).\n\n5. **Round the result to 12 significant digits:**\n   - The result is already within 12 significant digits.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<10.888200204>>>"
