    "To solve the problem (0.655 - 9.564), we need to perform a simple subtraction operation. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers involved**: We have two numbers, 0.655 and 9.564.\n\n2. **Understand the operation**: The operation is subtraction, where we subtract the second number (9.564) from the first number (0.655).\n\n3. **Perform the subtraction**: \n   - Align the decimal points of the two numbers.\n   - Subtract each digit starting from the rightmost digit (the thousandths place) and move to the left, borrowing as necessary.\n\n   ```\n     0.655\n   - 9.564\n   --------\n   ```\n\n   - Start from the rightmost digit:\n     - Thousandths place: 5 - 4 = 1\n     - Hundredths place: 5 - 6 = -1 (borrow 1 from the tenths place)\n     - Tenths place: 6 (after borrowing 1 becomes 5) - 5 = 0\n     - Units place: 0 (after borrowing 1 becomes -1) - 9 = -10 (borrow 1 from the tens place, which is 0, so it becomes -1)\n\n   After borrowing and adjusting, the subtraction becomes:\n   ```\n     0.655\n   - 9.564\n   --------\n    -8.909\n   ```\n\n4. **Result**: The result of the subtraction is -8.909.\n\n5. **Rounding**: The problem specifies rounding to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half. In this case, -8.909 already has fewer than 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<-8.909>>>"
