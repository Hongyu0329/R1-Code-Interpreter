    "To solve the expression \\(1.862 + (2.422 - (1.998 - 9.068) + 6.529)\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses**: Start with the innermost parentheses: \\(1.998 - 9.068\\).\n   \\[\n   1.998 - 9.068 = -7.070\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Level Parentheses**: Substitute the result from step 1 into the next level of parentheses: \\(2.422 - (-7.070)\\).\n   \\[\n   2.422 - (-7.070) = 2.422 + 7.070 = 9.492\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add the Remaining Value**: Add the result from step 2 to 6.529.\n   \\[\n   9.492 + 6.529 = 16.021\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Addition**: Add the result from step 3 to 1.862.\n   \\[\n   1.862 + 16.021 = 17.883\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{17.883}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<17.883>>>"
