    "To solve the expression \\(6.742/8.881 + 8.212 \\times 1.906 + 7.243\\), we will break it down into steps and calculate each part carefully:\n\n1. **Division**: Calculate \\(6.742/8.881\\).\n   - Perform the division: \\(6.742 \\div 8.881 \\approx 0.7593\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Calculate \\(8.212 \\times 1.906\\).\n   - Perform the multiplication: \\(8.212 \\times 1.906 \\approx 15.646072\\).\n\n3. **Addition**: Add the results from the division and multiplication to 7.243.\n   - First, add the division result to the multiplication result: \\(0.7593 + 15.646072 \\approx 16.405372\\).\n   - Then, add 7.243 to this sum: \\(16.405372 + 7.243 \\approx 23.648372\\).\n\n4. **Rounding**: Round the final result to 12 significant digits.\n   - The number \\(23.648372\\) is already within 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is needed.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<23.648372>>>"
