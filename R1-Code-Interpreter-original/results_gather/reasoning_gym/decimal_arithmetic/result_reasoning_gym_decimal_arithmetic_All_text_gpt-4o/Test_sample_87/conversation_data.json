    "To solve the expression \\((8.826/1.300/2.925*3.456)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Division and Multiplication from left to right:**\n\n   - First, perform the division \\(8.826 / 1.300\\):\n     \\[\n     8.826 / 1.300 = 6.7892307692307692307692307692308\n     \\]\n\n   - Next, take the result and divide by 2.925:\n     \\[\n     6.7892307692307692307692307692308 / 2.925 = 2.3209230769230769230769230769231\n     \\]\n\n   - Finally, multiply the result by 3.456:\n     \\[\n     2.3209230769230769230769230769231 * 3.456 = 8.0223938461538461538461538461538\n     \\]\n\n2. **Rounding:**\n\n   - The result is \\(8.0223938461538461538461538461538\\).\n   - Round this to 12 significant digits. The 13th digit is 8, which is greater than 5, so we round up the 12th digit:\n     \\[\n     8.022393846154\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<8.022393846154>>>}\n\\]"
