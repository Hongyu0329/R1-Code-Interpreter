    "To solve the expression \\(((4.714-(7.512/7.152))-9.191)/3.225\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the division inside the parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7.512}{7.152} = 1.0505035\\ldots\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the result from 4.714:**\n   \\[\n   4.714 - 1.0505035\\ldots = 3.6634965\\ldots\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract 9.191 from the result:**\n   \\[\n   3.6634965\\ldots - 9.191 = -5.5275035\\ldots\n   \\]\n\n4. **Divide the result by 3.225:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-5.5275035\\ldots}{3.225} = -1.71472868\\ldots\n   \\]\n\n5. **Round the result to 12 significant digits:**\n   \\[\n   -1.71472868657\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<-1.71472868657>>>"
