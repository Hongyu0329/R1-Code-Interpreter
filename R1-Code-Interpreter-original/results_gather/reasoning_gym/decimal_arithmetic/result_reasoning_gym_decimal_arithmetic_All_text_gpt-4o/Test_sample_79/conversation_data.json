    "To solve the problem \\(8.093 - 6.832 - 6.909\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Perform the first subtraction:**\n   - Subtract \\(6.832\\) from \\(8.093\\).\n   - \\(8.093 - 6.832 = 1.261\\).\n\n2. **Perform the second subtraction:**\n   - Subtract \\(6.909\\) from the result of the first subtraction.\n   - \\(1.261 - 6.909 = -5.648\\).\n\n3. **Round the result:**\n   - The result is \\(-5.648\\).\n   - Since we need to round to a maximum of 12 significant digits, and the number of digits in \\(-5.648\\) is less than 12, we keep it as is.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<-5.648>>>"
