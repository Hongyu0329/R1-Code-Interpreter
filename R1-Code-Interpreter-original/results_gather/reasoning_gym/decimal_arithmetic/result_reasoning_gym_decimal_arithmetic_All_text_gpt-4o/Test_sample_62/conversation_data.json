    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Start by solving the expressions within the parentheses.\n\n   - Calculate the first part: \\(2.034 \\times 7.057\\)\n     \\[\n     2.034 \\times 7.057 = 14.353938\n     \\]\n\n   - Calculate the second part: \\(6.077 \\times 9.751\\)\n     \\[\n     6.077 \\times 9.751 = 59.263827\n     \\]\n\n2. **Addition within Parentheses**: Add the results from the first step.\n   \\[\n   14.353938 + 59.263827 = 73.617765\n   \\]\n\n3. **Parentheses**: Calculate the sum in the second set of parentheses.\n   \\[\n   7.134 + 5.849 = 12.983\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiplication**: Multiply the results from steps 2 and 3.\n   \\[\n   73.617765 \\times 12.983 = 956.197978495\n   \\]\n\n5. **Rounding**: Round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n   \\[\n   956.197978495 \\approx 956.197978495\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<956.197978495>>>"
