    "To solve the expression \\((1.858 + (8.994 \\times 5.562) / 8.962)\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   8.994 \\times 5.562 = 50.018628\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide the result by 8.962:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50.018628}{8.962} = 5.581964\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add 1.858 to the result:**\n   \\[\n   1.858 + 5.581964 = 7.439964\n   \\]\n\n4. **Round the result to 12 significant digits:**\n   - The number 7.439964 already has fewer than 12 significant digits, so we do not need to adjust it further.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7.439964}\n\\]\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n<<<7.439964>>>"
