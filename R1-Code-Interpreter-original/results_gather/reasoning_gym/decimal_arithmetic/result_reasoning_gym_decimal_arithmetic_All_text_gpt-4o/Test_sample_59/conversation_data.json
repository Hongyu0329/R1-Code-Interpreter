    "To solve the division problem 2.644/7.211 and provide the answer to a maximum of 12 significant digits, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Division**: We are dividing 2.644 by 7.211. This means we want to find out how many times 7.211 fits into 2.644.\n\n2. **Perform the Division**: Use a calculator or long division to divide 2.644 by 7.211.\n\n3. **Significant Digits**: We need to ensure that the result is expressed to a maximum of 12 significant digits. Significant digits are the meaningful digits in a number. In this case, we will round the result to 12 significant digits.\n\n4. **Rounding**: If the 13th digit is 5 or greater, we round up the 12th digit. If it is less than 5, we leave the 12th digit as is.\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: The final answer should be presented in the format <<<answer>>>.\n\nNow, performing the division:\n\n2.644 ÷ 7.211 ≈ 0.3666468487\n\nThis result is already within 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0.3666468487>>>"
