    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which is typically parentheses first, then addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\n1. **Identify the expression**: \n   \\[\n   ((1.454 - 0.564 + 3.100) - (1.356 + 2.516))\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve the first set of parentheses**: \n   \\[\n   1.454 - 0.564 + 3.100\n   \\]\n   - Subtract \\(0.564\\) from \\(1.454\\):\n     \\[\n     1.454 - 0.564 = 0.890\n     \\]\n   - Add \\(3.100\\) to the result:\n     \\[\n     0.890 + 3.100 = 3.990\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the second set of parentheses**:\n   \\[\n   1.356 + 2.516\n   \\]\n   - Add \\(1.356\\) and \\(2.516\\):\n     \\[\n     1.356 + 2.516 = 3.872\n     \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the results of the two parentheses**:\n   \\[\n   3.990 - 3.872\n   \\]\n   - Subtract \\(3.872\\) from \\(3.990\\):\n     \\[\n     3.990 - 3.872 = 0.118\n     \\]\n\n5. **Round the result to 12 significant digits**:\n   - The result \\(0.118\\) already has fewer than 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0.118>>>}\n\\]"
