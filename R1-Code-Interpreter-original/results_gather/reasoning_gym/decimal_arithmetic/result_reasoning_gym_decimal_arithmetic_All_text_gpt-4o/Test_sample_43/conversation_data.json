    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Start by solving the innermost parentheses first.\n   - Inside the parentheses, we have: \\(5.664 + 1.373\\).\n   - Calculate: \\(5.664 + 1.373 = 7.037\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication inside Parentheses**: Now, multiply the result by 8.136.\n   - Calculate: \\(7.037 \\times 8.136 = 57.244632\\).\n\n3. **Addition**: Add the result to 7.445.\n   - Calculate: \\(7.445 + 57.244632 = 64.689632\\).\n\n4. **Multiplication**: Finally, multiply the result by 4.392.\n   - Calculate: \\(64.689632 \\times 4.392 = 284.091383744\\).\n\n5. **Rounding**: Round the final result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n   - The number 284.091383744 already has 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is needed.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<284.091383744>>>"
