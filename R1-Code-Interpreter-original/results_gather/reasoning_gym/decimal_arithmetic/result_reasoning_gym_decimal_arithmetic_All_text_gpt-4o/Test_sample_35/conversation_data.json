    "To solve the division problem 6.691 divided by 4.373, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Division**: We need to divide the numerator (6.691) by the denominator (4.373).\n\n2. **Perform the Division**: Use a calculator or long division to divide 6.691 by 4.373.\n\n3. **Rounding**: The problem specifies that the answer should be rounded to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The final answer should be presented in the format <<<answer>>>.\n\nNow, let's perform the division:\n\n- 6.691 ÷ 4.373 ≈ 1.529646536701\n\nThis result is already within 12 significant digits. Since the 13th digit is a '0', we do not need to round up.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1.52964653670>>>"
