    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to follow the order of operations, which is typically parentheses first, then addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\n1. **Identify and solve the expressions within parentheses:**\n\n   - The expression within the innermost parentheses is \\( (3.677 + 5.689) \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 3.677 + 5.689 = 9.366 \\).\n\n2. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n\n   - The expression now becomes \\( (5.966 - 5.408) + (9.366 + 5.233) \\).\n\n3. **Solve the remaining expressions within parentheses:**\n\n   - Calculate \\( 5.966 - 5.408 = 0.558 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 9.366 + 5.233 = 14.599 \\).\n\n4. **Add the results from the previous step:**\n\n   - Calculate \\( 0.558 + 14.599 = 15.157 \\).\n\n5. **Round the final result to 12 significant digits:**\n\n   - The result is already at 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<15.157>>>"
