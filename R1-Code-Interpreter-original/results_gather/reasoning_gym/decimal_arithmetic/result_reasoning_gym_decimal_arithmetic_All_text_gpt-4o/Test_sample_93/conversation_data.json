    "To solve the problem \\(9.809 \\times 5.752 - 0.070\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: First, multiply 9.809 by 5.752.\n   - Calculate \\(9.809 \\times 5.752\\).\n\n2. **Subtraction**: Subtract 0.070 from the result of the multiplication.\n   - Take the result from step 1 and subtract 0.070.\n\n3. **Rounding**: Round the final result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n1. **Multiplication**:\n   - \\(9.809 \\times 5.752 = 56.426968\\).\n\n2. **Subtraction**:\n   - \\(56.426968 - 0.070 = 56.356968\\).\n\n3. **Rounding**:\n   - The result \\(56.356968\\) is already within 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is needed.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<56.356968>>>"
