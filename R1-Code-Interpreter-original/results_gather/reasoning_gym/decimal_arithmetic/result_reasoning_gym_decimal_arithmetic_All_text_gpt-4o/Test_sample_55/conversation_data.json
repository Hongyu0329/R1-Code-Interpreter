    "To solve the expression \\(8.857 + 5.496 \\times 5.959\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the operations**: The expression involves addition and multiplication. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we perform multiplication before addition.\n\n2. **Perform the multiplication**: Calculate \\(5.496 \\times 5.959\\).\n\n3. **Perform the addition**: Add the result of the multiplication to 8.857.\n\n4. **Round the result**: Round the final result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: \n   \\[\n   5.496 \\times 5.959 = 32.742864\n   \\]\n\n2. **Addition**:\n   \\[\n   8.857 + 32.742864 = 41.599864\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rounding**: The result 41.599864 is already within 12 significant digits. However, we ensure it is rounded correctly. Since the number is already precise to 8 significant digits, no further rounding is needed.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<41.599864>>>"
