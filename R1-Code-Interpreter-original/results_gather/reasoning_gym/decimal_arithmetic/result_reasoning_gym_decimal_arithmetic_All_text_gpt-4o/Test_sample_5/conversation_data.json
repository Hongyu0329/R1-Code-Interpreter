    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: First, solve the expression inside the parentheses.\n   - Calculate the sum: \\(8.439 + 7.172 + 9.842\\).\n   - Sum = \\(25.453\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Multiply the result by 6.935.\n   - \\(25.453 \\times 6.935 = 176.451455\\).\n\n3. **Division**: Divide the result by 0.812.\n   - \\(176.451455 \\div 0.812 = 217.288889\\).\n\n4. **Addition**: Add 1.232 to the result.\n   - \\(217.288889 + 1.232 = 218.520889\\).\n\nFinally, round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<218.520889>>>."
