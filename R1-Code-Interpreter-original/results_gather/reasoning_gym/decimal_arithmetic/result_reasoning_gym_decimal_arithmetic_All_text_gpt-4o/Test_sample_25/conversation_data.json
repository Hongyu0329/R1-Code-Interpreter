    "To solve the problem 9.662 + 8.424, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Align the Numbers**: Write the numbers one below the other, aligning the decimal points:\n   ```\n   9.662\n + 8.424\n   ```\n\n2. **Add the Numbers Digit by Digit**: Start adding from the rightmost digit (the thousandths place) and move to the left, carrying over if necessary.\n\n   - **Thousandths Place**: 2 + 4 = 6\n   - **Hundredths Place**: 6 + 2 = 8\n   - **Tenths Place**: 6 + 4 = 10, write down 0 and carry over 1 to the units place.\n   - **Units Place**: 9 + 8 = 17, plus the 1 carried over = 18, write down 8 and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n\n3. **Final Carry Over**: Since there is no digit in the tens place to add to, the carried over 1 becomes the tens digit.\n\n4. **Combine the Results**: The result of the addition is 18.086.\n\n5. **Rounding**: The problem specifies rounding to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half. In this case, 18.086 already has fewer than 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<18.086>>>"
