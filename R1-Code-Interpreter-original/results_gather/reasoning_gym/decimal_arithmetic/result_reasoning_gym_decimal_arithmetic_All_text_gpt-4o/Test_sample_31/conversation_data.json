    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to carefully evaluate each part of the expression:\n\n1. **Numerator Calculation:**\n   - Multiply 4.819 by 1.427.\n   - Calculation: \\(4.819 \\times 1.427 = 6.874213\\).\n\n2. **Denominator Calculation:**\n   - Subtract 1.212 from 1.236.\n   - Calculation: \\(1.236 - 1.212 = 0.024\\).\n   - Multiply the result by 3.645.\n   - Calculation: \\(0.024 \\times 3.645 = 0.08748\\).\n\n3. **Final Division:**\n   - Divide the result of the numerator by the result of the denominator.\n   - Calculation: \\(\\frac{6.874213}{0.08748} = 78.573297\\).\n\n4. **Rounding:**\n   - Round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<78.573297>>>"
