    "To solve the expression step by step, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first.\n   - Calculate \\(7.142 - 1.762\\).\n   - Result: \\(5.380\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Multiply the result from the parentheses by 2.161.\n   - Calculate \\(2.161 \\times 5.380\\).\n   - Result: \\(11.61958\\).\n\n3. **Division**: Divide the result from the multiplication by 3.573.\n   - Calculate \\(11.61958 / 3.573\\).\n   - Result: \\(3.251063\\).\n\n4. **Subtraction**: Subtract 3.558 from the result of the division.\n   - Calculate \\(3.251063 - 3.558\\).\n   - Result: \\(-0.306937\\).\n\n5. **Addition**: Add 6.944 to the result of the subtraction.\n   - Calculate \\(-0.306937 + 6.944\\).\n   - Result: \\(6.637063\\).\n\nFinally, round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<6.637063>>>."
