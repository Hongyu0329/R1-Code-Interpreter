    "To solve the expression \\((9.121-4.806)*(7.966*1.067/5.404)\\), we will break it down into smaller steps and calculate each part carefully.\n\n1. **Calculate the subtraction in the first part:**\n   \\[\n   9.121 - 4.806 = 4.315\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the multiplication in the second part:**\n   \\[\n   7.966 \\times 1.067 = 8.501422\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the division in the second part:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8.501422}{5.404} = 1.573671\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the results from step 1 and step 3:**\n   \\[\n   4.315 \\times 1.573671 = 6.789999\n   \\]\n\n5. **Round the final result to 12 significant digits:**\n   \\[\n   6.789999 \\text{ (already has fewer than 12 significant digits)}\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<6.789999>>>}\n\\]"
