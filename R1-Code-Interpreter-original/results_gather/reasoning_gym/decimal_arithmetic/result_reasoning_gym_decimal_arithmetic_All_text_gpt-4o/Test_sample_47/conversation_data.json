    "To solve the problem \\(((5.727-4.029)/1.084)\\), we will break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Subtraction in the Numerator**: \n   - Calculate \\(5.727 - 4.029\\).\n   - This results in \\(1.698\\).\n\n2. **Division**:\n   - Divide the result from the subtraction by the denominator \\(1.084\\).\n   - Calculate \\(1.698 / 1.084\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Division**:\n   - The division results in approximately \\(1.566176470588\\).\n\n4. **Rounding**:\n   - Round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n   - The result \\(1.566176470588\\) is already within 12 significant digits.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1.56617647059>>>"
