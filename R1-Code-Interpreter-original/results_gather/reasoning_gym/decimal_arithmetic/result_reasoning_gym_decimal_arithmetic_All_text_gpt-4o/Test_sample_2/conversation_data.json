    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: \n   - Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first: \\(9.597 + 0.491\\).\n   - \\(9.597 + 0.491 = 10.088\\).\n\n2. **Division**:\n   - Calculate the division inside the parentheses: \\(1.058 / 5.590\\).\n   - \\(1.058 / 5.590 \\approx 0.1894463668\\).\n\n3. **Division**:\n   - Divide the result from step 1 by the result from step 2: \\(10.088 / 0.1894463668\\).\n   - \\(10.088 / 0.1894463668 \\approx 53.24719101\\).\n\n4. **Multiplication**:\n   - Calculate the multiplication: \\(1.581 \\times 0.025\\).\n   - \\(1.581 \\times 0.025 = 0.039525\\).\n\n5. **Addition**:\n   - Add the results from step 3 and step 4: \\(53.24719101 + 0.039525\\).\n   - \\(53.24719101 + 0.039525 = 53.28671601\\).\n\nFinally, round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<53.28671601>>>"
