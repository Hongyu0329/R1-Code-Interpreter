    "To solve the expression \\( (8.014 + \\frac{3.222}{9.035} \\times 8.928) \\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: The entire expression is within parentheses, but we need to evaluate the operations inside first.\n\n2. **Division**: Evaluate the division inside the parentheses:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3.222}{9.035} \\approx 0.356563032\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiplication**: Multiply the result of the division by 8.928:\n   \\[\n   0.356563032 \\times 8.928 \\approx 3.183999999\n   \\]\n\n4. **Addition**: Add the result of the multiplication to 8.014:\n   \\[\n   8.014 + 3.183999999 \\approx 11.197999999\n   \\]\n\n5. **Rounding**: Round the result to 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half:\n   \\[\n   11.198000000000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<11.198000000000>>>"
