    "To solve the expression \\(3.233 - (1.886 \\times 9.141) - 9.108\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the multiplication**: \n   - First, compute \\(1.886 \\times 9.141\\).\n   - This results in approximately \\(17.239926\\).\n\n2. **Substitute the multiplication result back into the expression**:\n   - The expression now becomes \\(3.233 - 17.239926 - 9.108\\).\n\n3. **Perform the subtraction**:\n   - First, subtract \\(17.239926\\) from \\(3.233\\).\n   - This results in approximately \\(-14.006926\\).\n\n4. **Continue with the subtraction**:\n   - Now subtract \\(9.108\\) from \\(-14.006926\\).\n   - This results in approximately \\(-23.114926\\).\n\n5. **Round the result**:\n   - The result \\(-23.114926\\) is already to 12 significant digits, but we need to ensure rounding is correct.\n   - Since the next digit after the 12th significant digit is not greater than 5, we do not need to round up.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<-23.114926>>>"
