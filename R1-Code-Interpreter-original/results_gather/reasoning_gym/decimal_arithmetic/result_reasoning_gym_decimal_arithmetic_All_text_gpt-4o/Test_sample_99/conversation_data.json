    "To solve the expression \\(8.324 + ((4.700 + 2.019) \\times 2.816)\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the expression inside the innermost parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   4.700 + 2.019 = 6.719\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply the result by 2.816:**\n   \\[\n   6.719 \\times 2.816 = 18.914304\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add the result to 8.324:**\n   \\[\n   8.324 + 18.914304 = 27.238304\n   \\]\n\n4. **Round the result to 12 significant digits:**\n   - The number 27.238304 already has fewer than 12 significant digits, so no rounding is necessary beyond ensuring it is presented to 12 significant digits.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{<<<27.238304>>>}\n\\]"
