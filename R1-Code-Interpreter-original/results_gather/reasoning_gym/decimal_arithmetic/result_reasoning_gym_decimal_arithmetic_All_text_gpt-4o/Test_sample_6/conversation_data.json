    "To solve the problem \\(((1.665+7.592) \\times 9.963 - 5.375) \\times 5.044\\), we will break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the sum inside the parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   1.665 + 7.592 = 9.257\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply the result by 9.963:**\n   \\[\n   9.257 \\times 9.963 = 92.222091\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract 5.375 from the result:**\n   \\[\n   92.222091 - 5.375 = 86.847091\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the result by 5.044:**\n   \\[\n   86.847091 \\times 5.044 = 438.086282004\n   \\]\n\n5. **Round the result to 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half:**\n   \\[\n   438.086282004 \\approx 438.086282004\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<438.086282004>>>"
