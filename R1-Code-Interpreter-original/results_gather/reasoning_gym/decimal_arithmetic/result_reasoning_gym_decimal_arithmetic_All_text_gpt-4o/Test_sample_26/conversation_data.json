    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: First, solve the expressions within the parentheses.\n   - Calculate the denominator's inner parentheses: \\(9.503 + 8.023 = 17.526\\).\n\n2. **Division and Multiplication**: Next, handle the division and multiplication in the denominator.\n   - Calculate the multiplication in the denominator: \\(5.791 \\times 7.374 = 42.694734\\).\n   - Divide the result by the sum calculated in step 1: \\(42.694734 / 17.526 = 2.436\\).\n\n3. **Subtraction**: Now, solve the subtraction in the numerator.\n   - Calculate the numerator: \\(3.371 - 3.153 = 0.218\\).\n\n4. **Final Division**: Finally, divide the result of the numerator by the result of the denominator.\n   - Divide the numerator by the denominator: \\(0.218 / 2.436 = 0.0895225464\\).\n\n5. **Rounding**: Round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n   - The result is already within 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is needed.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0.0895225464>>>"
