    "To solve the expression \\((0.757/(5.397-8.987)-(4.509-(7.889/1.703)))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the denominator of the first fraction:**\n   \\[\n   5.397 - 8.987 = -3.590\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the first fraction:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{0.757}{-3.590} = -0.210585\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the division in the second part of the expression:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7.889}{1.703} = 4.632471\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the subtraction in the second part of the expression:**\n   \\[\n   4.509 - 4.632471 = -0.123471\n   \\]\n\n5. **Combine the results:**\n   \\[\n   -0.210585 - (-0.123471) = -0.210585 + 0.123471 = -0.087114\n   \\]\n\nFinally, rounding the result to 12 significant digits, we get:\n\n<<<-0.087114>>>"
