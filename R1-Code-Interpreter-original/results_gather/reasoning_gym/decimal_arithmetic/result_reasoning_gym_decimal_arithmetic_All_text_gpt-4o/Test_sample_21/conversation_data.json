    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: \n   - Calculate the expression inside the parentheses: \\(4.277 + 0.769 \\times 7.224\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication inside Parentheses**:\n   - First, calculate \\(0.769 \\times 7.224\\).\n\n3. **Addition inside Parentheses**:\n   - Add the result of the multiplication to 4.277.\n\n4. **Division**:\n   - Calculate \\(7.480 / 7.449\\).\n\n5. **Multiplication**:\n   - Multiply the result of the addition inside the parentheses by 2.774.\n\n6. **Addition**:\n   - Add the result of the division to the result of the multiplication.\n\nNow, let's perform these calculations:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(0.769 \\times 7.224\\)**:\n   - \\(0.769 \\times 7.224 = 5.563056\\).\n\n2. **Add to 4.277**:\n   - \\(4.277 + 5.563056 = 9.840056\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\(7.480 / 7.449\\)**:\n   - \\(7.480 / 7.449 = 1.004162330905\\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 2.774**:\n   - \\(2.774 \\times 9.840056 = 27.293835344\\).\n\n5. **Add the results**:\n   - \\(1.004162330905 + 27.293835344 = 28.297997674905\\).\n\nFinally, round the result to 12 significant digits:\n\n<<<28.2980000000>>>"
