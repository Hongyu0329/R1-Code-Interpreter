    "To solve the problem \\(((5.511 - 2.516) \\times 8.807)\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Subtraction inside the parentheses:**\n   - Calculate \\(5.511 - 2.516\\).\n   - This equals \\(2.995\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the result from step 1 by 8.807.\n   - Calculate \\(2.995 \\times 8.807\\).\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   - \\(2.995 \\times 8.807 = 26.384965\\).\n\n4. **Rounding:**\n   - Round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n   - The result is already within 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is needed.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<26.384965>>>"
