    "To solve the problem 5.636 * 9.810, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to multiply two decimal numbers, 5.636 and 9.810, and provide the result rounded to a maximum of 12 significant digits.\n\n2. **Perform the Multiplication**: Multiply the two numbers:\n   \\[\n   5.636 \\times 9.810 = 55.29716\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rounding**: The result, 55.29716, needs to be rounded to a maximum of 12 significant digits. In this case, the number already has fewer than 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the specified format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<55.29716>>>"
