    "To solve the problem \\(((7.882 \\times 7.394) \\times 8.002)\\), we will break it down into steps and ensure precision at each step.\n\n1. **First Multiplication:**\n   - Calculate \\(7.882 \\times 7.394\\).\n   - This involves multiplying two numbers with four decimal places each, so we need to be careful with precision.\n\n2. **Second Multiplication:**\n   - Take the result from the first multiplication and multiply it by 8.002.\n   - Again, ensure precision as we are dealing with numbers with decimal places.\n\n3. **Rounding:**\n   - The problem specifies rounding up from the half to a maximum of 12 significant digits.\n   - This means if the 13th digit is 5 or more, we round the 12th digit up.\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(7.882 \\times 7.394\\):**\n   - The result of this multiplication is approximately 58.270108.\n\n2. **Multiply the result by 8.002:**\n   - \\(58.270108 \\times 8.002 \\approx 466.234676216\\).\n\n3. **Rounding:**\n   - The result \\(466.234676216\\) is already within 12 significant digits.\n   - No further rounding is needed as the 13th digit is not present.\n\nThus, the final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<466.234676216>>>"
