    "To solve the expression step by step, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Start with the innermost parentheses.\n   - Inside the parentheses, we have: \\(1.968 / 8.586\\).\n   - Calculate \\(1.968 / 8.586\\).\n\n2. **Division**: Perform the division.\n   - \\(1.968 / 8.586 = 0.2292\\) (rounded to four decimal places for intermediate steps).\n\n3. **Multiplication**: Multiply the result by 2.800.\n   - \\(0.2292 \\times 2.800 = 0.64176\\).\n\n4. **Subtraction**: Subtract the result from 2.980.\n   - \\(2.980 - 0.64176 = 2.33824\\).\n\n5. **Multiplication**: Multiply the result by 8.237.\n   - \\(2.33824 \\times 8.237 = 19.263\\).\n\n6. **Addition**: Add the result to 5.231.\n   - \\(5.231 + 19.263 = 24.494\\).\n\nFinally, round the result to 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<24.494>>>"
