    "To solve the expression \\(5.258 - 7.557 \\times 6.170\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify the operations**: The expression involves subtraction and multiplication.\n2. **Perform the multiplication first**: \n   - Calculate \\(7.557 \\times 6.170\\).\n   - Multiply the numbers: \\(7.557 \\times 6.170 = 46.62429\\).\n3. **Perform the subtraction**:\n   - Subtract the result of the multiplication from 5.258: \n   - \\(5.258 - 46.62429 = -41.36629\\).\n\nFinally, round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-41.36629>>>."
