    "To solve the expression \\(1.279 + 7.556 \\times (8.014 + 3.646) + 3.690\\), we will follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: First, solve the expression inside the parentheses.\n   \\[\n   8.014 + 3.646 = 11.660\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Next, perform the multiplication.\n   \\[\n   7.556 \\times 11.660 = 88.08096\n   \\]\n\n3. **Addition**: Finally, perform the addition operations from left to right.\n   \\[\n   1.279 + 88.08096 + 3.690 = 93.04996\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rounding**: Round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n   \\[\n   93.04996 \\rightarrow 93.04996\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{<<<93.04996>>>}\n\\]"
