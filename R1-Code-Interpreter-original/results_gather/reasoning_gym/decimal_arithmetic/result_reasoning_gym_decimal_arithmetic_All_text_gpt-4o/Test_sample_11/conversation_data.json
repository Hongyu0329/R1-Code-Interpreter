    "To solve the division problem \\( \\frac{2.359}{1.578} \\) and provide the answer to a maximum of 12 significant digits, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to divide 2.359 by 1.578 and round the result to 12 significant digits.\n\n2. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division of 2.359 by 1.578 using a calculator or long division.\n\n3. **Rounding**: Once the division is performed, ensure the result is rounded to 12 significant digits. If the 13th digit is 5 or more, round up the 12th digit.\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: Present the final answer in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's perform the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2.359}{1.578} \\approx 1.494297635 \\]\n\nSince this result is already less than 12 digits, we don't need to add any additional zeros. The result is already rounded to the maximum precision given the number of significant digits in the division.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1.494297635>>>"
