    "To solve the expression \\( (6.310 \\times 3.210 + 3.520) \\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: First, calculate the product of 6.310 and 3.210.\n   - \\( 6.310 \\times 3.210 = 20.2551 \\)\n\n2. **Addition**: Next, add 3.520 to the result of the multiplication.\n   - \\( 20.2551 + 3.520 = 23.7751 \\)\n\n3. **Rounding**: Finally, round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n   - The number 23.7751 already has fewer than 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<23.7751>>>"
