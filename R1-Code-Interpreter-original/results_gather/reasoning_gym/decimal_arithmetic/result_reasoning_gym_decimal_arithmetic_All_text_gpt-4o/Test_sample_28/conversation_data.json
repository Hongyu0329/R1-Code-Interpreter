    "To solve the expression \\(9.470 - \\left(\\frac{3.763}{5.449} + 3.039\\right)\\), we will break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the division**: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{3.763}{5.449}\n   \\]\n   Perform the division to get the result.\n\n2. **Add the result of the division to 3.039**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{3.763}{5.449}\\right) + 3.039\n   \\]\n   Add the result from step 1 to 3.039.\n\n3. **Subtract the result from 9.470**:\n   \\[\n   9.470 - \\left(\\frac{3.763}{5.449} + 3.039\\right)\n   \\]\n   Subtract the result from step 2 from 9.470.\n\n4. **Round the final result**:\n   Ensure the final result is rounded to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations:\n\n1. **Division**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3.763}{5.449} \\approx 0.690646\n   \\]\n\n2. **Addition**:\n   \\[\n   0.690646 + 3.039 = 3.729646\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtraction**:\n   \\[\n   9.470 - 3.729646 = 5.740354\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rounding**:\n   The result 5.740354 is already within 12 significant digits.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5.740354>>>"
