    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\n1. **Parentheses**: \n   - Calculate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\(9.515 + 5.116\\).\n     \\[\n     9.515 + 5.116 = 14.631\n     \\]\n\n2. **Multiplication**:\n   - Multiply the result from step 1 by 2.684.\n     \\[\n     14.631 \\times 2.684 = 39.270204\n     \\]\n   - Multiply the result from the previous multiplication by 2.418.\n     \\[\n     39.270204 \\times 2.418 = 94.960253672\n     \\]\n\n3. **Subtraction**:\n   - Calculate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\(5.756 - 6.332\\).\n     \\[\n     5.756 - 6.332 = -0.576\n     \\]\n\n4. **Addition**:\n   - Add the results from the multiplication and subtraction steps.\n     \\[\n     94.960253672 + (-0.576) = 94.384253672\n     \\]\n\n5. **Rounding**:\n   - Round the final result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n     \\[\n     94.384253672 \\approx 94.384253672\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<94.384253672>>>"
