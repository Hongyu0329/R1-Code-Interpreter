    "To solve the problem \\(((8.276 \\times 2.736) \\times 0.547)\\), we will break it down into steps and ensure precision at each step.\n\n1. **Multiply 8.276 by 2.736:**\n   - First, calculate \\(8.276 \\times 2.736\\).\n   - This multiplication gives us a result of approximately 22.641936.\n\n2. **Multiply the result by 0.547:**\n   - Now, take the result from step 1 and multiply it by 0.547.\n   - Calculate \\(22.641936 \\times 0.547\\).\n   - This multiplication gives us a result of approximately 12.379238592.\n\n3. **Round the result to 12 significant digits:**\n   - The result from step 2 is 12.379238592.\n   - Since we need to round to 12 significant digits, and the number already has fewer than 12 digits, we simply ensure the precision is maintained.\n   - The number is already precise to 12 significant digits.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<12.379238592>>>"
