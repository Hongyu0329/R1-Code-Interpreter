    "To solve the expression \\(7.049/(4.218/0.671)/1.679\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: First, solve the expression inside the parentheses: \\(4.218/0.671\\).\n   - Calculate \\(4.218 \\div 0.671\\).\n\n2. **Division**: Use the result from step 1 to continue with the division in the main expression.\n   - Divide \\(7.049\\) by the result from step 1.\n\n3. **Division**: Finally, divide the result from step 2 by \\(1.679\\).\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations step by step:\n\n1. Calculate \\(4.218 \\div 0.671\\):\n   - \\(4.218 \\div 0.671 \\approx 6.28540149\\).\n\n2. Divide \\(7.049\\) by the result from step 1:\n   - \\(7.049 \\div 6.28540149 \\approx 1.12146893\\).\n\n3. Divide the result from step 2 by \\(1.679\\):\n   - \\(1.12146893 \\div 1.679 \\approx 0.667999999\\).\n\nFinally, round the result to 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half:\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0.668000000000>>>."
