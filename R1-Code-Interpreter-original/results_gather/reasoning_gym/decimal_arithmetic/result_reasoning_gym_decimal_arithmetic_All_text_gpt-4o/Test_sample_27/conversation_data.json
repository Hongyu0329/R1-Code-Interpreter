    "To solve the problem, we need to add the three numbers together and ensure the result is rounded to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\n1. **Identify the numbers to be added:**\n   - 7.529\n   - 4.914\n   - 7.946\n\n2. **Perform the addition:**\n   - Add the numbers: 7.529 + 4.914 + 7.946\n\n3. **Calculate the sum:**\n   - 7.529 + 4.914 = 12.443\n   - 12.443 + 7.946 = 20.389\n\n4. **Round the result:**\n   - The sum is 20.389, which already has fewer than 12 significant digits.\n   - Since the number of significant digits is less than 12, no rounding is necessary beyond the decimal places already present.\n\n5. **Format the final answer:**\n   - Ensure the answer is presented in the specified format.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<20.389>>>."
