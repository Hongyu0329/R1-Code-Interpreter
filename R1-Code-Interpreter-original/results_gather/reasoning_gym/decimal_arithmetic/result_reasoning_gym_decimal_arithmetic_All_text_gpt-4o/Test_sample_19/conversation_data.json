    "To solve the expression \\(4.032 - \\frac{6.511}{9.603}\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Division**: First, calculate the division \\(\\frac{6.511}{9.603}\\).\n   - Perform the division: \\(6.511 \\div 9.603 \\approx 0.678000104\\).\n\n2. **Subtraction**: Next, subtract the result of the division from 4.032.\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(4.032 - 0.678000104 \\approx 3.353999896\\).\n\n3. **Rounding**: Round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n   - The number \\(3.353999896\\) is already within 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is needed.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<3.353999896>>>"
