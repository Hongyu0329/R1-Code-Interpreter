    "To solve the expression \\((1.068 - (5.078 \\times 8.324) - 0.128 \\times 2.012) + 7.719\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(5.078 \\times 8.324\\)\n   - \\(0.128 \\times 2.012\\)\n\n2. **Perform the multiplications:**\n   - \\(5.078 \\times 8.324 = 42.258472\\)\n   - \\(0.128 \\times 2.012 = 0.257536\\)\n\n3. **Substitute these values back into the expression:**\n   - \\(1.068 - 42.258472 - 0.257536\\)\n\n4. **Perform the subtraction inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(1.068 - 42.258472 = -41.190472\\)\n   - \\(-41.190472 - 0.257536 = -41.448008\\)\n\n5. **Add the result to 7.719:**\n   - \\(-41.448008 + 7.719 = -33.729008\\)\n\n6. **Round the final result to 12 significant digits:**\n   - The result is already within 12 significant digits.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<-33.729008>>>"
