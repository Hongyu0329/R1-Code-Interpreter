    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify the operations**: The expression is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{2.159 \\times 4.685}{9.286}\\right) + (6.007 + 0.142 + 8.115)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perform the multiplication and division inside the parentheses**:\n   - First, calculate \\(2.159 \\times 4.685\\):\n     \\[\n     2.159 \\times 4.685 = 10.112315\n     \\]\n   - Next, divide the result by 9.286:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10.112315}{9.286} = 1.089011\n     \\]\n\n3. **Perform the addition inside the parentheses**:\n   - Calculate \\(6.007 + 0.142 + 8.115\\):\n     \\[\n     6.007 + 0.142 + 8.115 = 14.264\n     \\]\n\n4. **Add the results from steps 2 and 3**:\n   - Add \\(1.089011\\) and \\(14.264\\):\n     \\[\n     1.089011 + 14.264 = 15.353011\n     \\]\n\n5. **Round the final result to 12 significant digits**:\n   - The number \\(15.353011\\) already has fewer than 12 significant digits, so no rounding is necessary beyond ensuring it is expressed to 12 significant digits.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{<<<15.353011>>>}\n\\]"
