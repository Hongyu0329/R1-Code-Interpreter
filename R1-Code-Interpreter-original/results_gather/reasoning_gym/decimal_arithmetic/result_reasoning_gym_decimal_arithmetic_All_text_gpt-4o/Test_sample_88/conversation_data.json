    "To solve the expression \\((3.091/(5.164-4.116)*(2.638+(4.902-4.693)))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the denominator of the first fraction:**\n   \\[\n   5.164 - 4.116 = 1.048\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the numerator of the first fraction:**\n   \\[\n   3.091\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide the numerator by the denominator:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3.091}{1.048} = 2.949904762\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the expression inside the parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   4.902 - 4.693 = 0.209\n   \\]\n\n5. **Add the result to 2.638:**\n   \\[\n   2.638 + 0.209 = 2.847\n   \\]\n\n6. **Multiply the result of the division by the result of the addition:**\n   \\[\n   2.949904762 \\times 2.847 = 8.398\n   \\]\n\nFinally, rounding the result to 12 significant digits, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Final Answer: } \\boxed{8.398}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8.398>>>"
