    "To solve the problem \\((6.096 + 9.141) + 4.463\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the sum inside the parentheses:**\n   - Add 6.096 and 9.141.\n   - \\(6.096 + 9.141 = 15.237\\).\n\n2. **Add the result to the remaining number:**\n   - Add 15.237 and 4.463.\n   - \\(15.237 + 4.463 = 19.700\\).\n\n3. **Round the result to 12 significant digits:**\n   - The result 19.700 already has fewer than 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<19.700>>>"
