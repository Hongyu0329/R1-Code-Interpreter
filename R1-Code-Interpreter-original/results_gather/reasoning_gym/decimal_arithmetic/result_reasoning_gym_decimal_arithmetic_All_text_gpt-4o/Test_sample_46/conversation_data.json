    "To solve the expression \\((4.919 \\times 0.560) - 3.092\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply 4.919 by 0.560:**\n   - Calculate \\(4.919 \\times 0.560\\).\n   - This multiplication gives us 2.75464.\n\n2. **Subtract 3.092 from the result of the multiplication:**\n   - Take the result from step 1, which is 2.75464, and subtract 3.092 from it.\n   - \\(2.75464 - 3.092 = -0.33736\\).\n\n3. **Round the result to 12 significant digits:**\n   - The result of the subtraction is \\(-0.33736\\).\n   - Since we need to round to 12 significant digits, and the number of digits in \\(-0.33736\\) is less than 12, we simply ensure the precision is maintained as is.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<-0.33736>>>"
