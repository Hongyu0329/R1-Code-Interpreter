    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Start by solving the innermost parentheses first.\n   - Inside the parentheses, we have: \\(3.176 + 1.792 \\times 6.341\\).\n   - According to the order of operations, perform the multiplication first: \\(1.792 \\times 6.341 = 11.359072\\).\n   - Now add the result to 3.176: \\(3.176 + 11.359072 = 14.535072\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Next, multiply the result by 2.930.\n   - \\(14.535072 \\times 2.930 = 42.59056176\\).\n\n3. **Addition**: Finally, add the remaining numbers in the expression.\n   - \\(8.094 + 0.211 + 42.59056176 = 50.89556176\\).\n\n4. **Rounding**: Round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n   - The number 50.89556176 already has fewer than 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is needed.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<50.89556176>>>"
