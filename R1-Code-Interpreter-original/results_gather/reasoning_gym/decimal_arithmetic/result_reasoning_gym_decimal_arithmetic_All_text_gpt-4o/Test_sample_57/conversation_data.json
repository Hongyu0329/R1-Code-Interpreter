    "To solve the problem 2.304 * 2.451 and provide the answer to a maximum of 12 significant digits, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers involved**: The numbers to be multiplied are 2.304 and 2.451.\n\n2. **Perform the multiplication**: Multiply the two numbers together.\n\n3. **Determine the number of significant digits**: The result should be rounded to a maximum of 12 significant digits. Since both numbers have 4 significant digits, the result should also be rounded to 4 significant digits.\n\n4. **Round the result**: If the result has more than 4 significant digits, round it to 4 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\n5. **Format the answer**: Present the final answer in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's perform the multiplication:\n\n2.304 * 2.451 = 5.644704\n\nSince the result has more than 4 significant digits, we round it to 4 significant digits:\n\n5.644704 rounds to 5.645 (since the digit after the fourth significant digit is 7, which is greater than 5, we round up).\n\nFinally, present the answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<5.645>>>"
