    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: First, solve the operations inside the parentheses.\n   - Inside the parentheses, we have: \\( (7.222 + 0.972) - 0.872 \\).\n   - First, perform the addition: \\( 7.222 + 0.972 = 8.194 \\).\n   - Then, perform the subtraction: \\( 8.194 - 0.872 = 7.322 \\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Now, multiply the results from the operations inside the parentheses with the other multiplication operation.\n   - We have: \\( (4.019 \\times 2.104) \\times 7.322 \\).\n   - First, calculate the multiplication: \\( 4.019 \\times 2.104 = 8.459576 \\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by 7.322: \\( 8.459576 \\times 7.322 = 61.94767387 \\).\n\n3. **Rounding**: Finally, round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n   - The result \\( 61.94767387 \\) is already within 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is needed.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<61.94767387>>>"
