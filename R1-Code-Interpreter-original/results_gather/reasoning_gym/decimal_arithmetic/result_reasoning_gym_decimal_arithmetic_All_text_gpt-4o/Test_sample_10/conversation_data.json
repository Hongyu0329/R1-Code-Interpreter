    "To solve the problem (4.507 - 2.287), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers involved**: We have two numbers, 4.507 and 2.287.\n\n2. **Understand the operation**: The operation to be performed is subtraction.\n\n3. **Perform the subtraction**: Subtract the second number from the first number:\n   \\[\n   4.507 - 2.287 = 2.220\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rounding**: The problem specifies rounding up from the half to a maximum of 12 significant digits. The result 2.220 already has fewer than 12 significant digits, so no rounding is necessary.\n\n5. **Format the answer**: The final answer should be presented in the specified format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<2.220>>>"
