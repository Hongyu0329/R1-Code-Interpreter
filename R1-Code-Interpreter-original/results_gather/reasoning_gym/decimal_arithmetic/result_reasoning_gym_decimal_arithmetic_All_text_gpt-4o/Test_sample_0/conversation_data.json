    "To solve the problem, we need to multiply the two numbers given: 2.370 and 8.131. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: We have two numbers to multiply: 2.370 and 8.131.\n\n2. **Perform the Multiplication**: Multiply the two numbers together.\n   - 2.370 * 8.131 = 19.27047\n\n3. **Rounding**: The problem specifies that the answer should be rounded to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n   - The result from the multiplication is 19.27047, which already has fewer than 12 significant digits.\n   - Since there are no additional digits beyond the decimal point that would affect rounding, the number remains as is.\n\n4. **Formatting the Answer**: The final answer should be presented in the format specified: <<<answer>>>.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<19.27047>>>"
