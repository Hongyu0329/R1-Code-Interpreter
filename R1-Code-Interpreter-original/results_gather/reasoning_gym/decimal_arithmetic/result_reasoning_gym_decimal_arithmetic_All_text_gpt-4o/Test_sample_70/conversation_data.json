    "To solve the expression \\(2.781 - \\frac{4.798}{8.686}\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Division**: Calculate the division part of the expression first, which is \\(\\frac{4.798}{8.686}\\).\n   - Perform the division: \\(4.798 \\div 8.686\\).\n\n2. **Subtraction**: Subtract the result of the division from 2.781.\n   - Calculate: \\(2.781 - \\text{(result from division)}\\).\n\n3. **Rounding**: Round the final result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. **Division**: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{4.798}{8.686} \\approx 0.552292\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtraction**:\n   \\[\n   2.781 - 0.552292 = 2.228708\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rounding**: The result \\(2.228708\\) is already within 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<2.228708>>>"
