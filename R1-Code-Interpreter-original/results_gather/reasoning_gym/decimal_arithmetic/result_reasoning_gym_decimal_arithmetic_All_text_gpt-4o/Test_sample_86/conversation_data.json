    "To solve the problem \\(((1.623 \\times 0.295) \\times 0.432)\\), we will break it down into steps and ensure precision at each step.\n\n1. **First Multiplication:**\n   - Calculate \\(1.623 \\times 0.295\\).\n   - This results in \\(0.478785\\).\n\n2. **Second Multiplication:**\n   - Take the result from the first multiplication and multiply it by \\(0.432\\).\n   - Calculate \\(0.478785 \\times 0.432\\).\n   - This results in \\(0.20697312\\).\n\n3. **Rounding:**\n   - The problem specifies rounding to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n   - The number \\(0.20697312\\) already has fewer than 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.20697312>>>"
