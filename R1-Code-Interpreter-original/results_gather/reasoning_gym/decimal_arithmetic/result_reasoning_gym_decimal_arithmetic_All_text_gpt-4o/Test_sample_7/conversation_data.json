    "To solve the problem \\((6.315 + 3.614) / 4.173\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Addition**: First, add the numbers in the numerator.\n   \\[\n   6.315 + 3.614 = 9.929\n   \\]\n\n2. **Division**: Next, divide the result by the denominator.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9.929}{4.173} \\approx 2.379990424\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rounding**: Round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n   - The number \\(2.379990424\\) already has fewer than 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is needed.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{<<<2.379990424>>>}\n\\]"
