    "To solve the given expression step by step, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Solve the operations inside the parentheses first.\n   - Inside the parentheses, we have two operations: multiplication and division.\n   - Calculate the multiplication: \\(8.835 \\times 0.795\\).\n   - Calculate the division: \\(4.728 \\div 5.391\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication and Division**: Perform these operations from left to right.\n   - After calculating the multiplication and division inside the parentheses, subtract the division result from the multiplication result.\n\n3. **Division**: Divide the result from step 2 by 4.182.\n\n4. **Subtraction**: Subtract 1.456 from the result obtained in step 3.\n\nNow, let's perform these calculations:\n\n1. **Multiplication**: \n   \\[\n   8.835 \\times 0.795 = 7.024425\n   \\]\n\n2. **Division**:\n   \\[\n   4.728 \\div 5.391 = 0.876883\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtraction inside Parentheses**:\n   \\[\n   7.024425 - 0.876883 = 6.147542\n   \\]\n\n4. **Division**:\n   \\[\n   6.147542 \\div 4.182 = 1.469678\n   \\]\n\n5. **Subtraction**:\n   \\[\n   1.469678 - 1.456 = 0.013678\n   \\]\n\nFinally, rounding the result to 12 significant digits, we get:\n\n<<<0.013678>>>"
