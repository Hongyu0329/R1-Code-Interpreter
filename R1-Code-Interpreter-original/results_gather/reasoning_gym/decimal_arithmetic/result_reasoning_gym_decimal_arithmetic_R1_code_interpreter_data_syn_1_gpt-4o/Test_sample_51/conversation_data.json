    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform the arithmetic operations step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((1.454 - 0.564 + 3.100) - (1.356 + 2.516))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Calculate the first part inside the first parentheses: \\(1.454 - 0.564 + 3.100\\).\n2. Calculate the second part inside the second parentheses: \\(1.356 + 2.516\\).\n3. Subtract the result of the second part from the result of the first part.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision and rounding to 12 significant digits.\n\n```python\n# Calculating the expression step by step\nfirst_part = 1.454 - 0.564 + 3.100\nsecond_part = 1.356 + 2.516\nresult = first_part - second_part\n\n# Rounding the result to 12 significant digits\nrounded_result = round(result, 12)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(rounded_result)\n```",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression is 0.118. Therefore, the final answer to the problem, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<0.118>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please solve this problem to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.
