    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). The expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3.091}{5.164 - 4.116} \\times (2.638 + (4.902 - 4.693))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the values inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(5.164 - 4.116\\)\n   - \\(4.902 - 4.693\\)\n\n2. **Substitute these values back into the expression:**\n   - \\(\\frac{3.091}{\\text{result of } (5.164 - 4.116)} \\times (2.638 + \\text{result of } (4.902 - 4.693))\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the division and multiplication:**\n   - First, calculate the division: \\(\\frac{3.091}{\\text{result of } (5.164 - 4.116)}\\)\n   - Then, calculate the multiplication with the result of the addition: \\(\\text{result of division} \\times \\text{result of } (2.638 + (4.902 - 4.693))\\)\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision and accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the values inside the parentheses\nvalue1 = 5.164 - 4.116\nvalue2 = 4.902 - 4.693\n\n# Step 2: Substitute these values back into the expression\ndivision_result = 3.091 / value1\naddition_result = 2.638 + value2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final result\nfinal_result = division_result * addition_result\n\n# Print the final result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please solve this problem to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.
