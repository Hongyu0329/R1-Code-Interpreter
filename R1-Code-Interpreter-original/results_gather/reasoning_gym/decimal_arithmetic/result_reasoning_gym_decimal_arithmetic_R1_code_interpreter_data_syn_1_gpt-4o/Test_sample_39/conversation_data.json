    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform the arithmetic operations in the correct order. The expression is:\n\n\\[ (4.341 - (4.315 + 8.393) + 8.270) \\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the value inside the innermost parentheses: \\( (4.315 + 8.393) \\).\n2. Subtract the result from step 1 from 4.341.\n3. Add 8.270 to the result from step 2.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision and rounding to 12 significant digits.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the sum inside the parentheses\ninner_sum = 4.315 + 8.393\n\n# Step 2: Subtract the inner sum from 4.341\nresult_after_subtraction = 4.341 - inner_sum\n\n# Step 3: Add 8.270 to the result\nfinal_result = result_after_subtraction + 8.270\n\n# Print the final result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final result rounded to 12 significant digits.",
