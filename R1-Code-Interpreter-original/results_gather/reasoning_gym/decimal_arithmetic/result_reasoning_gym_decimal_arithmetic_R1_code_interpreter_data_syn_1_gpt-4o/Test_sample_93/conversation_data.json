    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a simple arithmetic operation: multiply 9.809 by 5.752 and then subtract 0.070 from the result. We will use Python to ensure precision and accuracy in the calculation.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\nresult = 9.809 * 5.752 - 0.070\nprint(f\"{result:.12f}\")\n```\n\nThis code multiplies 9.809 by 5.752, subtracts 0.070, and then formats the result to 12 significant digits. Let's execute this code to get the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the result of the arithmetic operation with 12 significant digits. The result of the calculation \\(9.809 \\times 5.752 - 0.070\\) is 56.351368000000.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<56.351368000000>>>"
