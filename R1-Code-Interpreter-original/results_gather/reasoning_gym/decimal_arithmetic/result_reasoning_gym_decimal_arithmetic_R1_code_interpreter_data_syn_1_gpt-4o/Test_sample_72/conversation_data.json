    "To solve the problem of dividing 3.730 by 0.111 and rounding the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, we can use Python to perform the calculation and handle the rounding.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation:\n\n```python\n# Perform the division\nresult = 3.730 / 0.111\n\n# Round the result to 12 significant digits\nrounded_result = round(result, 12)\n\n# Print the rounded result\nprint(rounded_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please solve this problem to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.
