    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform the arithmetic operations in the correct order, which is multiplication and division in this case. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 7.996 \\times 4.968 \\times \\left(\\frac{1.186}{1.882}\\right) \\]\n\nWe will first calculate the division inside the parentheses, then multiply the result with the other two numbers. Finally, we will round the result to 12 significant digits.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision and correct rounding.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 7.996\nb = 4.968\nc = 1.186\nd = 1.882\n\n# Perform the calculation\nresult = a * b * (c / d)\n\n# Print the result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the precise result rounded to 12 significant digits.",
    "The calculation has been performed correctly, and the result is rounded to 12 significant digits. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<25.0333771562>>>"
