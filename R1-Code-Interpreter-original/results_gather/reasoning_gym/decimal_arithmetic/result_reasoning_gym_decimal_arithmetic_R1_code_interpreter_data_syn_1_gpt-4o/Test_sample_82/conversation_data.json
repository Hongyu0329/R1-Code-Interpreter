    "To solve the problem \\(((5.511-2.516) \\times 8.807)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is to first perform the subtraction inside the parentheses and then multiply the result by 8.807. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Calculate the subtraction inside the parentheses: \\(5.511 - 2.516\\).\n2. Multiply the result by 8.807.\n\nWe will use Python to ensure precision and rounding to 12 significant digits.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Perform the subtraction\nsubtraction_result = 5.511 - 2.516\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the result by 8.807\nfinal_result = subtraction_result * 8.807\n\n# Step 3: Round the result to 12 significant digits\nrounded_result = round(final_result, 12)\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(rounded_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the calculation \\(((5.511-2.516) \\times 8.807)\\) is 26.376965. \n\nThe final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<26.376965>>>"
