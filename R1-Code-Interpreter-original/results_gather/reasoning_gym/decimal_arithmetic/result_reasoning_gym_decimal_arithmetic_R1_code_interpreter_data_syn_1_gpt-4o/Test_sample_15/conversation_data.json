    "To solve the given expression \\( \\frac{7.049}{\\frac{4.218}{0.671}} \\div 1.679 \\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. First, solve the innermost division: \\( \\frac{4.218}{0.671} \\).\n2. Then, divide 7.049 by the result from step 1.\n3. Finally, divide the result from step 2 by 1.679.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure precision and accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the innermost division\ninner_division = 4.218 / 0.671\n\n# Step 2: Divide 7.049 by the result of the inner division\nfirst_division = 7.049 / inner_division\n\n# Step 3: Divide the result by 1.679\nfinal_result = first_division / 1.679\n\n# Print the final result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully, and the result of the expression \\( \\frac{7.049}{\\frac{4.218}{0.671}} \\div 1.679 \\) is:\n\n<<<0.667871266144>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please solve this problem to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.
