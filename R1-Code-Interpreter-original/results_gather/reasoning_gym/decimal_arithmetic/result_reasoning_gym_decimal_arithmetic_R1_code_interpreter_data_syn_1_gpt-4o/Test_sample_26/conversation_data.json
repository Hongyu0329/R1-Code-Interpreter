    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3.371 - 3.153}{\\frac{5.791 \\times 7.374}{9.503 + 8.023}}\n\\]\n\n1. **Calculate the numerator**: \\(3.371 - 3.153\\)\n2. **Calculate the denominator**:\n   - First, calculate the addition in the denominator: \\(9.503 + 8.023\\)\n   - Then, calculate the multiplication: \\(5.791 \\times 7.374\\)\n   - Finally, divide the result of the multiplication by the result of the addition.\n\n3. **Divide the numerator by the calculated denominator**.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision and accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the numerator\nnumerator = 3.371 - 3.153\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the denominator\naddition_result = 9.503 + 8.023\nmultiplication_result = 5.791 * 7.374\ndenominator = multiplication_result / addition_result\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final result\nresult = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final answer.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please solve this problem to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.
