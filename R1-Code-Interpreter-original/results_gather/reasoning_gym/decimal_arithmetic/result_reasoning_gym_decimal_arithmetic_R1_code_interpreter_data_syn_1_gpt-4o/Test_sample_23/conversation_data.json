    "To solve the problem, we need to multiply the two numbers given: 2.458 and 3.011. The result should be rounded to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\nLet's perform the multiplication and rounding using Python to ensure precision.\n\n```python\n# Perform the multiplication\nresult = 2.458 * 3.011\n\n# Round the result to 12 significant digits\nrounded_result = round(result, 12)\n\n# Print the rounded result\nprint(rounded_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the multiplication rounded to 12 significant digits.",
    "The multiplication of 2.458 and 3.011 results in 7.401038. This value is already within the limit of 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\n<<<7.401038>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please solve this problem to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.
