    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then division and multiplication, and finally addition.\n\nThe expression is: \n\n\\[ 0.144 + \\left(\\frac{7.877}{\\frac{4.491}{9.387}} + (1.047 \\times 8.131)\\right) \\]\n\n1. First, solve the innermost division: \\(\\frac{4.491}{9.387}\\).\n2. Then, divide 7.877 by the result from step 1.\n3. Calculate the multiplication: \\(1.047 \\times 8.131\\).\n4. Add the results from steps 2 and 3.\n5. Finally, add 0.144 to the result from step 4.\n\nLet's compute this using Python code to ensure precision and accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the innermost division\ninner_division = 4.491 / 9.387\n\n# Step 2: Divide 7.877 by the result of the inner division\ndivision_result = 7.877 / inner_division\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the multiplication\nmultiplication_result = 1.047 * 8.131\n\n# Step 4: Add the results from steps 2 and 3\ninner_addition = division_result + multiplication_result\n\n# Step 5: Add 0.144 to the result from step 4\nfinal_result = 0.144 + inner_addition\n\n# Print the final result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression is calculated to be 25.1215077014. \n\nTherefore, the final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<25.1215077014>>>"
