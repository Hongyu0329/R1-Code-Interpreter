    "To solve the expression \\((2.694 - \\frac{2.600}{8.639})\\) to a maximum of 12 significant digits, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the division \\(\\frac{2.600}{8.639}\\).\n2. Subtract the result from 2.694.\n3. Round the final result to 12 significant digits.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure precision and accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the values\nnumerator = 2.600\ndenominator = 8.639\ninitial_value = 2.694\n\n# Perform the division\ndivision_result = numerator / denominator\n\n# Subtract the division result from the initial value\nfinal_result = initial_value - division_result\n\n# Print the result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the precise result rounded to 12 significant digits.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the result of the expression \\((2.694 - \\frac{2.600}{8.639})\\) rounded to 12 significant digits. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<2.39303924065>>>"
