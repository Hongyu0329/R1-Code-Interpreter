    "To solve the expression \\( (8.014 + \\frac{3.222}{9.035} \\times 8.928) \\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. First, calculate the division inside the parentheses: \\(\\frac{3.222}{9.035}\\).\n2. Then, multiply the result by 8.928.\n3. Finally, add 8.014 to the result of the multiplication.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision up to 12 significant digits.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the division\ndivision_result = 3.222 / 9.035\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the division result by 8.928\nmultiplication_result = division_result * 8.928\n\n# Step 3: Add 8.014 to the multiplication result\nfinal_result = 8.014 + multiplication_result\n\n# Print the final result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully, and the result of the expression \\( (8.014 + \\frac{3.222}{9.035} \\times 8.928) \\) is 11.1978423907 when rounded to 12 significant digits.\n\n<<<11.1978423907>>>"
