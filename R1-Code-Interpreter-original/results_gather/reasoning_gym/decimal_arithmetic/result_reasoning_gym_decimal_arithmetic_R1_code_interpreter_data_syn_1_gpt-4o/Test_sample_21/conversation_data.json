    "To solve the given mathematical expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7.480}{7.449} + 2.774 \\times (4.277 + 0.769 \\times 7.224)\n\\]\n\n1. **Calculate the division**: \\( \\frac{7.480}{7.449} \\)\n2. **Calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses**: \\( 0.769 \\times 7.224 \\)\n3. **Add the result to 4.277**: \\( 4.277 + \\text{result from step 2} \\)\n4. **Multiply the result by 2.774**: \\( 2.774 \\times \\text{result from step 3} \\)\n5. **Add the result from step 1 to the result from step 4**.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision and accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the division\ndivision_result = 7.480 / 7.449\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses\nmultiplication_inside_parentheses = 0.769 * 7.224\n\n# Step 3: Add the result to 4.277\naddition_inside_parentheses = 4.277 + multiplication_inside_parentheses\n\n# Step 4: Multiply the result by 2.774\nmultiplication_result = 2.774 * addition_inside_parentheses\n\n# Step 5: Add the result from step 1 to the result from step 4\nfinal_result = division_result + multiplication_result\n\n# Print the final result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final result of the expression rounded to 12 significant digits.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression is calculated to be 28.2788397764. \n\nTherefore, the final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<28.2788397764>>>"
