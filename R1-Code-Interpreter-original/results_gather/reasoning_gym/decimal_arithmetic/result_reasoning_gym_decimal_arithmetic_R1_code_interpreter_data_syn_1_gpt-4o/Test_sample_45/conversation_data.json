    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform the arithmetic operations in the correct order, which is:\n\n1. Multiply 1.886 by 9.141.\n2. Subtract the result from 3.233.\n3. Subtract 9.108 from the result of step 2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure precision up to 12 significant digits.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 3.233\nb = 1.886\nc = 9.141\nd = 9.108\n\n# Perform the calculations\nresult = a - (b * c) - d\n\n# Print the result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the precise result of the expression.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the arithmetic expression. The final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<-23.114926>>>"
