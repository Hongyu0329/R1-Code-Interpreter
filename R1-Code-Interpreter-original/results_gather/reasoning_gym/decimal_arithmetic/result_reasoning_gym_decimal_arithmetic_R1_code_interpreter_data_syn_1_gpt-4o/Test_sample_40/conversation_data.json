    "To solve the problem of multiplying 5.636 by 9.810 and rounding the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, we can perform the multiplication and then apply the rounding rule.\n\nLet's calculate the product:\n\n```python\n# Perform the multiplication\nresult = 5.636 * 9.810\n\n# Print the result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the product rounded to 12 significant digits.",
    "The multiplication of 5.636 and 9.810 results in 55.28916. This value is already within the limit of 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\n<<<55.28916>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please solve this problem to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.
