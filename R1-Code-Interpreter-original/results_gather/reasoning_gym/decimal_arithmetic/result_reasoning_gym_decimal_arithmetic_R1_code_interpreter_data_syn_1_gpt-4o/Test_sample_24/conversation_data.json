    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((7.761 \\times 3.784) + (1.110 \\times (9.402 - 9.384))) - 9.536\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the value inside the innermost parentheses: \\(9.402 - 9.384\\).\n2. Multiply the result by 1.110.\n3. Calculate \\(7.761 \\times 3.784\\).\n4. Add the results from steps 2 and 3.\n5. Subtract 9.536 from the result of step 4.\n\nNow, let's compute this using Python to ensure precision and accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the value inside the innermost parentheses\ninner_parentheses = 9.402 - 9.384\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the result by 1.110\nsecond_term = 1.110 * inner_parentheses\n\n# Step 3: Calculate 7.761 * 3.784\nfirst_term = 7.761 * 3.784\n\n# Step 4: Add the results from steps 2 and 3\nsum_terms = first_term + second_term\n\n# Step 5: Subtract 9.536 from the result of step 4\nresult = sum_terms - 9.536\n\n# Print the result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final answer.",
