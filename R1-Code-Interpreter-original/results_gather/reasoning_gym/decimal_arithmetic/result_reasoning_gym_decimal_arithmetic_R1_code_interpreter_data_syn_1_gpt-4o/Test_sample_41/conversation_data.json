    "To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the expression:\n\n\\[ \\frac{8.228}{\\left(\\frac{7.553 \\times 7.983}{7.388}\\right)} \\]\n\nFirst, we will calculate the denominator:\n\n1. Multiply 7.553 by 7.983.\n2. Divide the result by 7.388.\n\nThen, we will divide 8.228 by the result obtained from the above calculation.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure precision and rounding to 12 significant digits.\n\n```python\n# Define the values\nnumerator = 8.228\na = 7.553\nb = 7.983\nc = 7.388\n\n# Calculate the denominator\ndenominator = (a * b) / c\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression is calculated to be approximately 1.00817414551. This value is already rounded to 12 significant digits.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1.00817414551>>>"
