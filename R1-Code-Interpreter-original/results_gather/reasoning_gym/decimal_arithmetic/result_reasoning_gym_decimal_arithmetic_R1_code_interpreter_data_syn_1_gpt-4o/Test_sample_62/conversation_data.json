    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and addition.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[\n(((2.034 \\times 7.057) + (6.077 \\times 9.751)) \\times (7.134 + 5.849))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate \\(2.034 \\times 7.057\\).\n2. Calculate \\(6.077 \\times 9.751\\).\n3. Add the results from steps 1 and 2.\n4. Calculate \\(7.134 + 5.849\\).\n5. Multiply the result from step 3 by the result from step 4.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision and accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 2.034 * 7.057\npart1 = 2.034 * 7.057\n\n# Step 2: Calculate 6.077 * 9.751\npart2 = 6.077 * 9.751\n\n# Step 3: Add the results from step 1 and step 2\nsum_parts = part1 + part2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate 7.134 + 5.849\nsum_inner = 7.134 + 5.849\n\n# Step 5: Multiply the result from step 3 by the result from step 4\nresult = sum_parts * sum_inner\n\n# Print the result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the final result.",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully, and the result of the expression is 955.688561995. \n\nTherefore, the final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<955.688561995>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please solve this problem to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.
