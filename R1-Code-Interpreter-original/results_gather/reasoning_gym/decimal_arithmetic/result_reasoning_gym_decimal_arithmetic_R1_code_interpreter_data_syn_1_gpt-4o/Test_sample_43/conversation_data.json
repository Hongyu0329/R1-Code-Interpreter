    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and addition. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n(7.445 + ((5.664 + 1.373) \\times 8.136)) \\times 4.392\n\\]\n\n1. First, solve the innermost parentheses: \\(5.664 + 1.373\\).\n2. Multiply the result by 8.136.\n3. Add 7.445 to the result from step 2.\n4. Finally, multiply the result from step 3 by 4.392.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python to ensure precision up to 12 significant digits.\n\n```python\n# Step-by-step calculation\ninner_sum = 5.664 + 1.373\ninner_product = inner_sum * 8.136\nouter_sum = 7.445 + inner_product\nfinal_result = outer_sum * 4.392\n\n# Print the final result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the final result.",
