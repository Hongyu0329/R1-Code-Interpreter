    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation given in the expression: \n\n\\[ (6.310 \\times 3.210 + 3.520) \\]\n\nWe will first multiply 6.310 by 3.210, and then add 3.520 to the result. Finally, we will round the result to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python for precision.\n\n```python\n# Perform the arithmetic operation\nresult = 6.310 * 3.210 + 3.520\n\n# Print the result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the precise result rounded to 12 significant digits.",
    "The calculation has been performed correctly, and the result of the expression \\((6.310 \\times 3.210 + 3.520)\\) is 23.7751. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<23.7751>>>"
