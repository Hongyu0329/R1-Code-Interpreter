    "To solve the given mathematical expression, we need to perform the operations in the correct order, which is division and multiplication from left to right. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8.826}{1.300} \\div 2.925 \\times 3.456\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, divide 8.826 by 1.300.\n2. Then, divide the result by 2.925.\n3. Finally, multiply the result by 3.456.\n\nTo ensure precision and accuracy, we will use Python to perform these calculations and round the result to 12 significant digits.\n\n```python\n# Perform the calculations step by step\nresult = (8.826 / 1.300) / 2.925 * 3.456\n\n# Round the result to 12 significant digits\nrounded_result = round(result, 12)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(rounded_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final answer.",
