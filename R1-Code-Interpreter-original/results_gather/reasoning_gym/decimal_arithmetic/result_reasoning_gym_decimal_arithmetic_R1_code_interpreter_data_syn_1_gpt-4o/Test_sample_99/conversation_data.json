    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication, and finally addition.\n\nThe expression is: \n\n\\[ 8.324 + ((4.700 + 2.019) \\times 2.816) \\]\n\n1. **Calculate the expression inside the innermost parentheses:**\n\n   \\[ 4.700 + 2.019 \\]\n\n2. **Multiply the result by 2.816:**\n\n   \\[ \\text{Result from step 1} \\times 2.816 \\]\n\n3. **Add 8.324 to the result from step 2:**\n\n   \\[ 8.324 + \\text{Result from step 2} \\]\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision up to 12 significant digits.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the sum inside the parentheses\ninner_sum = 4.700 + 2.019\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the result by 2.816\nproduct = inner_sum * 2.816\n\n# Step 3: Add 8.324 to the result\nfinal_result = 8.324 + product\n\n# Print the final result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final answer.",
