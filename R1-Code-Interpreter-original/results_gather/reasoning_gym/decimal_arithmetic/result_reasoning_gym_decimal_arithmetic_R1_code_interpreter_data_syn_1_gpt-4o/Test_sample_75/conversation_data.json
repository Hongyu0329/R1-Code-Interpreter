    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation given in the expression: \n\n\\[ (7.906 \\times 6.956 + 4.844) \\]\n\nWe will first multiply 7.906 by 6.956, and then add 4.844 to the result. Finally, we will round the result to 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python for precision:\n\n```python\n# Perform the arithmetic operation\nresult = 7.906 * 6.956 + 4.844\n\n# Round the result to 12 significant digits\nrounded_result = round(result, 12)\n\n# Print the rounded result\nprint(rounded_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
