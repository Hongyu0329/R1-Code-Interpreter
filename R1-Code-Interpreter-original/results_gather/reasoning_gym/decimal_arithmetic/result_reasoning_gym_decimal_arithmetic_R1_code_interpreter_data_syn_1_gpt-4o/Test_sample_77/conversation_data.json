    "To solve the given mathematical expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nThe expression given is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7.525}{1.663} - 4.896 + 7.389\n\\]\n\n1. **Division**: First, we perform the division \\(\\frac{7.525}{1.663}\\).\n2. **Subtraction**: Next, we subtract 4.896 from the result of the division.\n3. **Addition**: Finally, we add 7.389 to the result of the subtraction.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python to ensure precision up to 12 significant digits.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Perform the division\ndivision_result = 7.525 / 1.663\n\n# Step 2: Perform the subtraction\nsubtraction_result = division_result - 4.896\n\n# Step 3: Perform the addition\nfinal_result = subtraction_result + 7.389\n\n# Print the final result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the precise result of the expression.",
    "The calculation has been performed successfully, and the result of the expression \\((7.525/1.663) - 4.896 + 7.389\\) is:\n\n<<<7.01795490078>>>"
