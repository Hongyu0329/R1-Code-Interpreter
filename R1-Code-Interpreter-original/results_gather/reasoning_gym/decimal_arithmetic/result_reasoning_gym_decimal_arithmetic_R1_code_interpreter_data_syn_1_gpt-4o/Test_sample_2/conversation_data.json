    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). The expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(9.597 + 0.491)}{\\left(\\frac{1.058}{5.590}\\right)} + (1.581 \\times 0.025)\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the numerator of the first fraction:**\n   \\[\n   9.597 + 0.491 = 10.088\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the denominator of the first fraction:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1.058}{5.590}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the first fraction:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10.088}{\\left(\\frac{1.058}{5.590}\\right)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the multiplication:**\n   \\[\n   1.581 \\times 0.025\n   \\]\n\n5. **Add the results of the fraction and the multiplication:**\n\nNow, let's compute these calculations using Python to ensure precision and accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the numerator of the first fraction\nnumerator = 9.597 + 0.491\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the denominator of the first fraction\ndenominator = 1.058 / 5.590\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the first fraction\nfraction_result = numerator / denominator\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the multiplication\nmultiplication_result = 1.581 * 0.025\n\n# Step 5: Add the results of the fraction and the multiplication\nfinal_result = fraction_result + multiplication_result\n\n# Print the final result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final answer.",
    "The code has executed successfully, and the final result of the expression is calculated to be 53.3400164934. \n\nTherefore, the final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<53.3400164934>>>"
