    "To solve the given expression, we need to perform the arithmetic operations in the correct order, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\n\n1. Parentheses/Brackets\n2. Exponents/Orders\n3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\n4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n\nThe expression given is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9.100}{4.247} + 8.096 \\times 7.388 \\times 7.670\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. First, calculate the division: \\( \\frac{9.100}{4.247} \\).\n2. Then, calculate the multiplication: \\( 8.096 \\times 7.388 \\times 7.670 \\).\n3. Finally, add the results of the division and multiplication.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision and accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculating the expression\ndivision_result = 9.100 / 4.247\nmultiplication_result = 8.096 * 7.388 * 7.670\nfinal_result = division_result + multiplication_result\n\n# Output the result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression is calculated to be 460.910301117. This value is already rounded to 12 significant digits.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<460.910301117>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please solve this problem to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.
