    "To solve the given mathematical expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nThe expression given is:\n\n\\[\n(9.471/2.872/3.752-7.977+(8.832-3.282))\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Solve the operations inside the parentheses first.\n   - Calculate \\(8.832 - 3.282\\).\n\n2. **Division**: Perform the division operations from left to right.\n   - Calculate \\(9.471 / 2.872\\).\n   - Use the result to divide by 3.752.\n\n3. **Subtraction and Addition**: Perform the subtraction and addition operations from left to right.\n   - Subtract 7.977 from the result of the division.\n   - Add the result of the subtraction inside the parentheses.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the subtraction inside the parentheses\nparentheses_result = 8.832 - 3.282\n\n# Step 2: Perform the division operations\ndivision_result = 9.471 / 2.872 / 3.752\n\n# Step 3: Perform the subtraction and addition\nfinal_result = division_result - 7.977 + parentheses_result\n\n# Print the final result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final answer.",
    "The code execution has provided the result of the given mathematical expression. The final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<-1.54808156987>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please solve this problem to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.
