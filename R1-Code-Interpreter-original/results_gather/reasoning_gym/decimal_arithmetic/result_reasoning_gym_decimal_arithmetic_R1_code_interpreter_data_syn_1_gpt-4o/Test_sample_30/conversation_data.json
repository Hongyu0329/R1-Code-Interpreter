    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nThe expression is: \n\n\\[\n(1.068 - (5.078 \\times 8.324) - 0.128 \\times 2.012) + 7.719\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses:\n   - \\(5.078 \\times 8.324\\)\n   - \\(0.128 \\times 2.012\\)\n\n2. Substitute these values back into the expression and solve the subtraction and addition.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision up to 12 significant digits.\n\n```python\n# Define the values\na = 1.068\nb = 5.078\nc = 8.324\nd = 0.128\ne = 2.012\nf = 7.719\n\n# Perform the calculations\nresult = (a - (b * c) - (d * e)) + f\n\n# Print the result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final result.",
