    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation given in the expression \\((8.276 \\times 2.736) \\times 0.547\\). We will calculate this step-by-step and ensure the result is rounded to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\nLet's break down the calculation:\n\n1. First, calculate the product of 8.276 and 2.736.\n2. Then, multiply the result by 0.547.\n3. Finally, round the result to 12 significant digits.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure precision and correct rounding.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the product of 8.276 and 2.736\nproduct1 = 8.276 * 2.736\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the result by 0.547\nresult = product1 * 0.547\n\n# Step 3: Round the result to 12 significant digits\nrounded_result = round(result, 12)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(rounded_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully, and the result of the expression \\((8.276 \\times 2.736) \\times 0.547\\) is 12.385795392. This value is already rounded to 12 significant digits.\n\n<<<12.385795392>>>"
