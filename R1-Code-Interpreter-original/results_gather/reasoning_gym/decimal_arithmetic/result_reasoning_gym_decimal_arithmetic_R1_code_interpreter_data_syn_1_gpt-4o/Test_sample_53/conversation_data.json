    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression:\n\n\\[ 5.258 - 7.557 \\times 6.170 \\]\n\nThe order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) dictates that we perform the multiplication before the subtraction. Therefore, we first calculate the product of 7.557 and 6.170, and then subtract the result from 5.258.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision and accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = 5.258 - 7.557 * 6.170\n\n# Print the result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the precise result of the expression rounded to 12 significant digits.",
    "The calculation has been performed, and the result of the expression \\(5.258 - 7.557 \\times 6.170\\) is \\(-41.36869\\).\n\n<<<-41.36869>>>"
