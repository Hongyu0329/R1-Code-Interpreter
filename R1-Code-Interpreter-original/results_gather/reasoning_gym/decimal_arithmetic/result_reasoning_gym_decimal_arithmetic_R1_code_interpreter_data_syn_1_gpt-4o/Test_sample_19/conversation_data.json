    "To solve the expression \\(4.032 - \\frac{6.511}{9.603}\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. First, we perform the division: \\(\\frac{6.511}{9.603}\\).\n2. Then, we subtract the result from 4.032.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure precision up to 12 significant digits.\n\n```python\n# Perform the calculation\nresult = 4.032 - (6.511 / 9.603)\n\n# Print the result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the precise result of the expression.",
    "The calculation has been performed, and the result of the expression \\(4.032 - \\frac{6.511}{9.603}\\) is approximately 3.35398271374 when rounded to 12 significant digits.\n\n<<<3.35398271374>>>"
