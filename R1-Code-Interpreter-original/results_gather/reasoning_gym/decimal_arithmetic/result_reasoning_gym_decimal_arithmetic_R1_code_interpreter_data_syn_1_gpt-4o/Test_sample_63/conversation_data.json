    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 8.094 + 0.211 + ((3.176 + 1.792 \\times 6.341) \\times 2.930) \\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses: \\(1.792 \\times 6.341\\).\n2. Add the result to 3.176.\n3. Multiply the sum by 2.930.\n4. Add the result to 8.094 and 0.211.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision up to 12 significant digits.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses\nmultiplication_result = 1.792 * 6.341\n\n# Step 2: Add the result to 3.176\nsum_inside_parentheses = 3.176 + multiplication_result\n\n# Step 3: Multiply the sum by 2.930\nresult_after_multiplication = sum_inside_parentheses * 2.930\n\n# Step 4: Add the result to 8.094 and 0.211\nfinal_result = 8.094 + 0.211 + result_after_multiplication\n\n# Print the final result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final result rounded to 12 significant digits.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression is calculated as 50.90448096. \n\nTherefore, the final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<50.90448096>>>"
