    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\\[ 5.231 + (2.980 - (1.968 / 8.586) \\times 2.800) \\times 8.237 \\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the division inside the parentheses: \\( \\frac{1.968}{8.586} \\).\n2. Multiply the result by 2.800.\n3. Subtract the result from 2.980.\n4. Multiply the result by 8.237.\n5. Finally, add 5.231 to the result.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision and accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step-by-step calculation\ndivision_result = 1.968 / 8.586\nmultiplication_result = division_result * 2.800\nsubtraction_result = 2.980 - multiplication_result\nfinal_multiplication = subtraction_result * 8.237\nfinal_result = 5.231 + final_multiplication\n\n# Print the final result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression is calculated to be 24.4908443466. \n\nTherefore, the final answer, rounded to 12 significant digits, is:\n\n<<<24.4908443466>>>"
