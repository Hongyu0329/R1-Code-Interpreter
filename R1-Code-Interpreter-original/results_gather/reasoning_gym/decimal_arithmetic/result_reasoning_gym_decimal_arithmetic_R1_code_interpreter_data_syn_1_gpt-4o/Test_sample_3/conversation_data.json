    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((2.159 \\times 4.685 / 9.286) + (6.007 + 0.142 + 8.115))\n\\]\n\n1. First, calculate the multiplication and division inside the first set of parentheses:\n   - Multiply 2.159 by 4.685.\n   - Divide the result by 9.286.\n\n2. Next, calculate the addition inside the second set of parentheses:\n   - Add 6.007, 0.142, and 8.115.\n\n3. Finally, add the results from step 1 and step 2.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision and rounding to 12 significant digits.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the multiplication and division\npart1 = (2.159 * 4.685) / 9.286\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the addition\npart2 = 6.007 + 0.142 + 8.115\n\n# Step 3: Add the results from step 1 and step 2\nresult = part1 + part2\n\n# Round the result to 12 significant digits\nfinal_result = round(result, 12)\n\nprint(final_result)\n```",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully, and the result is rounded to 12 significant digits. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<15.353265022615>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please solve this problem to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.
