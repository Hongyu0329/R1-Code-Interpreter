    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a simple subtraction operation between the two numbers: 4.507 and 2.287. The result should be rounded to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.\n\nLet's perform the subtraction and ensure the result is rounded correctly.\n\n```python\n# Perform the subtraction\nresult = 4.507 - 2.287\n\n# Round the result to 12 significant digits\nrounded_result = round(result, 12)\n\n# Print the rounded result\nprint(rounded_result)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the final answer.",
    "The subtraction of 4.507 and 2.287 results in 2.22. The result is already within the limit of 12 significant digits, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\n<<<2.22>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please solve this problem to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.
