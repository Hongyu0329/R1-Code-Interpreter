    "To solve the given mathematical expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nThe expression is:  \n1. \\(1.862 + (2.422 - (1.998 - 9.068) + 6.529)\\)\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Solve the innermost parentheses:  \n   \\((1.998 - 9.068)\\)\n\n2. Use the result from step 1 to solve the next part:  \n   \\(2.422 - \\text{(result from step 1)} + 6.529\\)\n\n3. Finally, add the result from step 2 to 1.862.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure precision up to 12 significant digits.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the innermost parentheses\ninner_result = 1.998 - 9.068\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the next part\nmiddle_result = 2.422 - inner_result + 6.529\n\n# Step 3: Add the result to 1.862\nfinal_result = 1.862 + middle_result\n\n# Print the final result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```",
    "The calculation has been performed correctly, and the result of the expression is 17.883. \n\n<<<17.883>>>"
