    "To solve the given mathematical expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). The expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(4.714 - \\frac{7.512}{7.152}) - 9.191}{3.225}\n\\]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Division inside the parentheses**: Calculate \\(\\frac{7.512}{7.152}\\).\n2. **Subtraction inside the parentheses**: Subtract the result from step 1 from 4.714.\n3. **Subtraction outside the parentheses**: Subtract 9.191 from the result of step 2.\n4. **Final division**: Divide the result of step 3 by 3.225.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure precision and accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Division inside the parentheses\ndivision_result = 7.512 / 7.152\n\n# Step 2: Subtraction inside the parentheses\nsubtraction_inside_parentheses = 4.714 - division_result\n\n# Step 3: Subtraction outside the parentheses\nsubtraction_outside_parentheses = subtraction_inside_parentheses - 9.191\n\n# Step 4: Final division\nfinal_result = subtraction_outside_parentheses / 3.225\n\n# Print the final result rounded to 12 significant digits\nprint(f\"{final_result:.12g}\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression is \\(-1.71390250247\\). This value is already rounded to 12 significant digits.\n\n<<<-1.71390250247>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Please solve this problem to a maximum of 12 significant digits, rounding up from the half.
