    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the arithmetic operation as specified in the expression: \\((8.381 \\times 7.917) + 5.221\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. First, calculate the product of 8.381 and 7.917.\n2. Then, add 5.221 to the result of the multiplication.\n3. Finally, round the result to 12 significant digits.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure precision and accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the product\nproduct = 8.381 * 7.917\n\n# Step 2: Add 5.221 to the product\nresult = product + 5.221\n\n# Step 3: Round the result to 12 significant digits\nfinal_result = round(result, 12)\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the precise result of the expression rounded to 12 significant digits.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result of the expression \\((8.381 \\times 7.917) + 5.221\\) is calculated as 71.573377. This value is already rounded to 12 significant digits.\n\n<<<71.573377>>>"
