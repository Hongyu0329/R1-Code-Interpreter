    "To solve the logic circuit, we need to evaluate it step by step using the given inputs A = 0, B = 0, and C = 0. Let's break down the circuit:\n\n1. **Initial Inputs:**\n   - A = 0\n   - B = 0\n   - C = 0\n\n2. **First Layer of Gates:**\n   - The first AND gate takes inputs A and B. Since both are 0, the output is 0.\n   - The second AND gate takes inputs B and C. Since both are 0, the output is 0.\n   - The third AND gate takes inputs A and C. Since both are 0, the output is 0.\n\n3. **Second Layer of Gates:**\n   - The first XOR gate takes inputs from the first and second AND gates (both 0). XOR of 0 and 0 is 0.\n   - The second XOR gate takes inputs from the second and third AND gates (both 0). XOR of 0 and 0 is 0.\n   - The third XOR gate takes inputs from the first and third AND gates (both 0). XOR of 0 and 0 is 0.\n\n4. **Negation Gates:**\n   - The first negation gate negates the output of the first XOR gate (0), resulting in 1.\n   - The second negation gate negates the output of the second XOR gate (0), resulting in 1.\n\n5. **Third Layer of Gates:**\n   - The first NOR gate takes inputs from the first negation gate (1) and the third XOR gate (0). NOR of 1 and 0 is 0.\n   - The second NOR gate takes inputs from the second negation gate (1) and the third XOR gate (0). NOR of 1 and 0 is 0.\n\n6. **Final Layer of Gates:**\n   - The final NOR gate takes inputs from the first and second NOR gates (both 0). NOR of 0 and 0 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the final output of the circuit is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1>>>"
