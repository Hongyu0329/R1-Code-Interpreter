    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logic circuit step by step, using the given input values A = 0, B = 0, and C = 0. We will follow the flow of the circuit and apply the logic gates accordingly.\n\n1. **Initial Inputs:**\n   - A = 0\n   - B = 0\n   - C = 0\n\n2. **First Layer of AND Gates:**\n   - The first AND gate receives inputs A and B, both of which are 0. The output of this AND gate is 0 (since 0 AND 0 = 0).\n   - The second AND gate receives inputs B and C, both of which are 0. The output of this AND gate is 0 (since 0 AND 0 = 0).\n   - The third AND gate receives inputs A and C, both of which are 0. The output of this AND gate is 0 (since 0 AND 0 = 0).\n\n3. **Negation:**\n   - The output of the third AND gate (0) is negated. The negation of 0 is 1.\n\n4. **Second Layer of AND Gates:**\n   - The fourth AND gate receives the output of the first AND gate (0) and the negated output of the third AND gate (1). The output of this AND gate is 0 (since 0 AND 1 = 0).\n   - The fifth AND gate receives the output of the second AND gate (0) and the negated output of the third AND gate (1). The output of this AND gate is 0 (since 0 AND 1 = 0).\n   - The sixth AND gate receives the output of the third AND gate (0) and the negated output of the third AND gate (1). The output of this AND gate is 0 (since 0 AND 1 = 0).\n\n5. **XOR Gates:**\n   - The first XOR gate receives the output of the fourth AND gate (0) and the output of the fifth AND gate (0). The output of this XOR gate is 0 (since 0 XOR 0 = 0).\n   - The second XOR gate receives the output of the sixth AND gate (0) and the output of the first XOR gate (0). The output of this XOR gate is 0 (since 0 XOR 0 = 0).\n\n6. **Final Output:**\n   - The final output of the circuit is the output of the second XOR gate, which is 0.\n\nTherefore, the final output of the logic circuit is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
