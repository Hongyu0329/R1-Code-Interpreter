    "To solve the logic circuit, we need to evaluate it step by step using the given input values A = 1, B = 1, and C = 1. Let's break down the circuit:\n\n1. **Initial Inputs:**\n   - A = 1\n   - B = 1\n   - C = 1\n\n2. **First Layer of Gates:**\n   - The first NAND gate takes inputs A and B. The NAND operation on (1, 1) results in 0.\n   - The second NAND gate takes inputs B and C. The NAND operation on (1, 1) results in 0.\n   - The third NAND gate takes inputs A and C. The NAND operation on (1, 1) results in 0.\n   - The fourth NAND gate takes inputs A and B again. The NAND operation on (1, 1) results in 0.\n   - The fifth NAND gate takes inputs B and C again. The NAND operation on (1, 1) results in 0.\n   - The sixth NAND gate takes inputs A and C again. The NAND operation on (1, 1) results in 0.\n\n3. **Negation Gates:**\n   - The first negation gate negates the output of the first NAND gate, which is 0. Negating 0 results in 1.\n   - The second negation gate negates the output of the second NAND gate, which is 0. Negating 0 results in 1.\n   - The third negation gate negates the output of the third NAND gate, which is 0. Negating 0 results in 1.\n   - The fourth negation gate negates the output of the fourth NAND gate, which is 0. Negating 0 results in 1.\n   - The fifth negation gate negates the output of the fifth NAND gate, which is 0. Negating 0 results in 1.\n   - The sixth negation gate negates the output of the sixth NAND gate, which is 0. Negating 0 results in 1.\n\n4. **XOR Gates:**\n   - The first XOR gate takes inputs from the first and second negation gates, both of which are 1. The XOR operation on (1, 1) results in 0.\n   - The second XOR gate takes inputs from the third and fourth negation gates, both of which are 1. The XOR operation on (1, 1) results in 0.\n\n5. **AND Gates:**\n   - The first AND gate takes inputs from the first XOR gate (0) and the fifth negation gate (1). The AND operation on (0, 1) results in 0.\n   - The second AND gate takes inputs from the second XOR gate (0) and the sixth negation gate (1). The AND operation on (0, 1) results in 0.\n   - The final AND gate takes inputs from the first and second AND gates, both of which are 0. The AND operation on (0, 0) results in 0.\n\nThe final output of the circuit is 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
