    "To solve the logic circuit, we need to evaluate the circuit step by step using the given input values: A = 0, B = 0, and C = 1. Let's break down the circuit and evaluate each gate:\n\n1. **Negate Gates (>o):**\n   - The first negate gate takes input C (1) and outputs 0.\n   - The second negate gate takes input B (0) and outputs 1.\n   - The third negate gate takes input A (0) and outputs 1.\n\n2. **NAND Gates (↑↑):**\n   - The first NAND gate takes inputs A (0) and B (0). The output of a NAND gate is 1 unless both inputs are 1. Therefore, the output is 1.\n   - The second NAND gate takes inputs B (0) and C (1). The output is 1 because not both inputs are 1.\n   - The third NAND gate takes inputs A (0) and C (1). The output is 1 because not both inputs are 1.\n   - The fourth NAND gate takes inputs A (0) and the output of the first negate gate (0). The output is 1 because not both inputs are 1.\n   - The fifth NAND gate takes inputs B (0) and the output of the second negate gate (1). The output is 1 because not both inputs are 1.\n\n3. **AND Gates (&&):**\n   - The first AND gate takes inputs from the output of the first negate gate (0) and the output of the first NAND gate (1). The output is 0 because both inputs are not 1.\n   - The second AND gate takes inputs from the output of the second negate gate (1) and the output of the second NAND gate (1). The output is 1 because both inputs are 1.\n   - The third AND gate takes inputs from the output of the third negate gate (1) and the output of the third NAND gate (1). The output is 1 because both inputs are 1.\n   - The fourth AND gate takes inputs from the output of the fourth NAND gate (1) and the output of the fifth NAND gate (1). The output is 1 because both inputs are 1.\n\n4. **XOR Gates (⊕⊕):**\n   - The first XOR gate takes inputs from the output of the first AND gate (0) and the output of the second AND gate (1). The output is 1 because XOR outputs 1 when inputs are different.\n   - The second XOR gate takes inputs from the output of the third AND gate (1) and the output of the fourth AND gate (1). The output is 0 because XOR outputs 0 when inputs are the same.\n   - The final XOR gate takes inputs from the output of the first XOR gate (1) and the output of the second XOR gate (0). The output is 1 because XOR outputs 1 when inputs are different.\n\nTherefore, the final output of the circuit is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
