    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 4x9 matrix:\n   ```\n   8 8 3 7 7 0 4 2 5\n   2 2 2 1 0 8 4 0 9\n   6 2 4 1 5 3 4 4 3\n   7 1 1 7 7 0 2 9 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2, meaning we will take 2x2 blocks from the matrix and move 2 steps at a time both horizontally and vertically.\n\n3. **Calculate the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The input matrix is 4 rows by 9 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the output matrix will have:\n     - \\( \\text{rows} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{4}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 2 \\)\n     - \\( \\text{columns} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{9}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 4 \\)\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**: For each 2x2 block, calculate the average and place it in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [8, 8, 3, 7, 7, 0, 4, 2, 5],\n    [2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 8, 4, 0, 9],\n    [6, 2, 4, 1, 5, 3, 4, 4, 3],\n    [7, 1, 1, 7, 7, 0, 2, 9, 9]\n])\n\n# Define kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 2\nstride = 2\n\n# Calculate output dimensions\noutput_rows = input_matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = input_matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 block\n        block = input_matrix[i*stride:(i*stride)+kernel_size, j*stride:(j*stride)+kernel_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the block\n        block_average = np.mean(block)\n        # Assign the average to the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = block_average\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the average pooling of the given matrix with a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, and output the result rounded to 2 decimal places.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output matrix after performing average pooling on the given input matrix. The output matrix is:\n\n```\n[[5.   3.25 3.75 2.5 ]\n [4.   3.25 3.75 4.75]]\n```\n\nThis matrix is the result of applying a 2x2 average pooling operation with a stride of 2 on the input matrix. Each element in the output matrix represents the average of a 2x2 block from the input matrix.\n\n<<<[[5.00, 3.25, 3.75, 2.50], [4.00, 3.25, 3.75, 4.75]]>>>"
