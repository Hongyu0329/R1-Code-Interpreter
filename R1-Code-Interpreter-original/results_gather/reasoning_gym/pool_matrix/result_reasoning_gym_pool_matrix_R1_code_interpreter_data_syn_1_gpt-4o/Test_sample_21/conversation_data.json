    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 3x3 regions and find the maximum value in each region. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so the regions do not overlap.\n\nLet's break down the matrix into 3x3 regions:\n\n1. The first 3x3 region is:\n   ```\n   9 5 5\n   2 9 4\n   3 6 0\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\n2. The second 3x3 region is:\n   ```\n   6 4 0\n   3 6 7\n   6 2 0\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 7.\n\n3. The third 3x3 region is:\n   ```\n   8 9 5\n   9 9 7\n   3 5 0\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\n4. The fourth 3x3 region is:\n   ```\n   5 5 5\n   8 8 1\n   5 5 5\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 8.\n\n5. The fifth 3x3 region is:\n   ```\n   0 7 9\n   8 2 0\n   0 7 9\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\n6. The sixth 3x3 region is:\n   ```\n   6 6 4\n   2 6 1\n   6 6 4\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 6.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to automate this process and ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [9, 5, 5, 6, 4, 0, 8, 9, 5],\n    [2, 9, 4, 3, 6, 7, 9, 9, 7],\n    [3, 6, 0, 6, 2, 0, 3, 5, 0],\n    [5, 5, 5, 0, 7, 9, 6, 6, 4],\n    [8, 8, 1, 8, 2, 0, 2, 6, 1]\n])\n\n# Define kernel size\nkernel_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 3x3 region\n        region = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the region\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(region)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the max pooling result for the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the final output.",
