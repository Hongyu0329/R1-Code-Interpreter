    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to understand that each element in the output matrix will be the average of the elements in the corresponding kernel-sized region of the input matrix. Since the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will be the same as the corresponding element in the input matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Matrix**: The input matrix is given as:\n   ```\n   6 1 3 0 4 9 6 1 8\n   2 9 6 0 6 2 0 6 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size**: The kernel size is 1, which means each element in the input matrix corresponds directly to an element in the output matrix.\n\n3. **Output Matrix**: Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nNow, let's write the code to perform this operation and print the output matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [6, 1, 3, 0, 4, 9, 6, 1, 8],\n    [2, 9, 6, 0, 6, 2, 0, 6, 3]\n])\n\n# Kernel size\nkernel_size = 1\n\n# Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix\noutput_matrix = input_matrix\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements formatted to 2 decimal places\nformatted_output = np.array2string(output_matrix, formatter={'float_kind':lambda x: \"%.2f\" % x})\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nThe code will output the matrix with each element formatted to two decimal places. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "It seems there was an issue with formatting the output matrix to two decimal places. Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix should be identical to the input matrix, but we need to ensure that each element is formatted as a floating-point number with two decimal places.\n\nLet's correct the code to ensure the output matrix is formatted correctly:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [6, 1, 3, 0, 4, 9, 6, 1, 8],\n    [2, 9, 6, 0, 6, 2, 0, 6, 3]\n])\n\n# Kernel size\nkernel_size = 1\n\n# Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix\noutput_matrix = input_matrix.astype(float)\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements formatted to 2 decimal places\nformatted_output = np.array2string(output_matrix, formatter={'float_kind':lambda x: \"%.2f\" % x})\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the input matrix to a float type and format each element to two decimal places. Let's execute the code to get the correct result.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is formatted with each element as a floating-point number with two decimal places. Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix is identical to the input matrix, but with the specified formatting.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<[[6.00 1.00 3.00 0.00 4.00 9.00 6.00 1.00 8.00]\n [2.00 9.00 6.00 0.00 6.00 2.00 0.00 6.00 3.00]]>>>"
