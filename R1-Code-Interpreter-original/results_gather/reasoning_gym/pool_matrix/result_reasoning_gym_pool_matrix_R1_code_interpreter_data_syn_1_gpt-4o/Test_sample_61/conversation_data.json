    "To perform average pooling with a kernel size of 1, we need to consider each element of the matrix individually. Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is averaged over itself, which means the value remains unchanged.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation:\n\n1. The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   5 4 8 1 5 0 4\n   4 9 3 5 1 1 8\n   7 0 8 9 7 5 9\n   1 2 0 1 5 6 3\n   2 1 7 1 1 4 5\n   8 1 1 8 7 2 5\n   8 2 3 6 4 7 9\n   3 8 5 2 7 9 0\n   7 2 3 5 3 0 8\n   ```\n\n2. Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix. Each element is averaged over itself, so the values remain unchanged.\n\n3. The output matrix is:\n   ```\n   5.00 4.00 8.00 1.00 5.00 0.00 4.00\n   4.00 9.00 3.00 5.00 1.00 1.00 8.00\n   7.00 0.00 8.00 9.00 7.00 5.00 9.00\n   1.00 2.00 0.00 1.00 5.00 6.00 3.00\n   2.00 1.00 7.00 1.00 1.00 4.00 5.00\n   8.00 1.00 1.00 8.00 7.00 2.00 5.00\n   8.00 2.00 3.00 6.00 4.00 7.00 9.00\n   3.00 8.00 5.00 2.00 7.00 9.00 0.00\n   7.00 2.00 3.00 5.00 3.00 0.00 8.00\n   ```\n\nNow, let's format the output matrix correctly:\n\n<<<\n5.00 4.00 8.00 1.00 5.00 0.00 4.00\n4.00 9.00 3.00 5.00 1.00 1.00 8.00\n7.00 0.00 8.00 9.00 7.00 5.00 9.00\n1.00 2.00 0.00 1.00 5.00 6.00 3.00\n2.00 1.00 7.00 1.00 1.00 4.00 5.00\n8.00 1.00 1.00 8.00 7.00 2.00 5.00\n8.00 2.00 3.00 6.00 4.00 7.00 9.00\n3.00 8.00 5.00 2.00 7.00 9.00 0.00\n7.00 2.00 3.00 5.00 3.00 0.00 8.00\n>>>"
