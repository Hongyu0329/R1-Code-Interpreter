    "To perform max pooling with a kernel size of 1, we need to consider each element of the matrix individually. Since the kernel size is 1, each element is its own pool, and the maximum value in each pool is the element itself. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's write the code to confirm this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [0, 5, 6],\n    [9, 4, 0],\n    [0, 4, 0],\n    [4, 1, 6],\n    [9, 9, 3],\n    [9, 4, 6],\n    [6, 9, 4]\n])\n\n# Kernel size\nkernel_size = 1\n\n# Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix\noutput_matrix = input_matrix\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected for max pooling with a kernel size of 1. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n0 5 6\n9 4 0\n0 4 0\n4 1 6\n9 9 3\n9 4 6\n6 9 4\n>>>"
