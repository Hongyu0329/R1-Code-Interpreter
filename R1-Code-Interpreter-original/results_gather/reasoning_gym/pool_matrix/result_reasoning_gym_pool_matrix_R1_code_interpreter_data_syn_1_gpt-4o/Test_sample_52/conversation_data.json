    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to consider non-overlapping 2x1 regions of the matrix and compute the average of each region. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so we move the kernel by 2 rows each time.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n\n```\n1 9\n8 5\n0 1\n4 1\n9 5\n9 8\n```\n\nLet's break down the matrix into 2x1 regions:\n\n1. Region 1: \n   ```\n   1 9\n   8 5\n   ```\n   Average: \n   ```\n   (1+8)/2 = 4.5\n   (9+5)/2 = 7.0\n   ```\n\n2. Region 2:\n   ```\n   0 1\n   4 1\n   ```\n   Average:\n   ```\n   (0+4)/2 = 2.0\n   (1+1)/2 = 1.0\n   ```\n\n3. Region 3:\n   ```\n   9 5\n   9 8\n   ```\n   Average:\n   ```\n   (9+9)/2 = 9.0\n   (5+8)/2 = 6.5\n   ```\n\nThe resulting matrix after average pooling will be:\n\n```\n4.5 7.0\n2.0 1.0\n9.0 6.5\n```\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to ensure the calculations are correct and formatted to two decimal places.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [1, 9],\n    [8, 5],\n    [0, 1],\n    [4, 1],\n    [9, 5],\n    [9, 8]\n])\n\n# Kernel size\nkernel_size = 2\n\n# Perform average pooling\noutput_matrix = []\nfor i in range(0, matrix.shape[0], kernel_size):\n    if i + kernel_size <= matrix.shape[0]:\n        region = matrix[i:i+kernel_size, :]\n        avg_values = np.mean(region, axis=0)\n        output_matrix.append(avg_values)\n\n# Convert to numpy array and format to 2 decimal places\noutput_matrix = np.array(output_matrix)\noutput_matrix = np.round(output_matrix, 2)\n\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is as expected. The average pooling was performed correctly on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, and the results are formatted to two decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n4.5 7.0\n2.0 1.0\n9.0 6.5\n>>>"
