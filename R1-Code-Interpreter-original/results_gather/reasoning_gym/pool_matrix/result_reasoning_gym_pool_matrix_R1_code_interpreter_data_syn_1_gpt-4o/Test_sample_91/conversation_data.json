    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to consider each element individually since the kernel size is 1. This means that the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is its own maximum.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Matrix**: \n   ```\n   2 2 6 1 3 9\n   6 1 0 1 9 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size**: 1\n\n3. **Stride**: 1 (since stride is equal to the kernel size)\n\n4. **Output Matrix**: Since the kernel size is 1, each element is its own maximum, so the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nNow, let's write the code to perform this operation and verify the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [2, 2, 6, 1, 3, 9],\n    [6, 1, 0, 1, 9, 0]\n])\n\n# Kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 1\nstride = 1\n\n# Perform max pooling\noutput_matrix = input_matrix.copy()\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected for max pooling with a kernel size of 1. \n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n2 2 6 1 3 9\n6 1 0 1 9 0\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element is its own maximum, and thus the output matrix is identical to the input matrix.\n\n<<<\n2 2 6 1 3 9\n6 1 0 1 9 0\n>>>"
