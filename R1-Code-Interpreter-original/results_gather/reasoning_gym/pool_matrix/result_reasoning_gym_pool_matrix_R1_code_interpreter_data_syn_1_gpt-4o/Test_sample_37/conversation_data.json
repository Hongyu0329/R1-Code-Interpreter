    "To perform average pooling on a matrix with a kernel size of 1, we essentially take each element of the matrix as it is, since the kernel size of 1 means each element is its own region. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Matrix**: \n   ```\n   6 9 7\n   4 1 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size**: 1\n\n3. **Stride**: 1 (since stride is equal to the kernel size)\n\n4. **Output Matrix**: Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nNow, let's write the code to confirm this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [6, 9, 7],\n    [4, 1, 6]\n])\n\n# Kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 1\nstride = 1\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_height = (input_matrix.shape[0] - kernel_size) // stride + 1\noutput_width = (input_matrix.shape[1] - kernel_size) // stride + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_height, output_width))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(0, output_height):\n    for j in range(0, output_width):\n        # Extract the current region\n        region = input_matrix[i*stride:i*stride+kernel_size, j*stride:j*stride+kernel_size]\n        # Compute the average\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.mean(region)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected with a kernel size of 1. Each element is averaged over itself, resulting in no change.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[6.00, 9.00, 7.00], [4.00, 1.00, 6.00]]>>>"
