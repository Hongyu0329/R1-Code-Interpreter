    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to understand that each element in the output matrix will be the average of the elements in the corresponding kernel-sized region of the input matrix. Since the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will simply be the same as the corresponding element in the input matrix. This is because the average of a single number is the number itself.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   0 0 1 7\n   3 1 5 1\n   0 2 9 2\n   6 2 5 1\n   1 6 7 6\n   ```\n\n2. With a kernel size of 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is averaged over a 1x1 region, which is just the element itself.\n\n3. Therefore, the output matrix will be:\n   ```\n   0 0 1 7\n   3 1 5 1\n   0 2 9 2\n   6 2 5 1\n   1 6 7 6\n   ```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, the output matrix is identical to the input matrix. Let's format the output matrix correctly:\n\n<<<\n0 0 1 7\n3 1 5 1\n0 2 9 2\n6 2 5 1\n1 6 7 6\n>>>"
