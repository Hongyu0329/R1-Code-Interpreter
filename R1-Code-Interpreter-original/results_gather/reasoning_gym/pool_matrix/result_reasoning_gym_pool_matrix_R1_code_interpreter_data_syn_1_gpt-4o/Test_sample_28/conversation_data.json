    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 6x6 matrix.\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and since the stride is equal to the kernel size, the stride is also 3.\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: With a 6x6 input matrix and a kernel size of 3, the output matrix will be a 2x2 matrix. This is because the kernel will fit into the input matrix twice along each dimension (6/3 = 2).\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**: For each 3x3 region in the input matrix, calculate the average of the elements and place the result in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the average pooling:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [1, 6, 3, 8, 9, 1],\n    [2, 1, 7, 8, 5, 2],\n    [8, 6, 3, 2, 5, 0],\n    [3, 4, 0, 6, 6, 9],\n    [5, 7, 0, 2, 5, 8],\n    [7, 9, 4, 0, 7, 0]\n])\n\n# Define kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 3\nstride = 3\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = input_matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = input_matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 3x3 block\n        block = input_matrix[i*stride:(i+1)*stride, j*stride:(j+1)*stride]\n        # Calculate the average of the block\n        block_average = np.mean(block)\n        # Assign the average to the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = block_average\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average pooling of the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, and output the resulting matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places.",
