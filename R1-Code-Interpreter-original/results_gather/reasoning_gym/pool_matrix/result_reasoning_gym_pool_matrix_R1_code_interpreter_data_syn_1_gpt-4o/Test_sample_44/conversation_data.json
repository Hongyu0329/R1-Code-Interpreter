    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 2x2 submatrices and calculate the average of each submatrix. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so we move the kernel by 2 units both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is 8x9. With a kernel size of 2, the output matrix will have dimensions of 4x4 because:\n   - The number of rows in the output matrix = floor(8/2) = 4\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix = floor(9/2) = 4\n\n2. **Submatrices and Averages**: We will extract each 2x2 submatrix, compute its average, and place the result in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the average pooling result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [1, 7, 7, 0, 1, 2, 8, 7, 2],\n    [8, 4, 5, 0, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2],\n    [3, 6, 5, 2, 4, 5, 8, 6, 0],\n    [4, 6, 4, 2, 3, 4, 8, 8, 8],\n    [4, 9, 9, 9, 8, 5, 8, 6, 9],\n    [4, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 3, 9, 8],\n    [7, 2, 5, 5, 9, 0, 4, 4, 2],\n])\n\n# Kernel size\nk = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] // k\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] // k\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the 2x2 submatrix\n        submatrix = matrix[i*k:(i+1)*k, j*k:(j+1)*k]\n        # Calculate the average and assign it to the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.mean(submatrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the average pooling of the given matrix with a kernel size of 2 and print the resulting matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is the result of performing average pooling on the given input matrix with a kernel size of 2. The output matrix is smaller than the input matrix due to the pooling operation, and each element represents the average of a 2x2 submatrix from the input.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n[[5.   3.   1.75 5.  ]\n [4.75 3.25 4.   7.5 ]\n [6.25 8.25 7.   6.5 ]]\n```\n\nThis matrix is formatted correctly with elements rounded to two decimal places. \n\n<<<[[5.00, 3.00, 1.75, 5.00], [4.75, 3.25, 4.00, 7.50], [6.25, 8.25, 7.00, 6.50]]>>>"
