    "To perform max pooling with a kernel size of 1, we essentially take the maximum value from each 1x1 region of the matrix. Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is its own maximum.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this operation and print the output matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [2, 0, 5, 3],\n    [2, 6, 9, 8],\n    [3, 6, 0, 8],\n    [7, 0, 2, 7],\n    [9, 1, 8, 7],\n    [0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [3, 6, 2, 7],\n    [2, 5, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 7, 3],\n    [1, 2, 4, 2]\n])\n\n# Kernel size\nkernel_size = 1\n\n# Since the kernel size is 1, the output is the same as the input\noutput_matrix = input_matrix\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors. Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix is identical to the input matrix. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n2 0 5 3\n2 6 9 8\n3 6 0 8\n7 0 2 7\n9 1 8 7\n0 8 8 8\n3 6 2 7\n2 5 0 1\n0 1 7 3\n1 2 4 2\n>>>"
