    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 2x2 regions and calculate the average of each region. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so we move the kernel by 2 steps both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's break down the matrix into 2x2 regions:\n\n1. The first region is:\n   ```\n   9 9\n   9 5\n   ```\n\n2. The second region is:\n   ```\n   4\n   9\n   ```\n\n3. The third region is:\n   ```\n   3 3\n   5 5\n   ```\n\n4. The fourth region is:\n   ```\n   8\n   2\n   ```\n\n5. The fifth region is:\n   ```\n   3 3\n   5 1\n   ```\n\n6. The sixth region is:\n   ```\n   7\n   4\n   ```\n\n7. The seventh region is:\n   ```\n   4 2\n   6 7\n   ```\n\n8. The eighth region is:\n   ```\n   9\n   6\n   ```\n\n9. The ninth region is:\n   ```\n   7 9\n   3 6\n   ```\n\n10. The tenth region is:\n    ```\n    9\n    9\n    ```\n\nNow, let's calculate the average for each region and form the output matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [9, 9, 4],\n    [9, 5, 9],\n    [3, 3, 8],\n    [5, 5, 2],\n    [3, 3, 7],\n    [5, 1, 4],\n    [4, 2, 9],\n    [6, 7, 6],\n    [7, 9, 9],\n    [3, 6, 9]\n])\n\n# Define the kernel size\nkernel_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 region\n        region = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the region\n        region_average = np.mean(region)\n        # Store the result in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = region_average\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the average of each 2x2 region and output the resulting matrix. Let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is:\n\n```\n[[8.  ]\n [4.  ]\n [3.  ]\n [4.75]\n [6.25]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values of each 2x2 region from the original matrix, calculated with a kernel size of 2 and a stride of 2. Each element is rounded to two decimal places.\n\n<<<[[8.  ]\n [4.  ]\n [3.  ]\n [4.75]\n [6.25]]>>>"
