    "To perform max pooling with a kernel size of 1, we essentially take the maximum value from each 1x1 region of the matrix. Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is its own maximum.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this operation and print the resulting matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [7, 0, 8, 4, 1],\n    [7, 1, 3, 8, 9],\n    [4, 9, 9, 6, 7],\n    [9, 1, 9, 4, 5],\n    [7, 2, 2, 2, 0],\n    [0, 7, 4, 2, 2],\n    [4, 8, 5, 6, 4],\n    [1, 9, 2, 0, 5],\n    [7, 5, 7, 8, 4],\n    [2, 1, 6, 9, 5]\n])\n\n# Kernel size\nkernel_size = 1\n\n# Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix\noutput_matrix = input_matrix\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
    "The code executed correctly without any errors, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected for max pooling with a kernel size of 1. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[7, 0, 8, 4, 1],\n     [7, 1, 3, 8, 9],\n     [4, 9, 9, 6, 7],\n     [9, 1, 9, 4, 5],\n     [7, 2, 2, 2, 0],\n     [0, 7, 4, 2, 2],\n     [4, 8, 5, 6, 4],\n     [1, 9, 2, 0, 5],\n     [7, 5, 7, 8, 4],\n     [2, 1, 6, 9, 5]]>"
