    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 9x5 matrix.\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and since the stride is equal to the kernel size, the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 submatrices from the input matrix and compute their average.\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: Given the input matrix dimensions (9x5) and a kernel size of 2, the output matrix will have dimensions:\n   - Rows: floor(9/2) = 4\n   - Columns: floor(5/2) = 2\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**: For each 2x2 submatrix, calculate the average and place it in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [8, 0, 1, 4, 5],\n    [1, 0, 5, 0, 2],\n    [1, 4, 7, 9, 7],\n    [7, 6, 6, 3, 1],\n    [0, 8, 6, 0, 0],\n    [5, 7, 5, 3, 9],\n    [5, 3, 7, 3, 9],\n    [3, 8, 5, 0, 6]\n])\n\n# Kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 2\nstride = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = input_matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = input_matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the 2x2 submatrix\n        submatrix = input_matrix[i*stride:(i*stride)+kernel_size, j*stride:(j*stride)+kernel_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the submatrix\n        avg_value = np.mean(submatrix)\n        # Assign the average to the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = avg_value\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the average pooling of the given matrix with a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, and then print the resulting matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output matrix was computed correctly. Now, let's provide the final answer in the required format.\n\nThe average pooling result of the given matrix with a kernel size of 2 is:\n\n<<<\n2.25 2.50\n4.50 6.25\n5.00 3.50\n4.75 3.75\n>>>"
