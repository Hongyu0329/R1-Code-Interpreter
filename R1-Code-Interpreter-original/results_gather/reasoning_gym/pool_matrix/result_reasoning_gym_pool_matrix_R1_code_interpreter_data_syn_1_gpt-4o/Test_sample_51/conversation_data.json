    "To perform average pooling with a kernel size of 1, we essentially take each element of the matrix as it is, since the kernel size of 1 means that each element is its own region. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix, but we will format each element to two decimal places.\n\nLet's write a Python script to format the matrix elements to two decimal places:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [2, 7, 8, 7, 0, 0, 8, 3, 4],\n    [8, 4, 0, 5, 0, 6, 2, 4, 7],\n    [5, 0, 9, 9, 5, 9, 0, 4, 6],\n    [4, 2, 6, 7, 0, 8, 2, 7, 8],\n    [0, 6, 4, 1, 9, 4, 9, 4, 5],\n    [1, 5, 3, 7, 9, 3, 9, 5, 2],\n    [5, 0, 3, 7, 2, 9, 7, 5, 5],\n    [4, 4, 6, 5, 9, 9, 2, 8, 3],\n    [4, 7, 2, 4, 8, 1, 9, 7, 9]\n])\n\n# Format each element to two decimal places\nformatted_matrix = np.array([[f\"{element:.2f}\" for element in row] for row in matrix])\n\n# Print the formatted matrix\nprint(formatted_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will format each element of the matrix to two decimal places and print the resulting matrix. Let's execute this code to get the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is formatted with each element to two decimal places. Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, but with each element formatted to two decimal places.\n\nHere is the final output matrix:\n\n<<<\n[['2.00' '7.00' '8.00' '7.00' '0.00' '0.00' '8.00' '3.00' '4.00']\n ['8.00' '4.00' '0.00' '5.00' '0.00' '6.00' '2.00' '4.00' '7.00']\n ['5.00' '0.00' '9.00' '9.00' '5.00' '9.00' '0.00' '4.00' '6.00']\n ['4.00' '2.00' '6.00' '7.00' '0.00' '8.00' '2.00' '7.00' '8.00']\n ['0.00' '6.00' '4.00' '1.00' '9.00' '4.00' '9.00' '4.00' '5.00']\n ['1.00' '5.00' '3.00' '7.00' '9.00' '3.00' '9.00' '5.00' '2.00']\n ['5.00' '0.00' '3.00' '7.00' '2.00' '9.00' '7.00' '5.00' '5.00']\n ['4.00' '4.00' '6.00' '5.00' '9.00' '9.00' '2.00' '8.00' '3.00']\n ['4.00' '7.00' '2.00' '4.00' '8.00' '1.00' '9.00' '7.00' '9.00']]\n>>>"
