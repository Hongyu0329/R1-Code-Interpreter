    "To perform max pooling on a matrix with a kernel size of 1, we essentially take the maximum value from each 1x1 region of the matrix. Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is its own maximum.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Matrix**: \n   ```\n   2 8 1\n   9 3 5\n   1 4 5\n   1 9 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size**: 1\n\n3. **Stride**: 1 (since stride is equal to the kernel size)\n\n4. **Output Matrix**: Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nNow, let's write the code to perform this operation and verify the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [2, 8, 1],\n    [9, 3, 5],\n    [1, 4, 5],\n    [1, 9, 8]\n])\n\n# Kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 1\nstride = 1\n\n# Output matrix is the same as input matrix for kernel size 1\noutput_matrix = input_matrix\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm that the output matrix is the same as the input matrix.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected for a max pooling operation with a kernel size of 1. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n2 8 1\n9 3 5\n1 4 5\n1 9 8\n>>>"
