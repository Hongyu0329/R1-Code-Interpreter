    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to consider each element individually since the kernel size is 1. This means that the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is its own maximum.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   5 2\n   8 1\n   9 5\n   7 6\n   4 0\n   6 6\n   6 1\n   ```\n\n2. With a kernel size of 1, each element is considered individually, so the max pooling operation will not change the values.\n\n3. The output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nNow, let's write the code to confirm this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [5, 2],\n    [8, 1],\n    [9, 5],\n    [7, 6],\n    [4, 0],\n    [6, 6],\n    [6, 1]\n])\n\n# Kernel size is 1, so the output is the same as the input\noutput_matrix = input_matrix\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm that the output matrix is the same as the input matrix.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected with a kernel size of 1. There are no errors in the code execution.\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element is its own maximum, and thus the output matrix is identical to the input matrix.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<\n5 2\n8 1\n9 5\n7 6\n4 0\n6 6\n6 1\n>>>"
