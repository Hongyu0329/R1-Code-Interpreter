    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 2x2 submatrices and calculate the average of each submatrix. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so we move the kernel by 2 units both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's break down the matrix into 2x2 submatrices and calculate the average for each:\n\n1. The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   8 0 3 1 8 0 6 2\n   1 0 7 7 6 3 9 6\n   4 4 0 0 0 4 0 1\n   3 9 6 3 9 6 0 9\n   1 8 0 7 8 1 6 1\n   9 7 0 7 5 0 9 4\n   9 3 6 7 1 4 6 1\n   3 4 4 8 4 5 2 5\n   9 4 4 5 0 0 0 5\n   ```\n\n2.
