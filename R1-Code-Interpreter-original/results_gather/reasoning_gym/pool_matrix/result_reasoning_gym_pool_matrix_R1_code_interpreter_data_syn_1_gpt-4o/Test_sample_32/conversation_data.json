    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 3x3 regions and find the maximum value in each region. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so there will be no overlap between the pooling regions.\n\nLet's break down the given matrix into 3x3 regions:\n\n1. The first 3x3 region is:\n   ```\n   4 6 7\n   6 6 1\n   4 3 5\n   ```\n\n2. The second 3x3 region is:\n   ```\n   0 8 6\n   8 2 0\n   1 4 2\n   ```\n\n3. The third 3x3 region is:\n   ```\n   6 4 5\n   0 5 9\n   6 2 6\n   ```\n\nNow, we will find the maximum value in each of these regions.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [4, 6, 7],\n    [6, 6, 1],\n    [4, 3, 5],\n    [0, 8, 6],\n    [8, 2, 0],\n    [1, 4, 2],\n    [6, 4, 5],\n    [0, 5, 9],\n    [6, 2, 6]\n])\n\n# Define the kernel size\nkernel_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the number of regions\nnum_regions = matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = []\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(num_regions):\n    region = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, :]\n    max_value = np.max(region)\n    output_matrix.append(max_value)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the maximum value for each 3x3 region and store it in the output matrix. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output `[7, 8, 9]` represents the maximum values from each of the 3x3 regions in the input matrix. Each value corresponds to the maximum value found in each of the three regions we identified earlier.\n\nNow, let's format the output as requested:\n\n<<<[7, 8, 9]>>>"
