    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 6x4 matrix:\n   ```\n   2 2 2 6\n   9 7 4 6\n   8 8 8 9\n   4 1 2 8\n   8 4 7 5\n   8 4 6 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and since the stride is equal to the kernel size, the stride is also 3. This means that the pooling operation will be applied to non-overlapping 3x3 regions of the matrix.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 6 rows by 4 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the output matrix will have:\n     - \\( \\text{floor}(6/3) = 2 \\) rows\n     - \\( \\text{floor}(4/3) = 1 \\) column\n\n4. **Apply Max Pooling**: For each 3x3 region, find the maximum value.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this operation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [2, 2, 2, 6],\n    [9, 7, 4, 6],\n    [8, 8, 8, 9],\n    [4, 1, 2, 8],\n    [8, 4, 7, 5],\n    [8, 4, 6, 0]\n])\n\n# Define kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 3\nstride = 3\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Define the current 3x3 region\n        region = matrix[i*stride:(i*stride)+kernel_size, j*stride:(j*stride)+kernel_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the region\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(region)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the max pooled matrix for the given input. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is:\n\n```\n[[9.]\n [8.]]\n```\n\nThis result is obtained by applying max pooling with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3 on the given matrix. The pooling operation was performed on two 3x3 regions:\n\n1. The first 3x3 region:\n   ```\n   2 2 2\n   9 7 4\n   8 8 8\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\n2. The second 3x3 region:\n   ```\n   4 1 2\n   8 4 7\n   8 4 6\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 8.\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<[[9.00], [8.00]]>>>"
