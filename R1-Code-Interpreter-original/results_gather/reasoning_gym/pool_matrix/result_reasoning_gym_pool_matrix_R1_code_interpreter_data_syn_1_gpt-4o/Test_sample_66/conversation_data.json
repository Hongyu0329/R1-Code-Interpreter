    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping submatrices of size 2x2 and then take the maximum value from each submatrix.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n```\n4 9\n1 4\n7 6\n9 2\n7 2\n9 9\n5 2\n```\n\nLet's break down the matrix into 2x2 submatrices:\n1. Submatrix 1:\n   ```\n   4 9\n   1 4\n   ```\n   Max value: 9\n\n2. Submatrix 2:\n   ```\n   7 6\n   9 2\n   ```\n   Max value: 9\n\n3. Submatrix 3:\n   ```\n   7 2\n   9 9\n   ```\n   Max value: 9\n\n4. Submatrix 4:\n   ```\n   5 2\n   ```\n   Since this is a 2x1 matrix, the max value is 5.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to automate this process and ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [4, 9],\n    [1, 4],\n    [7, 6],\n    [9, 2],\n    [7, 2],\n    [9, 9],\n    [5, 2]\n])\n\n# Define the kernel size\nkernel_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the number of submatrices\nnum_submatrices = len(matrix) // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output list\noutput = []\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(num_submatrices):\n    submatrix = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, :]\n    max_value = np.max(submatrix)\n    output.append(max_value)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `[9, 9, 9]`. This output represents the maximum values from each 2x2 submatrix of the original matrix. \n\nThe final output matrix after performing max pooling with a kernel size of 2 is:\n\n<<<\n9\n9\n9\n>>>"
