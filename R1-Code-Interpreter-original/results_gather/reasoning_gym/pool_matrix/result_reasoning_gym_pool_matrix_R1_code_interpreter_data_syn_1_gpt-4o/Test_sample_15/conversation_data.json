    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to consider non-overlapping 2x2 regions of the matrix and find the maximum value in each region. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so we move the kernel by 2 units both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's break down the matrix into 2x2 regions:\n\n1. The first region is:\n   ```\n   7 6\n   8 8\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 8.\n\n2. The second region is:\n   ```\n   7 3\n   0 7\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 7.\n\n3. The third region is:\n   ```\n   0 7\n   7 7\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 7.\n\n4. The fourth region is:\n   ```\n   1 7\n   8 9\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to automate this process and ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [7, 6, 7],\n    [8, 8, 3],\n    [0, 7, 0],\n    [7, 7, 1],\n    [7, 2, 2],\n    [1, 7, 4],\n    [8, 9, 2]\n])\n\n# Define the kernel size\nkernel_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 region\n        region = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the region\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(region)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the max pooled matrix for the given input. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is as expected. The max pooling operation was performed on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, resulting in a smaller matrix with the maximum values from each 2x2 region.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n[[8.]\n [7.]\n [7.]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the maximum values from each 2x2 region of the original matrix. Now, let's format the output as requested:\n\n<<<[[8.], [7.], [7.]]>>>"
