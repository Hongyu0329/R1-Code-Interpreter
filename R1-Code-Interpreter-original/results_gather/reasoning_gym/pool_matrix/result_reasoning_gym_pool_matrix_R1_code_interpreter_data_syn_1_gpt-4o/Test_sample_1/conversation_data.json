    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 2x2 regions and then take the maximum value from each region. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so there will be no overlap between the pooling regions.\n\nGiven matrix:\n```\n4 7 8 2 2\n9 9 3 6 3\n3 1 7 6 0\n0 6 6 0 4\n```\n\nLet's break down the matrix into 2x2 regions:\n1. Top-left 2x2 region: \n   ```\n   4 7\n   9 9\n   ```\n2. Top-right 2x2 region:\n   ```\n   8 2\n   3 6\n   ```\n3. Bottom-left 2x2 region:\n   ```\n   3 1\n   0 6\n   ```\n4. Bottom-right 2x2 region:\n   ```\n   7 6\n   6 0\n   ```\n\nNow, we will find the maximum value in each of these regions and construct the output matrix.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [4, 7, 8, 2, 2],\n    [9, 9, 3, 6, 3],\n    [3, 1, 7, 6, 0],\n    [0, 6, 6, 0, 4]\n])\n\n# Define the kernel size\nkernel_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 region\n        region = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the region\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(region)\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix from the max pooling operation is:\n\n<<<\n9.00 8.00\n6.00 7.00\n>>>"
