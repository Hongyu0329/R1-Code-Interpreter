    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 2x2 regions and then find the maximum value in each region. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so there will be no overlap between the pooling regions.\n\nLet's break down the matrix into 2x2 regions:\n\n1. The first 2x2 region is:\n   ```\n   0 9\n   2 5\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\n2. The second 2x2 region is:\n   ```\n   6 2\n   9 4\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\n3. The third 2x2 region is:\n   ```\n   9 6\n   0 9\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\n4. The fourth 2x2 region is:\n   ```\n   0 2\n   8 4\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 8.\n\n5. The fifth 2x2 region is:\n   ```\n   3 8\n   6 6\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 8.\n\n6. The sixth 2x2 region is:\n   ```\n   0 5\n   9 0\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\n7. The seventh 2x2 region is:\n   ```\n   1 9\n   9 9\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\n8. The eighth 2x2 region is:\n   ```\n   7 3\n   4 4\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 7.\n\n9. The ninth 2x2 region is:\n   ```\n   6 6\n   5 8\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 8.\n\n10. The tenth 2x2 region is:\n    ```\n    9 0\n    4 2\n    ```\n    The maximum value is 9.\n\n11. The eleventh 2x2 region is:\n    ```\n    1 9\n    9 9\n    ```\n    The maximum value is 9.\n\n12. The twelfth 2x2 region is:\n    ```\n    8 1\n    8 1\n    ```\n    The maximum value is 8.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to automate this process and generate the output matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [0, 9, 6, 2, 9, 6, 0, 2],\n    [2, 5, 9, 4, 0, 9, 8, 4],\n    [3, 8, 0, 5, 6, 9, 7, 3],\n    [6, 6, 9, 0, 1, 9, 4, 4],\n    [5, 8, 4, 2, 9, 9, 8, 1]\n])\n\n# Define the kernel size\nkernel_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 region\n        region = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the region\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(region)\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final output matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix from the max pooling operation is:\n\n<<<\n9.00 9.00 9.00 8.00\n8.00 9.00 9.00 7.00\n>>>"
