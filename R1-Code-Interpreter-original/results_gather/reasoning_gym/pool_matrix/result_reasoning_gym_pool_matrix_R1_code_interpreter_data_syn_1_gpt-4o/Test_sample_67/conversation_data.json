    "To perform average pooling with a kernel size of 1, we essentially take each element of the matrix as it is, since the kernel size of 1 means each element is its own region. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix, but we will format it to two decimal places.\n\nLet's write a Python script to format the given matrix to two decimal places.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [1, 3, 9, 8, 9, 8, 2, 4],\n    [5, 4, 1, 7, 3, 7, 1, 1],\n    [0, 6, 4, 7, 2, 0, 8, 8],\n    [4, 9, 7, 5, 4, 9, 1, 9],\n    [0, 5, 9, 3, 3, 6, 2, 5],\n    [0, 5, 1, 2, 1, 9, 1, 3],\n    [8, 8, 9, 2, 9, 8, 0, 7],\n    [3, 2, 0, 6, 0, 2, 3, 2]\n])\n\n# Format each element to two decimal places\nformatted_matrix = np.round(matrix, 2)\n\n# Print the formatted matrix\nprint(formatted_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the formatted matrix.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected for average pooling with a kernel size of 1. Each element is formatted to two decimal places, although they appear as integers because they are whole numbers.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\n1.00 3.00 9.00 8.00 9.00 8.00 2.00 4.00\n5.00 4.00 1.00 7.00 3.00 7.00 1.00 1.00\n0.00 6.00 4.00 7.00 2.00 0.00 8.00 8.00\n4.00 9.00 7.00 5.00 4.00 9.00 1.00 9.00\n0.00 5.00 9.00 3.00 3.00 6.00 2.00 5.00\n0.00 5.00 1.00 2.00 1.00 9.00 1.00 3.00\n8.00 8.00 9.00 2.00 9.00 8.00 0.00 7.00\n3.00 2.00 0.00 6.00 0.00 2.00 3.00 2.00\n>>>"
