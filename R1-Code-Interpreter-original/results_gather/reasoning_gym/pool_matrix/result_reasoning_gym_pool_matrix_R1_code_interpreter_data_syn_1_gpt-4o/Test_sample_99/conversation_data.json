    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 7x7 matrix.\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and since the stride is equal to the kernel size, the stride is also 3. This means that the pooling operation will be applied to non-overlapping 3x3 regions of the matrix.\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: Given the input matrix size of 7x7 and a kernel size of 3, the output matrix will be of size 2x2. This is because the number of possible 3x3 regions that can fit into a 7x7 matrix with a stride of 3 is 2 along each dimension.\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**: For each 3x3 region, calculate the average of the elements and place the result in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the output matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [3, 7, 9, 9, 5, 0, 2],\n    [8, 1, 8, 0, 5, 4, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 2, 7, 5, 8],\n    [7, 5, 0, 7, 0, 3, 8],\n    [8, 8, 6, 8, 3, 2, 4],\n    [5, 3, 5, 3, 8, 0, 9],\n    [1, 8, 2, 2, 6, 5, 6]\n])\n\n# Define kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 3\nstride = 3\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = input_matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = input_matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 3x3 region\n        region = input_matrix[i*stride:(i*stride)+kernel_size, j*stride:(j*stride)+kernel_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the region\n        region_average = np.mean(region)\n        # Assign the average to the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = region_average\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
