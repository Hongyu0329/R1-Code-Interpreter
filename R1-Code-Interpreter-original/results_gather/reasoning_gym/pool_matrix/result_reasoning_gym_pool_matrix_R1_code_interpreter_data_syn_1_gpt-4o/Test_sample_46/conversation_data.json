    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping submatrices of size 2x2 and then take the maximum value from each submatrix.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n```\n5 6 7\n8 9 6\n8 4 4\n3 3 8\n4 4 6\n```\n\nThe matrix has 5 rows and 3 columns.
