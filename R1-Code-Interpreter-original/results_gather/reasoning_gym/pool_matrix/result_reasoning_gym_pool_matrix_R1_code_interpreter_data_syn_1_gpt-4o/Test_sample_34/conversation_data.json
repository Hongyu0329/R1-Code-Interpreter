    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 2x2 regions and calculate the average of each region. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so there will be no overlap between the pooling regions.\n\nGiven matrix:\n```\n4 7 3 5 3 0\n7 6 0 2 2 2\n6 0 8 8 9 9\n```\n\nLet's break down the matrix into 2x2 regions:\n1. Region 1: \n   ```\n   4 7\n   7 6\n   ```\n2. Region 2:\n   ```\n   3 5\n   0 2\n   ```\n3. Region 3:\n   ```\n   3 0\n   2 2\n   ```\n4. Region 4:\n   ```\n   6 0\n   8 8\n   ```\n5. Region 5:\n   ```\n   9 9\n   ```\n\nNow, let's calculate the average for each region and form the output matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [4, 7, 3, 5, 3, 0],\n    [7, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2],\n    [6, 0, 8, 8, 9, 9]\n])\n\n# Define kernel size\nkernel_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 region\n        region = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the region\n        region_average = np.mean(region)\n        # Assign the average to the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = region_average\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the average of each 2x2 region and output the resulting matrix. Let's execute the code to get the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is:\n\n```\n[[6.   2.5  1.75]]\n```\n\nThis matrix represents the average values of each 2x2 region from the original matrix. Each element in the output matrix is rounded to two decimal places.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[[6.00, 2.50, 1.75]]>>>"
