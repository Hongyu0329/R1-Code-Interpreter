    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   2 2 4 4\n   5 2 5 1\n   1 8 1 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3, meaning there is no overlap between the pooling regions.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 3x4.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the output matrix will be 1x1 because the kernel can only fit once in the 3x3 section of the matrix.\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - Extract the 3x3 section from the top-left corner of the matrix:\n     ```\n     2 2 4\n     5 2 5\n     1 8 1\n     ```\n   - Calculate the average of these values.\n\n5. **Compute the Average**: Sum all the elements in the 3x3 section and divide by 9 (since there are 9 elements).\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [2, 2, 4, 4],\n    [5, 2, 5, 1],\n    [1, 8, 1, 2]\n])\n\n# Define the kernel size\nkernel_size = 3\n\n# Extract the 3x3 section\nsection = matrix[:kernel_size, :kernel_size]\n\n# Calculate the average\naverage = np.mean(section)\n\n# Print the result as a 1x1 matrix\nprint(f\"[[{average:.2f}]]\")\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average of the 3x3 section and print it in the required format.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `[[3.33]]`. This is the result of performing average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3. The average of the 3x3 section of the matrix is calculated and formatted to two decimal places.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[[3.33]]>>>"
