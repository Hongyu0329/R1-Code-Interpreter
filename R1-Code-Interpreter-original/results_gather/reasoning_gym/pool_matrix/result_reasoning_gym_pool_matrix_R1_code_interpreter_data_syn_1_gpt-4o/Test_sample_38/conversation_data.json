    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 3x6 matrix:\n   ```\n   6 2 8 0 4 5\n   5 5 4 7 8 0\n   7 4 1 4 2 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3. This means we will take 3x3 submatrices from the input matrix without overlap.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 3 rows by 6 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the output matrix will have:\n     - \\( \\text{floor}(3/3) = 1 \\) row\n     - \\( \\text{floor}(6/3) = 2 \\) columns\n\n4. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - Extract each 3x3 submatrix and find the maximum value in each.\n   - The first submatrix is:\n     ```\n     6 2 8\n     5 5 4\n     7 4 1\n     ```\n     The maximum value is 8.\n   - The second submatrix is:\n     ```\n     0 4 5\n     7 8 0\n     4 2 6\n     ```\n     The maximum value is 8.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix will be 1x2 with the maximum values from each submatrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [6, 2, 8, 0, 4, 5],\n    [5, 5, 4, 7, 8, 0],\n    [7, 4, 1, 4, 2, 6]\n])\n\n# Define kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 3\nstride = 3\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = input_matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = input_matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current submatrix\n        submatrix = input_matrix[i*stride:(i*stride)+kernel_size, j*stride:(j*stride)+kernel_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the submatrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(submatrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
