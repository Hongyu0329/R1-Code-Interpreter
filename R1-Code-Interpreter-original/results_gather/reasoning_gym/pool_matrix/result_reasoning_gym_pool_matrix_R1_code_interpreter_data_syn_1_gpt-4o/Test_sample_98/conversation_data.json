    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 2x2 submatrices and find the maximum value in each submatrix. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so we move the kernel by 2 units both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. The input matrix is 10x8.\n2. With a kernel size of 2, the output matrix will be smaller. Specifically, it will be 5x4 because:\n   - The number of rows in the output matrix is calculated as `floor(10 / 2) = 5`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix is calculated as `floor(8 / 2) = 4`.\n\n3. For each 2x2 submatrix, we will find the maximum value and place it in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [9, 5, 3, 1, 0, 6, 8, 7],\n    [0, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 9, 7],\n    [2, 1, 4, 8, 2, 2, 1, 2],\n    [7, 3, 1, 2, 6, 8, 4, 3],\n    [8, 5, 2, 9, 3, 5, 8, 2],\n    [7, 7, 2, 0, 5, 1, 0, 8],\n    [3, 0, 4, 9, 2, 8, 9, 1],\n    [4, 6, 5, 7, 5, 5, 3, 3],\n    [1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 9, 7, 2],\n    [2, 1, 4, 0, 4, 4, 8, 0]\n])\n\n# Define the kernel size\nkernel_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = input_matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = input_matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 submatrix\n        submatrix = input_matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the submatrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(submatrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nThe code will compute the max pooling result for the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix from the max pooling operation is as follows:\n\n<<<\n9.00 7.00 6.00 9.00\n7.00 8.00 8.00 4.00\n8.00 9.00 5.00 8.00\n6.00 9.00 8.00 9.00\n2.00 5.00 9.00 8.00\n>>>"
