    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to consider each element individually since the kernel size is 1. This means that the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is its own maximum.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   3 4 6 5 8 2\n   1 7 8 0 7 6\n   4 1 6 8 6 6\n   ```\n\n2. With a kernel size of 1, each element is considered individually, so the max pooling operation will result in the same matrix.\n\n3. The output matrix will be:\n   ```\n   3 4 6 5 8 2\n   1 7 8 0 7 6\n   4 1 6 8 6 6\n   ```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, there is no need for any computation or iteration over submatrices. The output is directly the same as the input.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n3 4 6 5 8 2\n1 7 8 0 7 6\n4 1 6 8 6 6\n>>>"
