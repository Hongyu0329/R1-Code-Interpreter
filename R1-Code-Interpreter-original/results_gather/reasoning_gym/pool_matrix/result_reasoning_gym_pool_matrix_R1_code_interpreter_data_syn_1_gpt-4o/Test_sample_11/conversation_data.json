    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   4 0 1 5 0 3\n   1 2 7 0 3 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3, meaning the pooling regions do not overlap.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix has 2 rows and 6 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the output matrix will have:\n     - \\( \\text{output rows} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{input rows}}{\\text{kernel size}} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\)\n     - \\( \\text{output columns} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{input columns}}{\\text{kernel size}} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{6}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 2 \\)\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - Since the number of output rows is 0, it indicates that the kernel size is larger than the number of rows in the input matrix, and thus, no pooling can be performed vertically.\n   - However, we can still perform pooling horizontally, resulting in a single row in the output matrix.\n\n5. **Calculate the Average for Each Pooling Region**:\n   - For the first pooling region (first 3 columns): \\((4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 7) / 6 = 15 / 6 = 2.5\\)\n   - For the second pooling region (next 3 columns): \\((5 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 2) / 6 = 13 / 6 \\approx 2.17\\)\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [4, 0, 1, 5, 0, 3],\n    [1, 2, 7, 0, 3, 2]\n])\n\n# Kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 3\nstride = 3\n\n# Calculate the number of output columns\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((1, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_cols):\n    # Extract the current pooling region\n    pooling_region = matrix[:, i*stride:(i*stride)+kernel_size]\n    # Calculate the average\n    average = np.mean(pooling_region)\n    # Assign to the output matrix\n    output_matrix[0, i] = average\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the output matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is as expected. The average pooling was performed on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, resulting in the following output matrix:\n\n<<<[[2.5, 2.17]]>>>"
