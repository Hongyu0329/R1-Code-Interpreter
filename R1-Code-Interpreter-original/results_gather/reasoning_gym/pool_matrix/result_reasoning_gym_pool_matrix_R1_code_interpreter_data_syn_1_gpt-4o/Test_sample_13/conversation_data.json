    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 2x2 submatrices and find the maximum value in each submatrix. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so we move the kernel by 2 units both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's break down the matrix into 2x2 submatrices and find the maximum value for each:\n\n1. The first 2x2 submatrix is:\n   ```\n   3 0\n   5 9\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\n2. The second 2x2 submatrix is:\n   ```\n   5 3\n   6 8\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 8.\n\n3. The third 2x2 submatrix is:\n   ```\n   4 9\n   7 8\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\n4. The fourth 2x2 submatrix is:\n   ```\n   8 1\n   5 2\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 8.\n\n5. The fifth 2x2 submatrix is:\n   ```\n   8 1\n   9 1\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\n6. The sixth 2x2 submatrix is:\n   ```\n   6 4\n   6 8\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 8.\n\n7. The seventh 2x2 submatrix is:\n   ```\n   8 4\n   8 1\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 8.\n\n8. The eighth 2x2 submatrix is:\n   ```\n   6 4\n   6 0\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 6.\n\n9. The ninth 2x2 submatrix is:\n   ```\n   4 9\n   0 0\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\n10. The tenth 2x2 submatrix is:\n    ```\n    8 0\n    2 9\n    ```\n    The maximum value is 9.\n\n11. The eleventh 2x2 submatrix is:\n    ```\n    9 2\n    2 6\n    ```\n    The maximum value is 9.\n\n12. The twelfth 2x2 submatrix is:\n    ```\n    6 7\n    0 9\n    ```\n    The maximum value is 9.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to automate this process and generate the output matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef max_pooling(matrix, kernel_size):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    output_rows = rows // kernel_size\n    output_cols = cols // kernel_size\n    output_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n    \n    for i in range(output_rows):\n        for j in range(output_cols):\n            sub_matrix = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n            output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(sub_matrix)\n    \n    return output_matrix\n\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [3, 0, 5, 3, 4, 9, 8, 1],\n    [5, 9, 6, 8, 7, 8, 5, 2],\n    [8, 1, 6, 4, 8, 4, 6, 4],\n    [9, 1, 6, 8, 8, 1, 6, 0],\n    [4, 9, 8, 0, 9, 2, 6, 7],\n    [0, 0, 2, 9, 2, 6, 0, 9]\n])\n\noutput_matrix = max_pooling(input_matrix, 2)\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix from the max pooling operation is:\n\n<<<\n9.00 8.00 9.00 8.00\n9.00 8.00 8.00 6.00\n9.00 9.00 9.00 9.00\n>>>"
