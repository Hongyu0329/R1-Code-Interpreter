    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to consider each element individually since the kernel size is 1. This means that the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is averaged over itself.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Matrix**: The input matrix is given as:\n   ```\n   0 3 2 2 2 9 8\n   8 9 7 4 7 0 6\n   2 7 3 0 0 0 6\n   7 9 7 4 9 3 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size**: The kernel size is 1, which means each element is considered individually.\n\n3. **Output Matrix**: Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix. Each element is averaged over itself, so the values remain unchanged.\n\nLet's write the code to confirm this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 9, 8],\n    [8, 9, 7, 4, 7, 0, 6],\n    [2, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6],\n    [7, 9, 7, 4, 9, 3, 2]\n])\n\n# Kernel size\nkernel_size = 1\n\n# Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix\noutput_matrix = input_matrix\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements formatted to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.array2string(output_matrix, formatter={'float_kind':lambda x: \"%.2f\" % x}))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected with a kernel size of 1. Each element is averaged over itself, so the values remain unchanged.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n0 3 2 2 2 9 8\n8 9 7 4 7 0 6\n2 7 3 0 0 0 6\n7 9 7 4 9 3 2\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, the output matrix is identical to the input matrix.\n\n<<<[[0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 9, 8], [8, 9, 7, 4, 7, 0, 6], [2, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6], [7, 9, 7, 4, 9, 3, 2]]>>>"
