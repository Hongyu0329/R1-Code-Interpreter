    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to consider each element individually since the kernel size is 1. This means that the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is averaged over itself.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Matrix**: The matrix is given as:\n   ```\n   2 0 2 6 0\n   5 1 9 1 3\n   7 1 4 9 2\n   6 1 4 7 5\n   1 4 0 5 3\n   2 0 1 3 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size**: The kernel size is 1, which means each element is considered individually.\n\n3. **Output Matrix**: Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix. Each element is averaged over itself, resulting in the same value.\n\nNow, let's generate the output matrix:\n\n```python\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = [\n    [2, 0, 2, 6, 0],\n    [5, 1, 9, 1, 3],\n    [7, 1, 4, 9, 2],\n    [6, 1, 4, 7, 5],\n    [1, 4, 0, 5, 3],\n    [2, 0, 1, 3, 4]\n]\n\n# Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix\noutput_matrix = input_matrix\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThe code will output the matrix, which is the same as the input matrix. Let's execute the code to confirm this.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected with a kernel size of 1. Each element is averaged over itself, resulting in no change to the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n2 0 2 6 0\n5 1 9 1 3\n7 1 4 9 2\n6 1 4 7 5\n1 4 0 5 3\n2 0 1 3 4\n>>>"
