    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 3x3 submatrices and find the maximum value in each submatrix. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so the submatrices do not overlap.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is 8x10.\n2. **Kernel Size**: 3x3.\n3. **Stride**: 3 (same as the kernel size).\n4. **Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The number of rows in the output matrix is `floor(8/3) = 2`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix is `floor(10/3) = 3`.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform the max pooling operation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [3, 2, 6, 7, 1, 4, 9, 0, 0, 2],\n    [7, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 8, 9],\n    [4, 9, 9, 6, 1, 7, 1, 4, 5, 2],\n    [0, 2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 8, 1, 3, 9],\n    [2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 3, 9],\n    [0, 5, 0, 4, 5, 5, 1, 0, 7, 3],\n    [5, 4, 2, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 6],\n    [4, 6, 0, 6, 3, 8, 7, 2, 6, 1]\n])\n\n# Kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 3\nstride = 3\n\n# Calculate output dimensions\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Define the current submatrix\n        submatrix = matrix[i*stride:(i+1)*stride, j*stride:(j+1)*stride]\n        # Find the maximum value in the submatrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(submatrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix from the max pooling operation is:\n\n<<<[[9.00, 7.00, 9.00], [5.00, 5.00, 8.00]]>>>"
