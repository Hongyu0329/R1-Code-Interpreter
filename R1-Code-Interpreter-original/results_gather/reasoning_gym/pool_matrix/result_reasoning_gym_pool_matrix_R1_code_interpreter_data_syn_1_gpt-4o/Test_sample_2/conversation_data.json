    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 3x3 submatrices and calculate the average of each submatrix. The resulting matrix will have dimensions reduced according to the kernel size and stride.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n1 9 6 5 4 3 5\n2 9 8 6 5 6 4\n5 0 5 4 3 3 5\n5 8 8 4 8 4 2\n5 2 2 9 6 8 2\n6 0 5 4 0 4 4\n9 7 4 9 7 3 6\n7 9 6 8 8 9 4\n4 0 1 1 5 9 3\n5 0 0 2 3 4 1\n```\n\nWe will extract the following 3x3 submatrices:\n1. Top-left 3x3 submatrix\n2. Top-middle 3x3 submatrix\n3. Top-right 3x3 submatrix\n4. Middle-left 3x3 submatrix\n5. Middle-middle 3x3 submatrix\n6. Middle-right 3x3 submatrix\n7. Bottom-left 3x3 submatrix\n8. Bottom-middle 3x3 submatrix\n9. Bottom-right 3x3 submatrix\n\nLet's calculate the average for each submatrix using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [1, 9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 5],\n    [2, 9, 8, 6, 5, 6, 4],\n    [5, 0, 5, 4, 3, 3, 5],\n    [5, 8, 8, 4, 8, 4, 2],\n    [5, 2, 2, 9, 6, 8, 2],\n    [6, 0, 5, 4, 0, 4, 4],\n    [9, 7, 4, 9, 7, 3, 6],\n    [7, 9, 6, 8, 8, 9, 4],\n    [4, 0, 1, 1, 5, 9, 3],\n    [5, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 1]\n])\n\n# Kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 3\nstride = 3\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the submatrix\n        submatrix = matrix[i*stride:(i*stride)+kernel_size, j*stride:(j*stride)+kernel_size]\n        # Calculate the average and store it in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.mean(submatrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the average of each 3x3 submatrix and output the resulting matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places.",
