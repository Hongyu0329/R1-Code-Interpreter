    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 2x2 submatrices and calculate the average of each submatrix. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so we move the kernel by 2 units both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's break down the matrix into 2x2 submatrices and calculate the average for each:\n\n1. Submatrix from (0,0) to (1,1): \n   ```\n   5 8\n   6 1\n   ```\n   Average = (5 + 8 + 6 + 1) / 4 = 5.0\n\n2. Submatrix from (0,2) to (1,3):\n   ```\n   5 7\n   8 5\n   ```\n   Average = (5 + 7 + 8 + 5) / 4 = 6.25\n\n3. Submatrix from (0,4) to (1,5):\n   ```\n   8 6\n   1 8\n   ```\n   Average = (8 + 6 + 1 + 8) / 4 = 5.75\n\n4. Submatrix from (2,0) to (3,1):\n   ```\n   9 1\n   8 4\n   ```\n   Average = (9 + 1 + 8 + 4) / 4 = 5.5\n\n5. Submatrix from (2,2) to (3,3):\n   ```\n   7 6\n   0 2\n   ```\n   Average = (7 + 6 + 0 + 2) / 4 = 3.75\n\n6. Submatrix from (2,4) to (3,5):\n   ```\n   8 3\n   3 1\n   ```\n   Average = (8 + 3 + 3 + 1) / 4 = 3.75\n\n7. Submatrix from (4,0) to (5,1):\n   ```\n   6 5\n   1 7\n   ```\n   Average = (6 + 5 + 1 + 7) / 4 = 4.75\n\n8. Submatrix from (4,2) to (5,3):\n   ```\n   0 6\n   7 2\n   ```\n   Average = (0 + 6 + 7 + 2) / 4 = 3.75\n\n9. Submatrix from (4,4) to (5,5):\n   ```\n   3 6\n   4 5\n   ```\n   Average = (3 + 6 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 4.5\n\n10. Submatrix from (6,0) to (7,1):\n    ```\n    8 7\n    2 0\n    ```\n    Average = (8 + 7 + 2 + 0) / 4 = 4.25\n\n11. Submatrix from (6,2) to (7,3):\n    ```\n    2 9\n    4 4\n    ```\n    Average = (2 + 9 + 4 + 4) / 4 = 4.75\n\n12. Submatrix from (6,4) to (7,5):\n    ```\n    0 4\n    8 4\n    ```\n    Average = (0 + 4 + 8 + 4) / 4 = 4.0\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to automate this process and generate the output matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [5, 8, 5, 7, 8, 6],\n    [6, 1, 8, 5, 1, 8],\n    [9, 1, 7, 6, 8, 3],\n    [8, 4, 0, 2, 3, 1],\n    [6, 5, 0, 6, 3, 6],\n    [1, 7, 7, 2, 4, 5],\n    [8, 7, 2, 9, 0, 4],\n    [2, 0, 4, 4, 8, 4]\n])\n\n# Define kernel size\nkernel_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        submatrix = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.mean(submatrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the average pooling for each 2x2 submatrix and output the resulting matrix.",
