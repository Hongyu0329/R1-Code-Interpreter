    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 6x8 matrix:\n   ```\n   3 9 3 5 7 3 5 4\n   8 2 3 4 4 4 4 3\n   0 8 3 3 8 7 9 9\n   8 3 5 9 0 3 3 4\n   7 1 9 5 1 1 7 7\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2, meaning the pooling regions do not overlap.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 6 rows by 8 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the output matrix will have:\n     - \\( \\text{rows} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\)\n     - \\( \\text{columns} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\)\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**: For each 2x2 block in the input matrix, calculate the average and place it in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the output matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [3, 9, 3, 5, 7, 3, 5, 4],\n    [8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3],\n    [0, 8, 3, 3, 8, 7, 9, 9],\n    [8, 3, 5, 9, 0, 3, 3, 4],\n    [7, 1, 9, 5, 1, 1, 7, 7]\n])\n\n# Kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 2\nstride = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = input_matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = input_matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 block\n        block = input_matrix[i*stride:(i*stride)+kernel_size, j*stride:(j*stride)+kernel_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the block\n        block_average = np.mean(block)\n        # Assign the average to the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = block_average\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the average pooling of the given matrix with a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, and output the resulting matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output matrix after performing average pooling on the given input matrix. The output matrix is:\n\n```\n[[5.5  3.75 4.5  4.  ]\n [4.75 5.   4.5  6.25]]\n```\n\nThis matrix is the result of applying a 2x2 average pooling operation with a stride of 2 on the input matrix. Each element in the output matrix represents the average of a 2x2 block from the input matrix.\n\n<<<[[5.5, 3.75, 4.5, 4.0], [4.75, 5.0, 4.5, 6.25]]>>>"
