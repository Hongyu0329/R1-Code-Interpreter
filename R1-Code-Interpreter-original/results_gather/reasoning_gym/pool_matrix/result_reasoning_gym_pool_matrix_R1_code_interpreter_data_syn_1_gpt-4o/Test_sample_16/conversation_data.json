    "To perform max pooling with a kernel size of 1, we need to consider each element of the matrix individually. Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is its own maximum.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this operation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [0, 3, 1, 4, 0, 0, 6],\n    [6, 2, 0, 6, 6, 0, 7],\n    [8, 2, 2, 5, 2, 5, 9],\n    [2, 6, 2, 1, 5, 6, 0],\n    [5, 2, 6, 6, 5, 6, 2],\n    [2, 5, 4, 7, 3, 2, 0],\n    [3, 3, 6, 0, 2, 1, 6],\n    [9, 3, 9, 1, 7, 4, 2],\n    [1, 6, 3, 5, 0, 7, 4],\n    [2, 1, 9, 3, 0, 3, 0]\n])\n\n# Kernel size\nkernel_size = 1\n\n# Since the kernel size is 1, the output is the same as the input\noutput_matrix = matrix\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
