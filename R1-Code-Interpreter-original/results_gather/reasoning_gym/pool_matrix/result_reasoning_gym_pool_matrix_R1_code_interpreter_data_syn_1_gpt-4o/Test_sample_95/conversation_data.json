    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to consider each element individually since the kernel size is 1. This means that each element in the output matrix will be the same as the corresponding element in the input matrix because the average of a single number is the number itself.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n9 2 4\n3 9 4\n```\n\nWith a kernel size of 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix. Let's write the code to confirm this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [9, 2, 4],\n    [3, 9, 4]\n])\n\n# Kernel size\nkernel_size = 1\n\n# Perform average pooling\noutput_matrix = np.zeros_like(input_matrix, dtype=float)\n\nfor i in range(0, input_matrix.shape[0], kernel_size):\n    for j in range(0, input_matrix.shape[1], kernel_size):\n        # Extract the current region\n        region = input_matrix[i:i+kernel_size, j:j+kernel_size]\n        # Compute the average\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.mean(region)\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected with a kernel size of 1. Each element in the output matrix is the average of the corresponding single element in the input matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n9.00 2.00 4.00\n3.00 9.00 4.00\n>>>"
