    "To perform max pooling with a kernel size of 1, we essentially take each element of the matrix as it is, because the kernel size of 1 means that each element is its own region. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's write the code to confirm this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [0, 9, 2, 9, 8, 0],\n    [8, 5, 9, 2, 2, 3],\n    [1, 1, 8, 3, 4, 1],\n    [8, 5, 9, 1, 3, 6]\n])\n\n# Kernel size\nkernel_size = 1\n\n# Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix\noutput_matrix = input_matrix\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected for max pooling with a kernel size of 1. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n0 9 2 9 8 0\n8 5 9 2 2 3\n1 1 8 3 4 1\n8 5 9 1 3 6\n>>>"
