    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping submatrices of size 2x2 and then take the maximum value from each submatrix.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n```\n5 4\n0 2\n9 7\n6 4\n9 7\n1 8\n2 0\n5 6\n1 9\n5 5\n```\n\nThis matrix can be visualized as:\n```\n5 4\n0 2\n9 7\n6 4\n9 7\n1 8\n2 0\n5 6\n1 9\n5 5\n```\n\nWe will apply a 2x2 max pooling operation. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Divide the matrix into 2x2 blocks:\n   - Block 1: [[5, 4], [0, 2]]\n   - Block 2: [[9, 7], [6, 4]]\n   - Block 3: [[9, 7], [1, 8]]\n   - Block 4: [[2, 0], [5, 6]]\n   - Block 5: [[1, 9], [5, 5]]\n\n2. For each block, find the maximum value.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this operation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [5, 4],\n    [0, 2],\n    [9, 7],\n    [6, 4],\n    [9, 7],\n    [1, 8],\n    [2, 0],\n    [5, 6],\n    [1, 9],\n    [5, 5]\n])\n\n# Define the kernel size\nkernel_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the number of blocks\nnum_blocks = matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = []\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(num_blocks):\n    block = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, :]\n    max_value = np.max(block)\n    output_matrix.append(max_value)\n\n# Convert the output to a numpy array\noutput_matrix = np.array(output_matrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the maximum value for each 2x2 block and output the resulting matrix. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output `[5 9 9 6 9]` represents the maximum values from each 2x2 block of the input matrix. \n\nThe output matrix is a 1D array because each 2x2 block is reduced to a single maximum value. Since the input matrix had 10 rows and we used a kernel size of 2, we have 5 blocks, resulting in 5 maximum values.\n\nNow, let's format the output as requested:\n\n<<<[5, 9, 9, 6, 9]>>>"
