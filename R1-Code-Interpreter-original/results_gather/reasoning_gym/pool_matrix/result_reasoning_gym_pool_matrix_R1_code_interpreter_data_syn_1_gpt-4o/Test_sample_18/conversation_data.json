    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 2x2 submatrices and calculate the average of each submatrix. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so we move the kernel by 2 units both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. The input matrix is 10x6.\n2. With a kernel size of 2, the output matrix will be smaller. Specifically, the output dimensions will be:\n   - Height: floor(10 / 2) = 5\n   - Width: floor(6 / 2) = 3\n3. We will iterate over the matrix with steps of 2 to extract each 2x2 submatrix, compute its average, and store it in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 1, 4, 6, 5],\n    [6, 6, 5, 2, 7, 4],\n    [3, 6, 4, 1, 5, 9],\n    [0, 6, 3, 2, 9, 3],\n    [3, 3, 2, 0, 3, 2],\n    [0, 3, 0, 0, 7, 3],\n    [8, 7, 4, 4, 0, 0],\n    [3, 3, 1, 9, 4, 5],\n    [7, 0, 3, 5, 6, 1],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n])\n\n# Define kernel size\nkernel_size = 2\n\n# Calculate output dimensions\noutput_height = input_matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_width = input_matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_height, output_width))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_height):\n    for j in range(output_width):\n        # Extract the 2x2 submatrix\n        submatrix = input_matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n        # Calculate the average and store it in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.mean(submatrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the average pooling of the given matrix with a kernel size of 2 and output the result.",
