    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to consider each element individually since the kernel size is 1. This means that the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is averaged over itself.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Matrix**: The matrix is given as a 2D list.\n2. **Kernel Size**: The kernel size is 1, which means each element is considered individually.\n3. **Stride**: The stride is equal to the kernel size, which is 1 in this case.\n4. **Output Matrix**: Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nNow, let's write the code to perform this operation and print the output matrix.\n\n```python\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = [\n    [0, 3, 2, 0, 1, 3, 9],\n    [7, 5, 8, 3, 3, 2, 6],\n    [0, 4, 6, 9, 3, 8, 4],\n    [7, 6, 1, 5, 2, 1, 5],\n    [3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4],\n    [5, 4, 5, 7, 6, 2, 4],\n    [5, 8, 4, 6, 1, 4, 9],\n    [9, 5, 2, 4, 4, 4, 3]\n]\n\n# Kernel size\nkernel_size = 1\n\n# Perform average pooling\noutput_matrix = []\nfor i in range(0, len(input_matrix), kernel_size):\n    row = []\n    for j in range(0, len(input_matrix[0]), kernel_size):\n        # Since kernel size is 1, each element is its own average\n        row.append(round(input_matrix[i][j], 2))\n    output_matrix.append(row)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the same matrix as the input matrix, as each element is averaged over itself. Let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected. This is because the kernel size is 1, meaning each element is averaged over itself, resulting in no change to the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, which is the output matrix, is:\n\n<<<[[0, 3, 2, 0, 1, 3, 9], [7, 5, 8, 3, 3, 2, 6], [0, 4, 6, 9, 3, 8, 4], [7, 6, 1, 5, 2, 1, 5], [3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 4, 5, 7, 6, 2, 4], [5, 8, 4, 6, 1, 4, 9], [9, 5, 2, 4, 4, 4, 3]]>>>"
