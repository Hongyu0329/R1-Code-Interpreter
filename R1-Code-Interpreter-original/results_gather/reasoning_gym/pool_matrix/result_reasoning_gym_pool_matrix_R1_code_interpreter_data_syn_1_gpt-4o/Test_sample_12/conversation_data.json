    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 3x3 submatrices and calculate the average of each submatrix. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so there will be no overlap between the pooling regions.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is 8x10. With a kernel size of 3, the output matrix will have dimensions:\n   - Rows: floor(8/3) = 2\n   - Columns: floor(10/3) = 3\n\n2. **Submatrices**: We will extract 3x3 submatrices from the input matrix and compute the average of each submatrix.\n\n3. **Average Calculation**: For each 3x3 submatrix, sum all the elements and divide by 9 (since there are 9 elements in a 3x3 matrix).\n\n4. **Output Matrix**: Construct the output matrix using the calculated averages, ensuring each element is rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [4, 3, 1, 3, 0, 4, 3, 8, 7, 7],\n    [6, 9, 3, 7, 3, 3, 6, 5, 4, 5],\n    [9, 1, 8, 7, 4, 5, 3, 0, 4, 9],\n    [2, 8, 8, 6, 2, 0, 3, 4, 8, 3],\n    [2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 9, 8, 1, 8, 9],\n    [4, 2, 4, 6, 7, 5, 5, 6, 2, 5],\n    [1, 8, 9, 1, 8, 0, 9, 3, 5, 9],\n    [5, 0, 8, 0, 4, 2, 9, 7, 6, 6]\n])\n\n# Kernel size\nkernel_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the 3x3 submatrix\n        submatrix = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n        # Calculate the average and store it in the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.mean(submatrix)\n\n# Round the output matrix to 2 decimal places\noutput_matrix = np.round(output_matrix, 2)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the average pooling of the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and output the resulting matrix.",
