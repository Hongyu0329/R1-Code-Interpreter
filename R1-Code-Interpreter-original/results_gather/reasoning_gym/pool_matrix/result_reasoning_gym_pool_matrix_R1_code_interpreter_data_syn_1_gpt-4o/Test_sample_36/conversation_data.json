    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to consider each element individually since the kernel size is 1. This means that the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is averaged over itself.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Matrix**: We have a 10x10 matrix.\n2. **Kernel Size**: The kernel size is 1, which means each element is considered individually.\n3. **Stride**: The stride is equal to the kernel size, which is 1.\n4. **Output Matrix**: Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nGiven these conditions, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix. Let's write the code to confirm this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [2, 7, 4, 0, 8, 7, 4, 6, 3, 3],\n    [8, 5, 1, 9, 8, 6, 1, 4, 5, 0],\n    [7, 3, 5, 4, 7, 3, 7, 2, 5, 2],\n    [9, 8, 0, 9, 0, 5, 7, 2, 9, 4],\n    [4, 2, 2, 7, 7, 6, 0, 9, 1, 1],\n    [0, 4, 3, 4, 7, 2, 5, 2, 6, 3],\n    [4, 3, 4, 3, 8, 9, 2, 9, 6, 9],\n    [4, 4, 9, 8, 7, 3, 2, 7, 2, 6],\n    [3, 6, 5, 4, 8, 8, 7, 0, 5, 4]\n])\n\n# Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix\noutput_matrix = input_matrix\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the output.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected. Since the kernel size is 1, each element is averaged over itself, resulting in no change to the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n2 7 4 0 8 7 4 6 3 3\n8 5 1 9 8 6 1 4 5 0\n7 3 5 4 7 3 7 2 5 2\n9 8 0 9 0 5 7 2 9 4\n4 2 2 7 7 6 0 9 1 1\n0 4 3 4 7 2 5 2 6 3\n4 3 4 3 8 9 2 9 6 9\n4 4 9 8 7 3 2 7 2 6\n3 6 5 4 8 8 7 0 5 4\n>>>"
