    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 2x2 regions and find the maximum value in each region. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so we move the kernel by 2 units both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's break down the matrix into 2x2 regions:\n\n1. The first region is from (0,0) to (1,1).\n2. The second region is from (0,2) to (1,3).\n3. The third region is from (0,4) to (1,5).\n4. The fourth region is from (2,0) to (3,1).\n5. The fifth region is from (2,2) to (3,3).\n6. The sixth region is from (2,4) to (3,5).\n7. The seventh region is from (4,0) to (5,1).\n8. The eighth region is from (4,2) to (5,3).\n9. The ninth region is from (4,4) to (5,5).\n10. The tenth region is from (6,0) to (7,1).\n11. The eleventh region is from (6,2) to (7,3).\n12. The twelfth region is from (6,4) to (7,5).\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform max pooling on these regions and generate the output matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [0, 3, 9, 0, 0],\n    [0, 6, 2, 8, 9],\n    [5, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [8, 7, 9, 7, 1],\n    [9, 2, 9, 1, 5],\n    [0, 5, 5, 2, 2],\n    [3, 6, 4, 0, 1],\n    [7, 3, 1, 5, 5]\n])\n\n# Define the kernel size\nkernel_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 region\n        region = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the region\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(region)\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix from the max pooling operation is:\n\n<<<[[6. 9.]\n [8. 9.]\n [9. 9.]\n [7. 5.]]>>>"
