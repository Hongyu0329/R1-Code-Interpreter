    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 3x3 regions and compute the average of each region. The resulting matrix will have dimensions reduced according to the kernel size and stride.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Matrix**: The matrix is 8x8.\n2. **Kernel Size**: 3x3\n3. **Stride**: 3 (same as kernel size, so no overlap)\n4. **Output Matrix Size**: Since the input matrix is 8x8 and the kernel size is 3 with a stride of 3, the output matrix will be 2x2. This is calculated as:\n   - Number of rows in the output = floor((8 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 2\n   - Number of columns in the output = floor((8 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 2\n\n5. **Pooling Process**: For each 3x3 region, calculate the average and place it in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the average pooling:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [1, 5, 3, 4, 2, 1, 7, 9],\n    [0, 1, 4, 3, 1, 7, 2, 1],\n    [8, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4],\n    [7, 5, 3, 7, 4, 9, 2, 3],\n    [5, 9, 7, 1, 4, 5, 7, 4],\n    [6, 2, 6, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5],\n    [3, 3, 6, 5, 2, 5, 6, 7],\n    [1, 1, 7, 4, 9, 3, 0, 3]\n])\n\n# Kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 3\nstride = 3\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = (matrix.shape[0] - kernel_size) // stride + 1\noutput_cols = (matrix.shape[1] - kernel_size) // stride + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Define the current 3x3 region\n        region = matrix[i*stride:i*stride+kernel_size, j*stride:j*stride+kernel_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the region\n        region_average = np.mean(region)\n        # Assign the average to the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = region_average\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
