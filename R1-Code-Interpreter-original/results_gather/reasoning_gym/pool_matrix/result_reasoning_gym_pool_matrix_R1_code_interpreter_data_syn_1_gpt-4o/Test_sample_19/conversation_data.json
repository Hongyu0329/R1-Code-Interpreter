    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 5x10 matrix.\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and since the stride is equal to the kernel size, the stride is also 3.\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The output matrix will have dimensions calculated by the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{output\\_rows} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{input\\_rows} - \\text{kernel\\_size}}{\\text{stride}} \\right\\rfloor + 1\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{output\\_cols} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{input\\_cols} - \\text{kernel\\_size}}{\\text{stride}} \\right\\rfloor + 1\n     \\]\n   - For the given matrix, this results in an output matrix of size 1x3.\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**: \n   - For each 3x3 block in the input matrix, calculate the average and place it in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [9, 5, 0, 9, 5, 0, 5, 4, 9, 5],\n    [5, 4, 4, 3, 6, 4, 6, 9, 1, 4],\n    [7, 0, 8, 8, 6, 4, 5, 9, 2, 3],\n    [7, 7, 3, 8, 2, 5, 7, 1, 3, 5],\n    [8, 9, 6, 5, 7, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1]\n])\n\n# Define kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 3\nstride = 3\n\n# Calculate output dimensions\noutput_rows = (input_matrix.shape[0] - kernel_size) // stride + 1\noutput_cols = (input_matrix.shape[1] - kernel_size) // stride + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 3x3 block\n        block = input_matrix[i*stride:i*stride+kernel_size, j*stride:j*stride+kernel_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the block\n        block_average = np.mean(block)\n        # Assign the average to the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = block_average\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
