    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to consider the matrix as a 2D array and apply the pooling operation. The stride is equal to the kernel size, which means we will move the kernel by 3 units both horizontally and vertically without any overlap.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n```\n5 7\n6 7\n0 5\n3 3\n1 3\n1 5\n```\n\nThis matrix can be visualized as:\n```\n[\n [5, 7],\n [6, 7],\n [0, 5],\n [3, 3],\n [1, 3],\n [1, 5]\n]\n```\n\nWith a kernel size of 3, we will take 3x2 submatrices and find the maximum value in each submatrix. Since the matrix has 6 rows and 2 columns, and the kernel size is 3, we will have two submatrices to consider:\n1. The first submatrix consists of the first three rows.\n2. The second submatrix consists of the next three rows.\n\nLet's calculate the max pooling for each submatrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [5, 7],\n    [6, 7],\n    [0, 5],\n    [3, 3],\n    [1, 3],\n    [1, 5]\n])\n\n# Define the kernel size\nkernel_size = 3\n\n# Calculate the number of output rows\noutput_rows = matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, matrix.shape[1]))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    submatrix = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, :]\n    output_matrix[i] = np.max(submatrix, axis=0)\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the max pooling for the given matrix and output the result. Let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output matrix after performing max pooling with a kernel size of 3. The output matrix is:\n\n```\n[[6. 7.]\n [3. 5.]]\n```\n\nThis result is obtained by taking the maximum value from each 3x2 submatrix of the input matrix. The first submatrix (first three rows) gives the maximum values [6, 7], and the second submatrix (next three rows) gives the maximum values [3, 5].\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[6.00, 7.00], [3.00, 5.00]]>>>"
