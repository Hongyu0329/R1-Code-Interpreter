    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to consider each element individually since the kernel size is 1. This means that the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is its own maximum.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Matrix**: We have a 3x10 matrix.\n2. **Kernel Size**: 1, which means each element is considered individually.\n3. **Stride**: Equal to the kernel size, which is 1.\n4. **Output Matrix**: Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nGiven this, we can directly output the input matrix as the result of the max pooling operation.\n\nHere's the input matrix:\n\n```\n5 6 3 3 5 8 5 7 8 8\n3 2 8 1 8 3 8 4 1 3\n2 3 3 2 9 3 7 5 6 1\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same:\n\n```\n5 6 3 3 5 8 5 7 8 8\n3 2 8 1 8 3 8 4 1 3\n2 3 3 2 9 3 7 5 6 1\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n5 6 3 3 5 8 5 7 8 8\n3 2 8 1 8 3 8 4 1 3\n2 3 3 2 9 3 7 5 6 1\n>>>"
