    "To perform max pooling with a kernel size of 1, we essentially take each element of the matrix as it is, because the kernel size of 1 means that each element is its own pool. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's write the code to perform this operation and print the output matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [7, 8, 8, 6, 6, 0],\n    [9, 6, 5, 9, 1, 1],\n    [0, 9, 8, 1, 1, 6],\n    [4, 1, 4, 2, 0, 8],\n    [0, 2, 8, 0, 5, 3],\n    [0, 3, 9, 8, 6, 6],\n    [8, 3, 6, 7, 2, 3],\n    [0, 6, 7, 2, 3, 7],\n    [5, 5, 7, 3, 2, 1],\n    [1, 7, 4, 4, 6, 1]\n])\n\n# Kernel size\nkernel_size = 1\n\n# Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix\noutput_matrix = input_matrix\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
