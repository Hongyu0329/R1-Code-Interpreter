    "To perform average pooling with a kernel size of 1, we need to consider each element individually since the kernel size is 1. This means that the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is averaged over itself.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Matrix**: The input matrix is given as a 10x6 matrix.\n2. **Kernel Size**: The kernel size is 1, which means each element is considered individually.\n3. **Stride**: The stride is equal to the kernel size, which is 1 in this case.\n4. **Output Matrix**: Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nGiven these points, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix. Let's write the code to confirm this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [5, 6, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [8, 7, 2, 8, 7, 3],\n    [3, 3, 9, 4, 3, 5],\n    [9, 3, 3, 9, 6, 0],\n    [3, 7, 3, 1, 1, 5],\n    [3, 7, 3, 6, 5, 7],\n    [3, 8, 5, 7, 3, 5],\n    [9, 3, 7, 6, 8, 4],\n    [1, 6, 2, 5, 7, 9],\n    [5, 4, 7, 2, 2, 5]\n])\n\n# Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix\noutput_matrix = input_matrix\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThe code will output the same matrix as the input matrix, confirming that average pooling with a kernel size of 1 results in no change to the matrix. Let's execute the code to verify this.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, as expected when performing average pooling with a kernel size of 1. There are no errors in the execution.\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element is averaged over itself, resulting in no change to the matrix. Therefore, the output matrix is identical to the input matrix.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<\n5 6 1 2 1 1\n8 7 2 8 7 3\n3 3 9 4 3 5\n9 3 3 9 6 0\n3 7 3 1 1 5\n3 7 3 6 5 7\n3 8 5 7 3 5\n9 3 7 6 8 4\n1 6 2 5 7 9\n5 4 7 2 2 5\n>>>"
