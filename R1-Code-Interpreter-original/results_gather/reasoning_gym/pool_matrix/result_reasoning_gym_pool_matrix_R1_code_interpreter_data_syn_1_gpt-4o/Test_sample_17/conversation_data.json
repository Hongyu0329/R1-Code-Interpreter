    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   8 5 6 4 2 5 5\n   1 2 4 0 2 3 6\n   1 6 4 8 3 8 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 submatrices from the input matrix and compute the average of each submatrix.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix has 3 rows and 7 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(3/2) = 1`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor(7/2) = 3`.\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - Extract each 2x2 submatrix, compute its average, and place the result in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the output matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [8, 5, 6, 4, 2, 5, 5],\n    [1, 2, 4, 0, 2, 3, 6],\n    [1, 6, 4, 8, 3, 8, 9]\n])\n\n# Define kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 2\nstride = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = (input_matrix.shape[0] - kernel_size) // stride + 1\noutput_cols = (input_matrix.shape[1] - kernel_size) // stride + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the 2x2 submatrix\n        submatrix = input_matrix[i*stride:i*stride+kernel_size, j*stride:j*stride+kernel_size]\n        # Compute the average and assign it to the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.mean(submatrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the average pooling of the input matrix with a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, and then print the resulting output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix from the average pooling operation is:\n\n```\n[[4.0, 3.5, 3.0]]\n```\n\nThis matrix is the result of applying a 2x2 average pooling operation on the given input matrix with a stride of 2. Each element in the output matrix represents the average of a 2x2 submatrix from the input.\n\n<<<[[4.0, 3.5, 3.0]]>>>"
