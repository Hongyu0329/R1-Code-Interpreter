    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   3 5 5\n   7 9 9\n   3 6 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 submatrices from the input matrix and find the maximum value in each submatrix.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 3x3.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the output matrix will be smaller.\n   - The number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor((3 - 2) / 2) + 1 = 1`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor((3 - 2) / 2) + 1 = 1`.\n\n4. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - Extract the 2x2 submatrices and find the maximum value in each.\n   - The submatrices are:\n     - Top-left 2x2: `[[3, 5], [7, 9]]`\n     - Top-right 2x2: `[[5, 5], [9, 9]]`\n     - Bottom-left 2x2: `[[7, 9], [3, 6]]`\n     - Bottom-right 2x2: `[[9, 9], [6, 9]]`\n   - Calculate the maximum for each submatrix.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [3, 5, 5],\n    [7, 9, 9],\n    [3, 6, 9]\n])\n\n# Define kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 2\nstride = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = (input_matrix.shape[0] - kernel_size) // stride + 1\noutput_cols = (input_matrix.shape[1] - kernel_size) // stride + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 submatrix\n        submatrix = input_matrix[i*stride:i*stride+kernel_size, j*stride:j*stride+kernel_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the submatrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(submatrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the max pooling result for the given matrix. Let's execute it to find the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix from the max pooling operation is `[[9.]]`. This result is expected because the maximum value from the 2x2 submatrices is 9.\n\nNow, let's format the output matrix as requested:\n\n<<<[[9.]]>>>"
