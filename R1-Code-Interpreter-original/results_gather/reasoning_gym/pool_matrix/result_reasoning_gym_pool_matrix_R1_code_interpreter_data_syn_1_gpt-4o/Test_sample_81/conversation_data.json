    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to consider each element individually since the kernel size is 1. This means that the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is its own maximum.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Matrix**: \n   ```\n   5 2 2 6 7 0\n   9 0 2 7 4 5\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size**: 1\n\n3. **Stride**: 1 (since stride is equal to the kernel size)\n\n4. **Max Pooling**: Since the kernel size is 1, each element is its own maximum. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to perform this operation and print the output matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [5, 2, 2, 6, 7, 0],\n    [9, 0, 2, 7, 4, 5]\n])\n\n# Kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 1\nstride = 1\n\n# Since kernel size is 1, the output is the same as the input\noutput_matrix = input_matrix\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matrix is the same as the input matrix because the kernel size is 1. Therefore, each element is its own maximum.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n5 2 2 6 7 0\n9 0 2 7 4 5\n```\n\nSince the task is to provide the output matrix in the same format as the input matrix, enclosed within triple angle brackets, here is the final answer:\n\n<<<\n5 2 2 6 7 0\n9 0 2 7 4 5\n>>>"
