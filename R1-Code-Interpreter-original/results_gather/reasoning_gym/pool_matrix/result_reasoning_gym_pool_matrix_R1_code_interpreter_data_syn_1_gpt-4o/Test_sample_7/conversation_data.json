    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 5x6 matrix:\n   ```\n   9 9 9 0 4 6\n   3 0 4 8 1 4\n   9 0 4 4 4 9\n   6 5 7 8 8 8\n   7 1 9 7 6 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 submatrices and move 2 steps at a time both horizontally and vertically.\n\n3. **Calculate the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The input matrix is 5 rows by 6 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the output matrix will have:\n     - Rows: floor(5/2) = 2\n     - Columns: floor(6/2) = 3\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**: For each 2x2 submatrix, calculate the average and place it in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\ninput_matrix = np.array([\n    [9, 9, 9, 0, 4, 6],\n    [3, 0, 4, 8, 1, 4],\n    [9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 9],\n    [6, 5, 7, 8, 8, 8],\n    [7, 1, 9, 7, 6, 9]\n])\n\n# Define kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 2\nstride = 2\n\n# Calculate output dimensions\noutput_rows = input_matrix.shape[0] // kernel_size\noutput_cols = input_matrix.shape[1] // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the 2x2 submatrix\n        submatrix = input_matrix[i*stride:i*stride+kernel_size, j*stride:j*stride+kernel_size]\n        # Calculate the average\n        avg_value = np.mean(submatrix)\n        # Assign the average to the output matrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = avg_value\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the average pooling of the given matrix with a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix from the average pooling operation is:\n\n```\n[[5.25 5.25 3.75]\n [5.   5.75 7.25]]\n```\n\nThis matrix is the result of applying average pooling with a kernel size of 2 on the given input matrix. Each element in the output matrix represents the average of a 2x2 submatrix from the input matrix.\n\n<<<[[5.25, 5.25, 3.75], [5.0, 5.75, 7.25]]>>>"
