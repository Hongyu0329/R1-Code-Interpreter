    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to divide the matrix into non-overlapping 2x2 submatrices and find the maximum value in each submatrix. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so we move the kernel by 2 steps both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. The input matrix is 9x9.\n2. With a kernel size of 2, the output matrix will be smaller. Specifically, it will be a 4x4 matrix because:\n   - The number of rows in the output matrix = (9 - 2) / 2 + 1 = 4\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix = (9 - 2) / 2 + 1 = 4\n3. For each 2x2 submatrix, we find the maximum value and place it in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [4, 7, 2, 0, 1, 0, 2, 6, 3],\n    [5, 8, 6, 8, 5, 8, 0, 9, 3],\n    [9, 7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 4, 8, 5],\n    [2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 0, 0, 9],\n    [3, 6, 6, 5, 6, 9, 8, 2, 1],\n    [6, 4, 3, 0, 7, 0, 2, 0, 9],\n    [8, 9, 0, 3, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n    [6, 7, 8, 5, 7, 9, 3, 6, 3],\n    [8, 8, 8, 1, 6, 1, 1, 4, 9]\n])\n\n# Define the kernel size\nkernel_size = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = (matrix.shape[0] - kernel_size) // kernel_size + 1\noutput_cols = (matrix.shape[1] - kernel_size) // kernel_size + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current 2x2 submatrix\n        submatrix = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n        # Find the maximum value in the submatrix\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.max(submatrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
