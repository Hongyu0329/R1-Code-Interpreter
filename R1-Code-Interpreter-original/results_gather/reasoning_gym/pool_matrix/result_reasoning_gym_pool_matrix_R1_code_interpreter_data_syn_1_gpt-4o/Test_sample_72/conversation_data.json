    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   5 1 9 6 8\n   8 4 0 3 7\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3, meaning the pooling regions do not overlap.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 2x5.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the output matrix will be smaller.\n   - The number of pooling regions horizontally is calculated as `floor((5 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 1`.\n   - The number of pooling regions vertically is calculated as `floor((2 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 0`.\n   - Since the vertical dimension is less than the kernel size, no pooling can be performed, resulting in an empty output matrix.\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**: \n   - Since the vertical dimension is less than the kernel size, no pooling can be performed, resulting in an empty output matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to confirm the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [5, 1, 9, 6, 8],\n    [8, 4, 0, 3, 7]\n])\n\n# Define kernel size and stride\nkernel_size = 3\nstride = 3\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the output matrix\noutput_rows = (matrix.shape[0] - kernel_size) // stride + 1\noutput_cols = (matrix.shape[1] - kernel_size) // stride + 1\n\n# Initialize the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current pooling region\n        pooling_region = matrix[i*stride:i*stride+kernel_size, j*stride:j*stride+kernel_size]\n        # Calculate the average of the pooling region\n        output_matrix[i, j] = np.mean(pooling_region)\n\n# Print the output matrix with elements rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(np.round(output_matrix, 2))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code output is an empty array because the vertical dimension of the input matrix is less than the kernel size, which means no pooling can be performed. Therefore, the output matrix is empty.\n\nGiven the constraints of the problem, the output matrix is indeed empty. \n\n<<<[]>>>"
