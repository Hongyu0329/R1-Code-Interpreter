    "\nassistant > Given that the kernel size is 1, the average pooling operation will not change the matrix because each element is considered individually. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nThe input matrix is:\n```\n9 2 4\n3 9 4\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, the output matrix after average pooling will be:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n9 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n3 & 9 & 4 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSo, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<9 2 4\n3 9 4>>>"
