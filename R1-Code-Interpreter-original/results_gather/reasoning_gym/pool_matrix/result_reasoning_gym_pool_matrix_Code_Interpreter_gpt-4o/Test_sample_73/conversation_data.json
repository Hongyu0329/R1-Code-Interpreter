    "\nassistant > When performing max pooling with a kernel size of 1, each element in the input matrix is considered individually, and the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix. This is because the maximum value in each 1x1 region is the element itself.\n\nGiven the input matrix:\n\n```\n0 5 6\n9 4 0\n0 4 0\n4 1 6\n9 9 3\n9 4 6\n6 9 4\n```\n\nThe output matrix after max pooling with a kernel size of 1 is:\n\n```\n0 5 6\n9 4 0\n0 4 0\n4 1 6\n9 9 3\n9 4 6\n6 9 4\n```\n\nSo, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n0 5 6\n9 4 0\n0 4 0\n4 1 6\n9 9 3\n9 4 6\n6 9 4\n>>>"
