    "\nassistant > When performing average pooling with a kernel size of 1, each element in the output matrix corresponds directly to the element in the input matrix. This is because the kernel size of 1 means that each element is considered individually, and the average of a single element is the element itself.\n\nTherefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix. Let's format the output matrix as requested:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n6 & 1 & 3 & 0 & 4 & 9 & 6 & 1 & 8 \\\\\n2 & 9 & 6 & 0 & 6 & 2 & 0 & 6 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n6 1 3 0 4 9 6 1 8\n2 9 6 0 6 2 0 6 3\n>>>"
