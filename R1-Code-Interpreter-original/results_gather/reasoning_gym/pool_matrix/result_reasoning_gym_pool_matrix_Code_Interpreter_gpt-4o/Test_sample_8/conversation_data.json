    "\nassistant > When the kernel size is 1, average pooling will not change the matrix because each element is its own region. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix. Let's format the output matrix accordingly:\n\n```\n<<<\n6.00 7.00 5.00 8.00 8.00 2.00 1.00 7.00 2.00 3.00\n7.00 3.00 9.00 0.00 1.00 5.00 9.00 8.00 4.00 4.00\n8.00 6.00 3.00 3.00 7.00 7.00 1.00 3.00 5.00 2.00\n2.00 3.00 7.00 9.00 3.00 2.00 2.00 5.00 0.00 1.00\n7.00 9.00 3.00 8.00 5.00 9.00 3.00 2.00 6.00 9.00\n9.00 3.00 5.00 4.00 5.00 5.00 8.00 0.00 1.00 1.00\n4.00 8.00 9.00 2.00 5.00 7.00 8.00 6.00 4.00 2.00\n9.00 7.00 3.00 9.00 0.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 0.00 3.00\n2.00 4.00 9.00 7.00 6.00 7.00 7.00 3.00 4.00 9.00\n>>>\n```"
