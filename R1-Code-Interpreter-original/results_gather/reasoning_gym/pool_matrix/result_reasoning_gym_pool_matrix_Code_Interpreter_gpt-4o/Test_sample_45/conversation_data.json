    "\nassistant > When performing average pooling with a kernel size of 1, each element in the output matrix corresponds directly to the element in the input matrix. This is because the kernel size of 1 means that each element is considered individually, and the average of a single element is the element itself.\n\nTherefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix. Let's format it accordingly:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n7 & 4 & 4 & 5 & 8 & 0 & 9 \\\\\n7 & 5 & 3 & 0 & 6 & 4 & 6 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 7 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 9 \\\\\n6 & 4 & 5 & 8 & 1 & 8 & 1 \\\\\n6 & 3 & 4 & 3 & 9 & 0 & 8 \\\\\n9 & 5 & 3 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSo, the output matrix is:\n\n\\[\n<<<\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n7 & 4 & 4 & 5 & 8 & 0 & 9 \\\\\n7 & 5 & 3 & 0 & 6 & 4 & 6 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 7 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 9 \\\\\n6 & 4 & 5 & 8 & 1 & 8 & 1 \\\\\n6 & 3 & 4 & 3 & 9 & 0 & 8 \\\\\n9 & 5 & 3 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n>>>\n\\]"
