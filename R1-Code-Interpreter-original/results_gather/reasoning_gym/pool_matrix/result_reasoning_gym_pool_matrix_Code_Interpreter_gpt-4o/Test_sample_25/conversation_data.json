    "\nassistant > To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we will divide the matrix into non-overlapping 3x3 regions and calculate the average of each region. The stride is equal to the kernel size, so there will be no overlap between the pooling regions.\n\nLet's first represent the given matrix:\n\n```\n6 5 6 8 2 8 8\n1 7 9 5 8 8 1\n```\n\nSince the matrix has 2 rows and 7 columns, and the kernel size is 3, we can only perform pooling on the first row, resulting in a single row in the output matrix.
