    "\nassistant > When performing max pooling with a kernel size of 1, each element in the output matrix corresponds directly to the element in the input matrix. This is because the kernel size of 1 means that each pooling region is just a single element, so the maximum value in each region is the element itself.\n\nTherefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix. Here is the output matrix:\n\n```\n<<<\n9 7 1 0 9 8 8\n8 9 7 7 8 0 9\n2 5 3 3 3 9 8\n7 5 8 6 0 1 9\n9 0 2 2 5 8 3\n0 4 1 3 6 4 2\n3 1 3 4 2 7 2\n4 7 4 7 9 4 7\n4 0 8 7 6 3 6\n0 5 5 4 2 0 4\n>>>\n```"
