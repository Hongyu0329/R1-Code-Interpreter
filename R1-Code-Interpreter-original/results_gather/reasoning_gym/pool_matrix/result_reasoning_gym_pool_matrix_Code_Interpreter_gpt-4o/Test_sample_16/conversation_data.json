    "\nassistant > When performing max pooling with a kernel size of 1, each element in the output matrix corresponds directly to the maximum value in its respective 1x1 region in the input matrix. Therefore, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\nGiven the input matrix:\n\n```\n0 3 1 4 0 0 6\n6 2 0 6 6 0 7\n8 2 2 5 2 5 9\n2 6 2 1 5 6 0\n5 2 6 6 5 6 2\n2 5 4 7 3 2 0\n3 3 6 0 2 1 6\n9 3 9 1 7 4 2\n1 6 3 5 0 7 4\n2 1 9 3 0 3 0\n```\n\nThe output matrix after max pooling with a kernel size of 1 is:\n\n```\n<<<\n0 3 1 4 0 0 6\n6 2 0 6 6 0 7\n8 2 2 5 2 5 9\n2 6 2 1 5 6 0\n5 2 6 6 5 6 2\n2 5 4 7 3 2 0\n3 3 6 0 2 1 6\n9 3 9 1 7 4 2\n1 6 3 5 0 7 4\n2 1 9 3 0 3 0\n>>>\n```"
