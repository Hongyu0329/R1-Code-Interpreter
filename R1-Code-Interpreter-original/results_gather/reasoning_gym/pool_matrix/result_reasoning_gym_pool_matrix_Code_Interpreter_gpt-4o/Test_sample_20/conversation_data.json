    "\nassistant > To perform max pooling with a kernel size of 3, we need to divide the input matrix into non-overlapping regions of size 3x3 and then take the maximum value from each region. However, the given matrix is not a perfect square, so we will consider the largest possible square sub-matrix that can be formed.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n\n```\n5 7\n6 7\n0 5\n3 3\n1 3\n1 5\n```\n\nThis matrix has 6 rows and 2 columns. With a kernel size of 3, we can only consider the first 3 rows and 2 columns for pooling, as the kernel size exceeds the number of columns. Therefore, we will perform max pooling on the following sub-matrix:\n\n```\n5 7\n6 7\n0 5\n```\n\nLet's perform max pooling on this sub-matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the sub-matrix for pooling\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [5, 7],\n    [6, 7],\n    [0, 5]\n])\n\n# Kernel size\nkernel_size = 3\n\n# Perform max pooling\n# Since the kernel size is larger than the number of columns, we can only pool over the rows\nmax_pooled_value = np.max(matrix)\n\n# Create the output matrix\noutput_matrix = np.array([[max_pooled_value]])\n\noutput_matrix\nassistant > The result of max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 is:\n\n\\[\n<<<7>>>\n\\]"
