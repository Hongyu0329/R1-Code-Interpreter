    "\nassistant > When performing average pooling with a kernel size of 1, each element in the output matrix is simply the average of the corresponding element in the input matrix. Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nLet's format the input matrix as the output matrix with each element rounded to 2 decimal places:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n5 & 6 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n8 & 7 & 2 & 8 & 7 & 3 \\\\\n3 & 3 & 9 & 4 & 3 & 5 \\\\\n9 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 6 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 7 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n3 & 7 & 3 & 6 & 5 & 7 \\\\\n3 & 8 & 5 & 7 & 3 & 5 \\\\\n9 & 3 & 7 & 6 & 8 & 4 \\\\\n1 & 6 & 2 & 5 & 7 & 9 \\\\\n5 & 4 & 7 & 2 & 2 & 5 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe output matrix is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n5.00 & 6.00 & 1.00 & 2.00 & 1.00 & 1.00 \\\\\n8.00 & 7.00 & 2.00 & 8.00 & 7.00 & 3.00 \\\\\n3.00 & 3.00 & 9.00 & 4.00 & 3.00 & 5.00 \\\\\n9.00 & 3.00 & 3.00 & 9.00 & 6.00 & 0.00 \\\\\n3.00 & 7.00 & 3.00 & 1.00 & 1.00 & 5.00 \\\\\n3.00 & 7.00 & 3.00 & 6.00 & 5.00 & 7.00 \\\\\n3.00 & 8.00 & 5.00 & 7.00 & 3.00 & 5.00 \\\\\n9.00 & 3.00 & 7.00 & 6.00 & 8.00 & 4.00 \\\\\n1.00 & 6.00 & 2.00 & 5.00 & 7.00 & 9.00 \\\\\n5.00 & 4.00 & 7.00 & 2.00 & 2.00 & 5.00 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSo, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n5.00 6.00 1.00 2.00 1.00 1.00\n8.00 7.00 2.00 8.00 7.00 3.00\n3.00 3.00 9.00 4.00 3.00 5.00\n9.00 3.00 3.00 9.00 6.00 0.00\n3.00 7.00 3.00 1.00 1.00 5.00\n3.00 7.00 3.00 6.00 5.00 7.00\n3.00 8.00 5.00 7.00 3.00 5.00\n9.00 3.00 7.00 6.00 8.00 4.00\n1.00 6.00 2.00 5.00 7.00 9.00\n5.00 4.00 7.00 2.00 2.00 5.00\n>>>"
