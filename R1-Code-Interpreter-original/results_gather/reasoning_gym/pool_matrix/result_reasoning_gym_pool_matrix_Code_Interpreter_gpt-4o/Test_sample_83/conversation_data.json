    "\nassistant > When performing average pooling with a kernel size of 1, each element in the output matrix is simply the average of the corresponding element in the input matrix. Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n\n```\n2 0 2 6 0\n5 1 9 1 3\n7 1 4 9 2\n6 1 4 7 5\n1 4 0 5 3\n2 0 1 3 4\n```\n\nThe output matrix after average pooling with a kernel size of 1 is:\n\n```\n2.00 0.00 2.00 6.00 0.00\n5.00 1.00 9.00 1.00 3.00\n7.00 1.00 4.00 9.00 2.00\n6.00 1.00 4.00 7.00 5.00\n1.00 4.00 0.00 5.00 3.00\n2.00 0.00 1.00 3.00 4.00\n```\n\nSo, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n2.00 0.00 2.00 6.00 0.00\n5.00 1.00 9.00 1.00 3.00\n7.00 1.00 4.00 9.00 2.00\n6.00 1.00 4.00 7.00 5.00\n1.00 4.00 0.00 5.00 3.00\n2.00 0.00 1.00 3.00 4.00\n>>>"
