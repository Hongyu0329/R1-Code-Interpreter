    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Kernel Size**: \n   - The input matrix is a 9x7 matrix.\n   - The kernel size is 1, which means each element in the matrix is considered individually for pooling.\n   - Since the stride is equal to the kernel size, the stride is also 1.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**:\n   - With a kernel size of 1 and stride of 1, the output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix, which is 9x7.\n\n3. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - For each element in the matrix, calculate the average of the elements covered by the kernel. Since the kernel size is 1, each element is its own average.\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix, but we need to ensure each element is formatted to two decimal places.\n\n4. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert each element to a floating-point number with two decimal places.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\nInput Matrix:\n5 4 8 1 5 0 4\n4 9 3 5 1 1 8\n7 0 8 9 7 5 9\n1 2 0 1 5 6 3\n2 1 7 1 1 4 5\n8 1 1 8 7 2 5\n8 2 3 6 4 7 9\n3 8 5 2 7 9 0\n7 2 3 5 3 0 8\n```\n\n- Convert each element to two decimal places:\n\n```\nOutput Matrix:\n5.00 4.00 8.00 1.00 5.00 0.00 4.00\n4.00 9.00 3.00 5.00 1.00 1.00 8.00\n7.00 0.00 8.00 9.00 7.00 5.00 9.00\n1.00 2.00 0.00 1.00 5.00 6.00 3.00\n2.00 1.00 7.00 1.00 1.00 4.00 5.00\n8.00 1.00 1.00 8.00 7.00 2.00 5.00\n8.00 2.00 3.00 6.00 4.00 7.00 9.00\n3.00 8.00 5.00 2.00 7.00 9.00 0.00\n7.00 2.00 3.00 5.00 3.00 0.00 8.00\n```\n\nThe final output matrix, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<\n5.00 4.00 8.00 1.00 5.00 0.00 4.00\n4.00 9.00 3.00 5.00 1.00 1.00 8.00\n7.00 0.00 8.00 9.00 7.00 5.00 9.00\n1.00 2.00 0.00 1.00 5.00 6.00 3.00\n2.00 1.00 7.00 1.00 1.00 4.00 5.00\n8.00 1.00 1.00 8.00 7.00 2.00 5.00\n8.00 2.00 3.00 6.00 4.00 7.00 9.00\n3.00 8.00 5.00 2.00 7.00 9.00 0.00\n7.00 2.00 3.00 5.00 3.00 0.00 8.00\n>>>"
