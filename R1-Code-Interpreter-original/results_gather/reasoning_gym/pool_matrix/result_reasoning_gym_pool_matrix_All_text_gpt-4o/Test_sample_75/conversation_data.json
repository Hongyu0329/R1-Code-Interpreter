    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 5x8 matrix:\n   ```\n   0 9 6 2 9 6 0 2\n   2 5 9 4 0 9 8 4\n   3 8 0 5 6 9 7 3\n   6 6 9 0 1 9 4 4\n   5 8 4 2 9 9 8 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2, meaning the pooling regions do not overlap.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 5 rows by 8 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the output matrix will have:\n     - \\( \\text{floor}(5/2) = 2 \\) rows\n     - \\( \\text{floor}(8/2) = 4 \\) columns\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 2x4.\n\n4. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - Divide the input matrix into 2x2 regions and find the maximum value in each region.\n   - The regions and their maximum values are as follows:\n\n     - Region 1 (top-left 2x2):\n       ```\n       0 9\n       2 5\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n\n     - Region 2 (next 2x2 to the right):\n       ```\n       6 2\n       9 4\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n\n     - Region 3:\n       ```\n       9 6\n       0 9\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n\n     - Region 4:\n       ```\n       0 2\n       8 4\n       ```\n       Max = 8\n\n     - Region 5 (next row, first 2x2):\n       ```\n       3 8\n       6 6\n       ```\n       Max = 8\n\n     - Region 6:\n       ```\n       0 5\n       9 0\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n\n     - Region 7:\n       ```\n       6 9\n       1 9\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n\n     - Region 8:\n       ```\n       7 3\n       4 4\n       ```\n       Max = 7\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix, based on the maximum values from each region, is:\n     ```\n     9 9 9 8\n     8 9 9 7\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets and ensure each element is correct to 2 decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n9.00 9.00 9.00 8.00\n8.00 9.00 9.00 7.00\n>>>\n```"
