    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   0 3 2 2 2 9 8\n   8 9 7 4 7 0 6\n   2 7 3 0 0 0 6\n   7 9 7 4 9 3 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 1, and the stride is also 1. This means each element in the input matrix will be considered individually, and there will be no overlap between pooling regions.\n\n3. **Average Pooling with Kernel Size 1**: Since the kernel size is 1, each element in the input matrix is its own pooling region. Therefore, the average of each region (which contains only one element) is the element itself.\n\n4. **Output Matrix**: The output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix because the kernel size is 1. Each element in the output matrix is the same as the corresponding element in the input matrix.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be formatted to two decimal places.\n\nNow, let's format the output matrix:\n\n```\n0.00 3.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 9.00 8.00\n8.00 9.00 7.00 4.00 7.00 0.00 6.00\n2.00 7.00 3.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 6.00\n7.00 9.00 7.00 4.00 9.00 3.00 2.00\n```\n\nEnclosing the output matrix within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<\n0.00 3.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 9.00 8.00\n8.00 9.00 7.00 4.00 7.00 0.00 6.00\n2.00 7.00 3.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 6.00\n7.00 9.00 7.00 4.00 9.00 3.00 2.00\n>>>"
