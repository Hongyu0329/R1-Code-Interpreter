    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 9x3 matrix:\n   ```\n   4 6 7\n   6 6 1\n   4 3 5\n   0 8 6\n   8 2 0\n   1 4 2\n   6 4 5\n   0 5 9\n   6 2 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3. This means we will take 3x3 submatrices from the input matrix without overlap.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix has 9 rows and 3 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(9/3) = 3`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor(3/3) = 1`.\n\n4. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - **First 3x3 Block**:\n     ```\n     4 6 7\n     6 6 1\n     4 3 5\n     ```\n     The maximum value in this block is 7.\n\n   - **Second 3x3 Block**:\n     ```\n     0 8 6\n     8 2 0\n     1 4 2\n     ```\n     The maximum value in this block is 8.\n\n   - **Third 3x3 Block**:\n     ```\n     6 4 5\n     0 5 9\n     6 2 6\n     ```\n     The maximum value in this block is 9.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix will be a 3x1 matrix with the maximum values from each block:\n   ```\n   7\n   8\n   9\n   ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n7\n8\n9\n>>>\n```"
