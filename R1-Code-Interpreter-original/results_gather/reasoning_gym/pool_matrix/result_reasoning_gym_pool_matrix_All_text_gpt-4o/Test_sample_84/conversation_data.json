    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Pooling Operation**: Average pooling with a kernel size of 1 means that each element in the input matrix is considered individually. Since the kernel size is 1, each element is its own region, and the average of a single element is the element itself.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is a 10x6 matrix. With a kernel size of 1 and stride of 1, the output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix because each element is processed individually.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average**: For each element in the matrix, the average is simply the element itself because the kernel size is 1.\n\n4. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be formatted in the same way as the input matrix, with each element rounded to two decimal places. However, since the elements are integers, they will remain the same when rounded to two decimal places.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix will be identical to the input matrix because each element is averaged individually.\n\nGiven these steps, the output matrix is:\n\n```\n5 6 1 2 1 1\n8 7 2 8 7 3\n3 3 9 4 3 5\n9 3 3 9 6 0\n3 7 3 1 1 5\n3 7 3 6 5 7\n3 8 5 7 3 5\n9 3 7 6 8 4\n1 6 2 5 7 9\n5 4 7 2 2 5\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n5 6 1 2 1 1\n8 7 2 8 7 3\n3 3 9 4 3 5\n9 3 3 9 6 0\n3 7 3 1 1 5\n3 7 3 6 5 7\n3 8 5 7 3 5\n9 3 7 6 8 4\n1 6 2 5 7 9\n5 4 7 2 2 5\n>>>"
