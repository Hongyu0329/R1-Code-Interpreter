    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Pooling Parameters:**\n   - The input matrix is:\n     ```\n     0 9 2 9 8 0\n     8 5 9 2 2 3\n     1 1 8 3 4 1\n     8 5 9 1 3 6\n     ```\n   - The kernel size is 1, which means each element in the matrix is considered individually.\n   - The stride is equal to the kernel size, which is 1, meaning we move one element at a time.\n\n2. **Max Pooling with Kernel Size 1:**\n   - Since the kernel size is 1, each element is its own pooling region.\n   - Therefore, the max pooling operation with a kernel size of 1 will result in the same matrix as the input matrix because each element is the maximum of its own 1x1 region.\n\n3. **Output the Result:**\n   - The output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n   - Ensure the output is formatted correctly with elements rounded to 2 decimal places, although in this case, they are all integers.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n```\n0 9 2 9 8 0\n8 5 9 2 2 3\n1 1 8 3 4 1\n8 5 9 1 3 6\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n0 9 2 9 8 0\n8 5 9 2 2 3\n1 1 8 3 4 1\n8 5 9 1 3 6\n>>>"
