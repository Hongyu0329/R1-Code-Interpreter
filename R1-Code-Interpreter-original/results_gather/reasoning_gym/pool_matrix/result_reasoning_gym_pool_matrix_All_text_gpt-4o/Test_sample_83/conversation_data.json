    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 6x5 matrix:\n   ```\n   2 0 2 6 0\n   5 1 9 1 3\n   7 1 4 9 2\n   6 1 4 7 5\n   1 4 0 5 3\n   2 0 1 3 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 1, and the stride is also 1. This means each element of the matrix is considered individually, and there is no overlap between pooling regions.\n\n3. **Average Pooling with Kernel Size 1**: Since the kernel size is 1, each element in the matrix is its own pooling region. Therefore, the average of each element is the element itself.\n\n4. **Output Matrix**: The output matrix will be the same size as the input matrix because each element is processed individually. Each element in the output matrix will be the same as the corresponding element in the input matrix.\n\n5. **Formatting the Output**: The output matrix should be formatted with each element rounded to 2 decimal places, even though they are integers in this case.\n\nFollowing these steps, the output matrix is:\n\n```\n2.00 0.00 2.00 6.00 0.00\n5.00 1.00 9.00 1.00 3.00\n7.00 1.00 4.00 9.00 2.00\n6.00 1.00 4.00 7.00 5.00\n1.00 4.00 0.00 5.00 3.00\n2.00 0.00 1.00 3.00 4.00\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n2.00 0.00 2.00 6.00 0.00\n5.00 1.00 9.00 1.00 3.00\n7.00 1.00 4.00 9.00 2.00\n6.00 1.00 4.00 7.00 5.00\n1.00 4.00 0.00 5.00 3.00\n2.00 0.00 1.00 3.00 4.00\n>>>"
