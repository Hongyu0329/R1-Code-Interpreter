    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 4x3 matrix:\n   ```\n   3 7 1\n   6 2 4\n   2 9 5\n   6 6 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3. This means that the pooling operation will be applied to non-overlapping 3x3 regions of the matrix.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: Since the kernel size is 3 and the input matrix is 4x3, the output matrix will be smaller. Specifically, the output matrix will be 1x1 because:\n   - The number of rows in the output matrix is calculated as: floor((4 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 1\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix is calculated as: floor((3 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 1\n\n4. **Apply Max Pooling**: We will apply the max pooling operation to the only possible 3x3 region in the input matrix:\n   ```\n   3 7 1\n   6 2 4\n   2 9 5\n   ```\n   - The maximum value in this 3x3 region is 9.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix will be a 1x1 matrix containing the maximum value found in the 3x3 region.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and the elements should be correct to 2 decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<9.00>>>\n```"
