    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 9x9 matrix. The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2, meaning the pooling regions do not overlap.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: Since the kernel size is 2 and the stride is 2, the output matrix will be smaller. The size of the output matrix can be calculated as follows:\n   - Output rows = (Input rows) / (Kernel size) = 9 / 2 = 4.5, rounded down to 4.\n   - Output columns = (Input columns) / (Kernel size) = 9 / 2 = 4.5, rounded down to 4.\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 4x4.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**: For each 2x2 block in the input matrix, find the maximum value and place it in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Max Pooling**:\n   - **Block 1**: Top-left 2x2 block: \n     ```\n     4 7\n     5 8\n     ```\n     Max value = 8\n\n   - **Block 2**: Next 2x2 block to the right:\n     ```\n     2 0\n     6 8\n     ```\n     Max value = 8\n\n   - **Block 3**: Next 2x2 block to the right:\n     ```\n     1 0\n     0 9\n     ```\n     Max value = 9\n\n   - **Block 4**: Next 2x2 block to the right:\n     ```\n     2 6\n     9 3\n     ```\n     Max value = 9\n\n   - **Block 5**: Second row, first 2x2 block:\n     ```\n     9 7\n     2 1\n     ```\n     Max value = 9\n\n   - **Block 6**: Next 2x2 block to the right:\n     ```\n     5 9\n     2 4\n     ```\n     Max value = 9\n\n   - **Block 7**: Next 2x2 block to the right:\n     ```\n     4 6\n     0 0\n     ```\n     Max value = 6\n\n   - **Block 8**: Next 2x2 block to the right:\n     ```\n     4 8\n     0 9\n     ```\n     Max value = 9\n\n   - **Block 9**: Third row, first 2x2 block:\n     ```\n     3 6\n     6 4\n     ```\n     Max value = 6\n\n   - **Block 10**: Next 2x2 block to the right:\n     ```\n     6 5\n     3 0\n     ```\n     Max value = 6\n\n   - **Block 11**: Next 2x2 block to the right:\n     ```\n     6 9\n     7 0\n     ```\n     Max value = 9\n\n   - **Block 12**: Next 2x2 block to the right:\n     ```\n     8 2\n     2 0\n     ```\n     Max value = 8\n\n   - **Block 13**: Fourth row, first 2x2 block:\n     ```\n     8 9\n     6 7\n     ```\n     Max value = 9\n\n   - **Block 14**: Next 2x2 block to the right:\n     ```\n     0 3\n     8 5\n     ```\n     Max value = 8\n\n   - **Block 15**: Next 2x2 block to the right:\n     ```\n     2 8\n     7 9\n     ```\n     Max value = 9\n\n   - **Block 16**: Next 2x2 block to the right:\n     ```\n     0 0\n     3 6\n     ```\n     Max value = 6\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: Place the max values in the corresponding positions to form the output matrix.\n\nThe final output matrix after max pooling is:\n\n```\n8 8 9 9\n9 9 6 9\n6 6 9 8\n9 8 9 6\n```\n\nTherefore, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n8 8 9 9\n9 9 6 9\n6 6 9 8\n9 8 9 6\n>>>"
