    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2 and a stride of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 10x6 matrix:\n   ```\n   0 0 1 4 6 5\n   6 6 5 2 7 4\n   3 6 4 1 5 9\n   0 6 3 2 9 3\n   3 3 2 0 3 2\n   0 3 0 0 7 3\n   8 7 4 4 0 0\n   3 3 1 9 4 5\n   7 0 3 5 6 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2x2, and the stride is 2. This means we will take 2x2 blocks from the matrix, compute their average, and move the kernel 2 steps to the right or down to process the next block.\n\n3. **Calculate the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The input matrix is 10 rows by 6 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the output matrix will have dimensions:\n     - Rows: \\( \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\)\n     - Columns: \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\)\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - For each 2x2 block, calculate the average of the four elements.\n   - Move the kernel across the matrix with a stride of 2.\n\n5. **Compute the Averages**:\n   - Block (0,0) to (1,1): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{0 + 0 + 6 + 6}{4} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3.00\n     \\]\n   - Block (0,2) to (1,3): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{1 + 4 + 5 + 2}{4} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3.00\n     \\]\n   - Block (0,4) to (1,5): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{6 + 5 + 7 + 4}{4} = \\frac{22}{4} = 5.50\n     \\]\n   - Block (2,0) to (3,1): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{3 + 6 + 0 + 6}{4} = \\frac{15}{4} = 3.75\n     \\]\n   - Block (2,2) to (3,3): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{4 + 1 + 3 + 2}{4} = \\frac{10}{4} = 2.50\n     \\]\n   - Block (2,4) to (3,5): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{5 + 9 + 9 + 3}{4} = \\frac{26}{4} = 6.50\n     \\]\n   - Block (4,0) to (5,1): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{3 + 3 + 0 + 3}{4} = \\frac{9}{4} = 2.25\n     \\]\n   - Block (4,2) to (5,3): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{2 + 0 + 0 + 0}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = 0.50\n     \\]\n   - Block (4,4) to (5,5): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{3 + 2 + 7 + 3}{4} = \\frac{15}{4} = 3.75\n     \\]\n   - Block (6,0) to (7,1): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{8 + 7 + 3 + 3}{4} = \\frac{21}{4} = 5.25\n     \\]\n   - Block (6,2) to (7,3): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{4 + 4 + 1 + 9}{4} = \\frac{18}{4} = 4.50\n     \\]\n   - Block (6,4) to (7,5): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{0 + 0 + 4 + 5}{4} = \\frac{9}{4} = 2.25\n     \\]\n   - Block (8,0) to (9,1): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{7 + 0 + 3 + 5}{4} = \\frac{15}{4} = 3.75\n     \\]\n   - Block (8,2) to (9,3): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{3 + 5 + 1 + 9}{4} = \\frac{18}{4} = 4.50\n     \\]\n   - Block (8,4) to (9,5): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{6 + 1 + 4 + 5}{4} = \\frac{16}{4} = 4.00\n     \\]\n\n6. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix is:\n     ```\n     3.00 3.00 5.50\n     3.75 2.50 6.50\n     2.25 0.50 3.75\n     5.25 4.50 2.25\n     3.75 4.50 4.00\n     ```\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n3.00 3.00 5.50\n3.75 2.50 6.50\n2.25 0.50 3.75\n5.25 4.50 2.25\n3.75 4.50 4.00\n>>>"
