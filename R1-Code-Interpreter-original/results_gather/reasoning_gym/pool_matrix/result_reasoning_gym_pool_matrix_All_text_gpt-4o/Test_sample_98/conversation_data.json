    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is an 8x8 matrix. We will apply max pooling with a kernel size of 2x2.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: Since the stride is equal to the kernel size (2), the output matrix will be smaller. The size of the output matrix can be calculated as follows:\n   - Output rows = Input rows / Kernel size = 8 / 2 = 4\n   - Output columns = Input columns / Kernel size = 8 / 2 = 4\n   Therefore, the output matrix will be 4x4.\n\n3. **Apply Max Pooling**: For each 2x2 block in the input matrix, find the maximum value and place it in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\n4. **Process Each 2x2 Block**:\n   - Block 1 (Top-left 2x2): \n     ```\n     9 5\n     0 5\n     ```\n     Max = 9\n\n   - Block 2:\n     ```\n     3 1\n     7 1\n     ```\n     Max = 7\n\n   - Block 3:\n     ```\n     0 6\n     8 7\n     ```\n     Max = 8\n\n   - Block 4:\n     ```\n     6 1\n     9 7\n     ```\n     Max = 9\n\n   - Block 5:\n     ```\n     2 1\n     7 3\n     ```\n     Max = 7\n\n   - Block 6:\n     ```\n     4 8\n     1 2\n     ```\n     Max = 8\n\n   - Block 7:\n     ```\n     2 2\n     6 8\n     ```\n     Max = 8\n\n   - Block 8:\n     ```\n     1 2\n     4 3\n     ```\n     Max = 4\n\n   - Block 9:\n     ```\n     8 5\n     7 7\n     ```\n     Max = 8\n\n   - Block 10:\n     ```\n     2 9\n     2 0\n     ```\n     Max = 9\n\n   - Block 11:\n     ```\n     3 5\n     8 1\n     ```\n     Max = 8\n\n   - Block 12:\n     ```\n     8 2\n     0 8\n     ```\n     Max = 8\n\n   - Block 13:\n     ```\n     3 0\n     4 6\n     ```\n     Max = 6\n\n   - Block 14:\n     ```\n     4 9\n     5 7\n     ```\n     Max = 9\n\n   - Block 15:\n     ```\n     2 8\n     9 9\n     ```\n     Max = 9\n\n   - Block 16:\n     ```\n     9 1\n     7 2\n     ```\n     Max = 9\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: Place the maximum values from each block into the output matrix.\n\nThe final output matrix after max pooling is:\n```\n9 7 8 9\n7 8 8 4\n8 9 8 8\n6 9 9 9\n```\n\nTherefore, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n9 7 8 9\n7 8 8 4\n8 9 8 8\n6 9 9 9\n>>>"
