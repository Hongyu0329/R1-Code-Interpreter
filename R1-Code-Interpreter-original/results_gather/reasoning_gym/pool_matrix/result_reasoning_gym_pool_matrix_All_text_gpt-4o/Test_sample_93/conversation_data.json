    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride equal to the kernel size, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   2 7 3 6 0\n   5 6 2 5 0\n   4 2 9 0 7\n   2 7 9 5 3\n   5 7 9 9 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size:**\n   - The input matrix is 5x5.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, the output matrix will be smaller.\n   - The number of pooling regions along each dimension is calculated as:\n     - Rows: floor((5 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n     - Columns: floor((5 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 2x2.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling:**\n   - Divide the input matrix into non-overlapping 3x3 regions.\n   - For each region, find the maximum value.\n\n   **Region 1 (Top-left 3x3):**\n   ```\n   2 7 3\n   5 6 2\n   4 2 9\n   ```\n   - Maximum value: 9\n\n   **Region 2 (Top-right 3x3):**\n   ```\n   6 0\n   5 0\n   0 7\n   ```\n   - Maximum value: 6\n\n   **Region 3 (Bottom-left 3x3):**\n   ```\n   2 7 9\n   5 7 9\n   ```\n   - Maximum value: 9\n\n   **Region 4 (Bottom-right 3x3):**\n   ```\n   5 3\n   9 1\n   ```\n   - Maximum value: 9\n\n4. **Construct the Output Matrix:**\n   - The output matrix is constructed from the maximum values of each region:\n   ```\n   9 6\n   9 9\n   ```\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be correct to 2 decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n<<<\n9.00 6.00\n9.00 9.00\n>>>"
