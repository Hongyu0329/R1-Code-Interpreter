    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2 and a stride of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 4x9 matrix:\n   ```\n   7 3 4 8 2 8 1 7 1\n   7 2 9 4 2 6 4 3 6\n   0 6 3 3 0 6 2 9 4\n   2 0 4 5 0 4 6 6 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2x2, and the stride is 2. This means we will take 2x2 submatrices and move 2 steps horizontally and vertically to cover the entire matrix.\n\n3. **Calculate the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The input matrix is 4 rows by 9 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(4/2) = 2`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor(9/2) = 4`.\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - For each 2x2 submatrix, calculate the average of the elements.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - **First Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Submatrix 1: \n       ```\n       7 3\n       7 2\n       ```\n       Average = (7 + 3 + 7 + 2) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75\n     - Submatrix 2:\n       ```\n       4 8\n       9 4\n       ```\n       Average = (4 + 8 + 9 + 4) / 4 = 25 / 4 = 6.25\n     - Submatrix 3:\n       ```\n       2 8\n       2 6\n       ```\n       Average = (2 + 8 + 2 + 6) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.50\n     - Submatrix 4:\n       ```\n       1 7\n       4 3\n       ```\n       Average = (1 + 7 + 4 + 3) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75\n\n   - **Second Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Submatrix 1:\n       ```\n       0 6\n       2 0\n       ```\n       Average = (0 + 6 + 2 + 0) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2.00\n     - Submatrix 2:\n       ```\n       3 3\n       4 5\n       ```\n       Average = (3 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75\n     - Submatrix 3:\n       ```\n       0 6\n       0 4\n       ```\n       Average = (0 + 6 + 0 + 4) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.50\n     - Submatrix 4:\n       ```\n       2 9\n       6 6\n       ```\n       Average = (2 + 9 + 6 + 6) / 4 = 23 / 4 = 5.75\n\n6. **Output Matrix**: The resulting matrix after average pooling is:\n   ```\n   4.75 6.25 4.50 3.75\n   2.00 3.75 2.50 5.75\n   ```\n\nThe final output matrix, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<\n4.75 6.25 4.50 3.75\n2.00 3.75 2.50 5.75\n>>>"
