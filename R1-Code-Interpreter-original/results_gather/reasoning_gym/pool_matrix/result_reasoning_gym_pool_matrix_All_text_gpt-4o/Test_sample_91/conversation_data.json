    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   2 2 6 1 3 9\n   6 1 0 1 9 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 1, and the stride is also 1. This means that each element in the input matrix will be considered individually, and there will be no reduction in the size of the matrix.\n\n3. **Max Pooling Operation**: Since the kernel size is 1, each element is its own pool, and the maximum value in each pool is the element itself. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\n4. **Output Matrix**: The output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix, and each element will be the same as the corresponding element in the input matrix.\n\n5. **Formatting the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be formatted to two decimal places.\n\nFollowing these steps, the output matrix is:\n\n```\n2.00 2.00 6.00 1.00 3.00 9.00\n6.00 1.00 0.00 1.00 9.00 0.00\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the final output is:\n\n<<<\n2.00 2.00 6.00 1.00 3.00 9.00\n6.00 1.00 0.00 1.00 9.00 0.00\n>>>"
