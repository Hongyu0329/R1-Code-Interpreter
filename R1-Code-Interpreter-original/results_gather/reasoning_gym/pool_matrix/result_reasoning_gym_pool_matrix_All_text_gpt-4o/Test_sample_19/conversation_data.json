    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride equal to the kernel size, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 5x10 matrix:\n   ```\n   9 5 0 9 5 0 5 4 9 5\n   5 4 4 3 6 4 6 9 1 4\n   7 0 8 8 6 4 5 9 2 3\n   7 7 3 8 2 5 7 1 3 5\n   8 9 6 5 7 5 1 4 1 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: With a kernel size of 3 and no overlap, the output matrix will have dimensions calculated as follows:\n   - Rows: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{5}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\)\n   - Columns: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\)\n   So, the output matrix will be 1x3.\n\n3. **Perform Average Pooling**: We will calculate the average of each 3x3 block in the input matrix.\n\n   - **First Block (Top-left 3x3)**:\n     ```\n     9 5 0\n     5 4 4\n     7 0 8\n     ```\n     Average = \\( \\frac{9 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 8}{9} = \\frac{42}{9} = 4.67 \\)\n\n   - **Second Block (Middle 3x3)**:\n     ```\n     9 5 0\n     3 6 4\n     8 6 4\n     ```\n     Average = \\( \\frac{9 + 5 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 4 + 8 + 6 + 4}{9} = \\frac{45}{9} = 5.00 \\)\n\n   - **Third Block (Top-right 3x3)**:\n     ```\n     5 4 9\n     6 9 1\n     5 9 2\n     ```\n     Average = \\( \\frac{5 + 4 + 9 + 6 + 9 + 1 + 5 + 9 + 2}{9} = \\frac{50}{9} = 5.56 \\)\n\n4. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix is:\n   ```\n   4.67 5.00 5.56\n   ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**: Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n<<<4.67 5.00 5.56>>>"
