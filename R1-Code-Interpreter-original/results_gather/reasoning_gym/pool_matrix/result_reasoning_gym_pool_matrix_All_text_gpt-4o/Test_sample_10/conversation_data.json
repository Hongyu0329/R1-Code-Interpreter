    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   6 3\n   7 4\n   6 9\n   ```\n   This is a 3x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3. This means that the pooling operation will cover a 3x2 region of the matrix at a time, and there will be no overlap between regions.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - Since the kernel size is 3 and the input matrix has 3 rows, the pooling operation will cover the entire height of the matrix in one step.\n   - The width of the matrix is 2, which matches the width of the kernel. Therefore, the pooling operation will also cover the entire width of the matrix in one step.\n   - As a result, the output matrix will be 1x1 because the entire input matrix is covered in a single pooling operation.\n\n4. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - The max pooling operation involves taking the maximum value from the region covered by the kernel.\n   - The region covered by the kernel is the entire input matrix:\n     ```\n     6 3\n     7 4\n     6 9\n     ```\n   - The maximum value in this region is 9.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The output matrix is a 1x1 matrix containing the maximum value found, formatted to two decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<9.00>>>\n```"
