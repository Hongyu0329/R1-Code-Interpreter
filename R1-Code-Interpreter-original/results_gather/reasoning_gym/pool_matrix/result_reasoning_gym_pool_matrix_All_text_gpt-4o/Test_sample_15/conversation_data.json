    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   7 6 7\n   8 8 3\n   0 7 0\n   7 7 1\n   7 2 2\n   1 7 4\n   8 9 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 submatrices from the input matrix, and there will be no overlap between these submatrices.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix has 7 rows and 3 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor((7 - 2) / 2) + 1 = 3`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor((3 - 2) / 2) + 1 = 1`.\n\n4. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - Extract 2x2 submatrices and find the maximum value in each:\n     - Submatrix 1 (from rows 1-2, columns 1-2):\n       ```\n       7 6\n       8 8\n       ```\n       Max value = 8\n     - Submatrix 2 (from rows 3-4, columns 1-2):\n       ```\n       0 7\n       7 7\n       ```\n       Max value = 7\n     - Submatrix 3 (from rows 5-6, columns 1-2):\n       ```\n       7 2\n       1 7\n       ```\n       Max value = 7\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix will be:\n   ```\n   8\n   7\n   7\n   ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be correct to 2 decimal places. Since all elements are integers, they will be represented as floating-point numbers with two decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n8.00\n7.00\n7.00\n>>>\n```"
