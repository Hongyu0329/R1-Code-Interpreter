    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 2x9 matrix:\n   ```\n   6 1 3 0 4 9 6 1 8\n   2 9 6 0 6 2 0 6 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 1, and the stride is also 1. This means each element of the matrix is considered individually, and there is no reduction in the size of the matrix.\n\n3. **Average Pooling with Kernel Size 1**: Since the kernel size is 1, each element is its own region. Therefore, the average of each region (which is just one element) is the element itself.\n\n4. **Output Matrix**: The output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix because the kernel size is 1 and the stride is 1. Each element in the output matrix is the same as the corresponding element in the input matrix.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be formatted to two decimal places.\n\nGiven these steps, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix, formatted to two decimal places:\n\n```\n6.00 1.00 3.00 0.00 4.00 9.00 6.00 1.00 8.00\n2.00 9.00 6.00 0.00 6.00 2.00 0.00 6.00 3.00\n```\n\nThus, the final output is:\n\n<<<\n6.00 1.00 3.00 0.00 4.00 9.00 6.00 1.00 8.00\n2.00 9.00 6.00 0.00 6.00 2.00 0.00 6.00 3.00\n>>>"
