    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   6 9 7\n   4 1 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 1, and the stride is also 1. This means each element of the matrix will be considered individually, and there will be no overlap between pooling regions.\n\n3. **Average Pooling with Kernel Size 1**: Since the kernel size is 1, each element in the matrix is its own region. Therefore, the average of each region is simply the element itself.\n\n4. **Output Matrix**: The output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix because the kernel size is 1. Each element in the output matrix will be the same as the corresponding element in the input matrix.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be formatted with each element rounded to 2 decimal places, even though they are integers in this case.\n\nFollowing these steps, the output matrix is:\n```\n6.00 9.00 7.00\n4.00 1.00 6.00\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n6.00 9.00 7.00\n4.00 1.00 6.00\n>>>"
