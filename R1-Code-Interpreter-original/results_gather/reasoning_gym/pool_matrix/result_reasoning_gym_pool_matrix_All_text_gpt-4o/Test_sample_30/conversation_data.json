    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   2 8 1\n   9 3 5\n   1 4 5\n   1 9 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 1, and the stride is also 1. This means that each element of the matrix is considered individually, and there is no overlap between pooling regions.\n\n3. **Max Pooling with Kernel Size 1**: Since the kernel size is 1, each element is its own pooling region. Therefore, the max pooling operation will simply return the same matrix because each element is the maximum of its own 1x1 region.\n\n4. **Output Matrix**: The output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because the kernel size is 1, and each element is the maximum of its own region.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be formatted to 2 decimal places. However, since the elements are integers, they will be represented as floating-point numbers with two decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n2.00 8.00 1.00\n9.00 3.00 5.00\n1.00 4.00 5.00\n1.00 9.00 8.00\n>>>\n```"
