    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Pooling Operation**: Average pooling with a kernel size of 1 means that each element in the output matrix corresponds directly to the same element in the input matrix. This is because the kernel size of 1 implies that each pooling region is just a single element, and the average of a single element is the element itself.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is 8 rows by 7 columns. Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix, which is 8x7.\n\n3. **Calculate the Output Matrix**: Since the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix is the same as the corresponding element in the input matrix. Therefore, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\n4. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be formatted to two decimal places.\n\nGiven these steps, the output matrix is:\n\n```\n0.00 3.00 2.00 0.00 1.00 3.00 9.00\n7.00 5.00 8.00 3.00 3.00 2.00 6.00\n0.00 4.00 6.00 9.00 3.00 8.00 4.00\n7.00 6.00 1.00 5.00 2.00 1.00 5.00\n3.00 2.00 4.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00\n5.00 4.00 5.00 7.00 6.00 2.00 4.00\n5.00 8.00 4.00 6.00 1.00 4.00 9.00\n9.00 5.00 2.00 4.00 4.00 4.00 3.00\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n0.00 3.00 2.00 0.00 1.00 3.00 9.00\n7.00 5.00 8.00 3.00 3.00 2.00 6.00\n0.00 4.00 6.00 9.00 3.00 8.00 4.00\n7.00 6.00 1.00 5.00 2.00 1.00 5.00\n3.00 2.00 4.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00\n5.00 4.00 5.00 7.00 6.00 2.00 4.00\n5.00 8.00 4.00 6.00 1.00 4.00 9.00\n9.00 5.00 2.00 4.00 4.00 4.00 3.00\n>>>"
