    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 6x2 matrix:\n   ```\n   1 9\n   8 5\n   0 1\n   4 1\n   9 5\n   9 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 blocks from the matrix and move the kernel by 2 rows each time, without overlap.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: Since the input matrix has 6 rows and the kernel size is 2, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `6 / 2 = 3`. The number of columns remains the same as the input matrix, which is 2.\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - **First Block (Rows 1-2)**:\n     - Elements: (1, 9) and (8, 5)\n     - Average for first column: (1 + 8) / 2 = 4.5\n     - Average for second column: (9 + 5) / 2 = 7.0\n     - Resulting row: (4.5, 7.0)\n\n   - **Second Block (Rows 3-4)**:\n     - Elements: (0, 1) and (4, 1)\n     - Average for first column: (0 + 4) / 2 = 2.0\n     - Average for second column: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1.0\n     - Resulting row: (2.0, 1.0)\n\n   - **Third Block (Rows 5-6)**:\n     - Elements: (9, 5) and (9, 8)\n     - Average for first column: (9 + 9) / 2 = 9.0\n     - Average for second column: (5 + 8) / 2 = 6.5\n     - Resulting row: (9.0, 6.5)\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: Combine the resulting rows to form the output matrix.\n\nThe final output matrix after performing average pooling is:\n```\n4.5 7.0\n2.0 1.0\n9.0 6.5\n```\n\nEnclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets as required:\n\n<<<\n4.5 7.0\n2.0 1.0\n9.0 6.5\n>>>"
