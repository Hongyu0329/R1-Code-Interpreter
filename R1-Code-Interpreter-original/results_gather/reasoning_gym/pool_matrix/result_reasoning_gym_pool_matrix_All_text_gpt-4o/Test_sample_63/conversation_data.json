    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride equal to the kernel size, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is 10x10.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - Since the kernel size is 3 and the stride is also 3, the output matrix dimensions can be calculated as follows:\n   - Output rows = (Input rows - Kernel size) / Stride + 1 = (10 - 3) / 3 + 1 = 3\n   - Output columns = (Input columns - Kernel size) / Stride + 1 = (10 - 3) / 3 + 1 = 3\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 3x3.\n\n3. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - We will slide the 3x3 kernel over the input matrix with a stride of 3, calculate the average of the elements within the kernel, and place the result in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\n4. **Calculate Each Element of the Output Matrix**:\n   - **First Row**:\n     - First element: Average of the sub-matrix from (0,0) to (2,2):\n       \\[\n       \\frac{6 + 9 + 3 + 0 + 4 + 7 + 4 + 3 + 4}{9} = \\frac{40}{9} \\approx 4.44\n       \\]\n     - Second element: Average of the sub-matrix from (0,3) to (2,5):\n       \\[\n       \\frac{6 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 8 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 4}{9} = \\frac{35}{9} \\approx 3.89\n       \\]\n     - Third element: Average of the sub-matrix from (0,6) to (2,8):\n       \\[\n       \\frac{4 + 7 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 7 + 1 + 8 + 4}{9} = \\frac{40}{9} \\approx 4.44\n       \\]\n   - **Second Row**:\n     - First element: Average of the sub-matrix from (3,0) to (5,2):\n       \\[\n       \\frac{2 + 6 + 1 + 7 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 3 + 1}{9} = \\frac{34}{9} \\approx 3.78\n       \\]\n     - Second element: Average of the sub-matrix from (3,3) to (5,5):\n       \\[\n       \\frac{5 + 3 + 6 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 7 + 9 + 4}{9} = \\frac{41}{9} \\approx 4.56\n       \\]\n     - Third element: Average of the sub-matrix from (3,6) to (5,8):\n       \\[\n       \\frac{3 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 8 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 4}{9} = \\frac{36}{9} = 4.00\n       \\]\n   - **Third Row**:\n     - First element: Average of the sub-matrix from (6,0) to (8,2):\n       \\[\n       \\frac{4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 0 + 3}{9} = \\frac{18}{9} = 2.00\n       \\]\n     - Second element: Average of the sub-matrix from (6,3) to (8,5):\n       \\[\n       \\frac{6 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 3}{9} = \\frac{27}{9} = 3.00\n       \\]\n     - Third element: Average of the sub-matrix from (6,6) to (8,8):\n       \\[\n       \\frac{7 + 4 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 4}{9} = \\frac{49}{9} \\approx 5.44\n       \\]\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - The resulting matrix after average pooling is:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   4.44 & 3.89 & 4.44 \\\\\n   3.78 & 4.56 & 4.00 \\\\\n   2.00 & 3.00 & 5.44 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n4.44 3.89 4.44\n3.78 4.56 4.00\n2.00 3.00 5.44\n>>>"
