    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Pooling Parameters:**\n   - The input matrix is an 8x8 matrix.\n   - The kernel size is 1, which means each element of the matrix is considered individually.\n   - The stride is equal to the kernel size, which is 1, meaning there is no overlap between pooling regions.\n\n2. **Average Pooling with Kernel Size 1:**\n   - Since the kernel size is 1, each element in the matrix is its own pooling region.\n   - The average of a single element is the element itself.\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\n3. **Format the Output:**\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n   - Each element should be formatted to two decimal places.\n\n4. **Construct the Output Matrix:**\n   - Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n   - Format each element to two decimal places.\n\nNow, let's format the output matrix:\n\n```\n1.00 3.00 9.00 8.00 9.00 8.00 2.00 4.00\n5.00 4.00 1.00 7.00 3.00 7.00 1.00 1.00\n0.00 6.00 4.00 7.00 2.00 0.00 8.00 8.00\n4.00 9.00 7.00 5.00 4.00 9.00 1.00 9.00\n0.00 5.00 9.00 3.00 3.00 6.00 2.00 5.00\n0.00 5.00 1.00 2.00 1.00 9.00 1.00 3.00\n8.00 8.00 9.00 2.00 9.00 8.00 0.00 7.00\n3.00 2.00 0.00 6.00 0.00 2.00 3.00 2.00\n```\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n1.00 3.00 9.00 8.00 9.00 8.00 2.00 4.00\n5.00 4.00 1.00 7.00 3.00 7.00 1.00 1.00\n0.00 6.00 4.00 7.00 2.00 0.00 8.00 8.00\n4.00 9.00 7.00 5.00 4.00 9.00 1.00 9.00\n0.00 5.00 9.00 3.00 3.00 6.00 2.00 5.00\n0.00 5.00 1.00 2.00 1.00 9.00 1.00 3.00\n8.00 8.00 9.00 2.00 9.00 8.00 0.00 7.00\n3.00 2.00 0.00 6.00 0.00 2.00 3.00 2.00\n>>>"
