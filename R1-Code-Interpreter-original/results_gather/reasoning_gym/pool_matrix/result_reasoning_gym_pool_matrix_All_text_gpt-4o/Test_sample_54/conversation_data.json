    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2 and a stride of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 2x10 matrix:\n   ```\n   4 0 3 8 9 9 9 1 7 8\n   9 4 4 1 0 7 0 5 8 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 submatrices from the input matrix and move the kernel by 2 elements at a time both horizontally and vertically.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix has 2 rows and 10 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(2/2) = 1`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor(10/2) = 5`.\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - Extract each 2x2 submatrix, calculate the average of its elements, and place the result in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n   - Calculate averages for each 2x2 submatrix:\n     - Submatrix 1 (top-left): \n       ```\n       4 0\n       9 4\n       ```\n       Average = (4 + 0 + 9 + 4) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25\n     - Submatrix 2:\n       ```\n       3 8\n       4 1\n       ```\n       Average = (3 + 8 + 4 + 1) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4.00\n     - Submatrix 3:\n       ```\n       9 9\n       0 7\n       ```\n       Average = (9 + 9 + 0 + 7) / 4 = 25 / 4 = 6.25\n     - Submatrix 4:\n       ```\n       9 1\n       0 5\n       ```\n       Average = (9 + 1 + 0 + 5) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75\n     - Submatrix 5 (top-right):\n       ```\n       7 8\n       8 0\n       ```\n       Average = (7 + 8 + 8 + 0) / 4 = 23 / 4 = 5.75\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix is a 1x5 matrix:\n   ```\n   4.25 4.00 6.25 3.75 5.75\n   ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<4.25 4.00 6.25 3.75 5.75>>>\n```"
