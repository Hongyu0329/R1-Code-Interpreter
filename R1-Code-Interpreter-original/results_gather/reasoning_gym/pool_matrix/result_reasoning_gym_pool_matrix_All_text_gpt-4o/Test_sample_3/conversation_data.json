    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Pooling Parameters:**\n   - The input matrix is a 10x7 matrix.\n   - The kernel size is 1, which means each element in the matrix is considered individually.\n   - The stride is equal to the kernel size, which is 1, meaning there is no overlap between the pooling regions.\n\n2. **Max Pooling with Kernel Size 1:**\n   - Since the kernel size is 1, each element in the matrix is its own pooling region.\n   - Therefore, the max pooling operation with a kernel size of 1 will result in the same matrix as the input matrix because each element is the maximum of its own 1x1 region.\n\n3. **Output the Result:**\n   - The output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n   - Ensure that the output is formatted correctly, with each element rounded to two decimal places, even though they are integers.\n\n4. **Format the Output:**\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nGiven these steps, the output matrix after performing max pooling with a kernel size of 1 is:\n\n```\n9 7 1 0 9 8 8\n8 9 7 7 8 0 9\n2 5 3 3 3 9 8\n7 5 8 6 0 1 9\n9 0 2 2 5 8 3\n0 4 1 3 6 4 2\n3 1 3 4 2 7 2\n4 7 4 7 9 4 7\n4 0 8 7 6 3 6\n0 5 5 4 2 0 4\n```\n\nFormatted with each element to two decimal places, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n9.00 7.00 1.00 0.00 9.00 8.00 8.00\n8.00 9.00 7.00 7.00 8.00 0.00 9.00\n2.00 5.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 9.00 8.00\n7.00 5.00 8.00 6.00 0.00 1.00 9.00\n9.00 0.00 2.00 2.00 5.00 8.00 3.00\n0.00 4.00 1.00 3.00 6.00 4.00 2.00\n3.00 1.00 3.00 4.00 2.00 7.00 2.00\n4.00 7.00 4.00 7.00 9.00 4.00 7.00\n4.00 0.00 8.00 7.00 6.00 3.00 6.00\n0.00 5.00 5.00 4.00 2.00 0.00 4.00\n>>>"
