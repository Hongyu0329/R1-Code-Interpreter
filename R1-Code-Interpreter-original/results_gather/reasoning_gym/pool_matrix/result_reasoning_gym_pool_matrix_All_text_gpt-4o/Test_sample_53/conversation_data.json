    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   0 4 3\n   4 3 5\n   1 8 3\n   7 6 6\n   0 7 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine the Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and since the stride is equal to the kernel size, the stride is also 2. This means we will move the 2x2 kernel two steps at a time both horizontally and vertically.\n\n3. **Calculate the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The input matrix has dimensions 5x3 (5 rows and 3 columns).\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the output matrix will have dimensions:\n     - Rows: floor((5 - 2) / 2) + 1 = 2\n     - Columns: floor((3 - 2) / 2) + 1 = 1\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - **First 2x2 Block** (top-left corner):\n     ```\n     0 4\n     4 3\n     ```\n     Average = (0 + 4 + 4 + 3) / 4 = 11 / 4 = 2.75\n\n   - **Second 2x2 Block** (second row, first column):\n     ```\n     1 8\n     7 6\n     ```\n     Average = (1 + 8 + 7 + 6) / 4 = 22 / 4 = 5.50\n\n   - **Third 2x2 Block** (fourth row, first column):\n     ```\n     0 7\n     7 6\n     ```\n     Average = (0 + 7 + 7 + 6) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5.00\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix, based on the calculated averages, is:\n   ```\n   2.75\n   5.50\n   5.00\n   ```\n\n6. **Format the Output Matrix**: Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n2.75\n5.50\n5.00\n>>>\n```"
