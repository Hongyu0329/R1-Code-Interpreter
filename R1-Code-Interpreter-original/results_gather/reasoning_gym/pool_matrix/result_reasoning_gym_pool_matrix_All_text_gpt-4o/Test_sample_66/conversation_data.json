    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a single column matrix with the following elements:\n   ```\n   4\n   9\n   1\n   4\n   7\n   6\n   9\n   2\n   7\n   2\n   9\n   9\n   5\n   2\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will consider non-overlapping pairs of elements from the matrix.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**: For each pair of elements, we will take the maximum value. Let's go through the matrix step by step:\n   - Pair 1: (4, 9) → Max is 9\n   - Pair 2: (1, 4) → Max is 4\n   - Pair 3: (7, 6) → Max is 7\n   - Pair 4: (9, 2) → Max is 9\n   - Pair 5: (7, 2) → Max is 7\n   - Pair 6: (9, 9) → Max is 9\n   - Pair 7: (5, 2) → Max is 5\n\n4. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix will be a single column matrix with the maximum values from each pair:\n   ```\n   9\n   4\n   7\n   9\n   7\n   9\n   5\n   ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be correct to 2 decimal places. Since all elements are integers, we can represent them with two decimal places as follows:\n   ```\n   <<<9.00\n   4.00\n   7.00\n   9.00\n   7.00\n   9.00\n   5.00>>>\n   ```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<9.00\n4.00\n7.00\n9.00\n7.00\n9.00\n5.00>>>"
