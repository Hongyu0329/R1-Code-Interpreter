    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 5x3 matrix:\n   ```\n   1 7 5\n   9 0 3\n   0 3 7\n   9 0 9\n   4 5 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3. This means that the pooling operation will be applied to non-overlapping 3x3 regions of the matrix.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 5 rows by 3 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(5/3) = 1`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor(3/3) = 1`.\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 1x1.\n\n4. **Apply Max Pooling**:\n   - Since the output matrix is 1x1, we only need to consider the first 3x3 block of the input matrix:\n     ```\n     1 7 5\n     9 0 3\n     0 3 7\n     ```\n   - Find the maximum value in this 3x3 block. The values are: 1, 7, 5, 9, 0, 3, 0, 3, 7.\n   - The maximum value is 9.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix will be a 1x1 matrix containing the maximum value found in the 3x3 block.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and the elements should be correct to 2 decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<9.00>>>\n```"
