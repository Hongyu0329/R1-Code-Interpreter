    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   3 5 5\n   7 9 9\n   3 6 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Define the Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and since the stride is equal to the kernel size, the stride is also 2. This means that the pooling regions will not overlap.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 3x3.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the output matrix will be smaller.\n   - The number of rows in the output matrix is calculated as: \n     \\[\n     \\text{output\\_rows} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{input\\_rows} - \\text{kernel\\_size}}{\\text{stride}} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{3 - 2}{2} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n     \\]\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix is calculated similarly:\n     \\[\n     \\text{output\\_cols} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{input\\_cols} - \\text{kernel\\_size}}{\\text{stride}} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{3 - 2}{2} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 2x2.\n\n4. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - **First Pooling Region**: Top-left corner of the input matrix:\n     ```\n     3 5\n     7 9\n     ```\n     The maximum value in this region is 9.\n   - **Second Pooling Region**: Top-right corner of the input matrix:\n     ```\n     5 5\n     9 9\n     ```\n     The maximum value in this region is 9.\n   - **Third Pooling Region**: Bottom-left corner of the input matrix:\n     ```\n     7 9\n     3 6\n     ```\n     The maximum value in this region is 9.\n   - **Fourth Pooling Region**: Bottom-right corner of the input matrix:\n     ```\n     9 9\n     6 9\n     ```\n     The maximum value in this region is 9.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: Based on the maximum values from each pooling region, the output matrix is:\n   ```\n   9 9\n   9 9\n   ```\n\n6. **Format the Output Matrix**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be formatted to two decimal places:\n   ```\n   <<<9.00 9.00\n   9.00 9.00>>>\n   ```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<9.00 9.00\n9.00 9.00>>>"
