    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   4 4 4 6 3 9 2\n   6 2 8 7 9 7 1\n   0 8 2 5 6 8 5\n   6 5 8 6 2 6 4\n   3 7 9 3 1 6 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2, meaning the pooling regions do not overlap.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix has dimensions 5x7.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the output matrix will have dimensions:\n     - Rows: floor(5/2) = 2\n     - Columns: floor(7/2) = 3\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - Divide the input matrix into 2x2 regions and calculate the average for each region.\n   - The regions and their averages are as follows:\n\n   - **Region 1** (Top-left 2x2):\n     ```\n     4 4\n     6 2\n     ```\n     Average = (4 + 4 + 6 + 2) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4.00\n\n   - **Region 2** (Top-middle 2x2):\n     ```\n     4 6\n     8 7\n     ```\n     Average = (4 + 6 + 8 + 7) / 4 = 25 / 4 = 6.25\n\n   - **Region 3** (Top-right 2x2):\n     ```\n     3 9\n     9 7\n     ```\n     Average = (3 + 9 + 9 + 7) / 4 = 28 / 4 = 7.00\n\n   - **Region 4** (Middle-left 2x2):\n     ```\n     0 8\n     6 5\n     ```\n     Average = (0 + 8 + 6 + 5) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75\n\n   - **Region 5** (Middle-middle 2x2):\n     ```\n     2 5\n     8 6\n     ```\n     Average = (2 + 5 + 8 + 6) / 4 = 21 / 4 = 5.25\n\n   - **Region 6** (Middle-right 2x2):\n     ```\n     6 8\n     2 6\n     ```\n     Average = (6 + 8 + 2 + 6) / 4 = 22 / 4 = 5.50\n\n   - **Region 7** (Bottom-left 2x2):\n     ```\n     6 5\n     3 7\n     ```\n     Average = (6 + 5 + 3 + 7) / 4 = 21 / 4 = 5.25\n\n   - **Region 8** (Bottom-middle 2x2):\n     ```\n     8 6\n     9 3\n     ```\n     Average = (8 + 6 + 9 + 3) / 4 = 26 / 4 = 6.50\n\n   - **Region 9** (Bottom-right 2x2):\n     ```\n     2 6\n     1 6\n     ```\n     Average = (2 + 6 + 1 + 6) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix, based on the calculated averages, is:\n   ```\n   4.00 6.25 7.00\n   4.75 5.25 5.50\n   5.25 6.50 3.75\n   ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n4.00 6.25 7.00\n4.75 5.25 5.50\n5.25 6.50 3.75\n>>>"
