    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 5x3 matrix:\n   ```\n   3 6 2\n   2 8 9\n   3 8 4\n   4 0 3\n   5 7 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 submatrices from the input matrix, and there will be no overlap between these submatrices.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix has 5 rows and 3 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(5/2) = 2`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor(3/2) = 1`.\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - Extract 2x2 submatrices and calculate the average of each:\n     - First submatrix (top-left corner):\n       ```\n       3 6\n       2 8\n       ```\n       Average = (3 + 6 + 2 + 8) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75\n\n     - Second submatrix (bottom-left corner):\n       ```\n       3 8\n       4 0\n       ```\n       Average = (3 + 8 + 4 + 0) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75\n\n     - Third submatrix (bottom-right corner):\n       ```\n       5 7\n       ```\n       Since the kernel size is 2x2, and we only have a 2x1 submatrix here, we cannot form a complete 2x2 submatrix. Therefore, this part is not included in the output.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: Based on the averages calculated, the output matrix is:\n   ```\n   4.75\n   3.75\n   ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n4.75\n3.75\n>>>\n```"
