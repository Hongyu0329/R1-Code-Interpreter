    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 6x8 matrix:\n   ```\n   3 0 5 3 4 9 8 1\n   5 9 6 8 7 8 5 2\n   8 1 6 4 8 4 6 4\n   9 1 6 8 8 1 6 0\n   4 9 8 0 9 2 6 7\n   0 0 2 9 2 6 0 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2, meaning the pooling regions do not overlap.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 6 rows by 8 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the output matrix will be:\n     - \\( \\text{Output Rows} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\)\n     - \\( \\text{Output Columns} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\)\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 3x4.\n\n4. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - Divide the input matrix into 2x2 regions and find the maximum value in each region.\n   - The regions and their maximum values are as follows:\n\n   - **First Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Region 1: \n       ```\n       3 0\n       5 9\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n     - Region 2:\n       ```\n       5 3\n       6 8\n       ```\n       Max = 8\n     - Region 3:\n       ```\n       4 9\n       7 8\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n     - Region 4:\n       ```\n       8 1\n       5 2\n       ```\n       Max = 8\n\n   - **Second Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Region 5:\n       ```\n       8 1\n       9 1\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n     - Region 6:\n       ```\n       6 4\n       6 8\n       ```\n       Max = 8\n     - Region 7:\n       ```\n       8 4\n       8 1\n       ```\n       Max = 8\n     - Region 8:\n       ```\n       6 4\n       6 0\n       ```\n       Max = 6\n\n   - **Third Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Region 9:\n       ```\n       4 9\n       0 0\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n     - Region 10:\n       ```\n       8 0\n       2 9\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n     - Region 11:\n       ```\n       9 2\n       2 6\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n     - Region 12:\n       ```\n       6 7\n       0 9\n       ```\n       Max = 9\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix, after performing max pooling, is:\n     ```\n     9 8 9 8\n     9 8 8 6\n     9 9 9 9\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n9 8 9 8\n9 8 8 6\n9 9 9 9\n>>>\n```"
