    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is a 5x9 matrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - Since the kernel size is 3 and the stride is also 3, the output matrix dimensions can be calculated as follows:\n   - For the rows: \\( \\text{floor}(\\frac{5}{3}) = 1 \\) (since 5 divided by 3 is 1 with a remainder)\n   - For the columns: \\( \\text{floor}(\\frac{9}{3}) = 3 \\) (since 9 divided by 3 is exactly 3)\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be a 1x3 matrix.\n\n3. **Apply Max Pooling**:\n   - We will slide the 3x3 kernel over the input matrix with a stride of 3, and for each position, we will take the maximum value within the kernel.\n   \n   - **First Kernel Position (Top-left 3x3 sub-matrix)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     9 & 5 & 5 \\\\\n     2 & 9 & 4 \\\\\n     3 & 6 & 0 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     - Maximum value: 9\n\n   - **Second Kernel Position (Middle 3x3 sub-matrix)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     6 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n     3 & 6 & 7 \\\\\n     6 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     - Maximum value: 7\n\n   - **Third Kernel Position (Top-right 3x3 sub-matrix)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     8 & 9 & 5 \\\\\n     9 & 9 & 7 \\\\\n     3 & 5 & 0 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     - Maximum value: 9\n\n4. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix will be a 1x3 matrix with the maximum values from each of the kernel positions.\n\nThe final output matrix after performing max pooling is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Output Matrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 9 & 7 & 9 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<9 7 9>>>"
