    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is a 10x5 matrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - Since the kernel size is 3 and the stride is also 3, the output matrix dimensions can be calculated as follows:\n   - For the rows: \\( \\text{floor}((10 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 3 \\)\n   - For the columns: \\( \\text{floor}((5 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 1 \\)\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 3x1.\n\n3. **Apply Max Pooling**:\n   - We will slide the 3x3 kernel over the input matrix with a stride of 3, and for each position, we will take the maximum value within the kernel.\n\n4. **Calculate Each Element of the Output Matrix**:\n   - **First Element (Top-left 3x3 sub-matrix)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     6 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n     9 & 6 & 3 \\\\\n     3 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     The maximum value is 9.\n\n   - **Second Element (Middle 3x3 sub-matrix)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     6 & 0 & 5 \\\\\n     0 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n     5 & 8 & 3 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     The maximum value is 9.\n\n   - **Third Element (Bottom 3x3 sub-matrix)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     9 & 9 & 4 \\\\\n     7 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n     0 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     The maximum value is 9.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix, after performing max pooling, is:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     9 \\\\\n     9 \\\\\n     9 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n9\n9\n9\n>>>"
