    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 4x9 matrix:\n   ```\n   3 2 3 6 2 0 1 1 3\n   3 9 5 4 0 1 9 7 1\n   3 4 8 8 9 3 4 0 0\n   7 3 1 3 0 4 6 6 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3.\n   - The input matrix has dimensions 4x9.\n   - The output matrix dimensions can be calculated as follows:\n     - Number of rows in the output matrix = floor((4 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n     - Number of columns in the output matrix = floor((9 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 2x3.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - Divide the input matrix into non-overlapping 3x3 regions and find the maximum value in each region.\n   - The regions and their maximum values are:\n     - Region 1 (top-left 3x3):\n       ```\n       3 2 3\n       3 9 5\n       3 4 8\n       ```\n       Max value = 9\n     - Region 2 (top-middle 3x3):\n       ```\n       6 2 0\n       4 0 1\n       8 9 3\n       ```\n       Max value = 9\n     - Region 3 (top-right 3x3):\n       ```\n       1 1 3\n       9 7 1\n       4 0 0\n       ```\n       Max value = 9\n     - Region 4 (bottom-left 3x3):\n       ```\n       7 3 1\n       ```\n       Max value = 7\n     - Region 5 (bottom-middle 3x3):\n       ```\n       3 0 4\n       ```\n       Max value = 4\n     - Region 6 (bottom-right 3x3):\n       ```\n       6 6 2\n       ```\n       Max value = 6\n\n4. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix is constructed by placing the maximum values from each region in the corresponding position:\n     ```\n     9 9 9\n     7 4 6\n     ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be formatted to two decimal places.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n<<<\n9.00 9.00 9.00\n7.00 4.00 6.00\n>>>\n```"
