    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   2 2 2 6\n   9 7 4 6\n   8 8 8 9\n   4 1 2 8\n   8 4 7 5\n   8 4 6 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size:**\n   - The input matrix is 6x4.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, the output matrix will be smaller.\n   - The number of rows in the output matrix is calculated as: floor((6 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 2.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix is calculated as: floor((4 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 1.\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 2x1.\n\n3. **Apply Max Pooling:**\n   - We will slide the 3x3 kernel over the input matrix with a stride of 3, and for each position, we will take the maximum value within the kernel.\n\n4. **Calculate the Max Values:**\n   - **First Kernel Position (Top-left 3x3 sub-matrix):**\n     ```\n     2 2 2\n     9 7 4\n     8 8 8\n     ```\n     The maximum value is 9.\n\n   - **Second Kernel Position (Bottom-left 3x3 sub-matrix):**\n     ```\n     4 1 2\n     8 4 7\n     8 4 6\n     ```\n     The maximum value is 8.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix:**\n   - The output matrix, after applying max pooling, is:\n     ```\n     9\n     8\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output:**\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be formatted to two decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n9.00\n8.00\n>>>\n```"
