    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Pooling Operation**: Average pooling with a kernel size of 1 means that each element in the output matrix corresponds directly to the same element in the input matrix. This is because the kernel size of 1 means that each \"pool\" is just a single element, and the average of a single element is the element itself.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is a 10x10 matrix. Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will also be a 10x10 matrix because each element is processed individually without any reduction in size.\n\n3. **Calculate the Output Matrix**: Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix. Each element in the output matrix is the average of the corresponding single element in the input matrix.\n\n4. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be formatted in the same way as the input matrix, enclosed within triple angle brackets, and each element should be correct to 2 decimal places.\n\nGiven these steps, the output matrix is:\n\n```\n6.00 7.00 5.00 8.00 8.00 2.00 1.00 7.00 2.00 3.00\n7.00 3.00 9.00 0.00 1.00 5.00 9.00 8.00 4.00 4.00\n8.00 6.00 3.00 3.00 7.00 7.00 1.00 3.00 5.00 2.00\n2.00 3.00 7.00 9.00 3.00 2.00 2.00 5.00 0.00 1.00\n7.00 9.00 3.00 8.00 5.00 9.00 3.00 2.00 6.00 9.00\n9.00 3.00 5.00 4.00 5.00 5.00 8.00 0.00 1.00 1.00\n4.00 8.00 9.00 2.00 5.00 7.00 8.00 6.00 4.00 2.00\n9.00 7.00 3.00 9.00 0.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 0.00 3.00\n2.00 4.00 9.00 7.00 6.00 7.00 7.00 3.00 4.00 9.00\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n6.00 7.00 5.00 8.00 8.00 2.00 1.00 7.00 2.00 3.00\n7.00 3.00 9.00 0.00 1.00 5.00 9.00 8.00 4.00 4.00\n8.00 6.00 3.00 3.00 7.00 7.00 1.00 3.00 5.00 2.00\n2.00 3.00 7.00 9.00 3.00 2.00 2.00 5.00 0.00 1.00\n7.00 9.00 3.00 8.00 5.00 9.00 3.00 2.00 6.00 9.00\n9.00 3.00 5.00 4.00 5.00 5.00 8.00 0.00 1.00 1.00\n4.00 8.00 9.00 2.00 5.00 7.00 8.00 6.00 4.00 2.00\n9.00 7.00 3.00 9.00 0.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 0.00 3.00\n2.00 4.00 9.00 7.00 6.00 7.00 7.00 3.00 4.00 9.00\n>>>"
