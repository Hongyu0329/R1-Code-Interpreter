    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Pooling Parameters:**\n   - The input matrix is:\n     ```\n     5 6 3 3 5 8 5 7 8 8\n     3 2 8 1 8 3 8 4 1 3\n     2 3 3 2 9 3 7 5 6 1\n     ```\n   - The kernel size is 1, which means each element in the matrix is considered individually.\n   - The stride is equal to the kernel size, which is 1, meaning we move one element at a time.\n\n2. **Perform Max Pooling:**\n   - Since the kernel size is 1, each element is its own pool, and the maximum value in each pool is the element itself.\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix because each element is the maximum of its own 1x1 pool.\n\n3. **Format the Output:**\n   - The output matrix should be formatted in the same way as the input matrix, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n4. **Output the Result:**\n   - Since each element is its own maximum, the output matrix is identical to the input matrix.\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n5 6 3 3 5 8 5 7 8 8\n3 2 8 1 8 3 8 4 1 3\n2 3 3 2 9 3 7 5 6 1\n>>>"
