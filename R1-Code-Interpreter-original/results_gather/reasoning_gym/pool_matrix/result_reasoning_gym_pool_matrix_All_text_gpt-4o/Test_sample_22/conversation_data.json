    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 4x9 matrix:\n   ```\n   5 2 7 1 0 8 7 1 9\n   6 9 7 4 4 4 6 4 0\n   6 8 9 7 3 2 1 2 6\n   9 8 1 7 7 2 7 7 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3. This means that the pooling operation will be applied to non-overlapping 3x3 regions of the matrix.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 4 rows by 9 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(4/3) = 1`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor(9/3) = 3`.\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 1x3.\n\n4. **Apply Max Pooling**:\n   - **First 3x3 Region**: \n     ```\n     5 2 7\n     6 9 7\n     6 8 9\n     ```\n     The maximum value is 9.\n   \n   - **Second 3x3 Region**:\n     ```\n     1 0 8\n     4 4 4\n     7 3 2\n     ```\n     The maximum value is 8.\n   \n   - **Third 3x3 Region**:\n     ```\n     7 1 9\n     6 4 0\n     1 2 6\n     ```\n     The maximum value is 9.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix, after applying max pooling, is:\n   ```\n   9 8 9\n   ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```\n<<<9 8 9>>>\n```"
