    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride equal to the kernel size, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is 8x8.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - Since the kernel size is 3 and the stride is also 3, the output matrix will be smaller.\n   - The formula to calculate the dimensions of the output matrix is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Output dimension} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{Input dimension} - \\text{Kernel size}}{\\text{Stride}} \\right\\rfloor + 1\n     \\]\n   - For an 8x8 matrix with a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the output dimensions will be:\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{8 - 3}{3} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 3x3.\n\n3. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - We will slide the 3x3 kernel over the input matrix with a stride of 3 and calculate the average of the elements within each kernel window.\n   - The windows will be positioned as follows:\n     - Top-left corner of the matrix: (0,0) to (2,2)\n     - Top-middle: (0,3) to (2,5)\n     - Top-right: (0,6) to (2,7)\n     - Middle-left: (3,0) to (5,2)\n     - Middle-middle: (3,3) to (5,5)\n     - Middle-right: (3,6) to (5,7)\n     - Bottom-left: (6,0) to (7,2)\n     - Bottom-middle: (6,3) to (7,5)\n     - Bottom-right: (6,6) to (7,7)\n\n4. **Calculate the Averages**:\n   - For each 3x3 window, sum the elements and divide by 9 (since there are 9 elements in each window).\n\n   Let's calculate the averages for each window:\n\n   - **Top-left (0,0) to (2,2)**:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1 + 5 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 8 + 2 + 3}{9} = \\frac{27}{9} = 3.00\n     \\]\n\n   - **Top-middle (0,3) to (2,5)**:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 3 + 4 + 4}{9} = \\frac{29}{9} \\approx 3.22\n     \\]\n\n   - **Top-right (0,6) to (2,7)**:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{7 + 9 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 4}{9} = \\frac{33}{9} \\approx 3.67\n     \\]\n\n   - **Middle-left (3,0) to (5,2)**:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{7 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 7 + 6 + 2 + 6}{9} = \\frac{50}{9} \\approx 5.56\n     \\]\n\n   - **Middle-middle (3,3) to (5,5)**:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{7 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 5}{9} = \\frac{40}{9} \\approx 4.44\n     \\]\n\n   - **Middle-right (3,6) to (5,7)**:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2 + 3 + 3 + 7 + 4 + 5 + 0 + 5}{9} = \\frac{31}{9} \\approx 3.44\n     \\]\n\n   - **Bottom-left (6,0) to (7,2)**:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3 + 3 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 7}{6} = \\frac{21}{6} = 3.50\n     \\]\n\n   - **Bottom-middle (6,3) to (7,5)**:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 9 + 3}{6} = \\frac{28}{6} \\approx 4.67\n     \\]\n\n   - **Bottom-right (6,6) to (7,7)**:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{6 + 7 + 0 + 3}{4} = \\frac{16}{4} = 4.00\n     \\]\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix is constructed from the calculated averages.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3.00 & 3.22 & 3.67 \\\\\n5.56 & 4.44 & 3.44 \\\\\n3.50 & 4.67 & 4.00 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n3.00 3.22 3.67\n5.56 4.44 3.44\n3.50 4.67 4.00\n>>>"
