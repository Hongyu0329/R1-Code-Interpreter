    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 5x10 matrix:\n   ```\n   1 6 7 9 8 4 8 5 0 5\n   8 1 3 8 3 3 2 8 9 3\n   7 0 9 7 9 8 4 3 3 7\n   4 8 7 6 9 4 2 7 7 7\n   0 4 1 8 3 1 8 4 3 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2, meaning the pooling regions do not overlap.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 5 rows by 10 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the output matrix will have:\n     - \\( \\text{floor}(5/2) = 2 \\) rows\n     - \\( \\text{floor}(10/2) = 5 \\) columns\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 2x5.\n\n4. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each 2x2 block in the input matrix, find the maximum value.\n   - Move the kernel across the matrix with a stride of 2.\n\n5. **Calculate the Max Values for Each Block**:\n   - Block 1 (top-left 2x2): \n     ```\n     1 6\n     8 1\n     ```\n     Max = 8\n   - Block 2:\n     ```\n     7 9\n     3 8\n     ```\n     Max = 9\n   - Block 3:\n     ```\n     8 4\n     2 8\n     ```\n     Max = 8\n   - Block 4:\n     ```\n     0 5\n     9 3\n     ```\n     Max = 9\n   - Block 5:\n     ```\n     8 5\n     3 7\n     ```\n     Max = 8\n   - Block 6:\n     ```\n     7 0\n     4 8\n     ```\n     Max = 8\n   - Block 7:\n     ```\n     9 7\n     9 6\n     ```\n     Max = 9\n   - Block 8:\n     ```\n     9 8\n     2 7\n     ```\n     Max = 9\n   - Block 9:\n     ```\n     3 3\n     7 7\n     ```\n     Max = 7\n   - Block 10:\n     ```\n     3 7\n     7 7\n     ```\n     Max = 7\n\n6. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix is:\n     ```\n     8 9 8 9 8\n     8 9 9 7 7\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**: Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n8 9 8 9 8\n8 9 9 7 7\n>>>\n```"
