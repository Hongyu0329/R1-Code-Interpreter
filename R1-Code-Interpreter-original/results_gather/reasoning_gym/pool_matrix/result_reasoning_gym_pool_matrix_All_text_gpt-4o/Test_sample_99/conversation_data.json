    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 7x7 matrix:\n   ```\n   3 7 9 9 5 0 2\n   8 1 8 0 5 4 0\n   0 1 1 2 7 5 8\n   7 5 0 7 0 3 8\n   8 8 6 8 3 2 4\n   5 3 5 3 8 0 9\n   1 8 2 2 6 5 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the output matrix will be smaller. The number of pooling regions along each dimension is calculated as:\n   - Rows: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{7}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 2 \\)\n   - Columns: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{7}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 2 \\)\n   Thus, the output matrix will be 2x2.\n\n3. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - **First Pooling Region (Top-left 3x3 block)**:\n     ```\n     3 7 9\n     8 1 8\n     0 1 1\n     ```\n     Calculate the average: \\( \\frac{3 + 7 + 9 + 8 + 1 + 8 + 0 + 1 + 1}{9} = \\frac{38}{9} \\approx 4.22 \\)\n\n   - **Second Pooling Region (Top-right 3x3 block)**:\n     ```\n     9 5 0\n     0 5 4\n     2 7 5\n     ```\n     Calculate the average: \\( \\frac{9 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 7 + 5}{9} = \\frac{37}{9} \\approx 4.11 \\)\n\n   - **Third Pooling Region (Bottom-left 3x3 block)**:\n     ```\n     7 5 0\n     8 8 6\n     5 3 5\n     ```\n     Calculate the average: \\( \\frac{7 + 5 + 0 + 8 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 5}{9} = \\frac{47}{9} \\approx 5.22 \\)\n\n   - **Fourth Pooling Region (Bottom-right 3x3 block)**:\n     ```\n     7 0 3\n     8 3 2\n     3 8 0\n     ```\n     Calculate the average: \\( \\frac{7 + 0 + 3 + 8 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 8 + 0}{9} = \\frac{34}{9} \\approx 3.78 \\)\n\n4. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The resulting 2x2 matrix from the average pooling is:\n   ```\n   4.22 4.11\n   5.22 3.78\n   ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**: Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n4.22 4.11\n5.22 3.78\n>>>"
