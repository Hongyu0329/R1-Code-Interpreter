    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   5 1 9 6 8\n   8 4 0 3 7\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3. This means that the pooling operation will consider non-overlapping 3x3 regions of the matrix.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 2 rows by 5 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the output matrix will have dimensions calculated as follows:\n     - Number of rows in the output: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{number of rows in input}}{\\text{kernel size}} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\)\n     - Number of columns in the output: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{number of columns in input}}{\\text{kernel size}} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{5}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\)\n\n4. **Pooling Operation**:\n   - Since the number of rows in the output is 0, it indicates that the kernel size is larger than the number of rows in the input matrix, and thus no complete 3x3 region can be formed vertically.\n   - However, horizontally, we can form one 3x3 region from the first row and the first three columns of the input matrix.\n\n5. **Calculate the Average for the 3x3 Region**:\n   - The only possible 3x3 region is:\n     ```\n     5 1 9\n     8 4 0\n     ```\n   - Calculate the average of these elements:\n     - Sum of elements = 5 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 4 + 0 = 27\n     - Number of elements = 6\n     - Average = 27 / 6 = 4.5\n\n6. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - Since the output matrix can only have one column due to the horizontal pooling, and no complete vertical pooling is possible, the output matrix will be:\n     ```\n     4.50\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and formatted to two decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n4.50\n>>>\n```"
