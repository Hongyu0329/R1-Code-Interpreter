    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 5x8 matrix:\n   ```\n   2 3 5 2 7 2 4 9\n   5 1 0 0 7 5 9 6\n   5 0 6 3 1 3 6 0\n   7 4 7 8 8 6 7 0\n   4 3 7 8 4 7 5 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The kernel size is 3x3, and the stride is 3.\n   - The input matrix is 5 rows by 8 columns.\n   - The number of rows in the output matrix is calculated as: \n     \\[\n     \\text{output rows} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{input rows} - \\text{kernel size}}{\\text{stride}} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{5 - 3}{3} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n     \\]\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{output columns} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{input columns} - \\text{kernel size}}{\\text{stride}} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{8 - 3}{3} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 1 + 1 = 3\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 2x3.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each 3x3 region in the input matrix, find the maximum value.\n   - The regions are determined by the kernel size and stride.\n\n4. **Calculate the Max Values for Each Region**:\n   - **Region 1** (Top-left 3x3):\n     ```\n     2 3 5\n     5 1 0\n     5 0 6\n     ```\n     Max value = 6\n\n   - **Region 2** (Top-middle 3x3):\n     ```\n     2 7 2\n     0 7 5\n     3 1 3\n     ```\n     Max value = 7\n\n   - **Region 3** (Top-right 3x3):\n     ```\n     4 9\n     9 6\n     6 0\n     ```\n     Max value = 9\n\n   - **Region 4** (Bottom-left 3x3):\n     ```\n     7 4 7\n     4 3 7\n     ```\n     Max value = 7\n\n   - **Region 5** (Bottom-middle 3x3):\n     ```\n     8 8 6\n     8 4 7\n     ```\n     Max value = 8\n\n   - **Region 6** (Bottom-right 3x3):\n     ```\n     7 0\n     5 8\n     ```\n     Max value = 8\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix is:\n     ```\n     6 7 9\n     7 8 8\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n6 7 9\n7 8 8\n>>>\n```"
