    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   4 7 3 5 3 0\n   7 6 0 2 2 2\n   6 0 8 8 9 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 submatrices from the input matrix, and there will be no overlap between these submatrices.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix has 3 rows and 6 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(3/2) = 1`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor(6/2) = 3`.\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - Extract 2x2 submatrices and calculate the average of each:\n     - First submatrix (top-left corner):\n       ```\n       4 7\n       7 6\n       ```\n       Average = (4 + 7 + 7 + 6) / 4 = 24 / 4 = 6.00\n\n     - Second submatrix (top-middle):\n       ```\n       3 5\n       0 2\n       ```\n       Average = (3 + 5 + 0 + 2) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.50\n\n     - Third submatrix (top-right corner):\n       ```\n       3 0\n       2 2\n       ```\n       Average = (3 + 0 + 2 + 2) / 4 = 7 / 4 = 1.75\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix, after performing average pooling, is:\n   ```\n   6.00 2.50 1.75\n   ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<6.00 2.50 1.75>>>"
