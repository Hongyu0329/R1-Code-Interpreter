    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 3x6 matrix:\n   ```\n   6 2 8 0 4 5\n   5 5 4 7 8 0\n   7 4 1 4 2 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3. This means that the pooling operation will be applied to non-overlapping 3x3 regions of the matrix.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix has dimensions 3x6.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the output matrix will have dimensions:\n     - Rows: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{3}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\)\n     - Columns: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{6}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 2 \\)\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 1x2.\n\n4. **Apply Max Pooling**:\n   - **First Region (Top-left 3x3 block)**:\n     ```\n     6 2 8\n     5 5 4\n     7 4 1\n     ```\n     - The maximum value in this block is 8.\n   \n   - **Second Region (Top-right 3x3 block)**:\n     ```\n     0 4 5\n     7 8 0\n     4 2 6\n     ```\n     - The maximum value in this block is 8.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: Based on the maximum values found in each region, the output matrix is:\n   ```\n   8 8\n   ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be correct to 2 decimal places. Since the elements are integers, they can be represented as floating-point numbers with two decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<8.00 8.00>>>\n```"
