    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   8 5 6 4 2 5 5\n   1 2 4 0 2 3 6\n   1 6 4 8 3 8 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 blocks from the matrix and move 2 steps at a time both horizontally and vertically.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix has 3 rows and 7 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(3/2) = 1`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor(7/2) = 3`.\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - For each 2x2 block, calculate the average of the elements in the block.\n\n5. **Calculate Averages for Each Block**:\n   - **Block 1** (top-left 2x2 block):\n     ```\n     8 5\n     1 2\n     ```\n     Average = (8 + 5 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4.00\n\n   - **Block 2** (next 2x2 block to the right):\n     ```\n     6 4\n     4 0\n     ```\n     Average = (6 + 4 + 4 + 0) / 4 = 14 / 4 = 3.50\n\n   - **Block 3** (next 2x2 block to the right):\n     ```\n     2 5\n     2 3\n     ```\n     Average = (2 + 5 + 2 + 3) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3.00\n\n6. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix will be a 1x3 matrix with the calculated averages.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n4.00 3.50 3.00\n```\n\nEnclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<4.00 3.50 3.00>>>"
