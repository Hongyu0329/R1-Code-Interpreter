    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2 and a stride of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 7x9 matrix:\n   ```\n   1 7 7 0 1 2 8 7 2\n   8 4 5 0 3 1 4 1 2\n   3 6 5 2 4 5 8 6 0\n   4 6 4 2 3 4 8 8 8\n   4 9 9 9 8 5 8 6 9\n   4 8 7 8 7 8 3 9 8\n   7 2 5 5 9 0 4 4 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the output matrix will be smaller. The dimensions of the output matrix can be calculated as follows:\n   - Output rows = (Input rows - Kernel size) / Stride + 1 = (7 - 2) / 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Output columns = (Input columns - Kernel size) / Stride + 1 = (9 - 2) / 2 + 1 = 4\n\n3. **Perform Average Pooling**: For each 2x2 block in the input matrix, calculate the average and place it in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\n   - **First Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Block 1: (1, 7, 8, 4) → Average = (1 + 7 + 8 + 4) / 4 = 5.00\n     - Block 2: (7, 0, 4, 5) → Average = (7 + 0 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 4.00\n     - Block 3: (1, 2, 3, 1) → Average = (1 + 2 + 3 + 1) / 4 = 1.75\n     - Block 4: (8, 7, 4, 1) → Average = (8 + 7 + 4 + 1) / 4 = 5.00\n\n   - **Second Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Block 1: (3, 6, 4, 6) → Average = (3 + 6 + 4 + 6) / 4 = 4.75\n     - Block 2: (5, 2, 4, 2) → Average = (5 + 2 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 3.25\n     - Block 3: (4, 5, 3, 4) → Average = (4 + 5 + 3 + 4) / 4 = 4.00\n     - Block 4: (8, 6, 8, 8) → Average = (8 + 6 + 8 + 8) / 4 = 7.50\n\n   - **Third Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Block 1: (4, 9, 4, 8) → Average = (4 + 9 + 4 + 8) / 4 = 6.25\n     - Block 2: (9, 9, 7, 8) → Average = (9 + 9 + 7 + 8) / 4 = 8.25\n     - Block 3: (8, 5, 7, 8) → Average = (8 + 5 + 7 + 8) / 4 = 7.00\n     - Block 4: (8, 6, 3, 9) → Average = (8 + 6 + 3 + 9) / 4 = 6.50\n\n4. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix is a 3x4 matrix:\n   ```\n   5.00 4.00 1.75 5.00\n   4.75 3.25 4.00 7.50\n   6.25 8.25 7.00 6.50\n   ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**: Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n5.00 4.00 1.75 5.00\n4.75 3.25 4.00 7.50\n6.25 8.25 7.00 6.50\n>>>"
