    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Pooling Operation**: Average pooling with a kernel size of 1 means that each element in the input matrix is considered individually. Since the kernel size is 1, the average of each element is the element itself.\n\n2. **Stride and Kernel Size**: The stride is equal to the kernel size, which is 1. This means that the pooling operation will move one element at a time, and there will be no overlap between pooling regions.\n\n3. **Output Matrix Size**: Since the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix. Each element in the output matrix corresponds directly to an element in the input matrix.\n\n4. **Calculate the Average**: For each element in the input matrix, the average is simply the element itself because the kernel size is 1.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be formatted in the same way as the input matrix, enclosed within triple angle brackets. Each element should be presented with two decimal places.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n2 7 8 7 0 0 8 3 4\n8 4 0 5 0 6 2 4 7\n5 0 9 9 5 9 0 4 6\n4 2 6 7 0 8 2 7 8\n0 6 4 1 9 4 9 4 5\n1 5 3 7 9 3 9 5 2\n5 0 3 7 2 9 7 5 5\n4 4 6 5 9 9 2 8 3\n4 7 2 4 8 1 9 7 9\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix, with each element formatted to two decimal places:\n\n```\n2.00 7.00 8.00 7.00 0.00 0.00 8.00 3.00 4.00\n8.00 4.00 0.00 5.00 0.00 6.00 2.00 4.00 7.00\n5.00 0.00 9.00 9.00 5.00 9.00 0.00 4.00 6.00\n4.00 2.00 6.00 7.00 0.00 8.00 2.00 7.00 8.00\n0.00 6.00 4.00 1.00 9.00 4.00 9.00 4.00 5.00\n1.00 5.00 3.00 7.00 9.00 3.00 9.00 5.00 2.00\n5.00 0.00 3.00 7.00 2.00 9.00 7.00 5.00 5.00\n4.00 4.00 6.00 5.00 9.00 9.00 2.00 8.00 3.00\n4.00 7.00 2.00 4.00 8.00 1.00 9.00 7.00 9.00\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n2.00 7.00 8.00 7.00 0.00 0.00 8.00 3.00 4.00\n8.00 4.00 0.00 5.00 0.00 6.00 2.00 4.00 7.00\n5.00 0.00 9.00 9.00 5.00 9.00 0.00 4.00 6.00\n4.00 2.00 6.00 7.00 0.00 8.00 2.00 7.00 8.00\n0.00 6.00 4.00 1.00 9.00 4.00 9.00 4.00 5.00\n1.00 5.00 3.00 7.00 9.00 3.00 9.00 5.00 2.00\n5.00 0.00 3.00 7.00 2.00 9.00 7.00 5.00 5.00\n4.00 4.00 6.00 5.00 9.00 9.00 2.00 8.00 3.00\n4.00 7.00 2.00 4.00 8.00 1.00 9.00 7.00 9.00\n>>>"
