    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   7 5 6 8 3\n   7 9 3 5 9\n   4 1 3 1 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 1, and the stride is also 1. This means each element of the matrix is considered individually, and there is no reduction in the size of the matrix.\n\n3. **Max Pooling Operation**: Since the kernel size is 1, each element is its own pooling region. Therefore, the max pooling operation will simply return the same element for each position.\n\n4. **Output Matrix**: The output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix because the kernel size is 1 and the stride is 1. Each element in the output matrix will be the maximum value of the corresponding 1x1 region in the input matrix.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be formatted in the same way as the input matrix, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nGiven these steps, the output matrix is the same as the input matrix:\n\n```\n7 5 6 8 3\n7 9 3 5 9\n4 1 3 1 2\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n7 5 6 8 3\n7 9 3 5 9\n4 1 3 1 2\n>>>"
