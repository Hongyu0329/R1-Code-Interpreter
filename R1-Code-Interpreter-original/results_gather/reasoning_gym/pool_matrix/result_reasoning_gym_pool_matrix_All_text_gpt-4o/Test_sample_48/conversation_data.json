    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is 6 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - Since the kernel size is 3 and the stride is also 3, the output matrix dimensions can be calculated as follows:\n   - For rows: \\( \\text{floor}(\\frac{6}{3}) = 2 \\)\n   - For columns: \\( \\text{floor}(\\frac{8}{3}) = 2 \\)\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 2 rows by 2 columns.\n\n3. **Apply Max Pooling**:\n   - Divide the input matrix into non-overlapping 3x3 regions.\n   - For each 3x3 region, find the maximum value.\n\n4. **Calculate the Max Values for Each Region**:\n   - **Region 1** (Top-left 3x3):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     6 & 3 & 2 \\\\\n     1 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n     3 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Maximum value = 6\n\n   - **Region 2** (Top-right 3x3):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     3 & 6 & 7 \\\\\n     4 & 0 & 9 \\\\\n     9 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Maximum value = 9\n\n   - **Region 3** (Bottom-left 3x3):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     8 & 3 & 7 \\\\\n     9 & 8 & 6 \\\\\n     1 & 6 & 7 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Maximum value = 9\n\n   - **Region 4** (Bottom-right 3x3):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     3 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n     8 & 1 & 8 \\\\\n     9 & 0 & 9 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Maximum value = 9\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - Using the maximum values from each region, the output matrix is:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   6 & 9 \\\\\n   9 & 9 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be formatted to two decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n<<<\n6.00 9.00\n9.00 9.00\n>>>"
