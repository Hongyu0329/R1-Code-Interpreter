    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 9x2 matrix:\n   ```\n   7 9\n   4 4\n   3 3\n   5 2\n   2 5\n   0 3\n   1 5\n   2 6\n   9 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3. This means we will take 3x2 submatrices from the input matrix without overlap.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix has 9 rows. With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(9/3) = 3`.\n   - The number of columns remains the same as the input matrix, which is 2.\n\n4. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each 3x2 submatrix, find the maximum value in each column.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Max Pooling**:\n   - **First Submatrix (Rows 1-3)**:\n     ```\n     7 9\n     4 4\n     3 3\n     ```\n     - Max of first column: max(7, 4, 3) = 7\n     - Max of second column: max(9, 4, 3) = 9\n\n   - **Second Submatrix (Rows 4-6)**:\n     ```\n     5 2\n     2 5\n     0 3\n     ```\n     - Max of first column: max(5, 2, 0) = 5\n     - Max of second column: max(2, 5, 3) = 5\n\n   - **Third Submatrix (Rows 7-9)**:\n     ```\n     1 5\n     2 6\n     9 4\n     ```\n     - Max of first column: max(1, 2, 9) = 9\n     - Max of second column: max(5, 6, 4) = 6\n\n6. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - Combine the maximum values from each submatrix to form the output matrix.\n\nThe final output matrix after max pooling is:\n```\n7 9\n5 5\n9 6\n```\n\nTherefore, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n7 9\n5 5\n9 6\n>>>"
