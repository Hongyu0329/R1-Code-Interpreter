    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride equal to the kernel size, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 6x6 matrix:\n   ```\n   1 6 3 8 9 1\n   2 1 7 8 5 2\n   8 6 3 2 5 0\n   3 4 0 6 6 9\n   5 7 0 2 5 8\n   7 9 4 0 7 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the output matrix will be smaller. The input matrix is 6x6, and with a kernel size of 3, the output matrix will be 2x2. This is because:\n   - The number of rows in the output matrix = (6 - 3) / 3 + 1 = 2\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix = (6 - 3) / 3 + 1 = 2\n\n3. **Apply Average Pooling**: We will divide the input matrix into non-overlapping 3x3 regions and calculate the average of each region.\n\n   - **First Region (Top-left 3x3 block)**:\n     ```\n     1 6 3\n     2 1 7\n     8 6 3\n     ```\n     Average = (1 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 7 + 8 + 6 + 3) / 9 = 37 / 9 ≈ 4.11\n\n   - **Second Region (Top-right 3x3 block)**:\n     ```\n     8 9 1\n     8 5 2\n     2 5 0\n     ```\n     Average = (8 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 0) / 9 = 40 / 9 ≈ 4.44\n\n   - **Third Region (Bottom-left 3x3 block)**:\n     ```\n     3 4 0\n     5 7 0\n     7 9 4\n     ```\n     Average = (3 + 4 + 0 + 5 + 7 + 0 + 7 + 9 + 4) / 9 = 39 / 9 ≈ 4.33\n\n   - **Fourth Region (Bottom-right 3x3 block)**:\n     ```\n     6 6 9\n     2 5 8\n     0 7 0\n     ```\n     Average = (6 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 0 + 7 + 0) / 9 = 43 / 9 ≈ 4.78\n\n4. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix is a 2x2 matrix with the calculated averages:\n   ```\n   4.11 4.44\n   4.33 4.78\n   ```\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n4.11 4.44\n4.33 4.78\n>>>"
