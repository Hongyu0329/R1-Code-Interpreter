    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 8x5 matrix:\n   ```\n   0 3 9 0 0\n   0 6 2 8 9\n   5 0 1 1 0\n   8 7 9 7 1\n   9 2 9 1 5\n   0 5 5 2 2\n   3 6 4 0 1\n   7 3 1 5 5\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 submatrices from the input matrix and move the kernel by 2 steps both horizontally and vertically.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 8 rows by 5 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(8/2) = 4`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor(5/2) = 2`.\n\n4. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each 2x2 submatrix, find the maximum value.\n\n5. **Calculate the Max Values for Each Submatrix**:\n   - Submatrix 1 (top-left 2x2):\n     ```\n     0 3\n     0 6\n     ```\n     Max = 6\n\n   - Submatrix 2 (top-right 2x2):\n     ```\n     9 0\n     2 8\n     ```\n     Max = 9\n\n   - Submatrix 3 (second row, left 2x2):\n     ```\n     5 0\n     8 7\n     ```\n     Max = 8\n\n   - Submatrix 4 (second row, right 2x2):\n     ```\n     1 1\n     9 7\n     ```\n     Max = 9\n\n   - Submatrix 5 (third row, left 2x2):\n     ```\n     9 2\n     0 5\n     ```\n     Max = 9\n\n   - Submatrix 6 (third row, right 2x2):\n     ```\n     9 1\n     5 2\n     ```\n     Max = 9\n\n   - Submatrix 7 (bottom row, left 2x2):\n     ```\n     3 6\n     7 3\n     ```\n     Max = 7\n\n   - Submatrix 8 (bottom row, right 2x2):\n     ```\n     4 0\n     1 5\n     ```\n     Max = 5\n\n6. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix will be:\n     ```\n     6 9\n     8 9\n     9 9\n     7 5\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output Matrix**: Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n6 9\n8 9\n9 9\n7 5\n>>>\n```"
