    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Pooling Parameters:**\n   - The input matrix is:\n     ```\n     0 5 6\n     9 4 0\n     0 4 0\n     4 1 6\n     9 9 3\n     9 4 6\n     6 9 4\n     ```\n   - The kernel size is 1, which means each element in the matrix is considered individually.\n   - The stride is equal to the kernel size, which is 1, meaning we move one element at a time.\n\n2. **Max Pooling with Kernel Size 1:**\n   - Since the kernel size is 1, each element is its own pooling region.\n   - Therefore, the max pooling operation with a kernel size of 1 will result in the same matrix as the input matrix because each element is the maximum of its own 1x1 region.\n\n3. **Output the Result:**\n   - The output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n   - Ensure the output is formatted correctly with elements rounded to 2 decimal places, although in this case, they are all integers.\n\nThe final output matrix after performing max pooling with a kernel size of 1 is:\n\n<<<\n0.00 5.00 6.00\n9.00 4.00 0.00\n0.00 4.00 0.00\n4.00 1.00 6.00\n9.00 9.00 3.00\n9.00 4.00 6.00\n6.00 9.00 4.00\n>>>"
