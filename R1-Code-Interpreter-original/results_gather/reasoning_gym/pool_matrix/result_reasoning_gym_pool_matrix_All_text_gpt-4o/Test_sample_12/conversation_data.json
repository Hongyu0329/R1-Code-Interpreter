    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 9x10 matrix. The kernel size is 3, which means we will be considering 3x3 submatrices for pooling.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: Since the stride is equal to the kernel size (3), the output matrix will be smaller. The number of rows in the output matrix will be the floor of the input rows divided by the kernel size, and similarly for the columns. Thus, the output matrix will be 3x3.\n\n3. **Perform Average Pooling**: For each 3x3 submatrix, calculate the average of its elements. The submatrices are non-overlapping due to the stride being equal to the kernel size.\n\n4. **Calculate Averages**:\n   - **First Submatrix (Top-left corner)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     4 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n     6 & 9 & 3 \\\\\n     9 & 1 & 8 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = (4 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 9 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 8) / 9 = 44 / 9 ≈ 4.89\n\n   - **Second Submatrix (Top-middle)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     3 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n     7 & 3 & 3 \\\\\n     7 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = (3 + 0 + 4 + 7 + 3 + 3 + 7 + 4 + 5) / 9 = 36 / 9 = 4.00\n\n   - **Third Submatrix (Top-right corner)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     3 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n     6 & 5 & 4 \\\\\n     3 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = (3 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 0 + 4) / 9 = 40 / 9 ≈ 4.44\n\n   - **Fourth Submatrix (Middle-left)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     2 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n     2 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n     4 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = (2 + 8 + 8 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 4) / 9 = 33 / 9 ≈ 3.67\n\n   - **Fifth Submatrix (Middle-middle)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     6 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n     2 & 2 & 9 \\\\\n     6 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = (6 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 9 + 6 + 7 + 5) / 9 = 39 / 9 ≈ 4.33\n\n   - **Sixth Submatrix (Middle-right)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     3 & 4 & 8 \\\\\n     8 & 1 & 8 \\\\\n     5 & 6 & 2 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = (3 + 4 + 8 + 8 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 6 + 2) / 9 = 45 / 9 = 5.00\n\n   - **Seventh Submatrix (Bottom-left)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n     5 & 0 & 8 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = (1 + 8 + 9 + 5 + 0 + 8) / 6 = 31 / 6 ≈ 5.17\n\n   - **Eighth Submatrix (Bottom-middle)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 4 & 2 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = (1 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 2) / 6 = 15 / 6 = 2.50\n\n   - **Ninth Submatrix (Bottom-right)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     9 & 3 & 5 \\\\\n     9 & 7 & 6 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = (9 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 7 + 6) / 6 = 39 / 6 = 6.50\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: Place the calculated averages into the output matrix.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4.89 & 4.00 & 4.44 \\\\\n3.67 & 4.33 & 5.00 \\\\\n5.17 & 2.50 & 6.50 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n4.89 4.00 4.44\n3.67 4.33 5.00\n5.17 2.50 6.50\n>>>"
