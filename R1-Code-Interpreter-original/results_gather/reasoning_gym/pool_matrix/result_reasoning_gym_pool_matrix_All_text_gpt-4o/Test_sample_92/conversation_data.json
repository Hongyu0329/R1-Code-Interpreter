    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Pooling Operation**: Average pooling with a kernel size of 1 means that each element in the matrix is considered individually. Since the kernel size is 1, the average of each element is the element itself.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is a 6x10 matrix. With a kernel size of 1 and stride equal to the kernel size, the output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix, which is 6x10.\n\n3. **Calculate Average for Each Element**: Since the kernel size is 1, the average for each element is simply the element itself. Therefore, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\n4. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be formatted in the same way as the input matrix, enclosed within triple angle brackets, and each element should be correct to 2 decimal places.\n\nNow, let's write down the output matrix:\n\n```\n1.00 7.00 2.00 9.00 0.00 4.00 4.00 5.00 5.00 6.00\n9.00 6.00 0.00 8.00 9.00 9.00 0.00 2.00 2.00 1.00\n1.00 9.00 1.00 9.00 4.00 1.00 3.00 5.00 6.00 8.00\n7.00 5.00 5.00 0.00 8.00 4.00 9.00 3.00 9.00 2.00\n5.00 0.00 6.00 0.00 4.00 1.00 5.00 4.00 2.00 6.00\n4.00 2.00 9.00 5.00 7.00 8.00 9.00 8.00 9.00 0.00\n```\n\nEnclosing the output matrix within triple angle brackets, we have:\n\n<<<\n1.00 7.00 2.00 9.00 0.00 4.00 4.00 5.00 5.00 6.00\n9.00 6.00 0.00 8.00 9.00 9.00 0.00 2.00 2.00 1.00\n1.00 9.00 1.00 9.00 4.00 1.00 3.00 5.00 6.00 8.00\n7.00 5.00 5.00 0.00 8.00 4.00 9.00 3.00 9.00 2.00\n5.00 0.00 6.00 0.00 4.00 1.00 5.00 4.00 2.00 6.00\n4.00 2.00 9.00 5.00 7.00 8.00 9.00 8.00 9.00 0.00\n>>>"
