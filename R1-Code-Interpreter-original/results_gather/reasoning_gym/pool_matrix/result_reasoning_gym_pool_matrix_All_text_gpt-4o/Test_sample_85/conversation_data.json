    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Pooling Operation**: Average pooling with a kernel size of 1 means that each element in the input matrix is considered individually. Since the kernel size is 1, each element is its own region, and the average of a single element is the element itself.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is a 5x4 matrix. With a kernel size of 1 and stride of 1, the output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix because each element is processed individually.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average**: For each element in the matrix, the average is simply the element itself because the kernel size is 1.\n\n4. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be formatted in the same way as the input matrix, with each element rounded to two decimal places.\n\nGiven the input matrix:\n```\n0 0 1 7\n3 1 5 1\n0 2 9 2\n6 2 5 1\n1 6 7 6\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix, with each element rounded to two decimal places:\n\n```\n0.00 0.00 1.00 7.00\n3.00 1.00 5.00 1.00\n0.00 2.00 9.00 2.00\n6.00 2.00 5.00 1.00\n1.00 6.00 7.00 6.00\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n0.00 0.00 1.00 7.00\n3.00 1.00 5.00 1.00\n0.00 2.00 9.00 2.00\n6.00 2.00 5.00 1.00\n1.00 6.00 7.00 6.00\n>>>"
