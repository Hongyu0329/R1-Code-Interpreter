    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   9 2 4\n   3 9 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 1, and the stride is also 1. This means that each element in the input matrix will be considered individually, and there will be no overlap between pooling regions.\n\n3. **Average Pooling with Kernel Size 1**: Since the kernel size is 1, each element in the input matrix is its own pooling region. Therefore, the average of each element is the element itself.\n\n4. **Output Matrix**: The output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix because the kernel size is 1. Each element in the output matrix will be the same as the corresponding element in the input matrix.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The elements in the output matrix should be formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- The first row of the input matrix is `9, 2, 4`. After average pooling with a kernel size of 1, the first row of the output matrix is `9.00, 2.00, 4.00`.\n- The second row of the input matrix is `3, 9, 4`. After average pooling with a kernel size of 1, the second row of the output matrix is `3.00, 9.00, 4.00`.\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n```\n9.00 2.00 4.00\n3.00 9.00 4.00\n```\n\nFinally, we enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets as required:\n\n<<<\n9.00 2.00 4.00\n3.00 9.00 4.00\n>>>"
