    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 6x5 matrix:\n   ```\n   6 5 5 0 1\n   4 9 3 0 2\n   5 4 5 6 0\n   4 6 5 6 8\n   0 7 4 3 6\n   1 5 4 6 5\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 submatrices from the input matrix, and there will be no overlap between these submatrices.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 6 rows by 5 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(6/2) = 3`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor(5/2) = 2`.\n\n4. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each 2x2 submatrix, find the maximum value.\n   - The submatrices and their maximum values are as follows:\n\n   - **First Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Submatrix from rows 1-2, columns 1-2:\n       ```\n       6 5\n       4 9\n       ```\n       Max value = 9\n     - Submatrix from rows 1-2, columns 3-4:\n       ```\n       5 0\n       3 0\n       ```\n       Max value = 5\n\n   - **Second Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Submatrix from rows 3-4, columns 1-2:\n       ```\n       5 4\n       4 6\n       ```\n       Max value = 6\n     - Submatrix from rows 3-4, columns 3-4:\n       ```\n       5 6\n       5 6\n       ```\n       Max value = 6\n\n   - **Third Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Submatrix from rows 5-6, columns 1-2:\n       ```\n       0 7\n       1 5\n       ```\n       Max value = 7\n     - Submatrix from rows 5-6, columns 3-4:\n       ```\n       4 3\n       4 6\n       ```\n       Max value = 6\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix, after performing max pooling, is:\n   ```\n   9 5\n   6 6\n   7 6\n   ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n9 5\n6 6\n7 6\n>>>"
