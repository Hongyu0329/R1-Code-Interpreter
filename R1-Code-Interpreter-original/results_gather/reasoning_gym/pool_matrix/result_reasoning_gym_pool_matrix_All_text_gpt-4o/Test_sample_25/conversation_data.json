    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride equal to the kernel size, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   6 5 6 8 2 8 8\n   1 7 9 5 8 8 1\n   ```\n   This is a 2x7 matrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3. This means we will take 3x3 submatrices (or as close as possible given the matrix dimensions) and compute the average of the elements in each submatrix.\n\n3. **Calculate the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The input matrix has 2 rows and 7 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(2/3) = 0` (since the kernel size is larger than the number of rows, we cannot form a complete 3x3 submatrix vertically).\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor(7/3) = 2`.\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - Since we cannot form a complete 3x3 submatrix vertically, we will only consider horizontal pooling.\n   - For the first column of the output matrix, consider the first 3 columns of the input matrix:\n     ```\n     6 5 6\n     1 7 9\n     ```\n     The average is calculated as: (6 + 5 + 6 + 1 + 7 + 9) / 6 = 34 / 6 = 5.67.\n   - For the second column of the output matrix, consider the next 3 columns of the input matrix:\n     ```\n     8 2 8\n     5 8 8\n     ```\n     The average is calculated as: (8 + 2 + 8 + 5 + 8 + 8) / 6 = 39 / 6 = 6.50.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix, after performing average pooling, is a 1x2 matrix:\n   ```\n   5.67 6.50\n   ```\n\n6. **Format the Output Matrix**: Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<5.67 6.50>>>"
