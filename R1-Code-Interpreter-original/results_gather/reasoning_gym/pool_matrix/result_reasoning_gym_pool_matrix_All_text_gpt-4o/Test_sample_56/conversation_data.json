    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 9x5 matrix:\n   ```\n   8 0 1 4 5\n   1 0 5 0 2\n   1 4 7 9 7\n   7 6 6 3 1\n   0 8 6 0 0\n   5 7 5 3 9\n   5 3 7 3 9\n   3 8 5 0 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 submatrices from the input matrix, and there will be no overlap between these submatrices.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 9 rows by 5 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(9/2) = 4`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor(5/2) = 2`.\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**: For each 2x2 submatrix, calculate the average of its elements and place the result in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\n5. **Calculate the Averages**:\n   - For the first 2x2 block (top-left corner):\n     ```\n     8 0\n     1 0\n     ```\n     Average = (8 + 0 + 1 + 0) / 4 = 9 / 4 = 2.25\n\n   - For the second 2x2 block (top-right corner):\n     ```\n     1 4\n     5 0\n     ```\n     Average = (1 + 4 + 5 + 0) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.50\n\n   - For the third 2x2 block (second row, first column):\n     ```\n     1 4\n     7 6\n     ```\n     Average = (1 + 4 + 7 + 6) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.50\n\n   - For the fourth 2x2 block (second row, second column):\n     ```\n     7 9\n     6 3\n     ```\n     Average = (7 + 9 + 6 + 3) / 4 = 25 / 4 = 6.25\n\n   - For the fifth 2x2 block (third row, first column):\n     ```\n     0 8\n     5 7\n     ```\n     Average = (0 + 8 + 5 + 7) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5.00\n\n   - For the sixth 2x2 block (third row, second column):\n     ```\n     6 0\n     5 3\n     ```\n     Average = (6 + 0 + 5 + 3) / 4 = 14 / 4 = 3.50\n\n   - For the seventh 2x2 block (fourth row, first column):\n     ```\n     5 3\n     3 8\n     ```\n     Average = (5 + 3 + 3 + 8) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75\n\n   - For the eighth 2x2 block (fourth row, second column):\n     ```\n     7 3\n     5 0\n     ```\n     Average = (7 + 3 + 5 + 0) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75\n\n6. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix, after performing average pooling, is:\n   ```\n   2.25 2.50\n   4.50 6.25\n   5.00 3.50\n   4.75 3.75\n   ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**: Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n2.25 2.50\n4.50 6.25\n5.00 3.50\n4.75 3.75\n>>>"
