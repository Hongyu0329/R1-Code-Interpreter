    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is 10 rows by 7 columns.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - Since the kernel size is 3 and the stride is also 3, the output matrix dimensions can be calculated as follows:\n   - For rows: \\( \\text{floor}((10 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 3 \\)\n   - For columns: \\( \\text{floor}((7 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 2 \\)\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 3 rows by 2 columns.\n\n3. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - We will slide the 3x3 kernel over the input matrix with a stride of 3, calculate the average of the elements within each kernel, and place the result in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\n4. **Calculate Each Element in the Output Matrix**:\n   - **First Row, First Column**:\n     - Kernel covers: \n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       1 & 9 & 6 \\\\\n       2 & 9 & 8 \\\\\n       5 & 0 & 5 \\\\\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{1 + 9 + 6 + 2 + 9 + 8 + 5 + 0 + 5}{9} = \\frac{45}{9} = 5.00 \\)\n\n   - **First Row, Second Column**:\n     - Kernel covers:\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       5 & 4 & 3 \\\\\n       6 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n       4 & 3 & 3 \\\\\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{5 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 3}{9} = \\frac{39}{9} = 4.33 \\)\n\n   - **Second Row, First Column**:\n     - Kernel covers:\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       5 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n       5 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n       6 & 0 & 5 \\\\\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{5 + 8 + 8 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 0 + 5}{9} = \\frac{41}{9} = 4.56 \\)\n\n   - **Second Row, Second Column**:\n     - Kernel covers:\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       4 & 8 & 4 \\\\\n       9 & 6 & 8 \\\\\n       4 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{4 + 8 + 4 + 9 + 6 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 4}{9} = \\frac{47}{9} = 5.22 \\)\n\n   - **Third Row, First Column**:\n     - Kernel covers:\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       9 & 7 & 4 \\\\\n       7 & 9 & 6 \\\\\n       4 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{9 + 7 + 4 + 7 + 9 + 6 + 4 + 0 + 1}{9} = \\frac{47}{9} = 5.22 \\)\n\n   - **Third Row, Second Column**:\n     - Kernel covers:\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       9 & 7 & 3 \\\\\n       8 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n       1 & 5 & 9 \\\\\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{9 + 7 + 3 + 8 + 8 + 9 + 1 + 5 + 9}{9} = \\frac{59}{9} = 6.56 \\)\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix after performing average pooling is:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     5.00 & 4.33 \\\\\n     4.56 & 5.22 \\\\\n     5.22 & 6.56 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n5.00 4.33\n4.56 5.22\n5.22 6.56\n>>>"
