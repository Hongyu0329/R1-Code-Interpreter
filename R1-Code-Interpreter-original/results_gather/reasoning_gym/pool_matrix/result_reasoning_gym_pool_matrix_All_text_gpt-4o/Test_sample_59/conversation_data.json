    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   2 2 4 4\n   5 2 5 1\n   1 8 1 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride:**\n   The kernel size is 3, and the stride is equal to the kernel size, which is also 3. This means that the pooling regions do not overlap.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size:**\n   Since the input matrix is 3x4 and the kernel size is 3, the output matrix will be smaller. The number of pooling regions that fit into the input matrix is determined by the kernel size and stride. Here, we can only fit one 3x3 region into the input matrix.\n\n4. **Extract the Pooling Region:**\n   The only 3x3 region that fits into the input matrix is:\n   ```\n   2 2 4\n   5 2 5\n   1 8 1\n   ```\n\n5. **Calculate the Average for the Pooling Region:**\n   To perform average pooling, calculate the average of all elements in the 3x3 region:\n   - Sum of elements: 2 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 5 + 1 + 8 + 1 = 30\n   - Number of elements: 9\n   - Average: 30 / 9 = 3.33 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n6. **Construct the Output Matrix:**\n   Since there is only one pooling region, the output matrix will be 1x1 with the calculated average.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<3.33>>>\n```"
