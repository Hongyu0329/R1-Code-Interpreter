    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2 and a stride of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is a 10x3 matrix. With a kernel size of 2 and a stride of 2, the pooling operation will reduce the dimensions of the matrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The number of rows in the output matrix is calculated by dividing the number of rows in the input matrix by the kernel size. Since the input matrix has 10 rows and the kernel size is 2, the output matrix will have 10 / 2 = 5 rows.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix is calculated similarly. Since the input matrix has 3 columns and the kernel size is 2, the output matrix will have 3 / 2 = 1.5 columns. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a column, we consider only the full columns, resulting in 1 column.\n\n3. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - For each 2x2 block in the input matrix, calculate the average of the elements in that block.\n   - The stride of 2 means that each block is non-overlapping.\n\n4. **Calculate the Averages**:\n   - Block 1 (rows 1-2, column 1-2): \n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     9 & 9 \\\\\n     9 & 5 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = (9 + 9 + 9 + 5) / 4 = 32 / 4 = 8.00\n\n   - Block 2 (rows 3-4, column 1-2):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     3 & 3 \\\\\n     5 & 5 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = (3 + 3 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4.00\n\n   - Block 3 (rows 5-6, column 1-2):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     3 & 3 \\\\\n     5 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = (3 + 3 + 5 + 1) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3.00\n\n   - Block 4 (rows 7-8, column 1-2):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     4 & 2 \\\\\n     6 & 7 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = (4 + 2 + 6 + 7) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75\n\n   - Block 5 (rows 9-10, column 1-2):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     7 & 9 \\\\\n     3 & 6 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = (7 + 9 + 3 + 6) / 4 = 25 / 4 = 6.25\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix will be a 5x1 matrix with the calculated averages.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n8.00 \\\\\n4.00 \\\\\n3.00 \\\\\n4.75 \\\\\n6.25 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n8.00\n4.00\n3.00\n4.75\n6.25\n>>>"
