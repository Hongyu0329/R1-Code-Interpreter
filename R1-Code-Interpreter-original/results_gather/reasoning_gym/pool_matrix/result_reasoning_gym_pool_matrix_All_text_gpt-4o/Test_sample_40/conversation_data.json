    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   8 3 5 5\n   7 5 8 0\n   8 5 1 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 submatrices from the input matrix, and there will be no overlap between these submatrices.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 3 rows by 4 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the output matrix will have:\n     - Floor(3/2) = 1 row\n     - Floor(4/2) = 2 columns\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 1x2.\n\n4. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - Extract 2x2 submatrices and find the maximum value in each:\n     - First submatrix (top-left corner):\n       ```\n       8 3\n       7 5\n       ```\n       Maximum value is 8.\n     - Second submatrix (top-right corner):\n       ```\n       5 5\n       8 0\n       ```\n       Maximum value is 8.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix, after performing max pooling, is:\n   ```\n   8 8\n   ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```\n<<<8 8>>>\n```"
