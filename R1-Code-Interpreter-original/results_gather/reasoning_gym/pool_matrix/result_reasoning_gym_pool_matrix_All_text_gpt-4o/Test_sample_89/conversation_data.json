    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 3x5 matrix:\n   ```\n   2 5 8 4 1\n   4 3 0 2 4\n   6 3 9 4 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3. This means that the pooling operation will be applied to non-overlapping 3x3 regions of the matrix.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix has dimensions 3x5.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the output matrix will have dimensions:\n     - Rows: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{3}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\)\n     - Columns: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{5}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\)\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 1x1.\n\n4. **Apply Max Pooling**:\n   - Extract the 3x3 region from the top-left corner of the matrix:\n     ```\n     2 5 8\n     4 3 0\n     6 3 9\n     ```\n   - Find the maximum value in this region. The values are: 2, 5, 8, 4, 3, 0, 6, 3, 9. The maximum value is 9.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: Since the output matrix is 1x1, it will contain just the maximum value found, which is 9.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and formatted to two decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<9.00>>>\n```"
