    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride equal to the kernel size, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   4 0 1 5 0 3\n   1 2 7 0 3 2\n   ```\n   This is a 2x6 matrix.\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3. This means that the pooling operation will be applied to non-overlapping 3x3 regions of the matrix.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix has 2 rows and 6 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(2/3) = 0` (since the input matrix has fewer than 3 rows, no complete 3x3 region can be formed vertically).\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor(6/3) = 2`.\n\n4. **Apply Average Pooling**:\n   - Since the input matrix does not have enough rows to form a 3x3 region, we cannot perform pooling vertically. Therefore, the output matrix will have 0 rows, resulting in an empty matrix.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<>>>\n```"
