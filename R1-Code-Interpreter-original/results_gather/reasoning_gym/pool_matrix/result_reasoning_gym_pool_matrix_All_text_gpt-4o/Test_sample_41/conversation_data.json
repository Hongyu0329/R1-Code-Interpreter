    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 6x3 matrix:\n   ```\n   6 2 0\n   8 3 1\n   6 7 1\n   4 5 7\n   7 4 9\n   5 3 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3. This means that the pooling operation will be applied to non-overlapping 3x3 regions of the matrix.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 6 rows by 3 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the output matrix will have:\n     - \\( \\text{Output Rows} = \\frac{\\text{Input Rows}}{\\text{Kernel Size}} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\)\n     - \\( \\text{Output Columns} = \\frac{\\text{Input Columns}}{\\text{Kernel Size}} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\)\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 2x1.\n\n4. **Apply Max Pooling**:\n   - **First Region (Top 3x3 block)**:\n     ```\n     6 2 0\n     8 3 1\n     6 7 1\n     ```\n     - The maximum value in this block is 8.\n   \n   - **Second Region (Bottom 3x3 block)**:\n     ```\n     4 5 7\n     7 4 9\n     5 3 2\n     ```\n     - The maximum value in this block is 9.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: Based on the maximum values found in each region, the output matrix is:\n   ```\n   8\n   9\n   ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be correct to 2 decimal places. Since the elements are integers, they can be represented as floating-point numbers with two decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n8.00\n9.00\n>>>\n```"
