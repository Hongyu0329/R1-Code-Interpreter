    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 5x6 matrix:\n   ```\n   9 9 9 0 4 6\n   3 0 4 8 1 4\n   9 0 4 4 4 9\n   6 5 7 8 8 8\n   7 1 9 7 6 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 submatrices from the input matrix, and there will be no overlap between these submatrices.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 5 rows by 6 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(5/2) = 2`.\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix will be `floor(6/2) = 3`.\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 2x3.\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - For each 2x2 submatrix, calculate the average of its elements.\n\n5. **Calculate the Averages**:\n   - **First Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Submatrix 1: \n       ```\n       9 9\n       3 0\n       ```\n       Average = (9 + 9 + 3 + 0) / 4 = 21 / 4 = 5.25\n     - Submatrix 2:\n       ```\n       9 0\n       4 8\n       ```\n       Average = (9 + 0 + 4 + 8) / 4 = 21 / 4 = 5.25\n     - Submatrix 3:\n       ```\n       4 6\n       1 4\n       ```\n       Average = (4 + 6 + 1 + 4) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75\n\n   - **Second Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Submatrix 4:\n       ```\n       9 0\n       6 5\n       ```\n       Average = (9 + 0 + 6 + 5) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5.00\n     - Submatrix 5:\n       ```\n       4 4\n       7 8\n       ```\n       Average = (4 + 4 + 7 + 8) / 4 = 23 / 4 = 5.75\n     - Submatrix 6:\n       ```\n       4 9\n       8 8\n       ```\n       Average = (4 + 9 + 8 + 8) / 4 = 29 / 4 = 7.25\n\n6. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix, after performing average pooling, is:\n     ```\n     5.25 5.25 3.75\n     5.00 5.75 7.25\n     ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**: Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<\n5.25 5.25 3.75\n5.00 5.75 7.25\n>>>"
