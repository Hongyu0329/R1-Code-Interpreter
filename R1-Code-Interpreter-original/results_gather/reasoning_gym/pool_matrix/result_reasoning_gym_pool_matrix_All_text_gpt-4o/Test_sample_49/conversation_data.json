    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2 and a stride of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 10x9 matrix. However, for max pooling with a kernel size of 2, we need to consider only the parts of the matrix that can be fully covered by the kernel. This means we will only consider the first 8 rows and 8 columns, as the kernel will not fit entirely beyond these dimensions.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: With a kernel size of 2 and a stride of 2, the output matrix will have dimensions that are half of the input matrix dimensions (rounded down if necessary). Therefore, the output matrix will be 5x4.\n\n3. **Apply Max Pooling**: For each 2x2 block in the input matrix, find the maximum value and place it in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\n4. **Iterate Over the Input Matrix**: Start from the top-left corner of the input matrix and move the 2x2 kernel across the matrix with a stride of 2, both horizontally and vertically.\n\n5. **Calculate the Max Values**:\n   - For the first 2x2 block (top-left corner), the values are: [3, 1, 4, 3]. The maximum is 4.\n   - Move the kernel to the right: [8, 3, 8, 4]. The maximum is 8.\n   - Continue this process for each 2x2 block.\n\n6. **Construct the Output Matrix**: Place each maximum value in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- First row of output:\n  - Max of [3, 1, 4, 3] is 4\n  - Max of [8, 3, 8, 4] is 8\n  - Max of [1, 1, 1, 0] is 1\n  - Max of [1, 3, 5, 4] is 5\n\n- Second row of output:\n  - Max of [2, 4, 6, 3] is 6\n  - Max of [1, 3, 9, 9] is 9\n  - Max of [3, 1, 5, 5] is 5\n  - Max of [0, 9, 2, 6] is 9\n\n- Third row of output:\n  - Max of [1, 0, 2, 9] is 9\n  - Max of [3, 8, 8, 4] is 8\n  - Max of [4, 4, 6, 9] is 9\n  - Max of [6, 9, 9, 9] is 9\n\n- Fourth row of output:\n  - Max of [5, 2, 9, 2] is 9\n  - Max of [6, 0, 7, 8] is 8\n  - Max of [1, 4, 1, 0] is 4\n  - Max of [4, 2, 2, 6] is 6\n\n- Fifth row of output:\n  - Max of [5, 1, 4, 8] is 8\n  - Max of [9, 7, 1, 1] is 9\n  - Max of [0, 1, 7, 6] is 7\n  - Max of [5, 8, 6, 3] is 8\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n```\n4 8 1 5\n6 9 5 9\n9 8 9 9\n9 8 4 6\n8 9 7 8\n```\n\nTherefore, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n4 8 1 5\n6 9 5 9\n9 8 9 9\n9 8 4 6\n8 9 7 8\n>>>"
