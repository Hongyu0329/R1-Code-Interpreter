    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is 8 rows by 10 columns.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - Since the kernel size is 3 and the stride is also 3, the output matrix dimensions can be calculated as follows:\n   - For rows: \\( \\text{floor}(\\frac{8}{3}) = 2 \\)\n   - For columns: \\( \\text{floor}(\\frac{10}{3}) = 3 \\)\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 2 rows by 3 columns.\n\n3. **Apply Max Pooling**:\n   - We will slide the 3x3 kernel over the input matrix with a stride of 3, and for each position, we will take the maximum value within the 3x3 region.\n\n4. **Calculate Each Element of the Output Matrix**:\n   - **First Row, First Column**: Max of the region starting at (0,0) to (2,2):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     3 & 2 & 6 \\\\\n     7 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n     4 & 9 & 9 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Max value = 9\n\n   - **First Row, Second Column**: Max of the region starting at (0,3) to (2,5):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     7 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n     1 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n     6 & 1 & 7 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Max value = 7\n\n   - **First Row, Third Column**: Max of the region starting at (0,6) to (2,8):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     9 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     1 & 1 & 8 \\\\\n     1 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Max value = 9\n\n   - **Second Row, First Column**: Max of the region starting at (3,0) to (5,2):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & 2 & 5 \\\\\n     2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 5 & 0 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Max value = 5\n\n   - **Second Row, Second Column**: Max of the region starting at (3,3) to (5,5):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n     0 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n     4 & 5 & 5 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Max value = 5\n\n   - **Second Row, Third Column**: Max of the region starting at (3,6) to (5,8):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     8 & 1 & 3 \\\\\n     0 & 8 & 3 \\\\\n     1 & 0 & 7 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Max value = 8\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix is:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     9 & 7 & 9 \\\\\n     5 & 5 & 8 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be formatted to two decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n9.00 7.00 9.00\n5.00 5.00 8.00\n>>>"
