    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Pooling Parameters:**\n   - The input matrix is a 10x7 matrix.\n   - The kernel size is 1, which means each element in the matrix is considered individually.\n   - The stride is equal to the kernel size, which is 1, meaning we move one element at a time.\n\n2. **Max Pooling with Kernel Size 1:**\n   - Since the kernel size is 1, each element in the matrix is its own pooling region.\n   - Therefore, the max pooling operation with a kernel size of 1 will result in the same matrix as the input matrix because each element is the maximum of its own 1x1 region.\n\n3. **Output the Result:**\n   - The output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n   - Ensure the output is formatted correctly with elements rounded to 2 decimal places, although in this case, the elements are integers.\n\nGiven these steps, the output matrix is:\n\n```\n0 3 1 4 0 0 6\n6 2 0 6 6 0 7\n8 2 2 5 2 5 9\n2 6 2 1 5 6 0\n5 2 6 6 5 6 2\n2 5 4 7 3 2 0\n3 3 6 0 2 1 6\n9 3 9 1 7 4 2\n1 6 3 5 0 7 4\n2 1 9 3 0 3 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n0 3 1 4 0 0 6\n6 2 0 6 6 0 7\n8 2 2 5 2 5 9\n2 6 2 1 5 6 0\n5 2 6 6 5 6 2\n2 5 4 7 3 2 0\n3 3 6 0 2 1 6\n9 3 9 1 7 4 2\n1 6 3 5 0 7 4\n2 1 9 3 0 3 0\n>>>"
