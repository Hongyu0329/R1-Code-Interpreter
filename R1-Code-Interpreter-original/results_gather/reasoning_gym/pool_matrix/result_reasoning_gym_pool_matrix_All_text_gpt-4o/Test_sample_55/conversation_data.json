    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride equal to the kernel size, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Parameters:**\n   - The input matrix is:\n     ```\n     6 6 6 3 0\n     9 0 8 3 3\n     8 3 8 7 5\n     6 2 9 3 8\n     ```\n   - Kernel size = 3\n   - Stride = 3\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size:**\n   - The input matrix is 4x5.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the output matrix will be smaller.\n   - The number of pooling regions along the rows is calculated as: floor((4 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 1\n   - The number of pooling regions along the columns is calculated as: floor((5 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 1\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 1x1.\n\n3. **Perform Average Pooling:**\n   - We will apply the 3x3 kernel to the top-left corner of the matrix, as it is the only region that fits given the stride and kernel size.\n   - The 3x3 region from the input matrix is:\n     ```\n     6 6 6\n     9 0 8\n     8 3 8\n     ```\n   - Calculate the average of these values:\n     - Sum = 6 + 6 + 6 + 9 + 0 + 8 + 8 + 3 + 8 = 54\n     - Average = 54 / 9 = 6.00\n\n4. **Construct the Output Matrix:**\n   - Since the output matrix is 1x1, it will contain only the average value calculated above.\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<6.00>>>\n```"
