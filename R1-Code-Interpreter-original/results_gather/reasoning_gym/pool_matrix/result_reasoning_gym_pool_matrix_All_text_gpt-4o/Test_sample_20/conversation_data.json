    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is given as:\n   ```\n   5 7\n   6 7\n   0 5\n   3 3\n   1 3\n   1 5\n   ```\n   This is a 6x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3. This means that the pooling operation will be applied to non-overlapping 3x2 regions of the matrix.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix has 6 rows and 2 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the number of rows in the output matrix will be `floor(6/3) = 2`.\n   - The number of columns remains the same as the input matrix, which is 2.\n\n4. **Apply Max Pooling**:\n   - **First Region (Rows 1-3)**:\n     ```\n     5 7\n     6 7\n     0 5\n     ```\n     - For the first column: max(5, 6, 0) = 6\n     - For the second column: max(7, 7, 5) = 7\n     - Result for this region: [6, 7]\n\n   - **Second Region (Rows 4-6)**:\n     ```\n     3 3\n     1 3\n     1 5\n     ```\n     - For the first column: max(3, 1, 1) = 3\n     - For the second column: max(3, 3, 5) = 5\n     - Result for this region: [3, 5]\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**: Combine the results from each region to form the output matrix:\n   ```\n   6 7\n   3 5\n   ```\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be correct to 2 decimal places. However, since all elements are integers, they will be represented as such.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n6 7\n3 5\n>>>\n```"
