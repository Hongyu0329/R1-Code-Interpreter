    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride equal to the kernel size, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 9x4 matrix:\n   ```\n   3 2 2 0\n   2 1 7 5\n   3 7 0 9\n   3 4 6 2\n   3 5 8 2\n   6 3 2 9\n   1 1 6 5\n   0 2 6 2\n   2 9 4 5\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The kernel size is 3, and the stride is also 3.\n   - The input matrix has dimensions 9x4.\n   - The output matrix will have dimensions calculated as follows:\n     - For rows: \\( \\text{floor}((9 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 3 \\)\n     - For columns: \\( \\text{floor}((4 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 2 \\)\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 3x2.\n\n3. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - We will slide the 3x3 kernel over the input matrix with a stride of 3, and calculate the average of the elements within each kernel window.\n\n4. **Calculate Each Element of the Output Matrix**:\n   - **First Row, First Column**:\n     - Kernel window:\n       ```\n       3 2 2\n       2 1 7\n       3 7 0\n       ```\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 7 + 3 + 7 + 0}{9} = \\frac{27}{9} = 3.00 \\)\n\n   - **First Row, Second Column**:\n     - Kernel window:\n       ```\n       0\n       5\n       9\n       ```\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{0 + 5 + 9}{3} = \\frac{14}{3} = 4.67 \\)\n\n   - **Second Row, First Column**:\n     - Kernel window:\n       ```\n       3 4 6\n       3 5 8\n       6 3 2\n       ```\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{3 + 4 + 6 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 6 + 3 + 2}{9} = \\frac{40}{9} = 4.44 \\)\n\n   - **Second Row, Second Column**:\n     - Kernel window:\n       ```\n       2\n       2\n       9\n       ```\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{2 + 2 + 9}{3} = \\frac{13}{3} = 4.33 \\)\n\n   - **Third Row, First Column**:\n     - Kernel window:\n       ```\n       1 1 6\n       0 2 6\n       2 9 4\n       ```\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{1 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 9 + 4}{9} = \\frac{31}{9} = 3.44 \\)\n\n   - **Third Row, Second Column**:\n     - Kernel window:\n       ```\n       5\n       2\n       5\n       ```\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{5 + 2 + 5}{3} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4.00 \\)\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix is:\n     ```\n     3.00 4.67\n     4.44 4.33\n     3.44 4.00\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output Matrix**:\n   - Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```\n<<<\n3.00 4.67\n4.44 4.33\n3.44 4.00\n>>>\n```"
