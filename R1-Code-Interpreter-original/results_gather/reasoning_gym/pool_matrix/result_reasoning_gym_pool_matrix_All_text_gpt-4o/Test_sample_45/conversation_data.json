    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Pooling Operation**: Average pooling with a kernel size of 1 means that each element in the input matrix is considered individually. Since the kernel size is 1, the average of each element is the element itself.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is a 7x7 matrix. With a kernel size of 1 and stride equal to the kernel size, the output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix, which is 7x7.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average**: For each element in the matrix, the average is simply the element itself because the kernel size is 1.\n\n4. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be formatted in the same way as the input matrix, with each element rounded to 2 decimal places. However, since the elements are integers, they will be represented as floating-point numbers with two decimal places.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\nInput Matrix:\n7 4 4 5 8 0 9\n7 5 3 0 6 4 6\n4 5 7 3 1 1 9\n6 4 5 8 1 8 1\n6 3 4 3 9 0 8\n9 5 3 2 4 4 5\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix, but each element will be represented as a floating-point number with two decimal places:\n\n```\nOutput Matrix:\n7.00 4.00 4.00 5.00 8.00 0.00 9.00\n7.00 5.00 3.00 0.00 6.00 4.00 6.00\n4.00 5.00 7.00 3.00 1.00 1.00 9.00\n6.00 4.00 5.00 8.00 1.00 8.00 1.00\n6.00 3.00 4.00 3.00 9.00 0.00 8.00\n9.00 5.00 3.00 2.00 4.00 4.00 5.00\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n7.00 4.00 4.00 5.00 8.00 0.00 9.00\n7.00 5.00 3.00 0.00 6.00 4.00 6.00\n4.00 5.00 7.00 3.00 1.00 1.00 9.00\n6.00 4.00 5.00 8.00 1.00 8.00 1.00\n6.00 3.00 4.00 3.00 9.00 0.00 8.00\n9.00 5.00 3.00 2.00 4.00 4.00 5.00\n>>>"
