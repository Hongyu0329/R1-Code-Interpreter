    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix and Pooling Parameters:**\n   - The input matrix is a 10x4 matrix.\n   - The kernel size is 1, which means each element in the matrix is considered individually.\n   - The stride is equal to the kernel size, which is 1, meaning we move one element at a time.\n\n2. **Max Pooling with Kernel Size of 1:**\n   - Since the kernel size is 1, each element in the matrix is its own pooling region.\n   - Therefore, the max pooling operation with a kernel size of 1 will result in the same matrix as the input matrix because each element is the maximum of its own 1x1 region.\n\n3. **Output the Result:**\n   - The output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n   - Ensure that the output is formatted correctly, with each element rounded to two decimal places.\n\nGiven these steps, the output matrix after performing max pooling with a kernel size of 1 is:\n\n<<<\n2.00 0.00 5.00 3.00\n2.00 6.00 9.00 8.00\n3.00 6.00 0.00 8.00\n7.00 0.00 2.00 7.00\n9.00 1.00 8.00 7.00\n0.00 8.00 8.00 8.00\n3.00 6.00 2.00 7.00\n2.00 5.00 0.00 1.00\n0.00 1.00 7.00 3.00\n1.00 2.00 4.00 2.00\n>>>"
