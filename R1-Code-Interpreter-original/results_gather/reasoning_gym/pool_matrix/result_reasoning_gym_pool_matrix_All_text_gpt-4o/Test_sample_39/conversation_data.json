    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is 7 rows by 10 columns.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - Since the kernel size is 3 and the stride is also 3, the output matrix dimensions can be calculated as follows:\n   - For rows: \\( \\text{floor}(\\frac{7}{3}) = 2 \\)\n   - For columns: \\( \\text{floor}(\\frac{10}{3}) = 3 \\)\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 2 rows by 3 columns.\n\n3. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - We will slide the 3x3 kernel over the input matrix with a stride of 3, calculate the average of the elements within each kernel, and place the result in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n\n4. **Calculate Each Element in the Output Matrix**:\n   - **First Row, First Column**:\n     - Kernel covers: \n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       7 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n       0 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n       6 & 2 & 6 \\\\\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{7 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 6 + 2 + 6}{9} = \\frac{45}{9} = 5.00 \\)\n\n   - **First Row, Second Column**:\n     - Kernel covers:\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n       8 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n       7 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{2 + 1 + 0 + 8 + 1 + 0 + 7 + 2 + 1}{9} = \\frac{22}{9} \\approx 2.44 \\)\n\n   - **First Row, Third Column**:\n     - Kernel covers:\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       6 & 1 & 3 \\\\\n       5 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n       6 & 6 & 3 \\\\\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{6 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 0 + 2 + 6 + 6 + 3}{9} = \\frac{32}{9} \\approx 3.56 \\)\n\n   - **Second Row, First Column**:\n     - Kernel covers:\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n       2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n       2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 0}{9} = \\frac{12}{9} \\approx 1.33 \\)\n\n   - **Second Row, Second Column**:\n     - Kernel covers:\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       8 & 0 & 7 \\\\\n       9 & 6 & 0 \\\\\n       5 & 7 & 3 \\\\\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{8 + 0 + 7 + 9 + 6 + 0 + 5 + 7 + 3}{9} = \\frac{45}{9} = 5.00 \\)\n\n   - **Second Row, Third Column**:\n     - Kernel covers:\n       \\[\n       \\begin{bmatrix}\n       8 & 0 & 5 \\\\\n       3 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n       3 & 3 & 3 \\\\\n       \\end{bmatrix}\n       \\]\n     - Average: \\( \\frac{8 + 0 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3}{9} = \\frac{30}{9} \\approx 3.33 \\)\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix after performing average pooling is:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     5.00 & 2.44 & 3.56 \\\\\n     1.33 & 5.00 & 3.33 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n5.00 2.44 3.56\n1.33 5.00 3.33\n>>>"
