    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2 and a stride of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is an 8x6 matrix:\n   ```\n   5 8 5 7 8 6\n   6 1 8 5 1 8\n   9 1 7 6 8 3\n   8 4 0 2 3 1\n   6 5 0 6 3 6\n   1 7 7 2 4 5\n   8 7 2 9 0 4\n   2 0 4 4 8 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2x2, and the stride is 2. This means we will take non-overlapping 2x2 sections of the matrix and compute the average of each section.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: \n   - The input matrix is 8 rows by 6 columns.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the output matrix will have:\n     - \\( \\text{rows} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\)\n     - \\( \\text{columns} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\)\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 4x3.\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - For each 2x2 section, calculate the average and round to 2 decimal places.\n\n   Let's calculate the averages for each 2x2 section:\n\n   - **First Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Section 1: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 8 \\\\ 6 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\) \n       - Average: \\((5 + 8 + 6 + 1) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5.00\\)\n     - Section 2: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 7 \\\\ 8 & 5 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n       - Average: \\((5 + 7 + 8 + 5) / 4 = 25 / 4 = 6.25\\)\n     - Section 3: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 8 & 6 \\\\ 1 & 8 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n       - Average: \\((8 + 6 + 1 + 8) / 4 = 23 / 4 = 5.75\\)\n\n   - **Second Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Section 1: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 9 & 1 \\\\ 8 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n       - Average: \\((9 + 1 + 8 + 4) / 4 = 22 / 4 = 5.50\\)\n     - Section 2: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 7 & 6 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n       - Average: \\((7 + 6 + 0 + 2) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75\\)\n     - Section 3: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 8 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n       - Average: \\((8 + 3 + 3 + 1) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75\\)\n\n   - **Third Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Section 1: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 6 & 5 \\\\ 1 & 7 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n       - Average: \\((6 + 5 + 1 + 7) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75\\)\n     - Section 2: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n       - Average: \\((0 + 6 + 7 + 2) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75\\)\n     - Section 3: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 6 \\\\ 4 & 5 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n       - Average: \\((3 + 6 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.50\\)\n\n   - **Fourth Row of Output Matrix**:\n     - Section 1: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 8 & 7 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n       - Average: \\((8 + 7 + 2 + 0) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25\\)\n     - Section 2: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 9 \\\\ 4 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n       - Average: \\((2 + 9 + 4 + 4) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75\\)\n     - Section 3: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4 \\\\ 8 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n       - Average: \\((0 + 4 + 8 + 4) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4.00\\)\n\n5. **Output the Result**: The resulting matrix after average pooling is:\n   ```\n   5.00 6.25 5.75\n   5.50 3.75 3.75\n   4.75 3.75 4.50\n   4.25 4.75 4.00\n   ```\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n5.00 6.25 5.75\n5.50 3.75 3.75\n4.75 3.75 4.50\n4.25 4.75 4.00\n>>>"
