    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 4x9 matrix:\n   ```\n   8 8 3 7 7 0 4 2 5\n   2 2 2 1 0 8 4 0 9\n   6 2 4 1 5 3 4 4 3\n   7 1 1 7 7 0 2 9 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 submatrices from the input matrix and move the kernel by 2 steps both horizontally and vertically.\n\n3. **Calculate the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The input matrix has dimensions 4x9.\n   - With a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2, the output matrix will have dimensions:\n     - Rows: \\( \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\)\n     - Columns: \\( \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \\), but since we can't have half a column, we take the floor value, which is 4.\n\n4. **Perform Average Pooling**:\n   - For each 2x2 submatrix, calculate the average of its elements.\n   - Move the kernel by 2 steps to the right until the end of the row, then move down by 2 steps and repeat.\n\n5. **Calculate Averages for Each 2x2 Submatrix**:\n   - Submatrix 1 (top-left): \n     ```\n     8 8\n     2 2\n     ```\n     Average = (8 + 8 + 2 + 2) / 4 = 5.00\n\n   - Submatrix 2:\n     ```\n     3 7\n     2 1\n     ```\n     Average = (3 + 7 + 2 + 1) / 4 = 3.25\n\n   - Submatrix 3:\n     ```\n     7 0\n     0 8\n     ```\n     Average = (7 + 0 + 0 + 8) / 4 = 3.75\n\n   - Submatrix 4:\n     ```\n     4 2\n     4 0\n     ```\n     Average = (4 + 2 + 4 + 0) / 4 = 2.50\n\n   - Submatrix 5 (second row, first column):\n     ```\n     6 2\n     7 1\n     ```\n     Average = (6 + 2 + 7 + 1) / 4 = 4.00\n\n   - Submatrix 6:\n     ```\n     4 1\n     1 7\n     ```\n     Average = (4 + 1 + 1 + 7) / 4 = 3.25\n\n   - Submatrix 7:\n     ```\n     5 3\n     7 0\n     ```\n     Average = (5 + 3 + 7 + 0) / 4 = 3.75\n\n   - Submatrix 8:\n     ```\n     4 4\n     2 9\n     ```\n     Average = (4 + 4 + 2 + 9) / 4 = 4.75\n\n6. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix is a 2x4 matrix:\n   ```\n   5.00 3.25 3.75 2.50\n   4.00 3.25 3.75 4.75\n   ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**: Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n<<<\n5.00 3.25 3.75 2.50\n4.00 3.25 3.75 4.75\n>>>"
