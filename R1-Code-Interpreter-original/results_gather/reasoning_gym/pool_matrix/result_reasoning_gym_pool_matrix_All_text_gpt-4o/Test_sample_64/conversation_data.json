    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is 7x7.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - Since the kernel size is 3 and the stride is also 3, the output matrix dimensions can be calculated as follows:\n   - The number of rows in the output matrix = floor((7 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 2\n   - The number of columns in the output matrix = floor((7 - 3) / 3) + 1 = 2\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 2x2.\n\n3. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - Divide the input matrix into non-overlapping 3x3 regions.\n   - For each region, find the maximum value.\n\n4. **Calculate the Max Values for Each Region**:\n   - **Region 1 (Top-left 3x3 sub-matrix)**:\n     ```\n     4 6 4\n     6 9 2\n     1 7 1\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 9\n\n   - **Region 2 (Top-right 3x3 sub-matrix)**:\n     ```\n     1 2 6\n     5 1 2\n     4 8 4\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 8\n\n   - **Region 3 (Bottom-left 3x3 sub-matrix)**:\n     ```\n     8 8 9\n     8 5 5\n     9 5 3\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 9\n\n   - **Region 4 (Bottom-right 3x3 sub-matrix)**:\n     ```\n     1 7 4\n     6 4 2\n     4 2 9\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 9\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix is constructed using the maximum values from each region:\n     ```\n     9 8\n     9 9\n     ```\n\n6. **Format the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be formatted to two decimal places.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n9.00 8.00\n9.00 9.00\n>>>\n```"
