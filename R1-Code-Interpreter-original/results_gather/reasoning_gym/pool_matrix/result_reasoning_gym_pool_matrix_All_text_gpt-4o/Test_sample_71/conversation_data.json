    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The input matrix is a 9x5 matrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - Since the kernel size is 3 and the stride is also 3, the output matrix dimensions can be calculated as follows:\n   - For the rows: \\((9 - 3) / 3 + 1 = 3\\)\n   - For the columns: \\((5 - 3) / 3 + 1 = 1\\)\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 3x1.\n\n3. **Apply Average Pooling**:\n   - We will slide the 3x3 kernel over the input matrix with a stride of 3, and compute the average of the elements within each kernel window.\n\n4. **Calculate the Averages**:\n   - **First Window (Top-left 3x3 sub-matrix)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     7 & 9 & 3 \\\\\n     1 & 5 & 7 \\\\\n     6 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\((7 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 1 + 4) / 9 = 43 / 9 \\approx 4.78\\)\n\n   - **Second Window (Middle 3x3 sub-matrix)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     4 & 5 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 3 & 5 \\\\\n     7 & 6 & 7 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\((4 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 7) / 9 = 37 / 9 \\approx 4.11\\)\n\n   - **Third Window (Bottom 3x3 sub-matrix)**:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     8 & 3 & 5 \\\\\n     0 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n     9 & 5 & 5 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Average = \\((8 + 3 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 5 + 5) / 9 = 40 / 9 \\approx 4.44\\)\n\n5. **Construct the Output Matrix**:\n   - The output matrix will be:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     4.78 \\\\\n     4.11 \\\\\n     4.44 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n4.78\n4.11\n4.44\n>>>"
