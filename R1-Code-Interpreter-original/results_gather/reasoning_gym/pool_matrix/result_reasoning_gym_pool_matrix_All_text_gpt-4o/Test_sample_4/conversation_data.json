    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 7x2 matrix:\n   ```\n   5 2\n   8 1\n   9 5\n   7 6\n   4 0\n   6 6\n   6 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 1, and the stride is also 1. This means that each element in the input matrix will be considered individually, and there will be no reduction in the size of the matrix.\n\n3. **Max Pooling Operation**: Since the kernel size is 1, max pooling will simply take the maximum value of each 1x1 region, which is the value itself. Therefore, the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n\n4. **Output Matrix**: The output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix, which is 7x2. Each element will be the maximum value of the corresponding 1x1 region from the input matrix.\n\n5. **Formatting the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be formatted to two decimal places.\n\nGiven these steps, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n5.00 2.00\n8.00 1.00\n9.00 5.00\n7.00 6.00\n4.00 0.00\n6.00 6.00\n6.00 1.00\n>>>"
