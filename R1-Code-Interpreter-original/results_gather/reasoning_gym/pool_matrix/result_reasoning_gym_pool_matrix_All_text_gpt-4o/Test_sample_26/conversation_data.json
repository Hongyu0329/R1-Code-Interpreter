    "To perform average pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 3 and a stride equal to the kernel size, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   3 0 7 9 5\n   3 4 9 1 5\n   0 6 4 4 2\n   0 3 3 4 8\n   1 1 6 0 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine the Output Matrix Size:**\n   - The input matrix is 5x5.\n   - With a kernel size of 3 and stride of 3, the output matrix will be smaller.\n   - The number of pooling regions along each dimension is calculated as:\n     - Rows: (5 - 3) / 3 + 1 = 1\n     - Columns: (5 - 3) / 3 + 1 = 1\n   - Therefore, the output matrix will be 2x2.\n\n3. **Perform Average Pooling:**\n   - For each 3x3 region, calculate the average of the elements.\n\n   **Region 1 (Top-left 3x3 sub-matrix):**\n   ```\n   3 0 7\n   3 4 9\n   0 6 4\n   ```\n   - Sum = 3 + 0 + 7 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 0 + 6 + 4 = 36\n   - Average = 36 / 9 = 4.00\n\n   **Region 2 (Top-right 3x3 sub-matrix):**\n   ```\n   9 5\n   1 5\n   4 2\n   ```\n   - Sum = 9 + 5 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 26\n   - Average = 26 / 9 = 2.89\n\n   **Region 3 (Bottom-left 3x3 sub-matrix):**\n   ```\n   0 3 3\n   1 1 6\n   ```\n   - Sum = 0 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 6 = 14\n   - Average = 14 / 9 = 1.56\n\n   **Region 4 (Bottom-right 3x3 sub-matrix):**\n   ```\n   4 8\n   0 3\n   ```\n   - Sum = 4 + 8 + 0 + 3 = 15\n   - Average = 15 / 9 = 1.67\n\n4. **Construct the Output Matrix:**\n   - The output matrix, after performing average pooling, is:\n   ```\n   4.00 2.89\n   1.56 1.67\n   ```\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   - Enclose the output matrix within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n<<<\n4.00 2.89\n1.56 1.67\n>>>"
