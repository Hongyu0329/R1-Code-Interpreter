    "To perform max pooling on the given matrix with a kernel size of 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix**: The input matrix is a 10x2 matrix:\n   ```\n   5 4\n   0 2\n   9 7\n   6 4\n   9 7\n   1 8\n   2 0\n   5 6\n   1 9\n   5 5\n   ```\n\n2. **Kernel Size and Stride**: The kernel size is 2, and the stride is also 2. This means we will take 2x2 blocks from the matrix and move 2 steps down after each pooling operation.\n\n3. **Determine the Output Matrix Size**: Since the input matrix has 10 rows and the kernel size is 2 with a stride of 2, the output matrix will have 10/2 = 5 rows. The number of columns remains the same, which is 2.\n\n4. **Perform Max Pooling**:\n   - For each 2x2 block, find the maximum value.\n   - The blocks are taken from the matrix as follows:\n     - Block 1: Rows 1-2, Columns 1-2\n     - Block 2: Rows 3-4, Columns 1-2\n     - Block 3: Rows 5-6, Columns 1-2\n     - Block 4: Rows 7-8, Columns 1-2\n     - Block 5: Rows 9-10, Columns 1-2\n\n5. **Calculate the Max for Each Block**:\n   - Block 1: \n     ```\n     5 4\n     0 2\n     ```\n     Max values: 5 (from 5, 0) and 4 (from 4, 2)\n   - Block 2:\n     ```\n     9 7\n     6 4\n     ```\n     Max values: 9 (from 9, 6) and 7 (from 7, 4)\n   - Block 3:\n     ```\n     9 7\n     1 8\n     ```\n     Max values: 9 (from 9, 1) and 8 (from 7, 8)\n   - Block 4:\n     ```\n     2 0\n     5 6\n     ```\n     Max values: 5 (from 2, 5) and 6 (from 0, 6)\n   - Block 5:\n     ```\n     1 9\n     5 5\n     ```\n     Max values: 5 (from 1, 5) and 9 (from 9, 5)\n\n6. **Construct the Output Matrix**: The output matrix is constructed from the max values of each block:\n   ```\n   5 4\n   9 7\n   9 8\n   5 6\n   5 9\n   ```\n\n7. **Format the Output**: The output matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and each element should be correct to 2 decimal places. However, since all elements are integers, they can be represented as such.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n5 4\n9 7\n9 8\n5 6\n5 9\n>>>\n```"
