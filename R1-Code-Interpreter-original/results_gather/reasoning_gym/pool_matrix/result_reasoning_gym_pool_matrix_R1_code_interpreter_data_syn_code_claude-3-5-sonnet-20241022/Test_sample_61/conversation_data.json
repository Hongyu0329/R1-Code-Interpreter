    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For average pooling with kernel size 1, each element in the output matrix will be the average of values within a 1x1 window.\n2. Since kernel size equals stride (no overlap), and kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same size as the input matrix.\n3. With kernel size 1, each element will essentially remain the same as it's averaging only itself.\n4. We need to format the output to 2 decimal places.\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 4, 8, 1, 5, 0, 4],\n    [4, 9, 3, 5, 1, 1, 8],\n    [7, 0, 8, 9, 7, 5, 9],\n    [1, 2, 0, 1, 5, 6, 3],\n    [2, 1, 7, 1, 1, 4, 5],\n    [8, 1, 1, 8, 7, 2, 5],\n    [8, 2, 3, 6, 4, 7, 9],\n    [3, 8, 5, 2, 7, 9, 0],\n    [7, 2, 3, 5, 3, 0, 8]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, average pooling will keep the same values\n# Just format to 2 decimal places\nresult = []\nfor row in matrix:\n    formatted_row = [f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row]\n    result.append(\" \".join(formatted_row))\n\nprint(\"\\n\".join(result))\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix, just formatted to show 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<5.00 4.00 8.00 1.00 5.00 0.00 4.00\n4.00 9.00 3.00 5.00 1.00 1.00 8.00\n7.00 0.00 8.00 9.00 7.00 5.00 9.00\n1.00 2.00 0.00 1.00 5.00 6.00 3.00\n2.00 1.00 7.00 1.00 1.00 4.00 5.00\n8.00 1.00 1.00 8.00 7.00 2.00 5.00\n8.00 2.00 3.00 6.00 4.00 7.00 9.00\n3.00 8.00 5.00 2.00 7.00 9.00 0.00\n7.00 2.00 3.00 5.00 3.00 0.00 8.00>>>",
    "Based on the code execution output, we have successfully performed average pooling with kernel size 1 on the input matrix. Since the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix is simply the average of itself (which means it remains the same value), formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\nThe output matches our expectations exactly.
