    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For average pooling with kernel size 1, each element in the output matrix will be the average of a 1x1 region in the input matrix.\n2. Since kernel size equals stride (no overlap), and kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same size as the input matrix.\n3. With kernel size 1, each element will essentially remain the same as it's averaging only itself.\n4. We need to format the output to 2 decimal places.\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 3, 9, 8, 9, 8, 2, 4],\n    [5, 4, 1, 7, 3, 7, 1, 1],\n    [0, 6, 4, 7, 2, 0, 8, 8],\n    [4, 9, 7, 5, 4, 9, 1, 9],\n    [0, 5, 9, 3, 3, 6, 2, 5],\n    [0, 5, 1, 2, 1, 9, 1, 3],\n    [8, 8, 9, 2, 9, 8, 0, 7],\n    [3, 2, 0, 6, 0, 2, 3, 2]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, average pooling will keep the same values\n# but we need to format them to 2 decimal places\nresult = []\nfor row in matrix:\n    formatted_row = [f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row]\n    result_row = \" \".join(formatted_row)\n    result.append(result_row)\n\nprint(\"\\n\".join(result))\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix, just formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<1.00 3.00 9.00 8.00 9.00 8.00 2.00 4.00\n5.00 4.00 1.00 7.00 3.00 7.00 1.00 1.00\n0.00 6.00 4.00 7.00 2.00 0.00 8.00 8.00\n4.00 9.00 7.00 5.00 4.00 9.00 1.00 9.00\n0.00 5.00 9.00 3.00 3.00 6.00 2.00 5.00\n0.00 5.00 1.00 2.00 1.00 9.00 1.00 3.00\n8.00 8.00 9.00 2.00 9.00 8.00 0.00 7.00\n3.00 2.00 0.00 6.00 0.00 2.00 3.00 2.00>>>",
    "Based on the code execution output, we have successfully performed average pooling with kernel size 1 on the input matrix. The output matches our expectations because:\n\n1. With kernel size 1, each element is averaged with itself only, so the values remain the same\n2. All numbers are formatted to 2 decimal places as required\n3. The matrix dimensions remain unchanged (8x8) since kernel size is 1\n4. The output maintains the proper spacing and format\n\nThe output is correct and matches the required format.
