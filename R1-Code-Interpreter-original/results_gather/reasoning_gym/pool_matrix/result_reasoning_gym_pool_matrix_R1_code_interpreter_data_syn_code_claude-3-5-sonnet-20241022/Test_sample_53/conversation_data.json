    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For average pooling with kernel size 2:\n   - We need to divide the matrix into 2x2 non-overlapping regions\n   - For each region, calculate the average of all elements\n   - The output matrix will be smaller than the input matrix\n2. Given a 5x3 input matrix, with kernel size 2:\n   - Output matrix will be 2x1 for rows (⌊5/2⌋) and 1 for columns (⌊3/2⌋)\n   - Need to process each 2x2 region and calculate averages\n3. Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Implement average pooling\n   - Format output to 2 decimal places\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 4, 3],\n    [4, 3, 5],\n    [1, 8, 3],\n    [7, 6, 6],\n    [0, 7, 9]\n]\n\nkernel_size = 2\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Calculate output dimensions\nout_rows = rows // kernel_size\nout_cols = cols // kernel_size\n\n# Perform average pooling\nresult = []\nfor i in range(0, rows - kernel_size + 1, kernel_size):\n    row = []\n    for j in range(0, cols - kernel_size + 1, kernel_size):\n        # Calculate average for current window\n        window_sum = 0\n        for ki in range(kernel_size):\n            for kj in range(kernel_size):\n                window_sum += matrix[i + ki][j + kj]\n        average = window_sum / (kernel_size * kernel_size)\n        row.append(f\"{average:.2f}\")\n    if row:\n        result.append(row)\n\n# Format and print result\noutput = \"\\n\".join([\" \".join(row) for row in result])\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nNow let's analyze what the code will do:\n1. For the first 2x2 region (top-left): (0 + 4 + 4 + 3) / 4 = 2.75\n2. For the second 2x2 region (bottom-left): (1 + 8 + 7 + 6) / 4 = 5.50\n\nThe output will be a 2x1 matrix with these averages.\n\nBased on the code execution:\n\n<<<2.75\n5.50>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and provided the expected output. Let me explain the result:\n\n1. The input 5x3 matrix was:\n```\n0 4 3\n4 3 5\n1 8 3\n7 6 6\n0 7 9\n```\n\n2. With a kernel size of 2, we divided it into non-overlapping 2x2 regions:\n   - First region (top-left):\n     ```\n     0 4\n     4 3\n     ```\n     Average = (0 + 4 + 4 + 3) / 4 = 2.75\n\n   - Second region (bottom-left):\n     ```\n     1 8\n     7 6\n     ```\n     Average = (1 + 8 + 7 + 6) / 4 = 5.50\n\n3. Note that:\n   - The rightmost column (3, 5, 3, 6, 9) was not used because we can't form complete 2x2 regions with it\n   - The bottom row (0, 7, 9) was not used for the same reason\n   - This is expected behavior when stride equals kernel size\n\nThe output matrix is correct and formatted as required:\n<<<2.75\n5.50>>>"
