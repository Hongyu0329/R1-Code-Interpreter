    "Let me help you solve this pooling problem.\n\nFor pooling with kernel size 1, the output matrix will be the same size as the input matrix since we're essentially applying the operation to each individual element. With average pooling and kernel size 1, each element will be averaged with itself, meaning the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\nLet's write a Python code to handle this and format the output properly:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 7, 8, 7, 0, 0, 8, 3, 4],\n    [8, 4, 0, 5, 0, 6, 2, 4, 7],\n    [5, 0, 9, 9, 5, 9, 0, 4, 6],\n    [4, 2, 6, 7, 0, 8, 2, 7, 8],\n    [0, 6, 4, 1, 9, 4, 9, 4, 5],\n    [1, 5, 3, 7, 9, 3, 9, 5, 2],\n    [5, 0, 3, 7, 2, 9, 7, 5, 5],\n    [4, 4, 6, 5, 9, 9, 2, 8, 3],\n    [4, 7, 2, 4, 8, 1, 9, 7, 9]\n]\n\nkernel_size = 1\n\n# Function to perform average pooling\ndef average_pooling(matrix, kernel_size):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    result = []\n    \n    for i in range(0, rows, kernel_size):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(0, cols, kernel_size):\n            # For kernel size 1, just take the element itself\n            pool_sum = matrix[i][j]\n            pool_avg = pool_sum / (kernel_size * kernel_size)\n            row.append(f\"{pool_avg:.2f}\")\n        result.append(row)\n    \n    # Print in the required format\n    print(\"\\n\".join([\" \".join(row) for row in result]))\n\naverage_pooling(matrix, kernel_size)\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element will be averaged with itself, resulting in the same matrix but with all numbers formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<2.00 7.00 8.00 7.00 0.00 0.00 8.00 3.00 4.00\n8.00 4.00 0.00 5.00 0.00 6.00 2.00 4.00 7.00\n5.00 0.00 9.00 9.00 5.00 9.00 0.00 4.00 6.00\n4.00 2.00 6.00 7.00 0.00 8.00 2.00 7.00 8.00\n0.00 6.00 4.00 1.00 9.00 4.00 9.00 4.00 5.00\n1.00 5.00 3.00 7.00 9.00 3.00 9.00 5.00 2.00\n5.00 0.00 3.00 7.00 2.00 9.00 7.00 5.00 5.00\n4.00 4.00 6.00 5.00 9.00 9.00 2.00 8.00 3.00\n4.00 7.00 2.00 4.00 8.00 1.00 9.00 7.00 9.00>>>",
