    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 1, we actually get the same matrix as input since:\n   - Each element is considered its own region\n   - The stride equals kernel size (1), so we move one position at a time\n   - We take the maximum value in each 1x1 region, which is just the element itself\n\n2. Let's write a Python code to handle this systematically:\n   - Convert the input into a matrix\n   - Implement max pooling function\n   - Format the output correctly\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [2, 2, 6, 1, 3, 9],\n    [6, 1, 0, 1, 9, 0]\n])\n\ndef max_pooling(matrix, kernel_size):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    result_rows = rows // kernel_size\n    result_cols = cols // kernel_size\n    \n    result = np.zeros((result_rows, result_cols))\n    \n    for i in range(result_rows):\n        for j in range(result_cols):\n            window = matrix[\n                i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size,\n                j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size\n            ]\n            result[i,j] = np.max(window)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Perform max pooling\nresult = max_pooling(matrix, 1)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in result:\n    output += \" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be exactly the same as the input matrix, just formatted with 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<2.00 2.00 6.00 1.00 3.00 9.00\n6.00 1.00 0.00 1.00 9.00 0.00>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors. The output matches exactly what we expected:\n- The matrix dimensions remained the same (2×6) because we used a kernel size of 1\n- Each element is formatted to 2 decimal places\n- The values are unchanged from the input matrix since a 1×1 max pooling operation simply preserves the original values\n\nLet me provide the final answer in the requested format:\n\n<<<2.00 2.00 6.00 1.00 3.00 9.00\n6.00 1.00 0.00 1.00 9.00 0.00>>>"
