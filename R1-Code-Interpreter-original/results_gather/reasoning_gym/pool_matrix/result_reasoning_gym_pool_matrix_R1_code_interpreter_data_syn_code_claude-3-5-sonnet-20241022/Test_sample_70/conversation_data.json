    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For average pooling with kernel size 1, each element in the output matrix will be the average of values within a 1x1 window.\n2. Since kernel size equals stride (no overlap), and kernel size is 1:\n   - Each element will be itself (average of 1x1 window is the element itself)\n   - The output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix\n3. Let's write a Python code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 9, 8],\n    [8, 9, 7, 4, 7, 0, 6],\n    [2, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6],\n    [7, 9, 7, 4, 9, 3, 2]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, average pooling just returns the same matrix\n# We'll format the output to 2 decimal places\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\nresult = []\nfor i in range(rows):\n    row = []\n    for j in range(cols):\n        # Format to 2 decimal places\n        value = \"{:.2f}\".format(matrix[i][j])\n        row.append(value)\n    result.append(\" \".join(row))\n\nprint(\"\\n\".join(result))\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will be exactly the same as the input matrix, just formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<0.00 3.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 9.00 8.00\n8.00 9.00 7.00 4.00 7.00 0.00 6.00\n2.00 7.00 3.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 6.00\n7.00 9.00 7.00 4.00 9.00 3.00 2.00>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors. Since the kernel size is 1, the average pooling operation simply maintains the original matrix values, just formatted to display 2 decimal places. \n\nLet me verify that this is the correct answer:\n1. Each element in the output matrix is exactly the same as the input matrix (because kernel size = 1)\n2. All numbers are formatted to 2 decimal places\n3. The matrix dimensions remain unchanged (4x7)\n4. The output format matches the required format with triple angle brackets\n\nTherefore, I can confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<0.00 3.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 9.00 8.00\n8.00 9.00 7.00 4.00 7.00 0.00 6.00\n2.00 7.00 3.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 6.00\n7.00 9.00 7.00 4.00 9.00 3.00 2.00>>>"
