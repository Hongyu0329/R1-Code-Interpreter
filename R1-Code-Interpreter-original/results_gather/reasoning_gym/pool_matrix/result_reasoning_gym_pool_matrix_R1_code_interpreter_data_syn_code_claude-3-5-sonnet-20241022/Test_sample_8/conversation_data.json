    "Let me help you solve this pooling problem.\n\nFor average pooling with kernel size 1, since there's no overlap and the stride equals the kernel size, each element in the output matrix will be the average of a 1x1 region from the input matrix. This means the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix since we're taking the average of single elements.\n\nLet's write a Python code to handle this:\n\n```python\ndef average_pooling(matrix, kernel_size):\n    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:\n        return []\n    \n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # For kernel size 1, output will be same as input\n    if kernel_size == 1:\n        # Format each number to 2 decimal places\n        result = [[round(x, 2) for x in row] for row in matrix]\n        \n        # Print in the required format\n        print(\"<<<\")\n        for row in result:\n            print(\" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row))\n        print(\">>>\")\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 7, 5, 8, 8, 2, 1, 7, 2, 3],\n    [7, 3, 9, 0, 1, 5, 9, 8, 4, 4],\n    [8, 6, 3, 3, 7, 7, 1, 3, 5, 2],\n    [2, 3, 7, 9, 3, 2, 2, 5, 0, 1],\n    [7, 9, 3, 8, 5, 9, 3, 2, 6, 9],\n    [9, 3, 5, 4, 5, 5, 8, 0, 1, 1],\n    [4, 8, 9, 2, 5, 7, 8, 6, 4, 2],\n    [9, 7, 3, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 3],\n    [2, 4, 9, 7, 6, 7, 7, 3, 4, 9]\n]\n\naverage_pooling(matrix, 1)\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will be exactly the same as the input matrix, just formatted to 2 decimal places. Let me provide the final answer:\n\n<<<\n6.00 7.00 5.00 8.00 8.00 2.00 1.00 7.00 2.00 3.00\n7.00 3.00 9.00 0.00 1.00 5.00 9.00 8.00 4.00 4.00\n8.00 6.00 3.00 3.00 7.00 7.00 1.00 3.00 5.00 2.00\n2.00 3.00 7.00 9.00 3.00 2.00 2.00 5.00 0.00 1.00\n7.00 9.00 3.00 8.00 5.00 9.00 3.00 2.00 6.00 9.00\n9.00 3.00 5.00 4.00 5.00 5.00 8.00 0.00 1.00 1.00\n4.00 8.00 9.00 2.00 5.00 7.00 8.00 6.00 4.00 2.00\n9.00 7.00 3.00 9.00 0.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 0.00 3.00\n2.00 4.00 9.00 7.00 6.00 7.00 7.00 3.00 4.00 9.00\n>>>",
