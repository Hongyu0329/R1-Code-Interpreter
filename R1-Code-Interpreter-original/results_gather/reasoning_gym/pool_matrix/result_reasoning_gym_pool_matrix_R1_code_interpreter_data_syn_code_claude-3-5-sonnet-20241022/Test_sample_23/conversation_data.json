    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 1, we actually get the same matrix as input since:\n   - Each element is compared with itself only (1x1 kernel)\n   - No overlap between regions (stride = kernel size = 1)\n   - The output dimensions will be the same as input\n\n2. We need to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Apply max pooling with kernel size 1\n   - Format the output to 2 decimal places\n   - Present the result in the same format\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 8, 5, 7, 5],\n    [1, 6, 0, 3, 8],\n    [7, 1, 5, 7, 8]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, max pooling just returns the same matrix\n# We just need to format the output\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Format output\nresult = \"\"\nfor i in range(rows):\n    row = \" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in matrix[i])\n    result += row\n    if i < rows - 1:\n        result += \"\\n\"\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nSince kernel size is 1, each element is its own pooling region, so we just format the original matrix with 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<7.00 8.00 5.00 7.00 5.00\n1.00 6.00 0.00 3.00 8.00\n7.00 1.00 5.00 7.00 8.00>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1. With a kernel size of 1:\n   - Each pooling window contains exactly one element\n   - The stride equals the kernel size (1)\n   - Therefore, each element in the input becomes an element in the output\n\n2. The output matrix has:\n   - Same dimensions as input (5Ã—3)\n   - Each value formatted to 2 decimal places\n   - Same values as input since max pooling with kernel size 1 doesn't change anything\n\n3. The result maintains:\n   - Proper spacing between numbers\n   - Proper line breaks between rows\n   - All numbers formatted with 2 decimal places\n\nSince the code output matches exactly what we need, I can provide the final answer:\n\n<<<7.00 8.00 5.00 7.00 5.00\n1.00 6.00 0.00 3.00 8.00\n7.00 1.00 5.00 7.00 8.00>>>"
