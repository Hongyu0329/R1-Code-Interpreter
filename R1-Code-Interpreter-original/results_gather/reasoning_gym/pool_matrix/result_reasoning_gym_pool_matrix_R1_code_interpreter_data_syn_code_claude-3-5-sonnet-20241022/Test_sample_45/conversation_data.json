    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For average pooling with kernel size 1, each element in the output matrix will be the average of the values within a 1x1 window.\n2. Since kernel size equals stride (no overlap), and kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same size as the input matrix.\n3. With kernel size 1, each element is essentially averaged with itself, so the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n4. Let's write a Python code to handle this and format the output correctly.\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 4, 4, 5, 8, 0, 9],\n    [7, 5, 3, 0, 6, 4, 6],\n    [4, 5, 7, 3, 1, 1, 9],\n    [6, 4, 5, 8, 1, 8, 1],\n    [6, 3, 4, 3, 9, 0, 8],\n    [9, 5, 3, 2, 4, 4, 5]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, average pooling just returns the same matrix\n# Format output to 2 decimal places\nresult = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    result += \" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row) + \"\\n\"\n\nprint(result.strip())\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element is averaged with itself, meaning the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix, just formatted with 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<7.00 4.00 4.00 5.00 8.00 0.00 9.00\n7.00 5.00 3.00 0.00 6.00 4.00 6.00\n4.00 5.00 7.00 3.00 1.00 1.00 9.00\n6.00 4.00 5.00 8.00 1.00 8.00 1.00\n6.00 3.00 4.00 3.00 9.00 0.00 8.00\n9.00 5.00 3.00 2.00 4.00 4.00 5.00>>>",
