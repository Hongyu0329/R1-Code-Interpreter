    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 7×2 input matrix\n   - Kernel size is 2\n   - We need to perform max pooling\n   - No overlap between pooling regions (stride = kernel size = 2)\n\n2) For max pooling with kernel size 2:\n   - We'll take 2×2 blocks of numbers\n   - Find the maximum value in each block\n   - The output matrix will be smaller than the input\n\n3) Let's calculate the output matrix size:\n   - Original height = 7, width = 2\n   - With kernel size 2, new height = ⌊7/2⌋ = 3 (integer division)\n   - New width = ⌊2/2⌋ = 1\n\n4) Let's write code to perform this operation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [4, 9],\n    [1, 4],\n    [7, 6],\n    [9, 2],\n    [7, 2],\n    [9, 9],\n    [5, 2]\n])\n\nkernel_size = 2\n\n# Calculate output dimensions\nrows = matrix.shape[0]\ncols = matrix.shape[1]\nout_rows = rows // kernel_size\nout_cols = cols // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize output matrix\noutput = np.zeros((out_rows, out_cols))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(out_rows):\n    for j in range(out_cols):\n        # Extract the current block\n        block = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, \n                      j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n        # Get maximum value from the block\n        output[i,j] = np.max(block)\n\n# Format output to 2 decimal places\nformatted_output = np.round(output, 2)\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\n5) Looking at the output, we can verify:\n   - First 2×2 block (4,9,1,4) -> max is 9\n   - Second 2×2 block (7,6,9,2) -> max is 9\n   - Third 2×2 block (7,2,9,9) -> max is 9\n   - Last row (5,2) is incomplete for a 2×2 block, so it's not included\n\n<<<\n9.00\n9.00\n9.00\n>>>",
    "The code executed correctly, and now I can provide the final answer. Since we need to format the output as a matrix with elements separated by spaces and rounded to 2 decimal places:\n\n<<<\n9.00\n9.00\n9.00\n>>>\n\nThe result shows that:\n1. The first value 9.00 comes from max(4,9,1,4)\n2. The second value 9.00 comes from max(7,6,9,2)\n3. The third value 9.00 comes from max(7,2,9,9)\n\nThe last incomplete row (5,2) was not included in the output as it couldn't form a complete 2×2 block for the pooling operation."
