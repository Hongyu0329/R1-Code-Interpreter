    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For average pooling with kernel size 1, each element in the output matrix will be the average of values within a 1x1 window.\n2. Since kernel size equals stride (no overlap), and kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same size as the input matrix.\n3. With kernel size 1, each element is essentially averaged with itself, so the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n4. Let's write code to handle this and format the output correctly.\n\n```python\ndef average_pooling(matrix, kernel_size):\n    if kernel_size == 1:\n        # For kernel size 1, return the same matrix formatted to 2 decimal places\n        result = [[f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row] for row in matrix]\n        \n        # Print in the required format\n        print(\"<<<\")\n        for row in result:\n            print(\" \".join(row))\n        print(\">>>\")\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 0, 2, 6, 0],\n    [5, 1, 9, 1, 3],\n    [7, 1, 4, 9, 2],\n    [6, 1, 4, 7, 5],\n    [1, 4, 0, 5, 3],\n    [2, 0, 1, 3, 4]\n]\n\naverage_pooling(matrix, 1)\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element will be averaged with itself, resulting in the same values but formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<\n2.00 0.00 2.00 6.00 0.00\n5.00 1.00 9.00 1.00 3.00\n7.00 1.00 4.00 9.00 2.00\n6.00 1.00 4.00 7.00 5.00\n1.00 4.00 0.00 5.00 3.00\n2.00 0.00 1.00 3.00 4.00\n>>>",
    "Based on the code execution output, we can now provide the final answer.
