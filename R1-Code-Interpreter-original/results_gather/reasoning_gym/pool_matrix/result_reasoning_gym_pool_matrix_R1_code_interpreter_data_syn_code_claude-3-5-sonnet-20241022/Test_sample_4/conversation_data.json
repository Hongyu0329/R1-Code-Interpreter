    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 1, we actually keep the original matrix as is since we're taking the maximum of each 1x1 region.\n2. The stride equals the kernel size (1), so there's no overlap.\n3. Since kernel size is 1, the output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix.\n4. We'll write a Python script to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Perform max pooling\n   - Format the output with 2 decimal places\n\nLet's write the code:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 2],\n    [8, 1],\n    [9, 5],\n    [7, 6],\n    [4, 0],\n    [6, 6],\n    [6, 1]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, max pooling keeps the original values\n# Just format the output with 2 decimal places\nresult = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    result += \" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row) + \"\\n\"\n\n# Remove trailing newline and print\nprint(result.strip())\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will be exactly the same as in the input matrix, just formatted with 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<5.00 2.00\n8.00 1.00\n9.00 5.00\n7.00 6.00\n4.00 0.00\n6.00 6.00\n6.00 1.00>>>",
    "The code executed correctly, and I can now provide the final answer. Since the kernel size is 1, the max pooling operation simply maintains the original matrix values, just formatted with two decimal places as required.\n\n<<<5.00 2.00\n8.00 1.00\n9.00 5.00\n7.00 6.00\n4.00 0.00\n6.00 6.00\n6.00 1.00>>>"
