    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For average pooling with kernel size 1, each element in the output matrix will be the average of a 1x1 region from the input matrix.\n2. Since kernel size = 1, the output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix.\n3. With kernel size 1, each element remains unchanged as it's averaging only itself.\n4. We need to format the output to 2 decimal places.\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 2, 4],\n    [3, 9, 4]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, average pooling just returns the same matrix\n# but with numbers formatted to 2 decimal places\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create output string\noutput = \"\"\nfor i in range(rows):\n    row_str = \" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in matrix[i])\n    output += row_str\n    if i < rows - 1:\n        output += \"\\n\"\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element is averaged with itself, so the values remain the same. The only change is formatting to 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<9.00 2.00 4.00\n3.00 9.00 4.00>>>",
    "The code executed correctly, and I can now provide the final answer. Since the code output matches our expected result (the same matrix with numbers formatted to 2 decimal places), I can confirm this is the correct answer.\n\n<<<9.00 2.00 4.00\n3.00 9.00 4.00>>>"
