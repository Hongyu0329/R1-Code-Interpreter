    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 1, the output matrix will be the same size as the input matrix since there's no actual pooling happening (kernel size = stride = 1).\n2. In this case, the output will be identical to the input matrix.\n3. Let's write a Python code to handle this and format the output properly.\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 8, 8, 6, 6, 0],\n    [9, 6, 5, 9, 1, 1],\n    [0, 9, 8, 1, 1, 6],\n    [4, 1, 4, 2, 0, 8],\n    [0, 2, 8, 0, 5, 3],\n    [0, 3, 9, 8, 6, 6],\n    [8, 3, 6, 7, 2, 3],\n    [0, 6, 7, 2, 3, 7],\n    [5, 5, 7, 3, 2, 1],\n    [1, 7, 4, 4, 6, 1]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, the output is the same as input\n# Format the output with 2 decimal places\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    output += \" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row) + \"\\n\"\n\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will be identical to the corresponding element in the input matrix. The only difference is that we're formatting each number to have 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<7.00 8.00 8.00 6.00 6.00 0.00\n9.00 6.00 5.00 9.00 1.00 1.00\n0.00 9.00 8.00 1.00 1.00 6.00\n4.00 1.00 4.00 2.00 0.00 8.00\n0.00 2.00 8.00 0.00 5.00 3.00\n0.00 3.00 9.00 8.00 6.00 6.00\n8.00 3.00 6.00 7.00 2.00 3.00\n0.00 6.00 7.00 2.00 3.00 7.00\n5.00 5.00 7.00 3.00 2.00 1.00\n1.00 7.00 4.00 4.00 6.00 1.00>>>",
    "Based on the code execution output, I can confirm that the result is correct. Let me explain why:\n\n1. With a kernel size of 1, max pooling simply preserves the original values since each pooling window contains only one element.\n2. The output matrix has the same dimensions as the input matrix (10Ã—6).\n3. All numbers are formatted to 2 decimal places as required.\n4. The output matches the input matrix exactly, just with decimal formatting added.\n\nSince there are no errors in the execution and the output matches our expectations, I can provide the final answer:\n\n<<<7.00 8.00 8.00 6.00 6.00 0.00\n9.00 6.00 5.00 9.00 1.00 1.00\n0.00 9.00 8.00 1.00 1.00 6.00\n4.00 1.00 4.00 2.00 0.00 8.00\n0.00 2.00 8.00 0.00 5.00 3.00\n0.00 3.00 9.00 8.00 6.00 6.00\n8.00 3.00 6.00 7.00 2.00 3.00\n0.00 6.00 7.00 2.00 3.00 7.00\n5.00 5.00 7.00 3.00 2.00 1.00\n1.00 7.00 4.00 4.00 6.00 1.00>>>"
