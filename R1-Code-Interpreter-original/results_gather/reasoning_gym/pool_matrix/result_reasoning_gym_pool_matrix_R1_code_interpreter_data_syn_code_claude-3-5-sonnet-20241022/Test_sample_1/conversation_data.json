    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 2 and same stride:\n   - We need to divide the matrix into 2x2 non-overlapping regions\n   - For each region, find the maximum value\n   - The output matrix will be smaller (half the size in each dimension)\n2. Given a 4x5 input matrix, the output will be 2x3 (rounded down)\n3. Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Implement max pooling\n   - Format the output correctly\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 7, 8, 2, 2],\n    [9, 9, 3, 6, 3],\n    [3, 1, 7, 6, 0],\n    [0, 6, 6, 0, 4]\n]\n\nkernel_size = 2\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\noutput_rows = rows // kernel_size\noutput_cols = cols // kernel_size\n\n# Perform max pooling\nresult = []\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    row = []\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Get the current 2x2 region\n        region = []\n        for ki in range(kernel_size):\n            for kj in range(kernel_size):\n                region.append(matrix[i*kernel_size + ki][j*kernel_size + kj])\n        # Find max in region\n        row.append(max(region))\n    result.append(row)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\\n\".join([\" \".join([f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row]) for row in result])\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nLet's analyze what the code will do:\n1. For the first 2x2 region (top-left): max([4, 7, 9, 9]) = 9\n2. For the second 2x2 region (top-middle): max([8, 2, 3, 6]) = 8\n3. For the third 2x2 region (top-right): max([2, 3, 0, 4]) = 4\n4. For the first 2x2 region (bottom-left): max([3, 1, 0, 6]) = 6\n5. For the second 2x2 region (bottom-middle): max([7, 6, 6, 0]) = 7\n6. For the third 2x2 region (bottom-right): max([0, 4, -, -]) = 4\n\nThe code will generate a 2x3 matrix with these maximum values, formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<9.00 8.00 4.00\n6.00 7.00 4.00>>>",
    "I notice that my code execution produced a different output than expected. Let me analyze why:\n\n1. Looking at the input matrix again:\n```\n4 7 8 2 2\n9 9 3 6 3\n3 1 7 6 0\n0 6 6 0 4\n```\n\n2. With kernel size 2, we should divide it into 2x2 regions:\n```\n[4 7] [8 2] [2]\n[9 9] [3 6] [3]\n[3 1] [7 6] [0]\n[0 6] [6 0] [4]\n```\n\n3. I realize that my previous analysis was incorrect. Since we can only have complete 2x2 regions (no partial regions), we should only process:\n- Region 1: max([4,7,9,9]) = 9\n- Region 2: max([8,2,3,6]) = 8\n- Region 3: max([3,1,0,6]) = 6\n- Region 4: max([7,6,6,0]) = 7\n\nThe output matrix should be 2x2 because:\n- Rows: 4 รท 2 = 2\n- Columns: 5 รท 2 = 2 (integer division, we can't use incomplete regions)\n\nThe code output is correct:\n\n<<<9.00 8.00\n6.00 7.00>>>"
