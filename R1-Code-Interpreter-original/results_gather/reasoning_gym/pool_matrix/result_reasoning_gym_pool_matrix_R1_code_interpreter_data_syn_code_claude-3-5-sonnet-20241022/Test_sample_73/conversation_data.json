    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 1, we actually don't change the matrix at all since each pooling region contains only one element.\n2. The output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix.\n3. Let's write a Python code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 5, 6],\n    [9, 4, 0],\n    [0, 4, 0],\n    [4, 1, 6],\n    [9, 9, 3],\n    [9, 4, 6],\n    [6, 9, 4]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, we just format the output\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Format and print the result\nresult = \"\"\nfor i in range(rows):\n    row = \" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in matrix[i])\n    result += row + \"\\n\"\n\nprint(result.strip())\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will be exactly the same as the input matrix. We just need to format the numbers to have 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<0.00 5.00 6.00\n9.00 4.00 0.00\n0.00 4.00 0.00\n4.00 1.00 6.00\n9.00 9.00 3.00\n9.00 4.00 6.00\n6.00 9.00 4.00>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Since this was a max pooling operation with kernel size 1, each element in the output matrix is identical to the corresponding element in the input matrix, just formatted to show two decimal places.\n\nLet me confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<0.00 5.00 6.00\n9.00 4.00 0.00\n0.00 4.00 0.00\n4.00 1.00 6.00\n9.00 9.00 3.00\n9.00 4.00 6.00\n6.00 9.00 4.00>>>"
