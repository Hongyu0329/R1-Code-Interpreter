    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 2 and same stride:\n   - We need to divide the matrix into 2x2 non-overlapping regions\n   - For each region, find the maximum value\n   - The output matrix will be smaller (half the size in each dimension)\n2. Given 8x5 input matrix, the output will be 4x3 matrix\n3. Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Implement max pooling\n   - Format output correctly\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 3, 9, 0, 0],\n    [0, 6, 2, 8, 9],\n    [5, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [8, 7, 9, 7, 1],\n    [9, 2, 9, 1, 5],\n    [0, 5, 5, 2, 2],\n    [3, 6, 4, 0, 1],\n    [7, 3, 1, 5, 5]\n]\n\nkernel_size = 2\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Calculate output dimensions\nout_rows = rows // kernel_size\nout_cols = cols // kernel_size\n\n# Perform max pooling\nresult = []\nfor i in range(0, rows, kernel_size):\n    if i + kernel_size <= rows:  # Check if we have a complete kernel\n        row = []\n        for j in range(0, cols, kernel_size):\n            if j + kernel_size <= cols:  # Check if we have a complete kernel\n                # Get maximum value in current 2x2 region\n                max_val = max(\n                    matrix[i][j],\n                    matrix[i][j+1],\n                    matrix[i+1][j],\n                    matrix[i+1][j+1]\n                )\n                row.append(max_val)\n        if row:  # Only append if we have values in the row\n            result.append(row)\n\n# Format and print result\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in result:\n    output += \" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row) + \"\\n\"\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nNow that we have the result, let's format it according to the requirements:\n\n<<<6.00 9.00 9.00\n8.00 9.00 7.00\n9.00 9.00 5.00\n7.00 5.00 5.00>>>",
    "I notice that the code output is not matching with my expected output. Let me analyze why:\n\n1. The code is working correctly in terms of max pooling operation\n2. The issue was with my manual interpretation of the output - I included an extra column\n3. Let's verify the calculation:\n   - For a 8x5 input matrix with kernel size 2\n   - Output should be 4x2 matrix (not 4x3 as I incorrectly assumed before)\n   - Each element is the max of its corresponding 2x2 region\n\nLet's confirm the values:\n- Top left (0,0,0,6) -> max = 6\n- Top right (9,0,2,8) -> max = 9\n- And so on...\n\nThe code is actually giving us the correct output. Let me provide the correct answer:\n\n<<<6.00 9.00\n8.00 9.00\n9.00 9.00\n7.00 5.00>>>"
