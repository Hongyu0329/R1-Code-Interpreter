    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For average pooling with kernel size 1, each element in the output matrix will be the average of values within a 1x1 region.\n2. Since kernel size equals stride (no overlap), and kernel size is 1:\n   - Each element will be itself (average of 1x1 region)\n   - The output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix\n3. Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Perform average pooling\n   - Format the output with 2 decimal places\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 8, 4, 3, 2, 0, 2, 8],\n    [0, 7, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6],\n    [7, 8, 8, 6, 0, 2, 4, 8]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, each element remains the same\n# Just format to 2 decimal places\nresult = []\nfor row in matrix:\n    formatted_row = [f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row]\n    result.append(\" \".join(formatted_row))\n\nprint(\"\\n\".join(result))\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix, just formatted with 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<5.00 8.00 4.00 3.00 2.00 0.00 2.00 8.00\n0.00 7.00 6.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 6.00\n7.00 8.00 8.00 6.00 0.00 2.00 4.00 8.00>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors. Since the kernel size is 1, the average pooling operation simply maintains the original values but formats them to 2 decimal places. \n\nLet me explain why this is the correct result:\n1. With a kernel size of 1, each pooling window contains exactly one element\n2. The average of a single element is the element itself\n3. The stride equals the kernel size (1), so there's no overlap\n4. The output dimensions remain the same as the input (8 columns Ã— 3 rows)\n5. All numbers are formatted to show 2 decimal places\n\nThe output matches our expectations, so I can confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<5.00 8.00 4.00 3.00 2.00 0.00 2.00 8.00\n0.00 7.00 6.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 6.00\n7.00 8.00 8.00 6.00 0.00 2.00 4.00 8.00>>>"
