    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For a kernel size of 3, we'll divide the input matrix into 3x3 non-overlapping regions\n2. For each region, we'll calculate the average of all elements\n3. The output matrix will be smaller than the input matrix\n4. Given a 9x5 input matrix and kernel size 3:\n   - Number of rows in output = ⌊9/3⌋ = 3\n   - Number of columns in output = ⌊5/3⌋ = 1\n5. Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Perform average pooling\n   - Format the output correctly\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 9, 3, 9, 6],\n    [1, 5, 7, 7, 4],\n    [6, 1, 4, 8, 1],\n    [4, 5, 0, 1, 6],\n    [0, 3, 5, 3, 8],\n    [7, 6, 7, 1, 7],\n    [8, 3, 5, 1, 8],\n    [0, 1, 4, 4, 8],\n    [9, 5, 5, 4, 5]\n]\n\nkernel_size = 3\n\n# Calculate output dimensions\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\nout_rows = rows // kernel_size\nout_cols = cols // kernel_size\n\n# Perform average pooling\nresult = []\nfor i in range(out_rows):\n    row = []\n    for j in range(out_cols):\n        # Calculate average for current 3x3 region\n        sum_region = 0\n        for ki in range(kernel_size):\n            for kj in range(kernel_size):\n                sum_region += matrix[i*kernel_size + ki][j*kernel_size + kj]\n        avg = sum_region / (kernel_size * kernel_size)\n        row.append(f\"{avg:.2f}\")\n    result.append(row)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\\n\".join([\" \".join(row) for row in result])\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThe code:\n1. Defines the input matrix and kernel size\n2. Calculates output dimensions\n3. Iterates through non-overlapping 3x3 regions\n4. Calculates average for each region\n5. Formats output with 2 decimal places\n6. Returns result in required format\n\nThe output will be a 3x1 matrix where each element is the average of its corresponding 3x3 region in the input matrix.\n\n<<<4.67\n3.67\n4.44>>>",
    "I notice that my calculated values were slightly off. Let me verify the calculations manually to ensure accuracy:\n\nFor a 9x5 matrix with kernel size 3, we get a 3x1 output matrix. Let's verify each value:\n\n1. First element (top 3x3 region):\n   (7+9+3 + 1+5+7 + 6+1+4) / 9\n   = (19 + 13 + 11) / 9\n   = 43 / 9\n   ≈ 4.78\n\n2. Middle element (middle 3x3 region):\n   (4+5+0 + 0+3+5 + 7+6+7) / 9\n   = (9 + 8 + 20) / 9\n   = 37 / 9\n   ≈ 4.11\n\n3. Bottom element (bottom 3x3 region):\n   (8+3+5 + 0+1+4 + 9+5+5) / 9\n   = (16 + 5 + 19) / 9\n   = 40 / 9\n   ≈ 4.44\n\nThe code execution output is correct:\n\n<<<4.78\n4.11\n4.44>>>"
