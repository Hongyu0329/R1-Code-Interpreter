    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   - We have a 6×2 input matrix\n   - Kernel size is 2\n   - We need to perform average pooling\n   - Since stride = kernel size = 2, there's no overlap\n   - We need to output values rounded to 2 decimal places\n\n2) For a 6×2 matrix with kernel size 2:\n   - The output will be a 3×1 matrix\n   - Each output element will be the average of a 2×2 region\n   - We'll process the matrix from top to bottom\n\n3) Let's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 9],\n    [8, 5],\n    [0, 1],\n    [4, 1],\n    [9, 5],\n    [9, 8]\n]\n\nkernel_size = 2\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\noutput = []\n\n# Process the matrix in 2×2 blocks\nfor i in range(0, rows, kernel_size):\n    sum_elements = 0\n    # Sum all elements in the current 2×2 block\n    for r in range(i, min(i + kernel_size, rows)):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            sum_elements += matrix[r][c]\n    # Calculate average and append to output\n    average = sum_elements / (kernel_size * cols)\n    output.append(round(average, 2))\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\")\nfor val in output:\n    print(f\"{val:.2f}\")\nprint(\">>>\")\n```\n\nLet's analyze what this will do:\n1) First 2×2 block (1,9,8,5): average = (1+9+8+5)/4 = 5.75\n2) Second 2×2 block (0,1,4,1): average = (0+1+4+1)/4 = 1.50\n3) Third 2×2 block (9,5,9,8): average = (9+5+9+8)/4 = 7.75\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n5.75\n1.50\n7.75\n>>>",
    "Since there are no errors in the code execution and the output matches our calculations, I can confirm this is the correct answer.\n\nLet me verify our solution one final time:\n1) The first block (1,9,8,5) → average = 5.75 ✓\n2) The second block (0,1,4,1) → average = 1.50 ✓\n3) The third block (9,5,9,8) → average = 7.75 ✓\n\nThe output is formatted correctly with:\n- Values rounded to 2 decimal places\n- Each value on a new line\n- Enclosed in triple angle brackets\n\nTherefore, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<\n5.75\n1.50\n7.75\n>>>"
