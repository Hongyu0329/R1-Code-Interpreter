    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 1, since there's no overlap (stride = kernel size), the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix.\n2. We need to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Apply max pooling operation\n   - Format the output to 2 decimal places\n3. Let's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 0, 5, 3],\n    [2, 6, 9, 8],\n    [3, 6, 0, 8],\n    [7, 0, 2, 7],\n    [9, 1, 8, 7],\n    [0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [3, 6, 2, 7],\n    [2, 5, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 7, 3],\n    [1, 2, 4, 2]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, output is same as input but formatted to 2 decimal places\noutput = []\nfor row in matrix:\n    formatted_row = [f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row]\n    print(\" \".join(formatted_row))\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will be exactly the same as the input matrix, just formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<2.00 0.00 5.00 3.00\n2.00 6.00 9.00 8.00\n3.00 6.00 0.00 8.00\n7.00 0.00 2.00 7.00\n9.00 1.00 8.00 7.00\n0.00 8.00 8.00 8.00\n3.00 6.00 2.00 7.00\n2.00 5.00 0.00 1.00\n0.00 1.00 7.00 3.00\n1.00 2.00 4.00 2.00>>>",
    "Based on the code execution output, which matches exactly what we expected, I can now provide the final answer.\n\n<<<2.00 0.00 5.00 3.00\n2.00 6.00 9.00 8.00\n3.00 6.00 0.00 8.00\n7.00 0.00 2.00 7.00\n9.00 1.00 8.00 7.00\n0.00 8.00 8.00 8.00\n3.00 6.00 2.00 7.00\n2.00 5.00 0.00 1.00\n0.00 1.00 7.00 3.00\n1.00 2.00 4.00 2.00>>>"
