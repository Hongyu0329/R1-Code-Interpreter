    "Let me help you solve this max/min pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For kernel size = 1, the output matrix will be the same size as the input matrix since we're essentially looking at each element individually.\n2. With stride = kernel size = 1, we're not actually doing any pooling, so the output will be identical to the input.\n3. Let's write a Python code to handle this and format the output properly.\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 7, 1, 0, 9, 8, 8],\n    [8, 9, 7, 7, 8, 0, 9],\n    [2, 5, 3, 3, 3, 9, 8],\n    [7, 5, 8, 6, 0, 1, 9],\n    [9, 0, 2, 2, 5, 8, 3],\n    [0, 4, 1, 3, 6, 4, 2],\n    [3, 1, 3, 4, 2, 7, 2],\n    [4, 7, 4, 7, 9, 4, 7],\n    [4, 0, 8, 7, 6, 3, 6],\n    [0, 5, 5, 4, 2, 0, 4]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, output is same as input\n# Format output with 2 decimal places\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    output += \" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row) + \"\\n\"\n\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix, just formatted with 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<9.00 7.00 1.00 0.00 9.00 8.00 8.00\n8.00 9.00 7.00 7.00 8.00 0.00 9.00\n2.00 5.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 9.00 8.00\n7.00 5.00 8.00 6.00 0.00 1.00 9.00\n9.00 0.00 2.00 2.00 5.00 8.00 3.00\n0.00 4.00 1.00 3.00 6.00 4.00 2.00\n3.00 1.00 3.00 4.00 2.00 7.00 2.00\n4.00 7.00 4.00 7.00 9.00 4.00 7.00\n4.00 0.00 8.00 7.00 6.00 3.00 6.00\n0.00 5.00 5.00 4.00 2.00 0.00 4.00>>>",
    "The code executed correctly without any errors. Since the kernel size is 1, the max pooling operation simply maintains the original matrix values, just formatted to display with 2 decimal places. Each element in the output matrix is exactly the same as the input matrix because:\n\n1. A kernel size of 1 means we're looking at each element individually\n2. The stride being equal to the kernel size (both 1) means we move one position at a time\n3. Taking the maximum of a single value returns that same value\n\nTherefore, I can confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<9.00 7.00 1.00 0.00 9.00 8.00 8.00\n8.00 9.00 7.00 7.00 8.00 0.00 9.00\n2.00 5.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 9.00 8.00\n7.00 5.00 8.00 6.00 0.00 1.00 9.00\n9.00 0.00 2.00 2.00 5.00 8.00 3.00\n0.00 4.00 1.00 3.00 6.00 4.00 2.00\n3.00 1.00 3.00 4.00 2.00 7.00 2.00\n4.00 7.00 4.00 7.00 9.00 4.00 7.00\n4.00 0.00 8.00 7.00 6.00 3.00 6.00\n0.00 5.00 5.00 4.00 2.00 0.00 4.00>>>"
