    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 3:\n   - We need to divide the matrix into 3x3 regions\n   - Take the maximum value in each region\n   - The stride equals kernel size (3), so no overlap\n2. Given a 5x3 matrix, we need to:\n   - Calculate how many complete 3x3 regions we can fit\n   - For this case, we can fit one 3x3 region (first 3 rows)\n   - The remaining rows (2) are not enough to form a complete region\n3. Let's write code to:\n   - Create the input matrix\n   - Implement max pooling\n   - Format the output correctly\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [1, 7, 5],\n    [9, 0, 3],\n    [0, 3, 7],\n    [9, 0, 9],\n    [4, 5, 2]\n])\n\ndef max_pooling(matrix, kernel_size):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    # Calculate output dimensions\n    out_rows = rows // kernel_size\n    out_cols = cols // kernel_size\n    \n    result = np.zeros((out_rows, out_cols))\n    \n    # Perform max pooling\n    for i in range(out_rows):\n        for j in range(out_cols):\n            # Extract the region and find maximum\n            region = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, \n                          j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n            result[i,j] = np.max(region)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Get result and format\nresult = max_pooling(matrix, 3)\n# Format output with 2 decimal places\nformatted_result = np.array2string(result, formatter={'float_kind':lambda x: \"%.2f\" % x})\nprint(formatted_result)\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the code execution:\n1. The input 5x3 matrix can only form one complete 3x3 region\n2. The max pooling operation finds the maximum value in this 3x3 region\n3. The result is a 1x1 matrix containing the maximum value from the first 3x3 region\n\n<<<9.00>>>\n\nThe answer is a 1x1 matrix because:\n- Only one complete 3x3 region could be formed from the 5x3 input matrix\n- The maximum value in this region is 9\n- The remaining rows (4th and 5th) are discarded as they cannot form a complete 3x3 region",
    "Based on the code output, let me provide the final answer in the correct format.\n\nThe max pooling operation with kernel size 3 on the given 5x3 matrix results in a 1x1 matrix, as only one complete 3x3 region could be formed. The maximum value in this region is 9.00.\n\n<<<[[9.00]]>>>"
