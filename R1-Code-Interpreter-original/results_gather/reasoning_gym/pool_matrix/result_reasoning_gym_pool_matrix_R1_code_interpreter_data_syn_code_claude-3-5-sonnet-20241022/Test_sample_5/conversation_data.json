    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 1, the output matrix will be the same size as the input matrix since we're taking the maximum value from each 1x1 region.\n2. With kernel size 1, each element will remain unchanged as it's the maximum value in its own 1x1 region.\n3. Let's write a Python script to:\n   - Convert the input string into a matrix\n   - Perform max pooling with kernel size 1\n   - Format the output with 2 decimal places\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\ninput_str = \"\"\"5 6 3 3 5 8 5 7 8 8\n3 2 8 1 8 3 8 4 1 3\n2 3 3 2 9 3 7 5 6 1\"\"\"\n\n# Convert input string to matrix\nmatrix = [[float(num) for num in row.split()] for row in input_str.split('\\n')]\n\n# For kernel size 1, max pooling just returns the same matrix\n# Format each number to 2 decimal places\nresult = [[f\"{num:.2f}\" for num in row] for row in matrix]\n\n# Print result in the required format\nfor row in result:\n    print(\" \".join(row))\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix, just formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<5.00 6.00 3.00 3.00 5.00 8.00 5.00 7.00 8.00 8.00\n3.00 2.00 8.00 1.00 8.00 3.00 8.00 4.00 1.00 3.00\n2.00 3.00 3.00 2.00 9.00 3.00 7.00 5.00 6.00 1.00>>>",
    "Based on the code output, I can now provide the final answer. Since the code executed correctly without errors and produced the expected output matrix with all numbers formatted to 2 decimal places, I will present the answer in the required format:\n\n<<<5.00 6.00 3.00 3.00 5.00 8.00 5.00 7.00 8.00 8.00\n3.00 2.00 8.00 1.00 8.00 3.00 8.00 4.00 1.00 3.00\n2.00 3.00 3.00 2.00 9.00 3.00 7.00 5.00 6.00 1.00>>>"
