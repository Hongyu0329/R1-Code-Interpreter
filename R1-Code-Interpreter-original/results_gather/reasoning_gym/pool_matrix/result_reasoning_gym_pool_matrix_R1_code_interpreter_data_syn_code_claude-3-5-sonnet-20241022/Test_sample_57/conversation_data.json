    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 1, we actually get the same matrix as the input since we're taking the maximum of each 1x1 region.\n2. The stride equals the kernel size (1), so there's no overlap.\n3. Since kernel size is 1, the output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix.\n4. We need to format the numbers to 2 decimal places.\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 4, 6, 5, 8, 2],\n    [1, 7, 8, 0, 7, 6],\n    [4, 1, 6, 8, 6, 6]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, we just need to format each number to 2 decimal places\nresult = []\nfor row in matrix:\n    formatted_row = [f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row]\n    result.append(\" \".join(formatted_row))\n\nprint(\"\\n\".join(result))\n```\n\nThe code will format each number to have 2 decimal places. Since kernel size is 1, we don't need to perform any actual pooling operation - we just format the existing numbers.\n\n<<<3.00 4.00 6.00 5.00 8.00 2.00\n1.00 7.00 8.00 0.00 7.00 6.00\n4.00 1.00 6.00 8.00 6.00 6.00>>>",
    "The code executed successfully, and we can now provide the final answer. Since this was a max pooling operation with kernel size 1, the output matrix is identical to the input matrix, just with numbers formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<3.00 4.00 6.00 5.00 8.00 2.00\n1.00 7.00 8.00 0.00 7.00 6.00\n4.00 1.00 6.00 8.00 6.00 6.00>>>"
