    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 3 and same stride:\n   - We need to divide the matrix into 3x3 non-overlapping regions\n   - For each region, find the maximum value\n   - The output matrix will be smaller than input matrix\n   - With 5x5 input and kernel size 3, output will be 1x1 (since only one complete 3x3 region fits)\n\n2. Let's write code to:\n   - Create the input matrix\n   - Implement max pooling function\n   - Handle the pooling operation\n   - Format output to 2 decimal places\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [2, 7, 3, 6, 0],\n    [5, 6, 2, 5, 0],\n    [4, 2, 9, 0, 7],\n    [2, 7, 9, 5, 3],\n    [5, 7, 9, 9, 1]\n])\n\ndef max_pooling(matrix, kernel_size):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    output_rows = rows // kernel_size\n    output_cols = cols // kernel_size\n    output = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n    \n    for i in range(output_rows):\n        for j in range(output_cols):\n            # Extract the region and find maximum\n            region = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, \n                          j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n            output[i,j] = np.max(region)\n    \n    return output\n\n# Perform max pooling\nresult = max_pooling(matrix, 3)\n\n# Format output\noutput_str = \"<<<\" + str(np.round(result, 2)) + \">>>\"\nprint(output_str)\n```\n\nThe code will:\n1. Create a numpy array from the input matrix\n2. Implement max pooling function that:\n   - Calculates output dimensions\n   - Iterates through non-overlapping regions\n   - Finds maximum value in each region\n3. Format the output to 2 decimal places and enclose in <<<>>>\n\nLooking at the result, we can see that only one complete 3x3 region fits in the 5x5 input matrix (top-left corner), so our output will be a 1x1 matrix.\n\n<<<9.00>>>\n\nThis is correct because in the top-left 3x3 region:\n```\n2 7 3\n5 6 2\n4 2 9\n```\nThe maximum value is 9.",
    "Let me explain the output we received.\n\nThe code executed correctly and gave us <<<[[9.]]>>>, which represents a 1x1 matrix containing the value 9.00. The double brackets are part of NumPy's array notation, but for our required format, we should present just the value.\n\nSince we only need to present the final value in the specified format with 2 decimal places, I'll provide the final answer:\n\n<<<9.00>>>"
