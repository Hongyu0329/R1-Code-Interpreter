    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 1, we actually get the same matrix as the input since we're taking the maximum of each 1x1 region.\n2. The stride equals the kernel size (1), so there's no overlap.\n3. Since kernel size is 1, the output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix.\n4. We need to format the numbers to 2 decimal places.\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 5, 6, 8, 3],\n    [7, 9, 3, 5, 9],\n    [4, 1, 3, 1, 2]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, max pooling just returns the same matrix\n# We just need to format the numbers\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Format output\nresult = \"\"\nfor i in range(rows):\n    row = \" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in matrix[i])\n    result += row\n    if i < rows - 1:\n        result += \"\\n\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThe code will format each number to 2 decimal places and create the output in the required format.\n\n<<<7.00 5.00 6.00 8.00 3.00\n7.00 9.00 3.00 5.00 9.00\n4.00 1.00 3.00 1.00 2.00>>>",
    "Since we have received the code output and there are no errors, let's verify the result:\n\n1. The output maintains the same dimensions as the input (3x5 matrix) since kernel size is 1\n2. All numbers are formatted to 2 decimal places\n3. The values are identical to the input matrix, which is correct for max pooling with kernel size 1\n4. The format matches the requirement with triple angle brackets\n\nThe result is correct because:\n- With kernel size 1, each pooling window contains just one element\n- Max pooling takes the maximum value in each window\n- When the window size is 1x1, the maximum is simply the element itself\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that this is the final answer:\n\n<<<7.00 5.00 6.00 8.00 3.00\n7.00 9.00 3.00 5.00 9.00\n4.00 1.00 3.00 1.00 2.00>>>"
