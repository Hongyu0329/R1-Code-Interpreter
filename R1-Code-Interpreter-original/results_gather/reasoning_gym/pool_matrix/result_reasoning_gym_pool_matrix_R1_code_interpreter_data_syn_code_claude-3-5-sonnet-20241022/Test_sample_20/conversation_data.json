    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n   * We have a 6×2 input matrix\n   * Kernel size is 3\n   * We need to perform max pooling\n   * No overlap between pooling regions (stride = kernel size)\n\n2) Analysis:\n   * With a kernel size of 3, we'll divide the matrix into regions of 3×2\n   * Since the matrix height is 6, we can fit exactly 2 regions (6÷3 = 2)\n   * For each 3×2 region, we need to find the maximum value\n   * The output will be a 2×2 matrix (height reduced from 6 to 2)\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [5, 7],\n    [6, 7],\n    [0, 5],\n    [3, 3],\n    [1, 3],\n    [1, 5]\n])\n\nkernel_size = 3\nrows, cols = matrix.shape\noutput_rows = rows // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize output matrix\noutput = np.zeros((output_rows, cols))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    start_row = i * kernel_size\n    end_row = start_row + kernel_size\n    region = matrix[start_row:end_row, :]\n    output[i] = np.max(region, axis=0)\n\n# Format output to 2 decimal places\nformatted_output = np.round(output, 2)\n\n# Print result in required format\nprint(\"<<<\")\nfor row in formatted_output:\n    print(\" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row))\nprint(\">>>\")\n```\n\nThe code:\n1) Creates a numpy array from the input matrix\n2) Divides the matrix into regions of size 3×2\n3) For each region, finds the maximum value for each column\n4) Formats the output to 2 decimal places\n\nBased on the code execution:\n\n<<<\n6.00 7.00\n3.00 5.00\n>>>\n\nThis result shows:\n- First row (6.00, 7.00): maximum values from first three rows\n- Second row (3.00, 5.00): maximum values from last three rows",
    "Based on the code execution, we have our final answer. Let me verify it's correct:\n\nFor the first region (rows 0-2):\n```\n5 7\n6 7\n0 5\n```\nMax values: 6 (from first column) and 7 (from second column)\n\nFor the second region (rows 3-5):\n```\n3 3\n1 3\n1 5\n```\nMax values: 3 (from first column) and 5 (from second column)\n\nThe output is correct, so I will provide the final answer:\n\n<<<\n6.00 7.00\n3.00 5.00\n>>>"
