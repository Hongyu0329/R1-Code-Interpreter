    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For average pooling with kernel size 1, each element in the output matrix will be the average of a 1x1 region in the input matrix.\n2. Since kernel size equals stride (no overlap), and kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same size as the input matrix.\n3. With kernel size 1, each element will essentially remain the same as the input matrix since we're averaging a single number.\n4. Let's write a Python code to handle this and format the output correctly.\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 7, 2, 9, 0, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6],\n    [9, 6, 0, 8, 9, 9, 0, 2, 2, 1],\n    [1, 9, 1, 9, 4, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8],\n    [7, 5, 5, 0, 8, 4, 9, 3, 9, 2],\n    [5, 0, 6, 0, 4, 1, 5, 4, 2, 6],\n    [4, 2, 9, 5, 7, 8, 9, 8, 9, 0]\n]\n\ndef average_pooling(matrix, kernel_size):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    result = []\n    \n    for i in range(0, rows, kernel_size):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(0, cols, kernel_size):\n            # For kernel size 1, just take the element itself\n            avg = matrix[i][j]\n            row.append(f\"{avg:.2f}\")\n        result.append(row)\n    \n    # Format output\n    output = \"\\n\".join([\" \".join(row) for row in result])\n    print(output)\n\naverage_pooling(matrix, 1)\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will be the same as the input matrix, just formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<1.00 7.00 2.00 9.00 0.00 4.00 4.00 5.00 5.00 6.00\n9.00 6.00 0.00 8.00 9.00 9.00 0.00 2.00 2.00 1.00\n1.00 9.00 1.00 9.00 4.00 1.00 3.00 5.00 6.00 8.00\n7.00 5.00 5.00 0.00 8.00 4.00 9.00 3.00 9.00 2.00\n5.00 0.00 6.00 0.00 4.00 1.00 5.00 4.00 2.00 6.00\n4.00 2.00 9.00 5.00 7.00 8.00 9.00 8.00 9.00 0.00>>>",
    "Based on the code execution output, we can confirm that our solution is correct. Let me explain why:\n\n1. The input was a 6x10 matrix, and we performed average pooling with a kernel size of 1.\n2. With kernel size 1, each pooling operation just takes the value of a single element.\n3. The output matrix maintains the same dimensions as the input (6x10).\n4. All numbers are formatted to 2 decimal places as required.\n5. The values are exactly the same as the input matrix, just with decimal formatting added.\n\nTherefore, I can provide the final answer:\n\n<<<1.00 7.00 2.00 9.00 0.00 4.00 4.00 5.00 5.00 6.00\n9.00 6.00 0.00 8.00 9.00 9.00 0.00 2.00 2.00 1.00\n1.00 9.00 1.00 9.00 4.00 1.00 3.00 5.00 6.00 8.00\n7.00 5.00 5.00 0.00 8.00 4.00 9.00 3.00 9.00 2.00\n5.00 0.00 6.00 0.00 4.00 1.00 5.00 4.00 2.00 6.00\n4.00 2.00 9.00 5.00 7.00 8.00 9.00 8.00 9.00 0.00>>>"
