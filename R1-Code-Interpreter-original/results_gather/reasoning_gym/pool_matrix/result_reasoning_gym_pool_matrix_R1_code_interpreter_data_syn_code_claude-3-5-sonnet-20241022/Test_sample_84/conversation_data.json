    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For average pooling with kernel size 1, each element in the output matrix will be the average of a 1x1 region in the input matrix.\n2. Since kernel size equals stride (no overlap), and kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same size as the input matrix.\n3. With kernel size 1, each element will essentially remain the same as the input matrix since we're averaging a single number.\n4. Let's write a Python code to handle this and format the output correctly.\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 6, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [8, 7, 2, 8, 7, 3],\n    [3, 3, 9, 4, 3, 5],\n    [9, 3, 3, 9, 6, 0],\n    [3, 7, 3, 1, 1, 5],\n    [3, 7, 3, 6, 5, 7],\n    [3, 8, 5, 7, 3, 5],\n    [9, 3, 7, 6, 8, 4],\n    [1, 6, 2, 5, 7, 9],\n    [5, 4, 7, 2, 2, 5]\n]\n\ndef average_pooling(matrix, kernel_size):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    result = []\n    \n    for i in range(0, rows, kernel_size):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(0, cols, kernel_size):\n            # For kernel size 1, just take the element itself\n            avg = matrix[i][j]\n            row.append(f\"{avg:.2f}\")\n        result.append(\" \".join(row))\n    \n    print(\"<<<\")\n    print(\"\\n\".join(result))\n    print(\">>>\")\n\naverage_pooling(matrix, 1)\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will be exactly the same as the input matrix, just formatted to 2 decimal places. The output will be formatted with each row on a new line and elements separated by spaces.\n\n<<<\n5.00 6.00 1.00 2.00 1.00 1.00\n8.00 7.00 2.00 8.00 7.00 3.00\n3.00 3.00 9.00 4.00 3.00 5.00\n9.00 3.00 3.00 9.00 6.00 0.00\n3.00 7.00 3.00 1.00 1.00 5.00\n3.00 7.00 3.00 6.00 5.00 7.00\n3.00 8.00 5.00 7.00 3.00 5.00\n9.00 3.00 7.00 6.00 8.00 4.00\n1.00 6.00 2.00 5.00 7.00 9.00\n5.00 4.00 7.00 2.00 2.00 5.00\n>>>",
    "Based on the code execution output and no errors, I can provide the final answer.\n\nSince we performed average pooling with a kernel size of 1, each element in the output matrix is exactly the same as the input matrix, just formatted to show 2 decimal places. The kernel size of 1 means we're taking the average of each individual element, which is the element itself.\n\n<<<\n5.00 6.00 1.00 2.00 1.00 1.00\n8.00 7.00 2.00 8.00 7.00 3.00\n3.00 3.00 9.00 4.00 3.00 5.00\n9.00 3.00 3.00 9.00 6.00 0.00\n3.00 7.00 3.00 1.00 1.00 5.00\n3.00 7.00 3.00 6.00 5.00 7.00\n3.00 8.00 5.00 7.00 3.00 5.00\n9.00 3.00 7.00 6.00 8.00 4.00\n1.00 6.00 2.00 5.00 7.00 9.00\n5.00 4.00 7.00 2.00 2.00 5.00\n>>>"
