    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 2:\n   - We need to divide the matrix into 2x2 regions (non-overlapping due to stride = kernel size)\n   - For each region, find the maximum value\n   - The output matrix will be smaller than the input matrix\n\n2. Given a 3x4 input matrix and kernel size 2:\n   - Output matrix will be of size (3÷2)×(4÷2) = 1×2\n   - We'll need to handle incomplete regions if matrix dimensions aren't divisible by kernel size\n\n3. Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Implement max pooling\n   - Format the output correctly\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 3, 5, 5],\n    [7, 5, 8, 0],\n    [8, 5, 1, 0]\n]\n\nkernel_size = 2\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize output matrix\noutput_rows = rows // kernel_size\noutput_cols = cols // kernel_size\noutput = []\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(0, output_rows):\n    row = []\n    for j in range(0, output_cols):\n        # Get the current 2x2 region\n        region = []\n        for ki in range(kernel_size):\n            for kj in range(kernel_size):\n                region.append(matrix[i*kernel_size + ki][j*kernel_size + kj])\n        # Find max in region\n        row.append(max(region))\n    output.append(row)\n\n# Format output\noutput_str = ' '.join(f'{x:.2f}' for x in output[0])\nprint(f'<<<{output_str}>>>')\n```\n\nThe code:\n1. Takes the input matrix and kernel size\n2. Calculates output dimensions\n3. Performs max pooling by:\n   - Dividing matrix into 2x2 regions\n   - Finding maximum value in each region\n4. Formats output with 2 decimal places\n\nAfter running the code, we get the max values for each 2x2 region:\n- First region (top-left): max(8,3,7,5) = 8\n- Second region (top-right): max(5,5,8,0) = 8\n\n<<<8.00 8.00>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the correct answer. Let me explain why this is the correct result:\n\n1. For the input matrix:\n```\n8 3 5 5\n7 5 8 0\n8 5 1 0\n```\n\n2. With kernel size 2, we divide the matrix into 2x2 regions:\n   - First region (left):\n     ```\n     8 3\n     7 5\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 8.00\n\n   - Second region (right):\n     ```\n     5 5\n     8 0\n     ```\n     Maximum value = 8.00\n\n3. The bottom row is not included in the pooling operation because we don't have complete 2x2 regions (since kernel size = stride size, we don't process incomplete regions)\n\nTherefore, the final output matrix <<<8.00 8.00>>> is correct because:\n- It shows the maximum values from each complete 2x2 region\n- Values are formatted to 2 decimal places as required\n- The output size is correct (1×2 matrix, as we can only fit two complete 2x2 regions in the original matrix)\n\nThe answer is confirmed to be: <<<8.00 8.00>>>"
