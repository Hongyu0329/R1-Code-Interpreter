    "Let me help you solve this pooling operation.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For average pooling with kernel size 1, each element in the output matrix will be equal to the corresponding element in the input matrix.\n2. This is because a 1×1 kernel means we're taking the average of a single number, which is the number itself.\n3. Therefore, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix.\n\nLet's write code to handle this and format the output properly:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 7, 4, 0, 8, 7, 4, 6, 3, 3],\n    [8, 5, 1, 9, 8, 6, 1, 4, 5, 0],\n    [7, 3, 5, 4, 7, 3, 7, 2, 5, 2],\n    [9, 8, 0, 9, 0, 5, 7, 2, 9, 4],\n    [4, 2, 2, 7, 7, 6, 0, 9, 1, 1],\n    [0, 4, 3, 4, 7, 2, 5, 2, 6, 3],\n    [4, 3, 4, 3, 8, 9, 2, 9, 6, 9],\n    [4, 4, 9, 8, 7, 3, 2, 7, 2, 6],\n    [3, 6, 5, 4, 8, 8, 7, 0, 5, 4]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, average pooling just returns the same matrix\n# Format output to 2 decimal places\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    output += \" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row) + \"\\n\"\n\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, the average pooling operation simply returns the same matrix with each number formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<2.00 7.00 4.00 0.00 8.00 7.00 4.00 6.00 3.00 3.00\n8.00 5.00 1.00 9.00 8.00 6.00 1.00 4.00 5.00 0.00\n7.00 3.00 5.00 4.00 7.00 3.00 7.00 2.00 5.00 2.00\n9.00 8.00 0.00 9.00 0.00 5.00 7.00 2.00 9.00 4.00\n4.00 2.00 2.00 7.00 7.00 6.00 0.00 9.00 1.00 1.00\n0.00 4.00 3.00 4.00 7.00 2.00 5.00 2.00 6.00 3.00\n4.00 3.00 4.00 3.00 8.00 9.00 2.00 9.00 6.00 9.00\n4.00 4.00 9.00 8.00 7.00 3.00 2.00 7.00 2.00 6.00\n3.00 6.00 5.00 4.00 8.00 8.00 7.00 0.00 5.00 4.00>>>",
    "Based on the code execution output, we can see that our solution is correct. The output matrix is identical to the input matrix with each number formatted to 2 decimal places, which is exactly what we expect for average pooling with a kernel size of 1.\n\nTo explain why this is correct:\n1. Average pooling with kernel size 1 means we're taking the average of each 1×1 region\n2. The average of a single number is the number itself\n3. Since there's no overlap (stride equals kernel size), we process each element independently\n4. The only modification is formatting each number to show 2 decimal places\n\n<<<2.00 7.00 4.00 0.00 8.00 7.00 4.00 6.00 3.00 3.00\n8.00 5.00 1.00 9.00 8.00 6.00 1.00 4.00 5.00 0.00\n7.00 3.00 5.00 4.00 7.00 3.00 7.00 2.00 5.00 2.00\n9.00 8.00 0.00 9.00 0.00 5.00 7.00 2.00 9.00 4.00\n4.00 2.00 2.00 7.00 7.00 6.00 0.00 9.00 1.00 1.00\n0.00 4.00 3.00 4.00 7.00 2.00 5.00 2.00 6.00 3.00\n4.00 3.00 4.00 3.00 8.00 9.00 2.00 9.00 6.00 9.00\n4.00 4.00 9.00 8.00 7.00 3.00 2.00 7.00 2.00 6.00\n3.00 6.00 5.00 4.00 8.00 8.00 7.00 0.00 5.00 4.00>>>"
