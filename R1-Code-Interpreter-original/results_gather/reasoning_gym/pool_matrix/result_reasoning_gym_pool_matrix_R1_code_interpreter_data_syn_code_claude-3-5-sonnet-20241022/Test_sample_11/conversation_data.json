    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For a kernel size of 3 and given matrix dimensions (2×6):\n   - We need to divide the matrix into 3×3 regions\n   - Since stride = kernel size = 3, there's no overlap\n   - The output matrix will be smaller than input\n\n2. For this specific case:\n   - Input is 2×6 matrix\n   - With kernel size 3, we can fit 2 complete 3×3 regions horizontally\n   - The output will be a 1×2 matrix (since height is only 2, we can only fit 1 region vertically)\n\n3. Let's write code to:\n   - Create the input matrix\n   - Implement average pooling\n   - Format output to 2 decimal places\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [4, 0, 1, 5, 0, 3],\n    [1, 2, 7, 0, 3, 2]\n])\n\nkernel_size = 3\nrows, cols = matrix.shape\noutput_rows = rows // kernel_size\noutput_cols = cols // kernel_size\noutput = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current kernel region\n        region = matrix[\n            i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size,\n            j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size\n        ]\n        # Calculate average of available elements\n        output[i,j] = np.mean(region)\n\n# Format output to 2 decimal places\nformatted_output = ' '.join([f'{x:.2f}' for x in output.flatten()])\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nThe code will:\n1. Create a numpy array from the input matrix\n2. Calculate output dimensions based on kernel size\n3. Perform average pooling by taking mean of each 3×3 region\n4. Format output to 2 decimal places\n\nFor each 3×3 region:\n- First region: [4,0,1,1,2,7] → average = 2.50\n- Second region: [5,0,3,0,3,2] → average = 2.17\n\n<<<2.50 2.17>>>",
    "I notice that the code generated an error. Let me modify the code to be simpler and not rely on numpy, since we're dealing with a straightforward case.\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 0, 1, 5, 0, 3],\n    [1, 2, 7, 0, 3, 2]\n]\n\nkernel_size = 3\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# For kernel size 3, we'll have 2 regions to average\nresult = []\n\n# First region (first 3 columns)\nelements = [\n    matrix[0][0], matrix[0][1], matrix[0][2],\n    matrix[1][0], matrix[1][1], matrix[1][2]\n]\navg1 = sum(elements) / len(elements)\n\n# Second region (last 3 columns)\nelements = [\n    matrix[0][3], matrix[0][4], matrix[0][5],\n    matrix[1][3], matrix[1][4], matrix[1][5]\n]\navg2 = sum(elements) / len(elements)\n\nprint(f\"{avg1:.2f} {avg2:.2f}\")\n```\n\nThis simpler version should work without any dependencies. Let's analyze what it does:\n\n1. For the first region (left half):\n   - Elements: [4,0,1,1,2,7]\n   - Sum = 15\n   - Average = 15/6 = 2.50\n\n2. For the second region (right half):\n   - Elements: [5,0,3,0,3,2]\n   - Sum = 13\n   - Average = 13/6 ≈ 2.17\n\n<<<2.50 2.17>>>",
    "Great! The code executed successfully and produced the correct output. Let me verify the result one final time:\n\n1. The input matrix was divided into two 3×3 regions:\n   - Left region: [4,0,1,1,2,7] → average = 15/6 = 2.50\n   - Right region: [5,0,3,0,3,2] → average = 13/6 ≈ 2.17\n\n2. The output matches our calculations and is formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\nSince we have the correct result and it matches our mathematical verification, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<2.50 2.17>>>"
