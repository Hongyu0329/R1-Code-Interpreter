    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 1, we actually get the same matrix as input since we're taking the maximum of each 1x1 region.\n2. The stride equals the kernel size (1), so there's no overlap.\n3. Since kernel size is 1, the output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix.\n4. We'll write a Python script to:\n   - Convert the input into a matrix\n   - Perform max pooling\n   - Format the output with 2 decimal places\n\nLet's write the code:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 8, 1],\n    [9, 3, 5],\n    [1, 4, 5],\n    [1, 9, 8]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, the output is the same as input\n# Just format to 2 decimal places\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Format output\nresult = []\nfor i in range(rows):\n    row = []\n    for j in range(cols):\n        row.append(f\"{matrix[i][j]:.2f}\")\n    result.append(\" \".join(row))\n\nprint(\"\\n\".join(result))\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element is processed individually, and the maximum of a single number is the number itself. Therefore, we just need to format the original matrix with 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<2.00 8.00 1.00\n9.00 3.00 5.00\n1.00 4.00 5.00\n1.00 9.00 8.00>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1. With a kernel size of 1:\n   - Each pooling operation looks at only one element at a time\n   - The stride is also 1, so we process each element individually\n   - The maximum of a single number is the number itself\n\n2. Therefore, the output matrix:\n   - Has the same dimensions as the input (4Ã—3)\n   - Contains the same values as the input\n   - Is formatted to show 2 decimal places for each number\n\n3. The output shows:\n   - First row: 2.00 8.00 1.00\n   - Second row: 9.00 3.00 5.00\n   - Third row: 1.00 4.00 5.00\n   - Fourth row: 1.00 9.00 8.00\n\nThis is correct because:\n- Each element remains in its original position\n- Each number is formatted to show exactly two decimal places\n- The matrix structure is preserved\n\n<<<2.00 8.00 1.00\n9.00 3.00 5.00\n1.00 4.00 5.00\n1.00 9.00 8.00>>>"
