    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For a kernel size of 3, we'll divide the matrix into 3x3 regions (non-overlapping since stride = kernel size)\n2. The input matrix is 3x6, so we need to determine how many complete 3x3 regions we can fit\n3. We can fit 1 complete region in the height (3÷3=1) and 2 complete regions in the width (6÷3=2)\n4. For each region, we'll find the maximum value\n5. The output matrix will be 1x2 (height=3÷3, width=6÷3)\n\nLet's write code to perform this operation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [6, 2, 8, 0, 4, 5],\n    [5, 5, 4, 7, 8, 0],\n    [7, 4, 1, 4, 2, 6]\n])\n\nkernel_size = 3\nrows, cols = matrix.shape\noutput_rows = rows // kernel_size\noutput_cols = cols // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize output matrix\noutput = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract the current region\n        region = matrix[\n            i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size,\n            j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size\n        ]\n        # Find maximum value in the region\n        output[i,j] = np.max(region)\n\n# Format output to 2 decimal places\nformatted_output = ' '.join([f'{x:.2f}' for x in output.flatten()])\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nThe code divides the matrix into 3x3 regions and finds the maximum value in each region. Let's analyze the regions:\n\nFirst region (left 3x3):\n```\n6 2 8\n5 5 4\n7 4 1\n```\nMaximum = 8\n\nSecond region (right 3x3):\n```\n0 4 5\n7 8 0\n4 2 6\n```\nMaximum = 8\n\nTherefore, the output matrix should be [8.00 8.00]\n\n<<<8.00 8.00>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the correct output. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1. The original matrix was divided into two 3x3 regions:\n\nLeft region:\n```\n6 2 8\n5 5 4\n7 4 1\n```\nMaximum value = 8\n\nRight region:\n```\n0 4 5\n7 8 0\n4 2 6\n```\nMaximum value = 8\n\n2. Since the kernel size is 3 and there's no overlap (stride = kernel size):\n   - The output matrix height = 3 ÷ 3 = 1\n   - The output matrix width = 6 ÷ 3 = 2\n\n3. The output shows \"8.00 8.00\" which represents a 1x2 matrix with both maximum values formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\nThe answer matches our expected output, so I can confirm:\n\n<<<8.00 8.00>>>"
