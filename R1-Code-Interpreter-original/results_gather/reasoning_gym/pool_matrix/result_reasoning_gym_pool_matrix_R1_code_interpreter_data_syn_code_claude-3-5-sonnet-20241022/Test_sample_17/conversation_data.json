    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For average pooling with kernel size 2:\n   - We need to divide the matrix into 2x2 regions (non-overlapping due to stride=2)\n   - Calculate the average of each region\n   - The output matrix will be smaller than the input matrix\n\n2. Given the input matrix dimensions (3×7):\n   - Output matrix will have dimensions: ⌊3/2⌋ × ⌊7/2⌋ = 1×3\n   - Some elements at the right and bottom might be ignored if they don't form complete 2×2 regions\n\n3. Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Perform average pooling\n   - Format the output correctly\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 5, 6, 4, 2, 5, 5],\n    [1, 2, 4, 0, 2, 3, 6],\n    [1, 6, 4, 8, 3, 8, 9]\n]\n\nkernel_size = 2\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Calculate output dimensions\nout_rows = rows // kernel_size\nout_cols = cols // kernel_size\n\n# Perform average pooling\nresult = []\nfor i in range(out_rows):\n    row = []\n    for j in range(out_cols):\n        # Get the 2x2 region\n        values = []\n        for ki in range(kernel_size):\n            for kj in range(kernel_size):\n                values.append(matrix[i*kernel_size + ki][j*kernel_size + kj])\n        # Calculate average and round to 2 decimal places\n        avg = round(sum(values) / len(values), 2)\n        row.append(avg)\n    result.append(row)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \" \".join(str(x) for x in result[0])\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThe code:\n1. Creates the input matrix\n2. Defines kernel size and calculates output dimensions\n3. Iterates through the matrix in 2×2 blocks\n4. Calculates the average for each block\n5. Formats the output with 2 decimal places\n\nThe output shows the average pooling result. Each element in the output matrix represents the average of a 2×2 region from the input matrix:\n- First element: average of [[8,5],[1,2]]\n- Second element: average of [[6,4],[4,0]]\n- Third element: average of [[2,5],[2,3]]\n\n<<<4.00 3.50 3.00>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the correct answer. Let me explain the result:\n\nThe output matrix <<<4.0 3.5 3.0>>> represents the average pooling result where:\n\n1. 4.0 comes from the first 2×2 region:\n   [8 5]\n   [1 2]\n   Average = (8 + 5 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 4.0\n\n2. 3.5 comes from the second 2×2 region:\n   [6 4]\n   [4 0]\n   Average = (6 + 4 + 4 + 0) / 4 = 3.5\n\n3. 3.0 comes from the third 2×2 region:\n   [2 5]\n   [2 3]\n   Average = (2 + 5 + 2 + 3) / 4 = 3.0\n\nNote that the rightmost column of the original matrix [5,6,9] was not used because it didn't form a complete 2×2 region with the kernel size of 2.\n\nThe answer matches our requirements:\n- It's a matrix (in this case 1×3)\n- Values are rounded to 2 decimal places\n- It's properly formatted within triple angle brackets\n\n<<<4.0 3.5 3.0>>>"
