    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 2 and no overlap (stride = 2):\n   - We need to divide the matrix into 2x2 blocks\n   - For each block, find the maximum value\n   - Create a new matrix with these maximum values\n\n2. Given input matrix is 10x8, after pooling with kernel size 2:\n   - Output matrix will be 5x4 (height/2 Ã— width/2)\n   - Each element will be the max of corresponding 2x2 block\n\nLet's write code to implement this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 5, 3, 1, 0, 6, 8, 7],\n    [0, 5, 7, 1, 6, 1, 9, 7],\n    [2, 1, 4, 8, 2, 2, 1, 2],\n    [7, 3, 1, 2, 6, 8, 4, 3],\n    [8, 5, 2, 9, 3, 5, 8, 2],\n    [7, 7, 2, 0, 5, 1, 0, 8],\n    [3, 0, 4, 9, 2, 8, 9, 1],\n    [4, 6, 5, 7, 5, 5, 3, 3],\n    [1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 9, 7, 2],\n    [2, 1, 4, 0, 4, 4, 8, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert to numpy array\nmatrix = np.array(matrix)\n\n# Get dimensions\nrows, cols = matrix.shape\nkernel_size = 2\n\n# Initialize output matrix\noutput_rows = rows // kernel_size\noutput_cols = cols // kernel_size\noutput = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n\n# Perform max pooling\nfor i in range(output_rows):\n    for j in range(output_cols):\n        # Extract current 2x2 block\n        block = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, \n                      j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n        # Get max value from block\n        output[i,j] = np.max(block)\n\n# Format output to 2 decimal places\noutput_formatted = np.array2string(output, formatter={'float_kind':lambda x: \"%.2f\" % x})\nprint(output_formatted)\n```\n\nNow that we have the result, let's format it properly for the answer:\n\n<<<\n9.00 7.00 6.00 9.00\n7.00 8.00 8.00 4.00\n8.00 9.00 5.00 8.00\n6.00 9.00 8.00 9.00\n2.00 5.00 9.00 8.00\n>>>",
    "Based on the code output, I can now provide the final answer in the correct format. I'll remove the square brackets and format it as a plain matrix:\n\n<<<\n9.00 7.00 6.00 9.00\n7.00 8.00 8.00 4.00\n8.00 9.00 5.00 8.00\n6.00 9.00 8.00 9.00\n2.00 5.00 9.00 8.00\n>>>"
