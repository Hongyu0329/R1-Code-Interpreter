    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 1, we actually get the same matrix as input since we're taking the maximum of each 1x1 region.\n2. The stride equals the kernel size (1), so there's no overlap.\n3. Since kernel size is 1, the output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix.\n4. We need to format the numbers to 2 decimal places.\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 2, 2, 6, 7, 0],\n    [9, 0, 2, 7, 4, 5]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, max pooling just returns the same matrix\n# We just need to format the numbers\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Format the output\nresult = \"\"\nfor i in range(rows):\n    row = \" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in matrix[i])\n    result += row\n    if i < rows - 1:\n        result += \"\\n\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThe code will:\n1. Take the input matrix\n2. Format each number to 2 decimal places\n3. Join numbers in each row with spaces\n4. Join rows with newlines\n5. Enclose the result in <<<>>>\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element is processed individually (max of a 1x1 region is the element itself), so the output will be the same matrix with formatted numbers.\n\n<<<5.00 2.00 2.00 6.00 7.00 0.00\n9.00 0.00 2.00 7.00 4.00 5.00>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the correct output. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1. With a kernel size of 1:\n   - Each pooling operation looks at a single element (1x1 region)\n   - The maximum value of a single element is the element itself\n   - Therefore, the output matrix is identical to the input matrix\n\n2. The only transformation we performed was formatting each number to show exactly 2 decimal places:\n   - 5 became 5.00\n   - 2 became 2.00\n   - And so on...\n\n3. The matrix structure remained unchanged:\n   - Same number of rows (2)\n   - Same number of columns (6)\n   - Same element positions\n\n4. The output is correctly formatted:\n   - Numbers are space-separated\n   - Rows are newline-separated\n   - The entire matrix is enclosed in <<<>>>\n\nSince the code executed without errors and produced the expected output, we can confirm this is our final answer:\n\n<<<5.00 2.00 2.00 6.00 7.00 0.00\n9.00 0.00 2.00 7.00 4.00 5.00>>>"
