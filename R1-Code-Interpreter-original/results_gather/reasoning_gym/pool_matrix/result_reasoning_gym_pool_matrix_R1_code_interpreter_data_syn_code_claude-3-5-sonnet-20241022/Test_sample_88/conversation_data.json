    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 1, the output matrix will be the same size as the input matrix since we're essentially looking at each element individually.\n2. With kernel size 1, each element in the output matrix will be equal to the corresponding element in the input matrix.\n3. Let's write a Python code to handle this operation systematically.\n\n```python\ndef max_pooling(matrix, kernel_size):\n    # Convert input string to matrix\n    matrix = [[int(x) for x in row.split()] for row in matrix.strip().split('\\n')]\n    \n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # For kernel_size 1, output is same as input\n    if kernel_size == 1:\n        result = matrix\n    \n    # Format output with 2 decimal places\n    formatted_result = []\n    for row in result:\n        formatted_row = [f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row]\n        formatted_result.append(' '.join(formatted_row))\n    \n    print('\\n'.join(formatted_result))\n\n# Input matrix\ninput_matrix = \"\"\"7 0 8 4 1\n7 1 3 8 9\n4 9 9 6 7\n9 1 9 4 5\n7 2 2 2 0\n0 7 4 2 2\n4 8 5 6 4\n1 9 2 0 5\n7 5 7 8 4\n2 1 6 9 5\"\"\"\n\nmax_pooling(input_matrix, 1)\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element in the output matrix will be exactly the same as the input matrix, just formatted with 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<7.00 0.00 8.00 4.00 1.00\n7.00 1.00 3.00 8.00 9.00\n4.00 9.00 9.00 6.00 7.00\n9.00 1.00 9.00 4.00 5.00\n7.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 0.00\n0.00 7.00 4.00 2.00 2.00\n4.00 8.00 5.00 6.00 4.00\n1.00 9.00 2.00 0.00 5.00\n7.00 5.00 7.00 8.00 4.00\n2.00 1.00 6.00 9.00 5.00>>>",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches our expected result. Let me explain why this is correct:\n\n1. With a kernel size of 1:\n   - Each element is processed individually\n   - No aggregation is needed since we're looking at one element at a time\n   - The output matrix has the same dimensions as the input matrix (10Ã—5)\n\n2. The only transformation applied is formatting each number to show 2 decimal places:\n   - Integer values like 7 become 7.00\n   - Zero becomes 0.00\n   - All other numbers follow the same pattern\n\n3. The output preserves all the original values from the input matrix, just with decimal formatting.\n\nSince the code executed without errors and produced the correct output, I can now provide the final answer:\n\n<<<7.00 0.00 8.00 4.00 1.00\n7.00 1.00 3.00 8.00 9.00\n4.00 9.00 9.00 6.00 7.00\n9.00 1.00 9.00 4.00 5.00\n7.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 0.00\n0.00 7.00 4.00 2.00 2.00\n4.00 8.00 5.00 6.00 4.00\n1.00 9.00 2.00 0.00 5.00\n7.00 5.00 7.00 8.00 4.00\n2.00 1.00 6.00 9.00 5.00>>>"
