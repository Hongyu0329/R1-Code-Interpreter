    "Let me help you solve this max/min pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For kernel size = 1, the output matrix will be the same size as the input matrix since we're essentially looking at each element individually.\n2. With stride = kernel size = 1, we're not actually doing any pooling; the output will be identical to the input.\n3. Let's write a Python code to handle this and format the output properly.\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 3, 1, 4, 0, 0, 6],\n    [6, 2, 0, 6, 6, 0, 7],\n    [8, 2, 2, 5, 2, 5, 9],\n    [2, 6, 2, 1, 5, 6, 0],\n    [5, 2, 6, 6, 5, 6, 2],\n    [2, 5, 4, 7, 3, 2, 0],\n    [3, 3, 6, 0, 2, 1, 6],\n    [9, 3, 9, 1, 7, 4, 2],\n    [1, 6, 3, 5, 0, 7, 4],\n    [2, 1, 9, 3, 0, 3, 0]\n]\n\nkernel_size = 1\n\n# For kernel_size = 1, output is same as input\n# Format output with 2 decimal places\noutput = \"\"\nfor row in matrix:\n    output += \" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row) + \"\\n\"\n\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix, just formatted with 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<0.00 3.00 1.00 4.00 0.00 0.00 6.00\n6.00 2.00 0.00 6.00 6.00 0.00 7.00\n8.00 2.00 2.00 5.00 2.00 5.00 9.00\n2.00 6.00 2.00 1.00 5.00 6.00 0.00\n5.00 2.00 6.00 6.00 5.00 6.00 2.00\n2.00 5.00 4.00 7.00 3.00 2.00 0.00\n3.00 3.00 6.00 0.00 2.00 1.00 6.00\n9.00 3.00 9.00 1.00 7.00 4.00 2.00\n1.00 6.00 3.00 5.00 0.00 7.00 4.00\n2.00 1.00 9.00 3.00 0.00 3.00 0.00>>>",
