    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For a kernel size of 3, we need to:\n   - Process 3x3 regions of the input matrix\n   - Calculate the average of each region\n   - The stride equals kernel size (3), so there's no overlap\n2. Given the input matrix is 3x4, and kernel size is 3:\n   - We can only fit one complete 3x3 region\n   - The output matrix will be 1x1\n3. Let's write code to:\n   - Create the input matrix\n   - Implement average pooling\n   - Format the output correctly\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [2, 2, 4, 4],\n    [5, 2, 5, 1],\n    [1, 8, 1, 2]\n])\n\nkernel_size = 3\n\ndef average_pooling(matrix, kernel_size):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    output_rows = rows // kernel_size\n    output_cols = cols // kernel_size\n    result = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols))\n    \n    for i in range(output_rows):\n        for j in range(output_cols):\n            # Extract the region\n            region = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, \n                          j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n            # Calculate average if the region is complete\n            if region.shape == (kernel_size, kernel_size):\n                result[i,j] = np.mean(region)\n    \n    return result\n\nresult = average_pooling(matrix, kernel_size)\n\n# Format output to 2 decimal places\noutput = np.round(result, decimals=2)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThe code has executed, and we can now provide the final answer.\n\nThe average pooling operation with kernel size 3 results in a 1x1 matrix containing the average of the first 3x3 region. The average of [2,2,4,5,2,5,1,8,1] is 3.33.\n\n<<<3.33>>>",
    "Let me explain the output format. The code returned [[3.33]] which is a 1x1 matrix, but the question asks for a simple format within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe average pooling operation was correct:\n1. We took the only possible 3x3 region from the 3x4 input matrix:\n```\n2 2 4\n5 2 5\n1 8 1\n```\n2. Calculated the average: (2+2+4+5+2+5+1+8+1)/9 = 3.33\n\nLet me provide the answer in the requested format:\n\n<<<3.33>>>"
