    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For a kernel size of 3, we'll divide the 6x6 input matrix into non-overlapping 3x3 regions\n2. The output matrix will be 2x2 since 6÷3 = 2\n3. For each 3x3 region, we'll calculate the average of all elements\n4. We need to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Split it into 3x3 regions\n   - Calculate averages\n   - Format the output correctly\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 6, 3, 8, 9, 1],\n    [2, 1, 7, 8, 5, 2],\n    [8, 6, 3, 2, 5, 0],\n    [3, 4, 0, 6, 6, 9],\n    [5, 7, 0, 2, 5, 8],\n    [7, 9, 4, 0, 7, 0]\n]\n\nkernel_size = 3\nn = len(matrix)\noutput_size = n // kernel_size\n\n# Initialize output matrix\noutput = [[0 for _ in range(output_size)] for _ in range(output_size)]\n\n# Perform average pooling\nfor i in range(output_size):\n    for j in range(output_size):\n        # Calculate average for each 3x3 region\n        sum_region = 0\n        for ki in range(kernel_size):\n            for kj in range(kernel_size):\n                sum_region += matrix[i*kernel_size + ki][j*kernel_size + kj]\n        output[i][j] = round(sum_region / (kernel_size * kernel_size), 2)\n\n# Format and print output\nresult = \"\"\nfor row in output:\n    result += \" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row) + \"\\n\"\nprint(result.strip())\n```\n\nNow that we have the result, let's format it properly for the answer:\n\n<<<4.11 5.33\n5.44 4.11>>>",
    "I notice that my answer doesn't match the code output. Let me verify the calculations manually to ensure accuracy.\n\nFor a 3x3 kernel, let's check each region:\n\nTop-left region (3x3):\n1 6 3\n2 1 7\n8 6 3\nSum = 37, Average = 37/9 = 4.11 ✓\n\nTop-right region (3x3):\n8 9 1\n8 5 2\n2 5 0\nSum = 40, Average = 40/9 ≈ 4.44 ✓\n\nBottom-left region (3x3):\n3 4 0\n5 7 0\n7 9 4\nSum = 39, Average = 39/9 ≈ 4.33 ✓\n\nBottom-right region (3x3):\n6 6 9\n2 5 8\n0 7 0\nSum = 43, Average = 43/9 ≈ 4.78 ✓\n\nThe code output is correct, and I made a mistake in my previous answer. Here's the correct answer:\n\n<<<4.11 4.44\n4.33 4.78>>>"
