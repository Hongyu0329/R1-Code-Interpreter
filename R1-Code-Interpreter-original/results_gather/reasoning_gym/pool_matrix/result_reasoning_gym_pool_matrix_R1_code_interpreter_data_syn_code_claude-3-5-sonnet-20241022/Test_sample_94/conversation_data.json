    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For average pooling with kernel size 1, each element in the output matrix will be the average of a 1x1 region in the input matrix.\n2. Since kernel size = 1, the output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix.\n3. With kernel size 1, each element will essentially remain the same as there's no actual pooling happening.\n4. We need to format the output to 2 decimal places.\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 1, 3, 0, 4, 9, 6, 1, 8],\n    [2, 9, 6, 0, 6, 2, 0, 6, 3]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, we just need to format each number to 2 decimal places\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create output string\noutput = \"\"\nfor i in range(rows):\n    row_str = \" \".join([f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in matrix[i]])\n    output += row_str + \"\\n\"\n\n# Remove trailing newline and print\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nThe code simply formats each number to 2 decimal places and maintains the same matrix structure.\n\n<<<6.00 1.00 3.00 0.00 4.00 9.00 6.00 1.00 8.00\n2.00 9.00 6.00 0.00 6.00 2.00 0.00 6.00 3.00>>>",
    "Based on the code execution output, we have successfully processed the matrix with average pooling using kernel size 1. Since the kernel size is 1, each element is simply averaged with itself, resulting in the same values but formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\nLet me provide the final answer in the requested format:\n\n<<<6.00 1.00 3.00 0.00 4.00 9.00 6.00 1.00 8.00\n2.00 9.00 6.00 0.00 6.00 2.00 0.00 6.00 3.00>>>"
