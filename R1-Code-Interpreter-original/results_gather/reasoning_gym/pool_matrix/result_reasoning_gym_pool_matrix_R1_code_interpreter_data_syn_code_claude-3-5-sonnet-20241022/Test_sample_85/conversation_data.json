    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For average pooling with kernel size 1, each element in the output matrix will be the average of values within a 1x1 window.\n2. Since kernel size equals stride (no overlap), and kernel size is 1:\n   - Each element will be itself (average of 1x1 window is the element itself)\n   - Output matrix will have the same dimensions as input matrix\n3. Let's write code to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Perform average pooling\n   - Format output to 2 decimal places\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 0, 1, 7],\n    [3, 1, 5, 1],\n    [0, 2, 9, 2],\n    [6, 2, 5, 1],\n    [1, 6, 7, 6]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, each element remains the same\n# Just format to 2 decimal places\nresult = []\nfor row in matrix:\n    formatted_row = [f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row]\n    result.append(\" \".join(formatted_row))\n\nprint(\"\\n\".join(result))\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1:\n1. Each element is averaged with itself only\n2. The output matrix will be identical to the input matrix\n3. We just need to format each number to have 2 decimal places\n\n<<<0.00 0.00 1.00 7.00\n3.00 1.00 5.00 1.00\n0.00 2.00 9.00 2.00\n6.00 2.00 5.00 1.00\n1.00 6.00 7.00 6.00>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output. Let me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1. With a kernel size of 1:\n   - Each pooling window is 1x1\n   - The stride equals the kernel size (1)\n   - Therefore, each element is processed individually\n\n2. In average pooling:\n   - We take the average of all elements in the kernel window\n   - With a 1x1 kernel, we're averaging each element with itself\n   - So each element remains unchanged\n\n3. The output formatting:\n   - All numbers are shown with exactly 2 decimal places\n   - The matrix maintains its original 5x4 dimensions\n   - The spacing and layout match the input format\n\nThe output matches our expectations perfectly, so I can confirm this is the final answer:\n\n<<<0.00 0.00 1.00 7.00\n3.00 1.00 5.00 1.00\n0.00 2.00 9.00 2.00\n6.00 2.00 5.00 1.00\n1.00 6.00 7.00 6.00>>>"
