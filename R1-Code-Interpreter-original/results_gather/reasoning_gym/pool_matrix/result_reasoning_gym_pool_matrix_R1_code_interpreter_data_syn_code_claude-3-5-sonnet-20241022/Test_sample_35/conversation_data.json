    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what max pooling with kernel size 2 means:\n   - We divide the matrix into 2x2 regions (where possible)\n   - For each region, we take the maximum value\n   - Since stride = kernel size = 2, there's no overlap\n\n2) For a 3x3 input matrix with kernel size 2:\n   - We can only form complete 2x2 regions in the top-left corner\n   - The output will be a smaller matrix (in this case, 1x1)\n   - Other elements that don't form a complete 2x2 region are discarded\n\n3) Let's write code to perform this operation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [3, 5, 5],\n    [7, 9, 9],\n    [3, 6, 9]\n])\n\ndef max_pooling(matrix, kernel_size):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    # Calculate output dimensions\n    out_rows = rows // kernel_size\n    out_cols = cols // kernel_size\n    \n    result = np.zeros((out_rows, out_cols))\n    \n    # Perform max pooling\n    for i in range(out_rows):\n        for j in range(out_cols):\n            # Extract the region and find maximum\n            region = matrix[i*kernel_size:(i+1)*kernel_size, \n                          j*kernel_size:(j+1)*kernel_size]\n            result[i,j] = np.max(region)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Perform max pooling with kernel size 2\nresult = max_pooling(matrix, 2)\n\n# Format output to 2 decimal places\noutput = np.array2string(result, formatter={'float_kind':lambda x: \"%.2f\" % x})\nprint(output)\n```\n\n4) Looking at the 2x2 region in the top-left corner:\n   ```\n   3 5\n   7 9\n   ```\n   The maximum value is 9.\n\n5) This will be the only element in our output matrix since we can only form one complete 2x2 region.\n\n<<<9.00>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and gave us the output [[9.00]], which represents a 1x1 matrix containing the value 9.00.\n\nLet me explain why this is the correct answer:\n\n1) With the original 3x3 matrix:\n```\n3 5 5\n7 9 9\n3 6 9\n```\n\n2) Using a kernel size of 2 means:\n- We can only process complete 2x2 regions\n- With stride = 2 (no overlap), we can only fit one 2x2 region in the top-left corner:\n```\n[3 5]\n[7 9]\n```\n\n3) The max pooling operation takes the maximum value in this 2x2 region, which is 9.\n\n4) The remaining elements of the original matrix (the right column and bottom row) don't form complete 2x2 regions, so they are not included in the output.\n\n5) Therefore, our final output is a 1x1 matrix containing just the value 9.00.\n\n<<<9.00>>>"
