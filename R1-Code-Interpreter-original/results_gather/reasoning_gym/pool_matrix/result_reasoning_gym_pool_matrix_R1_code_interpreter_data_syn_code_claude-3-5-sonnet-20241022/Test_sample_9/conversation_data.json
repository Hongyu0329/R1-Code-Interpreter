    "Let me help you solve this average pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For average pooling with kernel size 1, each element in the output matrix will be the average of a 1x1 region in the input matrix.\n2. Since kernel size equals stride (no overlap), and kernel size is 1, the output matrix will be the same size as the input matrix.\n3. With kernel size 1, each element will essentially remain the same as it's averaging only itself.\n4. We need to format the output to 2 decimal places.\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 3, 2, 0, 1, 3, 9],\n    [7, 5, 8, 3, 3, 2, 6],\n    [0, 4, 6, 9, 3, 8, 4],\n    [7, 6, 1, 5, 2, 1, 5],\n    [3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4],\n    [5, 4, 5, 7, 6, 2, 4],\n    [5, 8, 4, 6, 1, 4, 9],\n    [9, 5, 2, 4, 4, 4, 3]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, average pooling will keep the same values\n# but we need to format them to 2 decimal places\nresult = []\nfor row in matrix:\n    formatted_row = [f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in row]\n    print(\" \".join(formatted_row))\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element is averaged with itself, so the values remain the same. The only change is formatting to 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<0.00 3.00 2.00 0.00 1.00 3.00 9.00\n7.00 5.00 8.00 3.00 3.00 2.00 6.00\n0.00 4.00 6.00 9.00 3.00 8.00 4.00\n7.00 6.00 1.00 5.00 2.00 1.00 5.00\n3.00 2.00 4.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00\n5.00 4.00 5.00 7.00 6.00 2.00 4.00\n5.00 8.00 4.00 6.00 1.00 4.00 9.00\n9.00 5.00 2.00 4.00 4.00 4.00 3.00>>>",
