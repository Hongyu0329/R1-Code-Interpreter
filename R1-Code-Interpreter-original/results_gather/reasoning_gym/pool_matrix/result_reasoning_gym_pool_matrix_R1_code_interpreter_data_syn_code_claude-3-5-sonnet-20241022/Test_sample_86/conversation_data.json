    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 1, we actually get the same matrix as input since we're taking the maximum of each 1x1 region.\n2. The stride equals the kernel size (1), so there's no overlap.\n3. Since kernel size is 1, the output matrix will have the same dimensions as the input matrix.\n4. We need to format the numbers to 2 decimal places.\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 9, 2, 9, 8, 0],\n    [8, 5, 9, 2, 2, 3],\n    [1, 1, 8, 3, 4, 1],\n    [8, 5, 9, 1, 3, 6]\n]\n\n# For kernel size 1, we just need to format each number\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create output string\noutput = \"\"\nfor i in range(rows):\n    row_str = \" \".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in matrix[i])\n    output += row_str + \"\\n\"\n\n# Remove trailing newline and print\nprint(output.strip())\n```\n\nSince the kernel size is 1, each element remains the same but needs to be formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<0.00 9.00 2.00 9.00 8.00 0.00\n8.00 5.00 9.00 2.00 2.00 3.00\n1.00 1.00 8.00 3.00 4.00 1.00\n8.00 5.00 9.00 1.00 3.00 6.00>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors. Since this was a max pooling operation with kernel size 1, each element in the input matrix remains unchanged, only formatted to display with 2 decimal places. The output matches our expectations exactly.\n\nLet me confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<0.00 9.00 2.00 9.00 8.00 0.00\n8.00 5.00 9.00 2.00 2.00 3.00\n1.00 1.00 8.00 3.00 4.00 1.00\n8.00 5.00 9.00 1.00 3.00 6.00>>>"
