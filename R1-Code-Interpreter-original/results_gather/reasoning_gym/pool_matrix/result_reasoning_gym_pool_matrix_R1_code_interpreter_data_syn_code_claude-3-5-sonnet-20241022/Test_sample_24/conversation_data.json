    "Let me help you solve this max pooling problem.\n\nThinking process:\n1. For max pooling with kernel size 2:\n   - We need to group elements in 2x2 blocks\n   - Take the maximum value from each block\n   - The output matrix will be smaller than input\n2. Given a 10x2 matrix, with kernel size 2:\n   - Output will be 5x1 matrix (10/2 = 5 rows)\n3. Need to:\n   - Parse the input matrix\n   - Process it in 2x2 blocks\n   - Find max in each block\n   - Format output to 2 decimal places\n\nLet's write code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 4],\n    [0, 2],\n    [9, 7],\n    [6, 4],\n    [9, 7],\n    [1, 8],\n    [2, 0],\n    [5, 6],\n    [1, 9],\n    [5, 5]\n]\n\n# Perform max pooling\nkernel_size = 2\nresult = []\n\n# Process matrix in blocks of kernel_size\nfor i in range(0, len(matrix), kernel_size):\n    block = matrix[i:i+kernel_size]  # Get 2x2 block\n    # Flatten block and find maximum\n    max_val = max(max(row) for row in block)\n    result.append(max_val)\n\n# Format output\noutput = \"\\n\".join(f\"{x:.2f}\" for x in result)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nNow that we have the result, let's format it as requested:\n\n<<<5.00\n9.00\n9.00\n6.00\n9.00>>>\n\nThe process:\n1. First block (5,4,0,2) -> max is 5\n2. Second block (9,7,6,4) -> max is 9\n3. Third block (9,7,1,8) -> max is 9\n4. Fourth block (2,0,5,6) -> max is 6\n5. Fifth block (1,9,5,5) -> max is 9",
    "The code executed correctly and provided the expected output. Let me explain the result:\n\nThe max pooling operation with kernel size 2 worked as follows:\n\n1. First 2x2 block:\n   ```\n   5 4\n   0 2\n   ```\n   Maximum = 5.00\n\n2. Second 2x2 block:\n   ```\n   9 7\n   6 4\n   ```\n   Maximum = 9.00\n\n3. Third 2x2 block:\n   ```\n   9 7\n   1 8\n   ```\n   Maximum = 9.00\n\n4. Fourth 2x2 block:\n   ```\n   2 0\n   5 6\n   ```\n   Maximum = 6.00\n\n5. Fifth 2x2 block:\n   ```\n   1 9\n   5 5\n   ```\n   Maximum = 9.00\n\nThe output matches our expectations, with each value representing the maximum value found in each 2x2 block of the original matrix, formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n<<<5.00\n9.00\n9.00\n6.00\n9.00>>>"
