However, I can explain the logic and expected outcome.\n\nThe approach involves using a topological sort to detect cycles in the graph of courses and prerequisites. Here's a summary of the steps:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph using an adjacency list. Each course is a node, and a prerequisite relationship is a directed edge.\n\n2. **In-Degree Calculation**: Calculate the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each course.\n\n3. **Queue Initialization**: Initialize a queue with all courses that have an in-degree of 0 (courses with no prerequisites).\n\n4. **Topological Sort**: Perform a topological sort by repeatedly removing courses with in-degree 0 from the queue, reducing the in-degree of their neighbors, and adding neighbors with in-degree 0 to the queue.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection**: If the number of courses processed equals the total number of courses, there is no cycle, and all courses can be completed. Otherwise, a cycle exists, and not all courses can be completed.\n\nGiven the prerequisites, the graph has cycles, so the expected result is `False`. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
