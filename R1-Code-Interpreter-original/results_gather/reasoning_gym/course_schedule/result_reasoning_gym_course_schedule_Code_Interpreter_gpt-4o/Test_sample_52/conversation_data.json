    "\nassistant > To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed.\n\nWe can use a topological sorting approach or a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.
