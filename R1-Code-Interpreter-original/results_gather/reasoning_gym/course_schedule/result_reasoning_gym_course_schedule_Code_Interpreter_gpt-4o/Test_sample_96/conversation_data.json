    "\nassistant > To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we can model this problem as a graph and check for cycles. Each course is a node, and each prerequisite is a directed edge. If there is a cycle in the graph, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed.\n\nWe can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to detect cycles in the graph. If a cycle is detected, it means it's not possible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's implement this approach to find the solution.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    # Create a graph from the prerequisites\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n    \n    # Track visited nodes to detect cycles\n    visited = [0] * num_courses  # 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    \n    def has_cycle(v):\n        if visited[v] == 1:  # Cycle detected\n            return True\n        if visited[v] == 2:  # Already visited node\n            return False\n        \n        # Mark the node as visiting\n        visited[v] = 1\n        for neighbor in graph[v]:\n            if has_cycle(neighbor):\n                return True\n        \n        # Mark the node as visited\n        visited[v] = 2\n        return False\n    \n    # Check each course for cycles\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if has_cycle(course):\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Given prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(0, 1), (0, 5), (4, 0), (2, 5), (1, 5), (4, 5), (3, 0)]\nnum_courses = 6\n\n# Determine if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nresult\nassistant > The result is that it is possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites.
