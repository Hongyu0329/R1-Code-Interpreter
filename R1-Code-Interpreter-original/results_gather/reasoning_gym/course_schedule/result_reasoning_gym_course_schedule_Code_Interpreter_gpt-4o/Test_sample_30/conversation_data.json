    "\nassistant > To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we can model this problem as a graph and check for cycles. Each course is a node, and each prerequisite is a directed edge from one node to another. If there is a cycle in the graph, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. We can use a topological sort or a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.\n\nLet's implement this approach to check for cycles in the graph.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    # Create a graph from the prerequisites\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    indegree = [0] * num_courses\n    \n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n        indegree[course] += 1\n    \n    # Use a queue to perform a topological sort\n    queue = deque([i for i in range(num_courses) if indegree[i] == 0])\n    visited_courses = 0\n    \n    while queue:\n        course = queue.popleft()\n        visited_courses += 1\n        for neighbor in graph[course]:\n            indegree[neighbor] -= 1\n            if indegree[neighbor] == 0:\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n    \n    # If we visited all courses, it means we can finish all courses\n    return visited_courses == num_courses\n\n# Given prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(3, 0), (4, 0), (7, 8), (1, 4), (5, 0), (3, 5), (8, 4), (6, 0), (2, 4)]\nnum_courses = 9\n\n# Check if we can finish all courses\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nresult\nassistant > The result is that it is possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites.
