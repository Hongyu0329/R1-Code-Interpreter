    "\nassistant > To determine if you can finish all courses given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and you cannot complete all courses. If there is no cycle, you can complete all courses.\n\nWe can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.
