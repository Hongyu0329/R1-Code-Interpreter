    "\nassistant > To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we can model this problem as a graph and check for cycles. Each course is a node, and a prerequisite relationship is a directed edge. If there is a cycle in the graph, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed.\n\nWe can use a topological sort to detect cycles in the graph. If a topological sort is possible, it means there are no cycles, and all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    # Create a graph and in-degree array\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    in_degree = [0] * num_courses\n    \n    # Build the graph and fill in-degree array\n    for dest, src in prerequisites:\n        graph[src].append(dest)\n        in_degree[dest] += 1\n    \n    # Initialize a queue with all courses having in-degree 0\n    queue = deque([i for i in range(num_courses) if in_degree[i] == 0])\n    \n    # Count of courses that can be completed\n    completed_courses = 0\n    \n    while queue:\n        course = queue.popleft()\n        completed_courses += 1\n        \n        # Decrease the in-degree of neighboring courses\n        for neighbor in graph[course]:\n            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1\n            # If in-degree becomes 0, add to queue\n            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n    \n    # If completed courses equal total courses, return True\n    return completed_courses == num_courses\n\n# Given prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(5, 8), (3, 8), (6, 8), (4, 8), (6, 2), (0, 7), (4, 2), (7, 5), (5, 3), (1, 8), (8, 2), (1, 6), (3, 4)]\nnum_courses = 9\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nresult\nassistant > The result is that all courses can be completed given the prerequisites.
