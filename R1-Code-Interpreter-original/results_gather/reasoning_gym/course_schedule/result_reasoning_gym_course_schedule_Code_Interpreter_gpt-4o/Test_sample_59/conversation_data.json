    "\nassistant > To determine if you can finish all courses given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and you cannot complete all courses. If there is no cycle, you can complete all courses.\n\nWe can use a topological sort algorithm to detect cycles in the graph. If we can perform a topological sort of the graph, it means there is no cycle, and you can finish all courses.\n\nLet's implement this logic.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    # Create an array to track the in-degree of each node\n    in_degree = [0] * num_courses\n    \n    # Build the graph and populate in-degree array\n    for dest, src in prerequisites:\n        graph[src].append(dest)\n        in_degree[dest] += 1\n    \n    # Initialize a queue with all nodes having in-degree 0\n    queue = deque([i for i in range(num_courses) if in_degree[i] == 0])\n    \n    # Count of nodes processed\n    count = 0\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Process a node with in-degree 0\n        node = queue.popleft()\n        count += 1\n        \n        # Decrease the in-degree of its neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1\n            # If in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue\n            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n    \n    # If count of processed nodes is equal to the number of courses, return True\n    return count == num_courses\n\n# Given prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (2, 0), (4, 1)]\nnum_courses = 5\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nresult\nassistant > The result is that you can finish all courses given the prerequisites.
