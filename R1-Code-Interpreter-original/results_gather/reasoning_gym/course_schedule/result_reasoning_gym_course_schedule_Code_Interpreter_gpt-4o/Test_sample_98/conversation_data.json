    "\nassistant > To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we can model this problem as a graph and check for cycles. Each course is a node, and each prerequisite is a directed edge from one node to another. If there is a cycle in the graph, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. Otherwise, all courses can be completed.\n\nWe can use a topological sort to detect cycles in the graph. If a topological sort is possible, it means the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    # Create an array to track the in-degree of each node\n    in_degree = [0] * num_courses\n    \n    # Build the graph and in-degree array\n    for dest, src in prerequisites:\n        graph[src].append(dest)\n        in_degree[dest] += 1\n    \n    # Initialize a queue with all nodes having in-degree 0\n    queue = deque([i for i in range(num_courses) if in_degree[i] == 0])\n    \n    # Count of nodes processed\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Process nodes with in-degree 0\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()\n        count += 1\n        # Decrease the in-degree of neighboring nodes\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1\n            # If in-degree becomes 0, add to queue\n            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n    \n    # If count of processed nodes equals the number of courses, return True\n    return count == num_courses\n\n# Given prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(5, 7), (0, 2), (4, 3), (7, 2), (3, 0), (6, 0), (8, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (6, 7)]\nnum_courses = 9\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nresult\nassistant > The result is that all courses can be completed given the prerequisites.
