    "\nassistant > To determine if you can finish all courses given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and you cannot complete all courses. If there is no cycle, it means you can complete all courses.\n\nWe can use a topological sort algorithm to detect cycles in the graph.

Let me provide you with a detailed explanation of the logic and the expected outcome.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: We represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node `b_i` to node `a_i` indicates that course `b_i` is a prerequisite for course `a_i`.\n\n2. **In-degree Calculation**: We calculate the in-degree for each course, which is the number of prerequisites it has.\n\n3. **Queue Initialization**: We initialize a queue with all courses that have an in-degree of 0, meaning they have no prerequisites and can be taken immediately.\n\n4. **Topological Sort**: We perform a topological sort by"
