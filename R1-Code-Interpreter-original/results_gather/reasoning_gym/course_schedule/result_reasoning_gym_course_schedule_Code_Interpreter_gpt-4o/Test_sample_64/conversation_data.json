    "\nassistant > To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed.\n\nWe can use a topological sort approach or a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. Let's implement this using DFS. If we find a cycle, we return `False`; otherwise, we return `True`.\n\nLet's proceed with the implementation.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    # Create a graph from the prerequisites\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n    \n    # States: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    state = [0] * num_courses\n    \n    def has_cycle(v):\n        if state[v] == 1:  # Found a cycle\n            return True\n        if state[v] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return False\n        \n        # Mark the current node as visiting\n        state[v] = 1\n        # Visit all the neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph[v]:\n            if has_cycle(neighbor):\n                return True\n        \n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        state[v] = 2\n        return False\n    \n    # Check each course for cycles\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if state[course] == 0:  # Unvisited\n            if has_cycle(course):\n                return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Given prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(5, 0), (5, 6), (3, 5), (0, 3), (4, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 4), (0, 6), (3, 0), (6, 2), (2, 4), (0, 4)]\nnum_courses = 7\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nresult\nassistant > The presence of a cycle in the course prerequisites indicates that not all courses can be completed.
