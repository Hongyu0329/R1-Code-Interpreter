However, I can guide you through the logic of solving this problem manually.\n\nTo determine if all courses can be completed, we need to check for cycles in the graph formed by the prerequisites. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how you can do this:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph. Each course is a node, and each prerequisite is a directed edge from one node to another.\n\n2. **Cycle Detection**: Use a Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. If a cycle is detected, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed.\n\n3. **DFS Implementation**:\n   - Maintain a `visited` list to track the state of each node: unvisited (0), visiting (1), and visited (2).\n   - For each course, perform a DFS. If you encounter a node that is already in the \"visiting\" state, a cycle is detected.\n   - If a cycle is detected during the DFS, return `False`.\n   - If no cycles are detected after checking all courses, return `True`.\n\nGiven the prerequisites `[(4, 3), (1, 4), (3, 0), (2, 3), (4, 0), (0, 2), (2, 0), (1, 2), (3, 1)]`, you can manually trace the DFS to check for cycles.\n\nIf you follow these steps, you will find that there is a cycle in the graph, indicating that not all courses can be completed. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
