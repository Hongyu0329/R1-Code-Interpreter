However, I can explain the logic and expected outcome based on the algorithm.\n\nThe algorithm uses a topological sort approach to determine if all courses can be completed. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Each course is represented as a node, and each prerequisite is a directed edge from one node to another.\n\n2. **In-Degree Calculation**: We calculate the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each node. A node with an in-degree of 0 can be taken without any prerequisites.\n\n3. **Queue Initialization**: We initialize a queue with all nodes that have an in-degree of 0.\n\n4. **Topological Sort**: We process each node in the queue, reducing the in-degree of its neighbors. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, it is added to the queue.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection**: If we can process all nodes (i.e., the number of processed nodes equals the total number of courses), there is no cycle, and all courses can be completed. Otherwise, a cycle exists, and not all courses can be completed.\n\nGiven the prerequisites provided, the algorithm would detect a cycle, indicating that not all courses can be completed. Therefore, the expected output is:\n\n```\n<<<False>>>\n```"
