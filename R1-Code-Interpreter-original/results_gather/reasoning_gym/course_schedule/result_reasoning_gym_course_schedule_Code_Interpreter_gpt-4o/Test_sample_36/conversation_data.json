    "\nassistant > To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we can model this problem as a graph and check for cycles. Each course is a node, and each prerequisite is a directed edge from one node to another. If there is a cycle in the graph, it means there is a circular dependency, and it is impossible to complete all courses. We can use a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    # Create a graph from the prerequisites\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n    \n    # Track visited nodes to detect cycles\n    visited = [0] * num_courses  # 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    \n    def dfs(course):\n        if visited[course] == 1:  # Cycle detected\n            return False\n        if visited[course] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return True\n        \n        # Mark the course as visiting\n        visited[course] = 1\n        \n        # Visit all the prerequisites\n        for next_course in graph[course]:\n            if not dfs(next_course):\n                return False\n        \n        # Mark the course as visited\n        visited[course] = 2\n        return True\n    \n    # Check each course\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if not dfs(course):\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Given prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(5, 6), (0, 5), (7, 1), (5, 2), (3, 0), (1, 9), (7, 6), (8, 2), (2, 0), (4, 0), (9, 2), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 7), (4, 5), (7, 4)]\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 10\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\ncan_finish = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\ncan_finish\nassistant > The result is that it is not possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites.
