    "\nassistant > To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nWe can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to detect cycles in the graph.
