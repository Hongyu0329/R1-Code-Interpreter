    "\nassistant > To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we can model this problem as a graph and check for cycles. Each course is a node, and each prerequisite is a directed edge from one node to another. If there is a cycle in the graph, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. We can use a topological sort or a cycle detection algorithm to solve this.\n\nLet's implement this using a cycle detection algorithm in a directed graph. We'll use Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles. If a cycle is detected, it means not all courses can be completed. Otherwise, they can be completed.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    # Create a graph from the prerequisites\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n    \n    # States: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    state = [0] * num_courses\n    \n    def has_cycle(v):\n        if state[v] == 1:  # Found a cycle\n            return True\n        if state[v] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return False\n        \n        # Mark the current node as visiting\n        state[v] = 1\n        # Visit all the neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph[v]:\n            if has_cycle(neighbor):\n                return True\n        \n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        state[v] = 2\n        return False\n    \n    # Check each course for cycles\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if state[course] == 0:  # Unvisited\n            if has_cycle(course):\n                return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Given prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(1, 7), (7, 4), (2, 1), (6, 2), (0, 2), (2, 4), (5, 2), (3, 4)]\nnum_courses = 8\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nresult\nassistant > The result is that all courses can be completed given the prerequisites.
