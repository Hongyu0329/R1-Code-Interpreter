    "\nassistant > To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for cycles in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nWe can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to detect cycles in the graph.
