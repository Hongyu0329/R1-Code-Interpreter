    "\nassistant > To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. We can use a topological sort or a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.\n\nLet's represent the courses and their prerequisites as a directed graph and use DFS to check for cycles. If a cycle is detected, it means not all courses can be completed. Otherwise, they can be completed.\n\nLet's implement this logic.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    # Create a graph from the prerequisites\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n    \n    # Track visited nodes to detect cycles\n    visited = [0] * num_courses  # 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    \n    def dfs(course):\n        if visited[course] == 1:  # Cycle detected\n            return False\n        if visited[course] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return True\n        \n        # Mark the course as visiting\n        visited[course] = 1\n        \n        # Visit all the prerequisites\n        for next_course in graph[course]:\n            if not dfs(next_course):\n                return False\n        \n        # Mark the course as visited\n        visited[course] = 2\n        return True\n    \n    # Check each course\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if not dfs(course):\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Given prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(0, 2), (2, 4), (6, 3), (0, 9), (8, 1), (2, 3), (9, 5), (1, 5), (7, 9), (6, 4), (5, 4), (3, 4), (8, 3), (7, 1)]\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 10\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nresult\nassistant > The result is that all courses can be completed given the prerequisites.
