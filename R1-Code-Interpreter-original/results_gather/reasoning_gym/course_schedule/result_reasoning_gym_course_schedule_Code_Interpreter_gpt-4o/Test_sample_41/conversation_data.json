    "\nassistant > To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed.\n\nWe can use a topological sort approach to detect cycles in the graph. If we can perform a topological sort of the graph, it means there are no cycles, and all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    # Create an array to keep track of in-degrees\n    in_degree = [0] * num_courses\n    \n    # Build the graph and in-degree array\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n        in_degree[course] += 1\n    \n    # Initialize a queue with all courses having in-degree 0\n    queue = deque([i for i in range(num_courses) if in_degree[i] == 0])\n    \n    # Count of courses that can be completed\n    completed_courses = 0\n    \n    while queue:\n        course = queue.popleft()\n        completed_courses += 1\n        \n        # Decrease the in-degree of neighboring courses\n        for neighbor in graph[course]:\n            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1\n            # If in-degree becomes 0, add to queue\n            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n    \n    # If the number of completed courses is equal to the total number of courses, return True\n    return completed_courses == num_courses\n\n# Given number of courses and prerequisites\nnum_courses = 7\nprerequisites = [(4, 1), (0, 6), (0, 1), (3, 6), (5, 6), (6, 5), (2, 6), (5, 0), (1, 2), (0, 3), (5, 2), (1, 6)]\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nresult\nassistant > The result is that it is not possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites due to the presence of a cycle in the dependency graph.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<False>>>"
