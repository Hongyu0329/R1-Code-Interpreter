    "\nassistant > To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we can model this problem as a graph and check for cycles. Each course is a node, and each prerequisite is a directed edge from one node to another. If there is a cycle in the graph, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed.\n\nWe can use a topological sort or a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.
