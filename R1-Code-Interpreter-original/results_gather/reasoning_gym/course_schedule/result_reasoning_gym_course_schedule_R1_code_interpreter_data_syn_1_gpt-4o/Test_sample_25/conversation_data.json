    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Model the Problem as a Graph**: \n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a, b) is a directed edge from b to a, indicating that course b must be completed before course a.\n\n2. **Detect Cycles in the Graph**:\n   - We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. \n   - During DFS, we maintain a recursion stack to keep track of nodes currently being visited. If we encounter a node that is already in the recursion stack, it indicates a cycle.\n\n3. **Implement the Solution**:\n   - Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.\n   - Use a visited list to track visited nodes and a recursion stack to detect cycles.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to check if it's possible to finish all courses.\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for dest, src in prerequisites:\n        graph[src].append(dest)\n\n    # Visited states: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    visited = [0] * num_courses\n\n    def dfs(course):\n        if visited[course] == 1:  # cycle detected\n            return False\n        if visited[course] == 2:  # already visited\n            return True\n\n        # Mark the course as being visited\n        visited[course] = 1\n\n        # Visit all the neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph[course]:\n            if not dfs(neighbor):\n                return False\n\n        # Mark the course as fully visited\n        visited[course] = 2\n        return True\n\n    # Check each course\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if not dfs(course):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 5\n# Prerequisites list\nprerequisites = [(2, 4), (3, 1), (2, 0), (1, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (2, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (0, 3)]\n\n# Check if we can finish all courses\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will determine if it's possible to complete all courses given the prerequisites by checking for cycles in the graph. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution indicates that there is a cycle in the course dependency graph, which means it is not possible to complete all courses given the prerequisites. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
