    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe problem can be represented as a directed graph where each course is a node, and each prerequisite is a directed edge from one node to another. We can use a graph traversal algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), to detect cycles in the graph.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.\n2. Use a DFS approach to detect cycles. We will maintain a visited list to keep track of the nodes that are currently being visited in the current path. If we encounter a node that is already in the current path, it indicates a cycle.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n\n    # Visited states: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    visited = [0] * num_courses\n\n    def dfs(course):\n        if visited[course] == 1:  # Cycle detected\n            return False\n        if visited[course] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return True\n\n        # Mark the course as being visited\n        visited[course] = 1\n\n        # Visit all the neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph[course]:\n            if not dfs(neighbor):\n                return False\n\n        # Mark the course as fully visited\n        visited[course] = 2\n        return True\n\n    # Check each course\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if not dfs(course):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 5\n# Prerequisites list\nprerequisites = [(0, 3), (2, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (4, 3)]\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will determine if it is possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites by checking for cycles in the graph. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned `True`, indicating that it is possible to complete all the courses given the prerequisites. This means there are no cycles in the course dependency graph, and all courses can be taken in a valid order.\n\n<<<True>>>"
