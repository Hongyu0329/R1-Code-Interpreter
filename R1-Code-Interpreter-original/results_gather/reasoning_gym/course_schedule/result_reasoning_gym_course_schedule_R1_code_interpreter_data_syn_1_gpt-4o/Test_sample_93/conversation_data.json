    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the courses and their prerequisites as a directed graph. Each course is a node, and a directed edge from node `b` to node `a` indicates that course `b` is a prerequisite for course `a`.\n\n2. **Cycle Detection**: Use a graph traversal algorithm to detect cycles. A common approach is to use Depth-First Search (DFS) with a recursion stack to keep track of the nodes currently being visited. If we revisit a node that is already in the recursion stack, it indicates a cycle.\n\n3. **Implementation**: Implement the graph as an adjacency list and use DFS to check for cycles.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n\n    # Visited states: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    visited = [0] * num_courses\n\n    def dfs(course):\n        if visited[course] == 1:  # Cycle detected\n            return False\n        if visited[course] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return True\n\n        # Mark the course as being visited\n        visited[course] = 1\n\n        # Visit all the prerequisites\n        for next_course in graph[course]:\n            if not dfs(next_course):\n                return False\n\n        # Mark the course as fully visited\n        visited[course] = 2\n        return True\n\n    # Check each course\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if not dfs(course):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 6\n# List of prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (2, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4)]\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will determine if it's possible to complete all courses given the prerequisites by checking for cycles in the graph. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is `True`. This means that it is possible to complete all the courses given the prerequisites, as there are no cycles in the dependency graph.\n\n<<<True>>>"
