    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe problem can be solved using a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph. Each course is a node, and a prerequisite relationship is a directed edge from one node to another.\n\n2. **Cycle Detection**: Use DFS to detect cycles in the graph. During the DFS traversal, keep track of the nodes currently in the recursion stack. If we encounter a node that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n3. **Implementation**: Implement the above logic using Python. We will create an adjacency list for the graph and use a recursive DFS function to check for cycles.\n\nLet's implement the code to check for cycles in the graph:\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for dest, src in prerequisites:\n        graph[src].append(dest)\n\n    # Visited states: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    visited = [0] * num_courses\n\n    def dfs(course):\n        if visited[course] == 1:  # Cycle detected\n            return False\n        if visited[course] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return True\n\n        # Mark the course as being visited\n        visited[course] = 1\n\n        # Visit all the neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph[course]:\n            if not dfs(neighbor):\n                return False\n\n        # Mark the course as fully visited\n        visited[course] = 2\n        return True\n\n    # Check each course\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if not dfs(course):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 6\n# List of prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(5, 4), (4, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (0, 2), (5, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 0), (0, 4), (2, 1)]\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if all courses can be completed.",
    "The code output indicates that there is a cycle in the graph, which means not all courses can be completed given the prerequisites. The presence of a cycle in the graph implies that there is a circular dependency among some courses, preventing the completion of all courses.\n\nThe cycle can be observed in the prerequisites list, particularly between courses 4 and 5, as they have mutual dependencies: (5, 4) and (4, 5). This creates a direct cycle, making it impossible to complete these courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
