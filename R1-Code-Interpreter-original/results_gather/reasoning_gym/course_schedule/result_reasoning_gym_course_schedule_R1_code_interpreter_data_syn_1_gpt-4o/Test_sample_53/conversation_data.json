    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nThe problem can be represented as a directed graph where each course is a node, and each prerequisite is a directed edge from one node to another. We can use a topological sort or a cycle detection algorithm to solve this problem. A common approach is to use Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.\n2. Use a DFS-based approach to detect cycles in the graph.\n3. If a cycle is detected, return False. Otherwise, return True.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n\n    # States: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    state = [0] * num_courses\n\n    def has_cycle(v):\n        if state[v] == 1:  # Found a cycle\n            return True\n        if state[v] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return False\n\n        # Mark the current node as visiting\n        state[v] = 1\n        for neighbor in graph[v]:\n            if has_cycle(neighbor):\n                return True\n\n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        state[v] = 2\n        return False\n\n    # Check each course for cycles\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if has_cycle(course):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 6\n# List of prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(1, 2), (0, 1), (4, 3), (3, 2), (5, 4), (5, 3), (0, 3), (4, 1)]\n\n# Check if we can finish all courses\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will determine if it's possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites by checking for cycles in the graph. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution indicates that it is possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites, as there are no cycles in the dependency graph.\n\nThe algorithm successfully checks for cycles using a depth-first search (DFS) approach, marking nodes as visiting and visited to detect cycles. Since the output is `True`, it means that all courses can be completed without any cyclic dependencies.\n\n<<<True>>>"
