    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe problem can be solved using a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. We will represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph and use DFS to check for cycles.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph using an adjacency list.\n2. Use DFS to detect cycles in the graph. We will maintain a visited set to keep track of visited nodes and a recursion stack to detect back edges, which indicate cycles.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n\n    # Visited set to keep track of visited nodes\n    visited = set()\n    # Recursion stack to detect cycles\n    rec_stack = set()\n\n    def dfs(course):\n        if course in rec_stack:\n            return False  # Cycle detected\n        if course in visited:\n            return True  # Already visited and no cycle found\n\n        # Mark the course as visited and add to recursion stack\n        visited.add(course)\n        rec_stack.add(course)\n\n        # Visit all the neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph[course]:\n            if not dfs(neighbor):\n                return False\n\n        # Remove from recursion stack\n        rec_stack.remove(course)\n        return True\n\n    # Check each course\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if course not in visited:\n            if not dfs(course):\n                return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 8\n# List of prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(5, 7), (0, 1), (2, 5), (6, 7), (3, 7), (0, 7), (2, 6), (4, 7), (1, 7), (5, 0), (3, 5), (4, 5), (1, 2), (6, 4)]\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if all courses can be completed.",
