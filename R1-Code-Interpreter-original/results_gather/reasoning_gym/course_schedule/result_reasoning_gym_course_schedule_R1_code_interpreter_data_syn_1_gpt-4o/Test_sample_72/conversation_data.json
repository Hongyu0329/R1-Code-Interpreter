    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe problem can be represented as a directed graph where each course is a node, and each prerequisite is a directed edge from one node to another. We can use a topological sort or a cycle detection algorithm to solve this problem.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph.\n2. Use a cycle detection algorithm (such as Depth-First Search) to check for cycles in the graph.\n3. If a cycle is detected, return False. Otherwise, return True.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create a graph from the prerequisites\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n\n    # Visited states: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    visited = [0] * num_courses\n\n    def has_cycle(v):\n        if visited[v] == 1:  # Found a cycle\n            return True\n        if visited[v] == 2:  # Already visited node\n            return False\n\n        # Mark the node as visiting\n        visited[v] = 1\n        for neighbor in graph[v]:\n            if has_cycle(neighbor):\n                return True\n\n        # Mark the node as visited\n        visited[v] = 2\n        return False\n\n    # Check each course for cycles\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if has_cycle(course):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Given data\nnum_courses = 5\nprerequisites = [(4, 0), (1, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)]\n\n# Check if we can finish all courses\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if all courses can be completed.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are no cycles in the course dependency graph, meaning it is possible to complete all courses given the prerequisites.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
