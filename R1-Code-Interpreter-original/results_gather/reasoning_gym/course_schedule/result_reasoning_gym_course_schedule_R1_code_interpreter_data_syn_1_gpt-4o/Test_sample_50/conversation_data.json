    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for cycles in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe problem can be solved using a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. We will represent the courses as nodes and prerequisites as directed edges.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.\n2. Use a DFS approach to detect cycles. We will maintain a visited list to keep track of visited nodes and a recursion stack to detect back edges, which indicate cycles.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for dest, src in prerequisites:\n        graph[src].append(dest)\n\n    # Visited states: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    visited = [0] * num_courses\n\n    def dfs(course):\n        if visited[course] == 1:  # Cycle detected\n            return False\n        if visited[course] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return True\n\n        # Mark the course as being visited\n        visited[course] = 1\n\n        # Visit all the neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph[course]:\n            if not dfs(neighbor):\n                return False\n\n        # Mark the course as fully visited\n        visited[course] = 2\n        return True\n\n    # Check each course\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if not dfs(course):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 6\n# List of prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (0, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (0, 3), (1, 5), (0, 1), (2, 1)]\n\n# Check if we can finish all courses\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if all courses can be completed.",
    "The code execution indicates that there is a cycle in the graph, which means not all courses can be completed given the prerequisites. The presence of a cycle in the course dependency graph prevents the completion of all courses.\n\nThe cycle can be identified by examining the prerequisites:\n- For example, course 0 depends on course 5, which in turn depends on course 0, creating a cycle.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
