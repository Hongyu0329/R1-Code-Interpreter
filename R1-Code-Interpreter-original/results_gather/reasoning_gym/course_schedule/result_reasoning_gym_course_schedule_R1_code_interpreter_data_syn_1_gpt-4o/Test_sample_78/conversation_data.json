    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nWe can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph using an adjacency list.\n2. Use a DFS approach to detect cycles in the graph.\n3. Maintain a visited list to track the state of each node (course):\n   - 0: Not visited\n   - 1: Visiting (currently in the recursion stack)\n   - 2: Visited (fully processed)\n4. If we encounter a node that is already in the \"Visiting\" state during the DFS, it indicates a cycle.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine if all courses can be completed.\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n\n    # Visited states: 0 = not visited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    visited = [0] * num_courses\n\n    def dfs(course):\n        if visited[course] == 1:  # Cycle detected\n            return False\n        if visited[course] == 2:  # Already processed\n            return True\n\n        # Mark the course as visiting\n        visited[course] = 1\n\n        # Visit all the neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph[course]:\n            if not dfs(neighbor):\n                return False\n\n        # Mark the course as visited\n        visited[course] = 2\n        return True\n\n    # Check each course\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if not dfs(course):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 8\n# Prerequisites list\nprerequisites = [(0, 4), (1, 5), (0, 1), (6, 0), (6, 5), (4, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (3, 5), (3, 0), (2, 4), (7, 1)]\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if all courses can be completed.",
    "The code execution indicates that there is a cycle in the graph, which means not all courses can be completed given the prerequisites. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
