    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe problem can be solved using a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. We will represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph and use DFS to check for cycles.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.\n2. Use a DFS approach to detect cycles in the graph.\n3. If a cycle is detected, return False. Otherwise, return True.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n\n    # Visited states: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    visited = [0] * num_courses\n\n    def dfs(course):\n        if visited[course] == 1:  # Cycle detected\n            return False\n        if visited[course] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return True\n\n        # Mark the course as being visited\n        visited[course] = 1\n\n        # Visit all the prerequisites\n        for next_course in graph[course]:\n            if not dfs(next_course):\n                return False\n\n        # Mark the course as fully visited\n        visited[course] = 2\n        return True\n\n    # Check each course\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if not dfs(course):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 10\n# List of prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(0, 2), (2, 6), (9, 8), (2, 5), (5, 6), (7, 8), (8, 6), (3, 6), (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 8), (4, 3), (9, 4), (0, 4)]\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if all courses can be completed.",
    "The code execution indicates that the output is `True`, meaning that it is possible to complete all the courses given the prerequisites. This result implies that there are no cycles in the graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites, allowing for a valid order of course completion.\n\n<<<True>>>"
