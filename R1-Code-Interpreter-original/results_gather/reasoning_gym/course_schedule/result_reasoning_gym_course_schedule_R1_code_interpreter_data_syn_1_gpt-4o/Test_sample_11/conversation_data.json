    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe problem can be represented as a directed graph where each course is a node, and each prerequisite is a directed edge from one node to another. We can use a topological sort or a cycle detection algorithm to solve this problem. A common approach is to use Depth First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine if all courses can be completed.\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create a graph from the prerequisites\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n\n    # Track visited nodes to detect cycles\n    visited = [0] * num_courses  # 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n\n    def has_cycle(v):\n        if visited[v] == 1:  # Found a cycle\n            return True\n        if visited[v] == 2:  # Already visited node\n            return False\n\n        # Mark the node as visiting\n        visited[v] = 1\n        for neighbor in graph[v]:\n            if has_cycle(neighbor):\n                return True\n\n        # Mark the node as visited\n        visited[v] = 2\n        return False\n\n    # Check each course for cycles\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if has_cycle(course):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 5\n# List of prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(1, 3), (0, 2), (1, 0), (3, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (2, 4), (2, 1)]\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if all courses can be completed.",
    "The code execution indicates that there is a cycle in the course dependency graph, which means not all courses can be completed. The presence of a cycle in the graph implies that there is a circular dependency among the courses, preventing the completion of all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
