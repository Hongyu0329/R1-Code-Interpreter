    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nThe problem can be solved using a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph using an adjacency list.\n\n2. **Cycle Detection**: Use DFS to detect cycles in the graph. During the DFS traversal, keep track of the visited nodes and the recursion stack. If a node is visited again while it is still in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n3. **Result**: If a cycle is detected, return False. Otherwise, return True.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n\n    # Visited states: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    visited = [0] * num_courses\n\n    def dfs(course):\n        if visited[course] == 1:  # Cycle detected\n            return False\n        if visited[course] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return True\n\n        # Mark the course as being visited\n        visited[course] = 1\n\n        # Visit all the prerequisites\n        for next_course in graph[course]:\n            if not dfs(next_course):\n                return False\n\n        # Mark the course as fully visited\n        visited[course] = 2\n        return True\n\n    # Check each course\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if not dfs(course):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 8\n# Prerequisites list\nprerequisites = [(0, 2), (2, 5), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 4), (7, 0), (4, 2), (5, 3), (2, 3), (6, 5), (1, 7)]\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if all courses can be completed.",
    "The code execution indicates that there is a cycle in the graph, which means not all courses can be completed given the prerequisites. The presence of a cycle in the graph implies that there is a circular dependency among some courses, preventing the completion of all courses.\n\nThe cycle can be identified in the prerequisites as follows:\n- Course 0 requires course 2.\n- Course 2 requires course 5.\n- Course 5 requires course 0.\n\nThis forms a cycle: 0 -> 2 -> 5 -> 0.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\n<<<False>>>"
