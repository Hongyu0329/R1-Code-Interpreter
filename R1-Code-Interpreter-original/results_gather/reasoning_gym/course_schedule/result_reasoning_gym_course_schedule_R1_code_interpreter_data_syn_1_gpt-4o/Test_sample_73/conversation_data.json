    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed.\n\nThe problem can be solved using a graph traversal algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), to detect cycles in the graph. We will represent the courses as nodes and prerequisites as directed edges. If we find a back edge during the DFS traversal, it indicates a cycle.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to check for cycles in the graph.\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n\n    # States: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    state = [0] * num_courses\n\n    def has_cycle(v):\n        if state[v] == 1:  # Found a back edge\n            return True\n        if state[v] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return False\n\n        # Mark the current node as visiting\n        state[v] = 1\n        for neighbor in graph[v]:\n            if has_cycle(neighbor):\n                return True\n\n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        state[v] = 2\n        return False\n\n    # Check each course for cycles\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if state[course] == 0:  # Unvisited\n            if has_cycle(course):\n                return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 9\n# List of prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(0, 1), (0, 7), (2, 8), (1, 2), (8, 7), (6, 2), (4, 7), (5, 7), (7, 6), (0, 6), (2, 0), (1, 6), (2, 4), (4, 8), (6, 3)]\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine if all courses can be completed.",
    "The code execution indicates that there is a cycle in the graph, which means not all courses can be completed given the prerequisites. The presence of a cycle in the course dependency graph prevents the completion of all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
