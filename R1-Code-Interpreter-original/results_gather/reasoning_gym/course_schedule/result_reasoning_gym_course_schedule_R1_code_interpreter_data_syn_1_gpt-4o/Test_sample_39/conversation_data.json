    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nWe can use a topological sort approach to detect cycles in the graph. If we can perform a topological sort of the graph, it means there is no cycle, and all courses can be completed.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph using an adjacency list. Each course is a node, and a directed edge from node `b_i` to node `a_i` indicates that course `b_i` is a prerequisite for course `a_i`.\n\n2. **Indegree Calculation**: Calculate the indegree (number of incoming edges) for each node. A node with an indegree of 0 can be taken without any prerequisites.\n\n3. **Topological Sort Using Kahn's Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize a queue with all nodes having an indegree of 0.\n   - While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue a node, and consider it as a course that can be completed.\n     - For each neighbor of this node, reduce its indegree by 1.\n     - If any neighbor's indegree becomes 0, add it to the queue.\n   - If the number of nodes processed equals the total number of courses, it means all courses can be completed. Otherwise, there is a cycle.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine if all courses can be completed.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    indegree = [0] * num_courses\n    \n    # Build the graph and calculate indegrees\n    for dest, src in prerequisites:\n        graph[src].append(dest)\n        indegree[dest] += 1\n    \n    # Initialize a queue with all nodes having indegree 0\n    queue = deque([i for i in range(num_courses) if indegree[i] == 0])\n    \n    # Number of courses that can be completed\n    completed_courses = 0\n    \n    while queue:\n        course = queue.popleft()\n        completed_courses += 1\n        \n        # Decrease the indegree of neighboring nodes\n        for neighbor in graph[course]:\n            indegree[neighbor] -= 1\n            # If indegree becomes 0, add to queue\n            if indegree[neighbor] == 0:\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n    \n    # If completed courses equal total courses, return True\n    return completed_courses == num_courses\n\n# Given number of courses and prerequisites\nnum_courses = 7\nprerequisites = [(0, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (5, 3), (4, 0), (5, 1), (2, 3), (6, 0)]\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if all courses can be completed.",
