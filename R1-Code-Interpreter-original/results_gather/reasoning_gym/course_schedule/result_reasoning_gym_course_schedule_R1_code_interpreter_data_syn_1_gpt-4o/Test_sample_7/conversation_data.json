    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nWe can represent the courses and their prerequisites as a directed graph, where each course is a node and each prerequisite is a directed edge. We can then use a graph traversal algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), to detect cycles in the graph.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.\n2. Use a DFS approach to detect cycles. We will maintain a visited list to keep track of the nodes that are currently being visited in the current path. If we encounter a node that is already in the current path, it means there is a cycle.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n\n    # Visited states: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    visited = [0] * num_courses\n\n    def dfs(course):\n        if visited[course] == 1:  # Cycle detected\n            return False\n        if visited[course] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return True\n\n        # Mark the course as being visited\n        visited[course] = 1\n\n        # Visit all the neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph[course]:\n            if not dfs(neighbor):\n                return False\n\n        # Mark the course as fully visited\n        visited[course] = 2\n        return True\n\n    # Check each course\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if not dfs(course):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 6\n# Prerequisites list\nprerequisites = [(5, 1), (4, 5), (2, 4), (0, 4), (3, 1), (0, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1)]\n\n# Check if we can finish all courses\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if all courses can be completed.",
    "The code execution indicates that the output is `True`, which means that it is possible to complete all the courses given the prerequisites. There are no cycles in the course dependency graph, allowing for all courses to be taken in a valid order.\n\n<<<True>>>"
