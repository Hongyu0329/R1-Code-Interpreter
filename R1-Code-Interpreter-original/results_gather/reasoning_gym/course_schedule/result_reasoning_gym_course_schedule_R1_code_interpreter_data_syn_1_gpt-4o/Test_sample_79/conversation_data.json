    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete all courses. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nWe can represent the courses and their prerequisites as a directed graph, where each course is a node and each prerequisite is a directed edge. We can then use a graph traversal algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), to detect cycles in the graph.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.\n2. Use a DFS approach to detect cycles. We will maintain a visited list to keep track of the state of each node:\n   - Unvisited: The node has not been visited yet.\n   - Visiting: The node is being visited (i.e., it's in the current path).\n   - Visited: The node and all its descendants have been fully processed.\n3. If we encounter a node that is already in the \"Visiting\" state during our DFS traversal, it means we have found a cycle.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n\n    # States: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    visited = [0] * num_courses\n\n    def dfs(course):\n        if visited[course] == 1:  # Found a cycle\n            return False\n        if visited[course] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return True\n\n        # Mark the course as being visited\n        visited[course] = 1\n\n        # Visit all the neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph[course]:\n            if not dfs(neighbor):\n                return False\n\n        # Mark the course as fully visited\n        visited[course] = 2\n        return True\n\n    # Check each course\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if not dfs(course):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 6\n# Prerequisites list\nprerequisites = [(5, 1), (4, 5), (2, 5), (4, 0), (3, 0), (1, 4), (3, 5), (1, 5), (5, 0)]\n\n# Check if we can finish all courses\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if all courses can be completed.",
    "The code execution indicates that there is a cycle in the course dependency graph, which means it is not possible to complete all courses given the prerequisites. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
