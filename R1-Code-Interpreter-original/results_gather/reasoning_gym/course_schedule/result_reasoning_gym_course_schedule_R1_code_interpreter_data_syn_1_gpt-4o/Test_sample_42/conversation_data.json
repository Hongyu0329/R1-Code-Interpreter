    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nWe can represent the courses and their prerequisites as a directed graph, where each course is a node and each prerequisite is a directed edge. We can then use a graph traversal algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), to detect cycles in the graph.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Create a graph using an adjacency list representation.\n2. Use a DFS approach to detect cycles in the graph.\n3. If a cycle is detected, return False. Otherwise, return True.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n\n    # States: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    state = [0] * num_courses\n\n    def has_cycle(v):\n        if state[v] == 1:  # Found a cycle\n            return True\n        if state[v] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return False\n\n        # Mark the current node as visiting\n        state[v] = 1\n        for neighbor in graph[v]:\n            if has_cycle(neighbor):\n                return True\n\n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        state[v] = 2\n        return False\n\n    # Check each course for cycles\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if has_cycle(course):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 9\n# List of prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(5, 3), (2, 0), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 3), (1, 5), (6, 3), (3, 4), (2, 6), (0, 6)]\n\n# Check if we can finish all courses\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine if all courses can be completed.",
    "The code execution indicates that it is possible to complete all the courses given the prerequisites, as there are no cycles in the course dependency graph.\n\n<<<True>>>"
