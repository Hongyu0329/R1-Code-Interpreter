    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nThe problem can be solved using a graph traversal algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), to detect cycles in the graph. We will represent the courses as nodes and prerequisites as directed edges between nodes.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph using an adjacency list.\n\n2. **Cycle Detection**: Use DFS to detect cycles in the graph. We will maintain a visited list to keep track of visited nodes and a recursion stack to keep track of nodes in the current path. If we encounter a node that is already in the recursion stack, it indicates a cycle.\n\n3. **Result**: If a cycle is detected, return False. Otherwise, return True.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for course, prereq in prerequisites:\n        graph[prereq].append(course)\n\n    # Visited states: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited\n    visited = [0] * num_courses\n\n    def dfs(course):\n        if visited[course] == 1:  # Cycle detected\n            return False\n        if visited[course] == 2:  # Already visited\n            return True\n\n        # Mark the course as being visited\n        visited[course] = 1\n\n        # Visit all the neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph[course]:\n            if not dfs(neighbor):\n                return False\n\n        # Mark the course as fully visited\n        visited[course] = 2\n        return True\n\n    # Check each course\n    for course in range(num_courses):\n        if not dfs(course):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Number of courses\nnum_courses = 6\n# List of prerequisites\nprerequisites = [(3, 4), (5, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (4, 3), (4, 5), (2, 1), (0, 2), (1, 4), (5, 2), (5, 3), (2, 3)]\n\n# Check if all courses can be finished\nresult = can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will determine if all courses can be completed by checking for cycles in the graph. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
