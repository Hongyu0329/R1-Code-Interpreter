    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites**: \n   - We have 10 courses labeled from 0 to 9.\n   - The prerequisites are given as pairs, where the first element of the pair depends on the second element.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph**:\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b to node a indicates that course b is a prerequisite for course a.\n\n3. **List of Prerequisites**:\n   - (0, 2): Course 2 is a prerequisite for course 0.\n   - (2, 4): Course 4 is a prerequisite for course 2.\n   - (6, 3): Course 3 is a prerequisite for course 6.\n   - (0, 9): Course 9 is a prerequisite for course 0.\n   - (8, 1): Course 1 is a prerequisite for course 8.\n   - (2, 3): Course 3 is a prerequisite for course 2.\n   - (9, 5): Course 5 is a prerequisite for course 9.\n   - (1, 5): Course 5 is a prerequisite for course 1.\n   - (7, 9): Course 9 is a prerequisite for course 7.\n   - (6, 4): Course 4 is a prerequisite for course 6.\n   - (5, 4): Course 4 is a prerequisite for course 5.\n   - (3, 4): Course 4 is a prerequisite for course 3.\n   - (8, 3): Course 3 is a prerequisite for course 8.\n   - (7, 1): Course 1 is a prerequisite for course 7.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles**:\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that cannot be completed because they depend on each other in a circular manner.\n   - We can use a depth-first search (DFS) or a topological sort to detect cycles in the graph.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection**:\n   - Start with any course and perform a DFS.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes and nodes currently in the recursion stack.\n   - If we encounter a node that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n6. **Analysis**:\n   - By performing a DFS on the graph, we find that there is a cycle involving courses 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 0, and 6. This cycle makes it impossible to complete all courses.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is a cycle in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
