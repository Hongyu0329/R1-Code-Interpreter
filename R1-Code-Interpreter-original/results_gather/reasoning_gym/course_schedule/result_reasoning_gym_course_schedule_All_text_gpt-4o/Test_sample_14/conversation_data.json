    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **List of Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n   - Prerequisites: [(4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 4), (1, 4), (3, 0), (0, 1), (4, 3), (0, 2), (2, 1)]\n\n2. **Graph Representation:**\n   - We can represent the courses and their prerequisites as a directed graph where an edge from course `b_i` to course `a_i` indicates that `b_i` is a prerequisite for `a_i`.\n\n3. **Building the Graph:**\n   - Course 4 depends on course 1.\n   - Course 3 depends on course 1.\n   - Course 2 depends on course 4.\n   - Course 1 depends on course 4.\n   - Course 3 depends on course 0.\n   - Course 0 depends on course 1.\n   - Course 4 depends on course 3.\n   - Course 0 depends on course 2.\n   - Course 2 depends on course 1.\n\n4. **Detecting Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in this graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n   - Let's trace the dependencies:\n     - Course 4 -> Course 1\n     - Course 1 -> Course 4 (Cycle detected: 4 -> 1 -> 4)\n     - Course 3 -> Course 1\n     - Course 3 -> Course 0\n     - Course 0 -> Course 1\n     - Course 0 -> Course 2\n     - Course 2 -> Course 4\n     - Course 2 -> Course 1\n     - Course 4 -> Course 3 (Cycle detected: 4 -> 3 -> 0 -> 2 -> 4)\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are cycles in the graph, specifically between courses 4 and 1, and another involving courses 4, 3, 0, and 2.\n   - Because of these cycles, it is impossible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
