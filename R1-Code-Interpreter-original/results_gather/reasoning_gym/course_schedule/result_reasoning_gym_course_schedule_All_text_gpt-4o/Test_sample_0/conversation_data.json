    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the given prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 5 (labeled 0 to 4)\n   - Prerequisites: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 3), (1, 2), (0, 2)]\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Course 3 depends on course 0.\n   - Course 4 depends on course 0.\n   - Course 4 also depends on course 3.\n   - Course 1 depends on course 2.\n   - Course 0 depends on course 2.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - The graph can be represented as:\n     - 0 -> 3, 4\n     - 2 -> 0, 1\n     - 3 -> 4\n\n4. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in this directed graph.\n   - Start with course 0:\n     - 0 -> 3 -> 4 (no cycle here)\n   - Start with course 2:\n     - 2 -> 0 -> 3 -> 4 (no cycle here)\n     - 2 -> 1 (no cycle here)\n   - There are no back edges that create a cycle in the graph.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are no cycles in the graph, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that it is possible to finish all courses.\n\n<<<True>>>"
