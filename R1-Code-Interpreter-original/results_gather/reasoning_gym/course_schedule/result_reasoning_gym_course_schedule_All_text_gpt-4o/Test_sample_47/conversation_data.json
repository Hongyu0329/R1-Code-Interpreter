    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (3, 4): To take course 3, you must first take course 4.\n     - (2, 1): To take course 2, you must first take course 1.\n     - (3, 5): To take course 3, you must first take course 5.\n     - (2, 5): To take course 2, you must first take course 5.\n     - (5, 4): To take course 5, you must first take course 4.\n     - (0, 5): To take course 0, you must first take course 5.\n     - (4, 1): To take course 4, you must first take course 1.\n     - (0, 2): To take course 0, you must first take course 2.\n     - (0, 4): To take course 0, you must first take course 4.\n     - (1, 0): To take course 1, you must first take course 0.\n     - (4, 5): To take course 4, you must first take course 5.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, with edges pointing from the prerequisite course to the dependent course.\n   - For example, an edge from 4 to 3 indicates that course 4 is a prerequisite for course 3.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.\n   - A cycle exists if during the DFS traversal, we encounter a node that is already in the current path of traversal.\n\n4. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Start DFS from each course and track visited nodes and nodes in the current path.\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection in Given Prerequisites:**\n   - Start with course 0: \n     - 0 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 0 (cycle detected)\n   - The presence of a cycle (0 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 0) indicates that not all courses can be completed.\n\nSince a cycle is detected, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<False>>>"
