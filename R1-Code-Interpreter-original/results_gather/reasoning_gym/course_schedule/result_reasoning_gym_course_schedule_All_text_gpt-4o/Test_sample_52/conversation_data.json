    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - We have 10 courses labeled from 0 to 9.\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from b_i to a_i indicates that b_i is a prerequisite for a_i.\n\n3. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (8, 9), (2, 5), (5, 6), (9, 2), (3, 6), (5, 4), (0, 9), (2, 6), (7, 2), (1, 5), (7, 5), (0, 8), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 2), (1, 3), (9, 6)\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes currently in the recursion stack (indicating the path being explored).\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Perform Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during DFS, return False.\n   - If DFS completes without finding a cycle, return True.\n\n6. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - The graph has a cycle if there is a path that leads back to a previously visited node in the current path.\n   - For example, if you have a path 9 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9, this forms a cycle.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - After analyzing the prerequisites, we find that there is indeed a cycle in the graph.\n   - Specifically, the cycle 9 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 prevents all courses from being completed.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<False>>>"
