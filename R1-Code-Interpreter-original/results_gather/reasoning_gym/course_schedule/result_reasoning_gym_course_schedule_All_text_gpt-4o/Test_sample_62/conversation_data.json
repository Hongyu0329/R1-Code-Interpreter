    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - We have 9 courses labeled from 0 to 8.\n   - The prerequisites are given as pairs, where the first element of the pair depends on the second element.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node `b_i` to node `a_i` indicates that course `b_i` must be completed before course `a_i`.\n\n3. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (8, 0): Course 8 depends on course 0.\n   - (3, 4): Course 3 depends on course 4.\n   - (1, 4): Course 1 depends on course 4.\n   - (2, 5): Course 2 depends on course 5.\n   - (0, 4): Course 0 depends on course 4.\n   - (6, 4): Course 6 depends on course 4.\n   - (2, 6): Course 2 depends on course 6.\n   - (0, 7): Course 0 depends on course 7.\n   - (8, 3): Course 8 depends on course 3.\n   - (5, 4): Course 5 depends on course 4.\n   - (3, 7): Course 3 depends on course 7.\n   - (7, 4): Course 7 depends on course 4.\n   - (1, 5): Course 1 depends on course 5.\n   - (6, 3): Course 6 depends on course 3.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n   - We can use a depth-first search (DFS) or a topological sort to detect cycles in the graph.\n\n5. **Perform Topological Sort or DFS:**\n   - Using DFS, we can keep track of visited nodes and nodes currently in the recursion stack.\n   - If we encounter a node that is already in the recursion stack, it indicates a cycle.\n\n6. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - By performing a DFS on the graph, we find that there is a cycle involving courses 2, 5, 4, 6, and 3. Specifically, the cycle is: 2 -> 6 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is a cycle in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
