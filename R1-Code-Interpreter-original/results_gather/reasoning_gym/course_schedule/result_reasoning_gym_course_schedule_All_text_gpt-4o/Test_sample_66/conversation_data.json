    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n   - Prerequisites: (1, 6), (5, 1), (4, 3), (5, 6), (2, 5), (3, 6), (0, 3)\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, where an edge from b_i to a_i indicates that course b_i must be completed before course a_i.\n   - The edges based on the prerequisites are:\n     - 6 -> 1\n     - 1 -> 5\n     - 3 -> 4\n     - 6 -> 5\n     - 5 -> 2\n     - 6 -> 3\n     - 3 -> 0\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a circular dependency, making it impossible to complete all courses.\n   - We can use a depth-first search (DFS) or a topological sort to detect cycles.\n\n4. **Perform Topological Sort or DFS:**\n   - Start with nodes that have no incoming edges (courses with no prerequisites).\n   - Use a DFS approach to visit each node, marking nodes as visited.\n   - If we revisit a node that is already in the current path of the DFS, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Start DFS from course 6:\n     - Visit 6, then 1, then 5, then 2. No cycle here.\n     - Backtrack to 5, then visit 3, then 4. No cycle here.\n     - Backtrack to 3, then visit 0. No cycle here.\n   - All nodes are visited without revisiting any node in the current path, indicating no cycle.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is no cycle in the graph, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
