    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 8 (labeled from 0 to 7).\n   - Prerequisites: [(1, 7), (7, 4), (2, 1), (6, 2), (0, 2), (2, 4), (5, 2), (3, 4)].\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b_i to node a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - Course 7 -> Course 1\n   - Course 4 -> Course 7\n   - Course 1 -> Course 2\n   - Course 2 -> Course 6\n   - Course 2 -> Course 0\n   - Course 4 -> Course 2\n   - Course 2 -> Course 5\n   - Course 4 -> Course 3\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method (such as Depth-First Search) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes that are currently being visited (recursion stack).\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection Analysis:**\n   - Start from any unvisited node and perform DFS.\n   - If a cycle is detected during the DFS traversal, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after all nodes are processed, return True.\n\n6. **Perform DFS:**\n   - Start from course 0: No cycle detected.\n   - Start from course 1: No cycle detected.\n   - Start from course 2: No cycle detected.\n   - Start from course 3: No cycle detected.\n   - Start from course 4: No cycle detected.\n   - Start from course 5: No cycle detected.\n   - Start from course 6: No cycle detected.\n   - Start from course 7: No cycle detected.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since no cycles are detected in the graph, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
