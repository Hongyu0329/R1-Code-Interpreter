    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n   - Prerequisites: [(2, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 1), (2, 3), (0, 1), (1, 3), (4, 2)]\n\n2. **Build the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, where an edge from b_i to a_i indicates that course b_i must be completed before course a_i.\n   - From the prerequisites, we can construct the following directed edges:\n     - 1 -> 2\n     - 3 -> 0\n     - 2 -> 1\n     - 1 -> 3\n     - 3 -> 2\n     - 1 -> 0\n     - 3 -> 1\n     - 2 -> 4\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them.\n   - Let's trace the dependencies:\n     - From 1 -> 2 -> 1, we have a cycle.\n     - From 3 -> 0, 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3, we have another cycle.\n     - The presence of these cycles indicates that not all courses can be completed.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are cycles in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
