    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and it is impossible to complete all courses. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Dependencies:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (0, 1): To take course 0, you must first take course 1.\n     - (5, 1): To take course 5, you must first take course 1.\n     - (4, 5): To take course 4, you must first take course 5.\n     - (3, 4): To take course 3, you must first take course 4.\n     - (2, 1): To take course 2, you must first take course 1.\n     - (4, 2): To take course 4, you must first take course 2.\n     - (2, 5): To take course 2, you must first take course 5.\n     - (0, 3): To take course 0, you must first take course 3.\n     - (5, 0): To take course 5, you must first take course 0.\n     - (3, 5): To take course 3, you must first take course 5.\n\n2. **Construct the Dependency Graph:**\n   - The graph can be represented as:\n     - 1 -> 0, 5, 2\n     - 5 -> 4, 2, 3\n     - 4 -> 3\n     - 2 -> 4\n     - 0 -> 5\n     - 3 -> 0\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Start from course 1:\n     - 1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 0 (Cycle detected: 0 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 0)\n   - The presence of a cycle (0 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 0) indicates that it is impossible to complete all courses.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is a cycle in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
