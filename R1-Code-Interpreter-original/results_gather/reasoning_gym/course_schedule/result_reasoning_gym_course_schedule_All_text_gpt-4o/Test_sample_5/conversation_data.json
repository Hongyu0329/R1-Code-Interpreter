    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Representation**:\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a_i, b_i) is a directed edge from b_i to a_i, indicating that b_i must be completed before a_i.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph**:\n   - Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.\n   - For each prerequisite (a_i, b_i), add an edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles**:\n   - Use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to detect cycles in the graph.\n   - Maintain a visited list to track the state of each node:\n     - Unvisited\n     - Visiting (currently in the recursion stack)\n     - Visited (fully processed)\n   - If during the DFS, we encounter a node that is already in the \"Visiting\" state, a cycle is detected.\n\n4. **Perform DFS for Cycle Detection**:\n   - Initialize all nodes as unvisited.\n   - For each node, if it is unvisited, perform a DFS.\n   - If a cycle is detected during any DFS, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after processing all nodes, return True.\n\n5. **Consider All Nodes**:\n   - Ensure that all nodes (courses) are considered, even if they are not part of any prerequisite pair, as they can be completed independently.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the given prerequisites:\n\n- Construct the graph using the given prerequisites.\n- Perform DFS from each unvisited node to check for cycles.\n- If a cycle is found, return False.\n- If no cycles are found after checking all nodes, return True.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, we find that there is a cycle in the graph. For example, one such cycle is: 9 -> 1 -> 6 -> 4 -> 9. This cycle indicates that these courses depend on each other in a circular manner, making it impossible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
