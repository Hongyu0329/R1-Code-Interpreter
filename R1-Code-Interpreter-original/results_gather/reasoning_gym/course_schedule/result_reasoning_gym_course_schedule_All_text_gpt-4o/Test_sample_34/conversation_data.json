    "To determine if you can finish all courses given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a way to take all courses without violating any prerequisite conditions. This problem can be visualized as a graph problem where courses are nodes and prerequisites are directed edges. The goal is to check if this directed graph has a cycle. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and it is impossible to complete all courses. If there is no cycle, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the given prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n   - Prerequisites: (2, 3), (0, 4), (3, 1), (1, 4)\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph can be represented as:\n     - 2 depends on 3\n     - 0 depends on 4\n     - 3 depends on 1\n     - 1 depends on 4\n\n3. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them.\n   - Start with course 0:\n     - 0 -> 4\n   - Start with course 1:\n     - 1 -> 4\n   - Start with course 2:\n     - 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4\n   - Start with course 3:\n     - 3 -> 1 -> 4\n   - Start with course 4:\n     - 4 has no dependencies\n\n4. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - There are no back edges that create a cycle in the graph. Each course can be completed by following the prerequisite chain without encountering a previously visited course in the same path.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are no cycles in the graph, it is possible to complete all courses by following the prerequisite order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that it is possible to finish all courses.\n\n<<<True>>>"
