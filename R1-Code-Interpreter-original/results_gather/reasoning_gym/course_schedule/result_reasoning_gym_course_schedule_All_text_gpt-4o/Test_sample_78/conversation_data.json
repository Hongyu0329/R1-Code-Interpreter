    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (0, 4): Course 4 is a prerequisite for course 0.\n     - (1, 5): Course 5 is a prerequisite for course 1.\n     - (0, 1): Course 1 is a prerequisite for course 0.\n     - (6, 0): Course 0 is a prerequisite for course 6.\n     - (6, 5): Course 5 is a prerequisite for course 6.\n     - (4, 1): Course 1 is a prerequisite for course 4.\n     - (0, 2): Course 2 is a prerequisite for course 0.\n     - (1, 3): Course 3 is a prerequisite for course 1.\n     - (3, 5): Course 5 is a prerequisite for course 3.\n     - (3, 0): Course 0 is a prerequisite for course 3.\n     - (2, 4): Course 4 is a prerequisite for course 2.\n     - (7, 1): Course 1 is a prerequisite for course 7.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Represent the courses as nodes and prerequisites as directed edges.\n   - The graph is directed, where an edge from node b to node a indicates that b is a prerequisite for a.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes that are currently being visited in the current path.\n   - If a node is revisited in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n\n4. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during the DFS traversal, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after checking all nodes, return True.\n\n5. **Analyze the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - Start with course 0 and follow the prerequisites:\n     - 0 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5\n     - 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5\n     - 0 -> 2 -> 4\n     - 6 -> 0\n     - 6 -> 5\n     - 7 -> 1\n   - Check for cycles in the paths:\n     - Path 0 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 0 forms a cycle (0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 0).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since a cycle is detected in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
