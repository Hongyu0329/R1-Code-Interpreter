    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Representation**:\n   - Courses are nodes in a graph.\n   - Prerequisites are directed edges between nodes.\n   - An edge from node `b_i` to node `a_i` indicates that course `b_i` must be completed before course `a_i`.\n\n2. **List of Prerequisites**:\n   - (4, 1): To take course 4, you must first take course 1.\n   - (1, 2): To take course 1, you must first take course 2.\n   - (5, 2): To take course 5, you must first take course 2.\n   - (5, 0): To take course 5, you must first take course 0.\n   - (1, 4): To take course 1, you must first take course 4.\n   - (1, 3): To take course 1, you must first take course 3.\n   - (4, 5): To take course 4, you must first take course 5.\n   - (0, 1): To take course 0, you must first take course 1.\n   - (0, 3): To take course 0, you must first take course 3.\n   - (2, 3): To take course 2, you must first take course 3.\n   - (4, 2): To take course 4, you must first take course 2.\n   - (2, 0): To take course 2, you must first take course 0.\n\n3. **Construct the Graph**:\n   - Create a directed graph using the prerequisites.\n   - Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n   - Directed edges as per the prerequisites.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles**:\n   - Use a cycle detection algorithm for directed graphs, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) with a recursion stack or Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting.\n   - If a cycle is detected, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection Analysis**:\n   - Start from any node and perform DFS.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes and nodes in the current recursion stack.\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n6. **Check for Cycles**:\n   - From the prerequisites, we can see that there is a cycle:\n     - 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 0 -> 1 (and other cycles involving these nodes).\n   - This cycle indicates that there is a circular dependency.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is a cycle in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
