    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Representation**:\n   - Courses are represented as nodes.\n   - Prerequisites are directed edges between nodes.\n   - An edge from node `b_i` to node `a_i` indicates that course `b_i` must be completed before course `a_i`.\n\n2. **List of Prerequisites**:\n   - (5, 3): To take course 5, you must first take course 3.\n   - (2, 3): To take course 2, you must first take course 3.\n   - (6, 0): To take course 6, you must first take course 0.\n   - (4, 1): To take course 4, you must first take course 1.\n   - (3, 7): To take course 3, you must first take course 7.\n   - (7, 2): To take course 7, you must first take course 2.\n   - (0, 2): To take course 0, you must first take course 2.\n   - (6, 2): To take course 6, you must first take course 2.\n   - (3, 1): To take course 3, you must first take course 1.\n   - (1, 7): To take course 1, you must first take course 7.\n   - (3, 0): To take course 3, you must first take course 0.\n   - (7, 0): To take course 7, you must first take course 0.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles**:\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph formed by these prerequisites.\n   - A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them.\n\n4. **Construct the Graph**:\n   - Create a directed graph using the prerequisites.\n   - Use a depth-first search (DFS) or a topological sort to detect cycles.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection**:\n   - Start from any course and perform a DFS.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes and nodes currently in the recursion stack.\n   - If a node is encountered that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n6. **Analyze the Given Prerequisites**:\n   - By analyzing the prerequisites, we can see that there is a cycle:\n     - Course 3 requires course 7.\n     - Course 7 requires course 2.\n     - Course 2 requires course 3.\n   - This forms a cycle: 3 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is a cycle in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
