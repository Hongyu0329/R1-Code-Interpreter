    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - We have 10 courses labeled from 0 to 9.\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a_i, b_i) is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - The graph can be represented using an adjacency list.\n   - For example, from the prerequisites [(5, 6), (0, 5), (7, 1), ...], we can construct the adjacency list:\n     - 6 -> [5]\n     - 5 -> [0]\n     - 1 -> [7]\n     - 2 -> [5, 8, 9]\n     - 0 -> [3, 2, 4, 5, 6]\n     - 7 -> [6]\n     - 4 -> [7]\n     - 9 -> [1]\n     - 3 -> []\n     - 8 -> []\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes that are currently in the recursion stack (i.e., nodes that are being visited).\n   - If we revisit a node that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Perform DFS:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during DFS, return False.\n   - If DFS completes without finding a cycle, return True.\n\n6. **Check All Nodes:**\n   - Ensure all nodes are checked, as the graph may be disconnected.\n\n7. **Final Decision:**\n   - If any cycle is detected, not all courses can be completed.\n   - If no cycles are detected, all courses can be completed.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, we find that there is a cycle in the graph. For example, the cycle 5 -> 0 -> 5 is present, indicating a circular dependency.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
