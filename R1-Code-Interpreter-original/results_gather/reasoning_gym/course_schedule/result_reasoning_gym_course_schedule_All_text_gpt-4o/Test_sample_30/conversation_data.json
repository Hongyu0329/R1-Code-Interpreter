    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 9 (labeled 0 to 8).\n   - Prerequisites: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (7, 8), (1, 4), (5, 0), (3, 5), (8, 4), (6, 0), (2, 4)].\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b_i to node a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - Course 0: Prerequisite for courses 3, 4, 5, 6.\n   - Course 4: Prerequisite for courses 1, 2, 8.\n   - Course 5: Prerequisite for course 3.\n   - Course 8: Prerequisite for course 7.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method (e.g., Depth-First Search) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes currently in the recursion stack (to detect back edges indicating cycles).\n\n5. **Cycle Detection Analysis:**\n   - Start from any unvisited node and perform DFS.\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n   - If all nodes can be visited without revisiting a node in the recursion stack, there is no cycle.\n\n6. **Apply Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from course 0:\n     - Visit 0, then 3, then 5, back to 0 (no cycle as 0 is not in the current path).\n   - Continue with other unvisited nodes:\n     - Visit 4, then 1, back to 4 (no cycle).\n     - Visit 2, back to 4 (no cycle).\n     - Visit 8, then 7, back to 8 (no cycle).\n   - Visit 6, back to 0 (no cycle).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - No cycles detected in the graph.\n   - All courses can be completed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
