    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **List of Prerequisites**: \n   - (5, 0): To take course 5, you must first take course 0.\n   - (2, 1): To take course 2, you must first take course 1.\n   - (1, 5): To take course 1, you must first take course 5.\n   - (3, 2): To take course 3, you must first take course 2.\n   - (1, 4): To take course 1, you must first take course 4.\n   - (0, 2): To take course 0, you must first take course 2.\n   - (3, 0): To take course 3, you must first take course 0.\n   - (5, 3): To take course 5, you must first take course 3.\n   - (5, 2): To take course 5, you must first take course 2.\n   - (4, 5): To take course 4, you must first take course 5.\n   - (4, 2): To take course 4, you must first take course 2.\n\n2. **Graph Representation**:\n   - Courses are nodes.\n   - Prerequisites are directed edges from the second course to the first course in each pair.\n\n3. **Cycle Detection**:\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in this directed graph.\n   - A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n\n4. **Constructing the Graph**:\n   - Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.\n   - For each prerequisite (a, b), add an edge from b to a.\n\n5. **Checking for Cycles**:\n   - Use a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes that are currently in the recursion stack.\n   - If we revisit a node that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n6. **Analysis**:\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during the DFS, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after checking all nodes, return True.\n\n7. **Cycle Detection in the Given Prerequisites**:\n   - Start with course 0: 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 0 (cycle detected).\n   - The presence of a cycle means not all courses can be completed.\n\nBased on the above analysis, there is a cycle in the course dependency graph, which makes it impossible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<False>>>"
