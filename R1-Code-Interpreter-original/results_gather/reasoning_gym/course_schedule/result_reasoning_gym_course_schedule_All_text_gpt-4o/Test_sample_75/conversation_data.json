    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Dependencies:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (5, 3): To take course 5, you must first take course 3.\n     - (1, 2): To take course 1, you must first take course 2.\n     - (2, 0): To take course 2, you must first take course 0.\n     - (5, 2): To take course 5, you must first take course 2.\n     - (1, 0): To take course 1, you must first take course 0.\n     - (4, 5): To take course 4, you must first take course 5.\n     - (2, 4): To take course 2, you must first take course 4.\n     - (4, 0): To take course 4, you must first take course 0.\n     - (5, 1): To take course 5, you must first take course 1.\n     - (3, 1): To take course 3, you must first take course 1.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph can be represented as an adjacency list:\n     - 0: []\n     - 1: [2, 0]\n     - 2: [0, 4]\n     - 3: [1]\n     - 4: [5, 0]\n     - 5: [3, 2, 1]\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n   - Start with course 0, which has no prerequisites.\n   - Course 1 depends on courses 2 and 0.\n   - Course 2 depends on courses 0 and 4.\n   - Course 4 depends on courses 5 and 0.\n   - Course 5 depends on courses 3, 2, and 1.\n   - Course 3 depends on course 1.\n\n4. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Starting from course 0, we can take it as it has no prerequisites.\n   - For course 1, we need to take courses 2 and 0. We can take course 0, but course 2 depends on course 4.\n   - Course 4 depends on course 5, which depends on courses 3, 2, and 1.\n   - Course 3 depends on course 1, creating a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is a cycle in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
