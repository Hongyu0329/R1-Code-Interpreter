    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and it is impossible to complete all courses. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (0, 2): To take course 0, you must first take course 2.\n     - (2, 5): To take course 2, you must first take course 5.\n     - (4, 5): To take course 4, you must first take course 5.\n     - (5, 0): To take course 5, you must first take course 0.\n     - (6, 4): To take course 6, you must first take course 4.\n     - (7, 0): To take course 7, you must first take course 0.\n     - (4, 2): To take course 4, you must first take course 2.\n     - (5, 3): To take course 5, you must first take course 3.\n     - (2, 3): To take course 2, you must first take course 3.\n     - (6, 5): To take course 6, you must first take course 5.\n     - (1, 7): To take course 1, you must first take course 7.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, with edges pointing from the prerequisite course to the dependent course.\n   - For example, an edge from 2 to 0 indicates that course 2 is a prerequisite for course 0.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - A cycle in the graph indicates that there is a circular dependency, making it impossible to complete all courses.\n   - Let's trace the dependencies:\n     - From (0, 2) and (2, 5), we have a path: 2 → 0 → 5.\n     - From (5, 0), we have a path: 5 → 0.\n     - This creates a cycle: 0 → 2 → 5 → 0.\n   - The presence of this cycle means that courses 0, 2, and 5 are interdependent in a way that makes it impossible to complete them.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is a cycle in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
