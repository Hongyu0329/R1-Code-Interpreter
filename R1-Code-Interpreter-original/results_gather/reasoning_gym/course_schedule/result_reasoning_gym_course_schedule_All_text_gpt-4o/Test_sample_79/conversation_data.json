    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Dependencies:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (5, 1): To take course 5, you must first take course 1.\n     - (4, 5): To take course 4, you must first take course 5.\n     - (2, 5): To take course 2, you must first take course 5.\n     - (4, 0): To take course 4, you must first take course 0.\n     - (3, 0): To take course 3, you must first take course 0.\n     - (1, 4): To take course 1, you must first take course 4.\n     - (3, 5): To take course 3, you must first take course 5.\n     - (1, 5): To take course 1, you must first take course 5.\n     - (5, 0): To take course 5, you must first take course 0.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph can be represented as an adjacency list:\n     - 0: [4, 5]\n     - 1: [5]\n     - 2: [5]\n     - 3: [0, 5]\n     - 4: [0, 5]\n     - 5: [1]\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in this graph. A cycle would mean that a course depends on itself indirectly, making it impossible to complete all courses.\n   - Start with course 0:\n     - 0 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 4 (cycle detected)\n   - Since a cycle is detected, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The presence of a cycle in the course dependency graph indicates that not all courses can be completed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
