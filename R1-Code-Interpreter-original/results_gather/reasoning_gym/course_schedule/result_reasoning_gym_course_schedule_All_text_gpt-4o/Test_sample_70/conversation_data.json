    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (0, 1): To take course 0, you must first take course 1.\n     - (3, 1): To take course 3, you must first take course 1.\n     - (5, 4): To take course 5, you must first take course 4.\n     - (5, 1): To take course 5, you must first take course 1.\n     - (4, 2): To take course 4, you must first take course 2.\n     - (2, 1): To take course 2, you must first take course 1.\n     - (2, 0): To take course 2, you must first take course 0.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, where an edge from b_i to a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n   - The graph can be represented as:\n     - 1 -> 0\n     - 1 -> 3\n     - 4 -> 5\n     - 1 -> 5\n     - 2 -> 4\n     - 1 -> 2\n     - 0 -> 2\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in this directed graph.\n   - A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n\n4. **Topological Sorting:**\n   - If we can perform a topological sort on the graph, it means there is no cycle, and all courses can be completed.\n   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree of 0).\n   - Remove these courses from the graph and reduce the in-degree of their dependent courses.\n   - Continue this process until all courses are removed or a cycle is detected (i.e., some courses still have non-zero in-degree).\n\n5. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - If we can remove all courses, it means there is no cycle, and all courses can be completed.\n   - If some courses remain with non-zero in-degree, it indicates a cycle.\n\n6. **Apply the Logic:**\n   - Start with course 1, which has no prerequisites.\n   - Remove course 1, and update the in-degrees of courses 0, 3, 5, and 2.\n   - Next, course 0 can be taken (in-degree becomes 0).\n   - Remove course 0, and update the in-degree of course 2.\n   - Now, course 2 can be taken (in-degree becomes 0).\n   - Remove course 2, and update the in-degree of course 4.\n   - Now, course 4 can be taken (in-degree becomes 0).\n   - Remove course 4, and update the in-degree of course 5.\n   - Finally, course 5 can be taken (in-degree becomes 0).\n   - Remove course 5.\n   - All courses have been removed, indicating no cycle.\n\nSince we can remove all courses without encountering a cycle, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<True>>>"
