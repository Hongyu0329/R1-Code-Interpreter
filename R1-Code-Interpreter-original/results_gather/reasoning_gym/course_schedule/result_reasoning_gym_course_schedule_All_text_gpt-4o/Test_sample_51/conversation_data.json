    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete all courses. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 8 (labeled 0 to 7).\n   - Prerequisites: [(3, 6), (1, 2), (0, 4), (7, 5), (3, 2), (1, 3), (7, 0), (0, 2), (6, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5)].\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b_i to node a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - Course 6 -> Course 3\n   - Course 2 -> Course 1\n   - Course 4 -> Course 0\n   - Course 5 -> Course 7\n   - Course 2 -> Course 3\n   - Course 3 -> Course 1\n   - Course 0 -> Course 7\n   - Course 2 -> Course 0\n   - Course 5 -> Course 6\n   - Course 5 -> Course 2\n   - Course 5 -> Course 4\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method (e.g., Depth-First Search) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes currently in the recursion stack (indicating the path being explored).\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection Analysis:**\n   - Start from any unvisited node and perform DFS.\n   - If a cycle is detected during DFS, return False.\n   - If DFS completes without finding a cycle, continue with the next unvisited node.\n   - If all nodes are visited without detecting a cycle, return True.\n\n6. **Apply Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from course 0:\n     - Visit course 0, then course 4, then course 5, then course 7.\n     - Backtrack to course 5, then visit course 6, then course 3, then course 2, then course 1.\n     - No cycle detected in this path.\n   - All nodes are visited, and no cycle is detected.\n\nSince no cycle is detected in the graph, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<True>>>"
