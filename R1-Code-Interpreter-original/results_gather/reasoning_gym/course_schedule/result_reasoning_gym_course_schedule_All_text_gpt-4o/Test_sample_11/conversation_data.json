    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **List of Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n   - Prerequisites: [(1, 3), (0, 2), (1, 0), (3, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (2, 4), (2, 1)]\n\n2. **Graph Representation:**\n   - We can represent the courses and their prerequisites as a directed graph where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node b to node a indicates that course b is a prerequisite for course a.\n\n3. **Building the Graph:**\n   - Course 1 requires 3: 3 -> 1\n   - Course 0 requires 2: 2 -> 0\n   - Course 1 requires 0: 0 -> 1\n   - Course 3 requires 4: 4 -> 3\n   - Course 3 requires 0: 0 -> 3\n   - Course 4 requires 0: 0 -> 4\n   - Course 2 requires 4: 4 -> 2\n   - Course 2 requires 1: 1 -> 2\n\n4. **Checking for Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in this directed graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them all.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start with course 0: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 0 (cycle detected)\n   - The presence of a cycle (0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 0) indicates that it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is a cycle in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
