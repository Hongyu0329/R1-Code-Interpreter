    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n   - Prerequisites: [(5, 7), (0, 1), (2, 5), (6, 7), (3, 7), (0, 7), (2, 6), (4, 7), (1, 7), (5, 0), (3, 5), (4, 5), (1, 2), (6, 4)]\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a_i, b_i) is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes that are currently being visited in the current path.\n   - If a node is revisited in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n\n4. **Perform DFS for Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during DFS, return False.\n   - If DFS completes without finding a cycle, return True.\n\n5. **Check Each Course:**\n   - Start DFS from each course (node) that has not been visited.\n   - If any DFS call detects a cycle, it means not all courses can be completed.\n\n6. **Final Decision:**\n   - If no cycles are detected after checking all courses, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's apply this logic to the given prerequisites:\n\n- Start DFS from course 0:\n  - 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 7\n  - 5 -> 0 (cycle detected)\n\nSince a cycle is detected, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
