    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - We have 8 courses labeled from 0 to 7.\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning course b_i must be completed before course a_i.\n\n2. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (6, 0): Course 0 must be completed before course 6.\n   - (2, 5): Course 5 must be completed before course 2.\n   - (3, 2): Course 2 must be completed before course 3.\n   - (3, 6): Course 6 must be completed before course 3.\n   - (6, 4): Course 4 must be completed before course 6.\n   - (5, 4): Course 4 must be completed before course 5.\n   - (2, 4): Course 4 must be completed before course 2.\n   - (1, 4): Course 4 must be completed before course 1.\n   - (0, 4): Course 4 must be completed before course 0.\n   - (7, 6): Course 6 must be completed before course 7.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - We can represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph where each course is a node, and each prerequisite is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n4. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - To determine if all courses can be completed, we need to check if this directed graph has a cycle.\n   - A cycle in the graph would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n\n5. **Topological Sorting:**\n   - If the graph can be topologically sorted, it means there is no cycle, and all courses can be completed.\n   - We can use algorithms like Kahn's algorithm or Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles and perform topological sorting.\n\n6. **Analysis of the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - Let's try to perform a topological sort or detect a cycle using the given prerequisites.\n   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites and try to order the courses.\n   - If we can order all courses without encountering a cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - After analyzing the graph formed by the prerequisites, we find that there is no cycle.\n   - Therefore, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
