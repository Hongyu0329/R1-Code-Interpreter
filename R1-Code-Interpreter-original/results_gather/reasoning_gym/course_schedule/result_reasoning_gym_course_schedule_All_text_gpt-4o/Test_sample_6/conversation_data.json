    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - We have 10 courses labeled from 0 to 9.\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a_i, b_i) is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n3. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (6, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (9, 0), (5, 7), (2, 5), (4, 7), (9, 1), (0, 3), (3, 7), (2, 4), (6, 3), (8, 1), (5, 4), (4, 8), (8, 4)\n\n4. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - We need to determine if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a circular dependency, making it impossible to complete all courses.\n   - Use a graph traversal method like Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles. During DFS, keep track of nodes in the current path. If you revisit a node that is already in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - Mark nodes as visited and add them to the current path.\n   - If a node is revisited in the current path, a cycle exists.\n   - If no cycles are detected after checking all nodes, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\n6. **Analyze the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - Construct the graph and perform DFS to check for cycles.\n   - For example, starting from course 6, follow the prerequisites: 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 7. No cycle here.\n   - Continue checking other paths: 1 -> 3 -> 7, 1 -> 4 -> 8, 9 -> 0 -> 3, etc.\n   - Eventually, you will find a cycle: 4 -> 8 -> 1 -> 4, which makes it impossible to complete all courses.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since a cycle is detected, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
