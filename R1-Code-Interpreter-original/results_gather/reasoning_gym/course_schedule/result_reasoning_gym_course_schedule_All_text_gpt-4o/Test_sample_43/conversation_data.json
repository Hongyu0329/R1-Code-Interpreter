    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - We have 8 courses labeled from 0 to 7.\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (6, 2): To take course 6, first take course 2.\n   - (3, 7): To take course 3, first take course 7.\n   - (7, 5): To take course 7, first take course 5.\n   - (0, 2): To take course 0, first take course 2.\n   - (1, 5): To take course 1, first take course 5.\n   - (3, 2): To take course 3, first take course 2.\n   - (0, 7): To take course 0, first take course 7.\n   - (4, 7): To take course 4, first take course 7.\n   - (6, 5): To take course 6, first take course 5.\n   - (2, 5): To take course 2, first take course 5.\n   - (7, 2): To take course 7, first take course 2.\n\n3. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Courses are nodes.\n   - Prerequisites are directed edges from b_i to a_i.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method (e.g., Depth-First Search) to detect cycles.\n   - If a cycle is detected, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed.\n\n5. **Graph Analysis:**\n   - Start with course 5, which is a prerequisite for courses 1, 2, 6, and 7.\n   - Course 2 is a prerequisite for courses 0, 3, 6, and 7.\n   - Course 7 is a prerequisite for courses 0, 3, and 4.\n   - Check for cycles by following the dependencies.\n\n6. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - From course 5, you can go to course 2.\n   - From course 2, you can go to course 7.\n   - From course 7, you can go back to course 2, forming a cycle (2 -> 7 -> 2).\n\nSince there is a cycle in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<False>>>"
