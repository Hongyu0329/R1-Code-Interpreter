    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 7 (labeled 0 to 6).\n   - Prerequisites: [(1, 6), (4, 3), (4, 6), (2, 6), (5, 2), (5, 1), (3, 6), (0, 2), (3, 2)].\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from b_i to a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - Course 6 is a prerequisite for courses 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n   - Course 3 is a prerequisite for course 4.\n   - Course 2 is a prerequisite for courses 0, 3, and 5.\n   - Course 1 is a prerequisite for course 5.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in this directed graph.\n   - A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n\n5. **Topological Sorting or Cycle Detection:**\n   - Use a method like Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Alternatively, use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting, which can also detect cycles.\n\n6. **Cycle Detection Analysis:**\n   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree 0).\n   - Remove them from the graph and reduce the in-degree of their dependent courses.\n   - If you can remove all courses this way, there is no cycle.\n   - If some courses remain with non-zero in-degree, a cycle exists.\n\n7. **Apply the Analysis:**\n   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites: course 6.\n   - Remove course 6, reducing the in-degree of courses 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n   - Continue removing courses with in-degree 0.\n   - If all courses can be removed, there is no cycle.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - After applying the above steps, if all courses can be removed without any remaining, it means there is no cycle, and all courses can be completed.\n\nAfter performing the analysis, we find that it is possible to complete all courses without encountering a cycle.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>."
