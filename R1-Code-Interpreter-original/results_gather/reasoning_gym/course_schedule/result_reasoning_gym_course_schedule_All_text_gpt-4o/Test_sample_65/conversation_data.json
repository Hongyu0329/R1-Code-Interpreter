    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and it is impossible to complete all courses. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (5, 4): To take course 5, you must first take course 4.\n     - (4, 5): To take course 4, you must first take course 5.\n     - (2, 5): To take course 2, you must first take course 5.\n     - (2, 4): To take course 2, you must first take course 4.\n     - (0, 2): To take course 0, you must first take course 2.\n     - (5, 1): To take course 5, you must first take course 1.\n     - (3, 1): To take course 3, you must first take course 1.\n     - (4, 1): To take course 4, you must first take course 1.\n     - (4, 0): To take course 4, you must first take course 0.\n     - (0, 4): To take course 0, you must first take course 4.\n     - (2, 1): To take course 2, you must first take course 1.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, with edges representing prerequisites.\n   - For example, an edge from 4 to 5 indicates that course 5 depends on course 4.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - A cycle exists if there is a path that starts and ends at the same course.\n   - From the prerequisites, we can see:\n     - (5, 4) and (4, 5) form a cycle between courses 4 and 5.\n     - (4, 0) and (0, 4) form a cycle between courses 0 and 4.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The presence of cycles (4 <-> 5 and 0 <-> 4) indicates that there are circular dependencies.\n   - Therefore, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe final answer is that it is not possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites.\n\n<<<False>>>"
