    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that there is a circular dependency, and it is impossible to complete all courses. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 6 (labeled 0 to 5).\n   - Prerequisites: [(5, 2), (2, 4), (2, 1), (0, 1), (1, 4), (3, 2)].\n   - This means:\n     - To take course 5, you must first take course 2.\n     - To take course 2, you must first take course 4.\n     - To take course 2, you must first take course 1.\n     - To take course 0, you must first take course 1.\n     - To take course 1, you must first take course 4.\n     - To take course 3, you must first take course 2.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Represent the courses as nodes and prerequisites as directed edges.\n   - The graph can be visualized as:\n     - 4 -> 2\n     - 1 -> 2\n     - 4 -> 1\n     - 1 -> 0\n     - 2 -> 5\n     - 2 -> 3\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method (such as Depth-First Search) to detect cycles.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes and nodes in the current path.\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n\n4. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Start from each unvisited node and perform a DFS.\n   - If a cycle is detected during any DFS traversal, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after all nodes are processed, return True.\n\n5. **Perform the Check:**\n   - Start DFS from node 4:\n     - 4 -> 2 -> 5 (no cycle)\n     - 4 -> 1 -> 0 (no cycle)\n   - Start DFS from node 2:\n     - 2 -> 5 (no cycle)\n     - 2 -> 3 (no cycle)\n   - Start DFS from node 1:\n     - 1 -> 0 (no cycle)\n   - Start DFS from node 0:\n     - No outgoing edges (no cycle)\n   - Start DFS from node 3:\n     - No outgoing edges (no cycle)\n   - Start DFS from node 5:\n     - No outgoing edges (no cycle)\n\nSince no cycles are detected in any of the DFS traversals, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<True>>>"
