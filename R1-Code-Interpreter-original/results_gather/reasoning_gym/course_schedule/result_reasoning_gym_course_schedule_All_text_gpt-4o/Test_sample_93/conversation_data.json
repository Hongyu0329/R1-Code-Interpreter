    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 6 (labeled 0 to 5).\n   - Prerequisites: [(2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (2, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4)].\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b to node a indicates that course b must be completed before course a.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - Course 2 depends on courses 0 and 3.\n   - Course 3 depends on course 0.\n   - Course 4 depends on course 0.\n   - Course 0 depends on course 5.\n   - Course 1 depends on courses 5 and 4.\n\n4. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a circular dependency, making it impossible to complete all courses.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start with course 0: It depends on course 5.\n   - Course 5 has no prerequisites, so it can be completed.\n   - Course 1 depends on courses 5 and 4. Since course 5 can be completed, check course 4.\n   - Course 4 depends on course 0. Since course 0 depends on course 5, and course 5 can be completed, course 4 can be completed.\n   - Course 1 can now be completed since both its prerequisites (5 and 4) can be completed.\n   - Course 2 depends on courses 0 and 3. Since course 0 can be completed, check course 3.\n   - Course 3 depends on course 0, which can be completed, so course 3 can be completed.\n   - Now, course 2 can be completed since both its prerequisites (0 and 3) can be completed.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are no cycles in the graph, as all courses can be completed by following the prerequisite order.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to finish all courses.\n\nFinal answer: <<<True>>>"
