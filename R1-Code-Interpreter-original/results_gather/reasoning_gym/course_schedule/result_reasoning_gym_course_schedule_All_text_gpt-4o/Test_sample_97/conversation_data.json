    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Dependencies:**\n   - Courses: 0 to 8\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (1, 6): To take course 1, you must first take course 6.\n     - (7, 2): To take course 7, you must first take course 2.\n     - (5, 2): To take course 5, you must first take course 2.\n     - (6, 2): To take course 6, you must first take course 2.\n     - (5, 6): To take course 5, you must first take course 6.\n     - (4, 3): To take course 4, you must first take course 3.\n     - (3, 2): To take course 3, you must first take course 2.\n     - (4, 6): To take course 4, you must first take course 6.\n     - (0, 1): To take course 0, you must first take course 1.\n     - (3, 6): To take course 3, you must first take course 6.\n     - (8, 7): To take course 8, you must first take course 7.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, where an edge from b_i to a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes and nodes in the current path (recursion stack) to detect back edges, which indicate cycles.\n\n4. **Check Each Course:**\n   - Start from each course and perform DFS to see if you can complete all courses without encountering a cycle.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - If a cycle is detected during the DFS traversal, it means not all courses can be completed.\n   - If no cycle is detected, all courses can be completed.\n\n6. **Analyze the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - By performing DFS on the graph constructed from the prerequisites, we can check for cycles.\n   - In this case, there is no cycle in the graph, as each course can be completed in a sequence that respects the prerequisites.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<True>>>"
