    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (3, 0): To take course 3, you must first take course 0.\n     - (3, 1): To take course 3, you must first take course 1.\n     - (6, 4): To take course 6, you must first take course 4.\n     - (4, 5): To take course 4, you must first take course 5.\n     - (1, 2): To take course 1, you must first take course 2.\n     - (3, 2): To take course 3, you must first take course 2.\n     - (5, 3): To take course 5, you must first take course 3.\n     - (1, 5): To take course 1, you must first take course 5.\n     - (0, 4): To take course 0, you must first take course 4.\n     - (6, 5): To take course 6, you must first take course 5.\n     - (2, 0): To take course 2, you must first take course 0.\n     - (2, 5): To take course 2, you must first take course 5.\n     - (1, 0): To take course 1, you must first take course 0.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Represent the courses as nodes and prerequisites as directed edges.\n   - For example, an edge from node 0 to node 3 indicates that course 0 is a prerequisite for course 3.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes that are currently being visited in the current path.\n   - If a node is revisited in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n\n4. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during the DFS traversal, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after traversing all nodes, return True.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Let's perform a DFS starting from each course:\n     - Start from course 0: Visit 0 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 (Cycle detected)\n     - Since a cycle is detected, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that it is not possible to finish all courses due to the presence of a cycle in the prerequisites.\n\n<<<False>>>"
