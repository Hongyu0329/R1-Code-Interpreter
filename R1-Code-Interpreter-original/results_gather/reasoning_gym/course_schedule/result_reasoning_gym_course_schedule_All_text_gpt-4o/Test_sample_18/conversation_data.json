    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 8 (labeled 0 to 7).\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i) meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (2, 0): To take course 2, first take course 0.\n   - (3, 7): To take course 3, first take course 7.\n   - (1, 0): To take course 1, first take course 0.\n   - (7, 2): To take course 7, first take course 2.\n   - (5, 6): To take course 5, first take course 6.\n   - (7, 6): To take course 7, first take course 6.\n   - (0, 6): To take course 0, first take course 6.\n   - (3, 0): To take course 3, first take course 0.\n   - (4, 5): To take course 4, first take course 5.\n   - (5, 7): To take course 5, first take course 7.\n   - (7, 0): To take course 7, first take course 0.\n   - (2, 3): To take course 2, first take course 3.\n   - (1, 6): To take course 1, first take course 6.\n\n3. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Courses are nodes.\n   - Prerequisites are directed edges from b_i to a_i.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method (e.g., Depth-First Search) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited list to track the state of each node: unvisited, visiting, or visited.\n   - If a node is encountered that is already in the visiting state, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection Analysis:**\n   - Start from any unvisited node and perform DFS.\n   - If a cycle is detected during the DFS traversal, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after all nodes are processed, return True.\n\n6. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - From the prerequisites, we can see that there is a cycle involving courses 0, 2, 3, and 7:\n     - 2 requires 0, 3 requires 7, 7 requires 2, and 2 requires 3.\n   - This forms a cycle: 2 -> 3 -> 7 -> 2.\n\nSince there is a cycle in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<False>>>"
