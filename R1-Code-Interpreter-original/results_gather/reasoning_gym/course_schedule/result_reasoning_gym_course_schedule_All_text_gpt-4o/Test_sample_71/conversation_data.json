    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - We have 10 courses labeled from 0 to 9.\n   - The prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a_i, b_i) is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n3. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (5, 6): To take course 5, first take course 6.\n   - (9, 2): To take course 9, first take course 2.\n   - (7, 1): To take course 7, first take course 1.\n   - (9, 6): To take course 9, first take course 6.\n   - (1, 4): To take course 1, first take course 4.\n   - (8, 7): To take course 8, first take course 7.\n   - (2, 6): To take course 2, first take course 6.\n   - (8, 9): To take course 8, first take course 9.\n   - (3, 9): To take course 3, first take course 9.\n   - (4, 6): To take course 4, first take course 6.\n   - (1, 0): To take course 1, first take course 0.\n   - (4, 8): To take course 4, first take course 8.\n   - (0, 9): To take course 0, first take course 9.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes currently in the recursion stack (indicating the path being explored).\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Perform Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during DFS, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after exploring all nodes, return True.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - After performing the cycle detection, if no cycles are found, it means all courses can be completed.\n\nIn this case, after analyzing the graph formed by the prerequisites, we find that there is a cycle involving courses 9, 2, and 6. This cycle prevents the completion of all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
