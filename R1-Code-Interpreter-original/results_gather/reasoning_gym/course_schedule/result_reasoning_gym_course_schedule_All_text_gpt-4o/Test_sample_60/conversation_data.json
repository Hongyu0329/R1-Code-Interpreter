    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n   - Prerequisites: [(5, 0), (4, 6), (7, 1), (1, 7), (2, 1), (3, 1), (0, 2), (5, 3), (3, 2), (7, 5), (4, 1), (6, 5)]\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a_i, b_i) is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes that are currently in the recursion stack (i.e., nodes that are being visited in the current path).\n   - If we revisit a node that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n4. **Perform DFS for Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during DFS, return False.\n   - If DFS completes without finding a cycle, return True.\n\n5. **Check Each Course:**\n   - Start DFS from course 0 and check for cycles.\n   - Repeat for each course that hasn't been visited yet.\n\n6. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - For the given prerequisites, perform DFS and track the visited nodes.\n   - If a node is revisited in the current path, a cycle exists.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - After performing the above steps, if no cycles are detected, all courses can be completed.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine if it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nAfter analyzing the prerequisites, we find that there is a cycle involving courses 1, 7, and 5. Specifically, the cycle is: 1 -> 7 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1. This cycle indicates that there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
