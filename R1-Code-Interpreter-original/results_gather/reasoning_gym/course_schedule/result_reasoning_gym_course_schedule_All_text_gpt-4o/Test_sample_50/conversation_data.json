    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (3, 1): To take course 3, you must first take course 1.\n     - (4, 0): To take course 4, you must first take course 0.\n     - (5, 0): To take course 5, you must first take course 0.\n     - (5, 1): To take course 5, you must first take course 1.\n     - (0, 5): To take course 0, you must first take course 5.\n     - (3, 2): To take course 3, you must first take course 2.\n     - (4, 2): To take course 4, you must first take course 2.\n     - (0, 3): To take course 0, you must first take course 3.\n     - (1, 5): To take course 1, you must first take course 5.\n     - (0, 1): To take course 0, you must first take course 1.\n     - (2, 1): To take course 2, you must first take course 1.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, with edges pointing from the prerequisite course to the dependent course.\n   - For example, an edge from 1 to 3 indicates that course 1 is a prerequisite for course 3.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - A cycle in the graph indicates that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular manner, making it impossible to complete all courses.\n   - We can use algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.\n\n4. **Analyze the Graph:**\n   - Start with course 0: \n     - Course 0 depends on course 5 and course 1.\n     - Course 5 depends on course 0 and course 1.\n     - Course 1 depends on course 5.\n   - This forms a cycle: 0 -> 5 -> 1 -> 5 -> 0.\n   - Since there is a cycle, it is impossible to complete all courses.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The presence of a cycle in the prerequisite graph means not all courses can be completed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
