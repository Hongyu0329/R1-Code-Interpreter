    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Dependencies:**\n   - Courses: 0 to 8\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (5, 3): To take course 5, you must first take course 3.\n     - (2, 0): To take course 2, you must first take course 0.\n     - (8, 7): To take course 8, you must first take course 7.\n     - (8, 6): To take course 8, you must first take course 6.\n     - (7, 3): To take course 7, you must first take course 3.\n     - (1, 5): To take course 1, you must first take course 5.\n     - (6, 3): To take course 6, you must first take course 3.\n     - (3, 4): To take course 3, you must first take course 4.\n     - (2, 6): To take course 2, you must first take course 6.\n     - (0, 6): To take course 0, you must first take course 6.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, with edges pointing from the prerequisite to the dependent course.\n   - Example edges: 3 -> 5, 0 -> 2, 7 -> 8, etc.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a method like Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes and nodes in the current path (recursion stack).\n\n4. **Cycle Detection Analysis:**\n   - Start from any unvisited node and perform DFS.\n   - If you revisit a node that is already in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n   - If you complete DFS for all nodes without finding a cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\n5. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Start DFS from course 0:\n     - 0 -> 2 -> 6 -> 3 -> 4 (no cycle here)\n   - Continue DFS from other unvisited nodes:\n     - 3 -> 5 -> 1 (no cycle here)\n     - 7 -> 8 (no cycle here)\n   - All nodes are visited without detecting a cycle.\n\nSince no cycles are detected in the graph, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<True>>>"
