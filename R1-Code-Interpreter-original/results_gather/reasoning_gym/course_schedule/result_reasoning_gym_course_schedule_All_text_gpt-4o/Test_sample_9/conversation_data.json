    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 8 (labeled 0 to 7).\n   - Prerequisites: [(3, 7), (1, 6), (2, 7), (6, 2), (4, 0), (2, 0), (5, 1), (7, 0)].\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b to node a indicates that course b must be completed before course a.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - Course 3 depends on course 7.\n   - Course 1 depends on course 6.\n   - Course 2 depends on course 7.\n   - Course 6 depends on course 2.\n   - Course 4 depends on course 0.\n   - Course 2 depends on course 0.\n   - Course 5 depends on course 1.\n   - Course 7 depends on course 0.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n   - One way to detect cycles is to use Depth-First Search (DFS) and keep track of visited nodes and recursion stack.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n   - In this graph, starting from course 6, we can see:\n     - 6 -> 2 -> 7 -> 0\n     - 2 -> 0\n     - 7 -> 0\n     - 6 -> 2 (cycle detected: 6 -> 2 -> 6)\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is a cycle (6 -> 2 -> 6), it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
