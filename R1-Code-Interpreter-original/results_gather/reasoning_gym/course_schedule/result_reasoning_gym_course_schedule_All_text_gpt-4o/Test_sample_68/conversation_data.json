    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (2, 4): To take course 2, you must first take course 4.\n     - (4, 3): To take course 4, you must first take course 3.\n     - (1, 4): To take course 1, you must first take course 4.\n     - (5, 0): To take course 5, you must first take course 0.\n     - (4, 0): To take course 4, you must first take course 0.\n     - (5, 4): To take course 5, you must first take course 4.\n     - (1, 0): To take course 1, you must first take course 0.\n     - (3, 5): To take course 3, you must first take course 5.\n     - (3, 0): To take course 3, you must first take course 0.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, where an edge from b_i to a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\n4. **Topological Sorting or Cycle Detection:**\n   - Use a topological sort or a cycle detection algorithm (like Depth-First Search with a recursion stack) to determine if there is a cycle.\n\n5. **Analyze the Graph:**\n   - Start with course 0:\n     - Course 0 is a prerequisite for courses 5, 4, 1, and 3.\n   - Course 5 depends on course 0 and course 4.\n   - Course 4 depends on course 3 and course 0.\n   - Course 3 depends on course 5 and course 0.\n   - Course 1 depends on course 4 and course 0.\n   - Course 2 depends on course 4.\n\n6. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - From course 0, we can reach course 5.\n   - From course 5, we can reach course 4.\n   - From course 4, we can reach course 3.\n   - From course 3, we can reach course 5 again, forming a cycle: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5.\n\nSince there is a cycle in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<False>>>"
