    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - We have 9 courses labeled from 0 to 8.\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i) meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a_i, b_i) is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n3. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (6, 7), (3, 2), (4, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (8, 7), (2, 7), (4, 1), (5, 1), (8, 6), (3, 1), (0, 8), (5, 7)\n\n4. **Graph Representation:**\n   - The graph can be represented as an adjacency list or matrix.\n   - We need to check for cycles in this directed graph.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting to detect cycles.\n   - If a cycle is detected, it is impossible to complete all courses.\n\n6. **Perform Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start with any course and perform DFS.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes and nodes in the current path.\n   - If a node is revisited in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n\n7. **Check All Courses:**\n   - Since the graph may be disconnected, ensure all courses are checked for cycles.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - If no cycles are detected, all courses can be completed.\n   - If a cycle is detected, it is impossible to complete all courses.\n\nAfter performing the above analysis and cycle detection, we find that there is a cycle in the graph. For example, one such cycle is: 1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 6 -> 7, which makes it impossible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
