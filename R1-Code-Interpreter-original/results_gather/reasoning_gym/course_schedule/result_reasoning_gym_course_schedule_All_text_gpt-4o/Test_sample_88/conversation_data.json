    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0 to 8\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (3, 4): To take course 3, you must first take course 4.\n     - (6, 1): To take course 6, you must first take course 1.\n     - (1, 2): To take course 1, you must first take course 2.\n     - (6, 2): To take course 6, you must first take course 2.\n     - (4, 0): To take course 4, you must first take course 0.\n     - (4, 1): To take course 4, you must first take course 1.\n     - (0, 1): To take course 0, you must first take course 1.\n     - (1, 3): To take course 1, you must first take course 3.\n     - (7, 6): To take course 7, you must first take course 6.\n     - (3, 7): To take course 3, you must first take course 7.\n     - (7, 2): To take course 7, you must first take course 2.\n     - (2, 1): To take course 2, you must first take course 1.\n     - (8, 0): To take course 8, you must first take course 0.\n     - (8, 6): To take course 8, you must first take course 6.\n     - (5, 2): To take course 5, you must first take course 2.\n     - (6, 0): To take course 6, you must first take course 0.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a, b) is a directed edge from b to a.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes currently in the recursion stack (to detect back edges indicating cycles).\n\n4. **Cycle Detection Analysis:**\n   - Start with course 0 and follow the prerequisites.\n   - Course 0 requires course 1.\n   - Course 1 requires course 2.\n   - Course 2 requires course 1 (cycle detected: 1 -> 2 -> 1).\n   - Since a cycle is detected, not all courses can be completed.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The presence of a cycle in the graph indicates that it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
