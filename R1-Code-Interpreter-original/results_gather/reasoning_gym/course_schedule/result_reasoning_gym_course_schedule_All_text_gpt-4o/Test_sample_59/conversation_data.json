    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (0, 3): To take course 0, you must first take course 3.\n     - (1, 3): To take course 1, you must first take course 3.\n     - (1, 0): To take course 1, you must first take course 0.\n     - (4, 0): To take course 4, you must first take course 0.\n     - (2, 0): To take course 2, you must first take course 0.\n     - (4, 1): To take course 4, you must first take course 1.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph can be represented as a directed graph where an edge from b_i to a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - A cycle in the graph would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n   - We can use a depth-first search (DFS) or a topological sort to detect cycles.\n\n4. **Perform Topological Sort or DFS:**\n   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree of 0).\n   - Remove them from the graph and reduce the in-degree of their dependent courses.\n   - If you can remove all courses in this manner, there is no cycle.\n   - If you cannot remove all courses, there is a cycle.\n\n5. **Apply the Algorithm:**\n   - Course 3 has no prerequisites, so it can be taken first.\n   - After taking course 3, courses 0 and 1 become available.\n   - After taking course 0, courses 2 and 4 become available.\n   - After taking course 1, course 4 is still available.\n   - All courses can be taken without encountering a cycle.\n\nSince we can complete all courses without encountering a cycle, it is possible to finish all courses.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<True>>>"
