    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0 to 8\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (7, 3): To take course 7, you must first take course 3.\n     - (1, 6): To take course 1, you must first take course 6.\n     - (7, 0): To take course 7, you must first take course 0.\n     - (8, 1): To take course 8, you must first take course 1.\n     - (4, 7): To take course 4, you must first take course 7.\n     - (2, 4): To take course 2, you must first take course 4.\n     - (1, 4): To take course 1, you must first take course 4.\n     - (3, 4): To take course 3, you must first take course 4.\n     - (5, 8): To take course 5, you must first take course 8.\n     - (6, 3): To take course 6, you must first take course 3.\n     - (4, 3): To take course 4, you must first take course 3.\n     - (5, 7): To take course 5, you must first take course 7.\n     - (4, 0): To take course 4, you must first take course 0.\n     - (3, 0): To take course 3, you must first take course 0.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, with edges pointing from the prerequisite course to the dependent course.\n   - For example, an edge from 3 to 7 indicates that course 3 is a prerequisite for course 7.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.\n   - A cycle exists if during the DFS traversal, we encounter a node that is already in the current path of traversal.\n\n4. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Start DFS from each course that has no prerequisites (i.e., no incoming edges).\n   - Track visited nodes and nodes in the current path.\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Analyze the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - The prerequisites form a complex graph with multiple dependencies.\n   - By performing a DFS or using a topological sort, we can check for cycles.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - After analyzing the graph formed by the prerequisites, we find that there is a cycle.\n   - For example, one possible cycle is: 3 -> 4 -> 7 -> 3.\n   - Since there is a cycle, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
