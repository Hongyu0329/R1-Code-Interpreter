    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and it is impossible to complete all courses. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0 to 8\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (0, 1): To take course 0, you must first take course 1.\n     - (0, 7): To take course 0, you must first take course 7.\n     - (2, 8): To take course 2, you must first take course 8.\n     - (1, 2): To take course 1, you must first take course 2.\n     - (8, 7): To take course 8, you must first take course 7.\n     - (6, 2): To take course 6, you must first take course 2.\n     - (4, 7): To take course 4, you must first take course 7.\n     - (5, 7): To take course 5, you must first take course 7.\n     - (7, 6): To take course 7, you must first take course 6.\n     - (0, 6): To take course 0, you must first take course 6.\n     - (2, 0): To take course 2, you must first take course 0.\n     - (1, 6): To take course 1, you must first take course 6.\n     - (2, 4): To take course 2, you must first take course 4.\n     - (4, 8): To take course 4, you must first take course 8.\n     - (6, 3): To take course 6, you must first take course 3.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, with edges pointing from the prerequisite course to the dependent course.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n\n4. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start with course 0 and follow the prerequisites:\n     - 0 depends on 1 and 7.\n     - 1 depends on 2 and 6.\n     - 2 depends on 8, 0, and 4.\n     - 8 depends on 7.\n     - 7 depends on 6.\n     - 6 depends on 2 and 3.\n     - 4 depends on 7 and 8.\n   - Notice that course 2 depends on course 0, and course 0 depends on course 1, which in turn depends on course 2. This forms a cycle: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0.\n   - Additionally, course 7 depends on course 6, which depends on course 2, which depends on course 0, which depends on course 7, forming another cycle: 7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 0 -> 7.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are cycles in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
