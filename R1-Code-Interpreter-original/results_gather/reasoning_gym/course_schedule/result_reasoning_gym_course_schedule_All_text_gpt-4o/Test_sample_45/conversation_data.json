    "To determine if you can finish all courses given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and you cannot complete all courses. If there is no cycle, it means you can complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n   - Prerequisites: [(4, 6), (3, 6), (1, 0), (0, 6), (0, 3), (2, 3), (5, 4)]\n\n2. **Build the Graph:**\n   - Represent the courses as nodes and prerequisites as directed edges.\n   - For example, (4, 6) means there is a directed edge from 6 to 4.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - 6 -> 4\n   - 6 -> 3\n   - 0 -> 1\n   - 6 -> 0\n   - 3 -> 0\n   - 3 -> 2\n   - 4 -> 5\n\n4. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Use a method like Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes and nodes currently in the recursion stack.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If you revisit a node that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n6. **Perform DFS:**\n   - Start from node 6: Visit 6 -> 4 -> 5 (no cycle here)\n   - Backtrack to 6: Visit 6 -> 3 -> 0 -> 1 (no cycle here)\n   - Backtrack to 3: Visit 3 -> 2 (no cycle here)\n   - All nodes are visited without revisiting any node in the current path, indicating no cycle.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since no cycles are detected in the graph, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
