    "To determine if you can finish all courses given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and you cannot complete all courses. If there is no cycle, it means you can complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (4, 6): To take course 4, you must first take course 6.\n     - (1, 3): To take course 1, you must first take course 3.\n     - (6, 3): To take course 6, you must first take course 3.\n     - (6, 2): To take course 6, you must first take course 2.\n     - (1, 5): To take course 1, you must first take course 5.\n     - (5, 2): To take course 5, you must first take course 2.\n     - (0, 5): To take course 0, you must first take course 5.\n     - (2, 3): To take course 2, you must first take course 3.\n     - (5, 6): To take course 5, you must first take course 6.\n     - (2, 0): To take course 2, you must first take course 0.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, where an edge from b_i to a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes that are currently being visited (recursion stack).\n   - If you revisit a node that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n4. **Perform DFS to Check for Cycles:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during DFS, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after checking all nodes, return True.\n\n5. **Analyze the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - Construct the graph based on the prerequisites.\n   - Perform DFS to check for cycles.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - After performing the above steps, if no cycles are detected, it means you can complete all courses. Otherwise, if a cycle is detected, you cannot complete all courses.\n\nIn this case, after analyzing the graph constructed from the prerequisites, we find that there is a cycle involving courses 0, 5, 6, and 2. Therefore, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<False>>>"
