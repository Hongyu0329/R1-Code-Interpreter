    "To determine if you can finish all courses given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and you cannot complete all courses. If there is no cycle, it means you can complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Dependencies:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (5, 0): To take course 5, you must first take course 0.\n     - (5, 6): To take course 5, you must first take course 6.\n     - (3, 5): To take course 3, you must first take course 5.\n     - (0, 3): To take course 0, you must first take course 3.\n     - (4, 6): To take course 4, you must first take course 6.\n     - (1, 0): To take course 1, you must first take course 0.\n     - (1, 6): To take course 1, you must first take course 6.\n     - (2, 0): To take course 2, you must first take course 0.\n     - (3, 4): To take course 3, you must first take course 4.\n     - (0, 6): To take course 0, you must first take course 6.\n     - (3, 0): To take course 3, you must first take course 0.\n     - (6, 2): To take course 6, you must first take course 2.\n     - (2, 4): To take course 2, you must first take course 4.\n     - (0, 4): To take course 0, you must first take course 4.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, with edges pointing from the prerequisite course to the dependent course.\n   - For example, an edge from 0 to 5 indicates that course 0 is a prerequisite for course 5.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes currently in the recursion stack (indicating the path being explored).\n   - If you revisit a node that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n4. **Cycle Detection Analysis:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during the DFS traversal, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after exploring all nodes, return True.\n\n5. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Start with course 0: \n     - 0 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 (cycle detected: 6 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6)\n   - Since a cycle is detected, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nBased on the analysis, there is a cycle in the course dependency graph, which means it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal answer: <<<False>>>"
