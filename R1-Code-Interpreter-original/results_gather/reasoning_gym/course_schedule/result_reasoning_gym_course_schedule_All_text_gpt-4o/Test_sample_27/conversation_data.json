    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Prerequisites List**: \n   - (4, 2): To take course 4, you must first take course 2.\n   - (5, 2): To take course 5, you must first take course 2.\n   - (0, 5): To take course 0, you must first take course 5.\n   - (5, 1): To take course 5, you must first take course 1.\n   - (2, 4): To take course 2, you must first take course 4.\n   - (3, 0): To take course 3, you must first take course 0.\n   - (3, 4): To take course 3, you must first take course 4.\n   - (3, 5): To take course 3, you must first take course 5.\n   - (1, 2): To take course 1, you must first take course 2.\n   - (4, 3): To take course 4, you must first take course 3.\n\n2. **Graph Representation**:\n   - We can represent the courses and their prerequisites as a directed graph where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node b to node a indicates that course b is a prerequisite for course a.\n\n3. **Cycle Detection**:\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in this directed graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\n4. **Constructing the Graph**:\n   - From the prerequisites, we can construct the following directed edges:\n     - 2 -> 4\n     - 2 -> 5\n     - 5 -> 0\n     - 1 -> 5\n     - 4 -> 2\n     - 0 -> 3\n     - 4 -> 3\n     - 5 -> 3\n     - 2 -> 1\n     - 3 -> 4\n\n5. **Checking for Cycles**:\n   - Let's trace the dependencies:\n     - Starting from course 2, we have 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 0 -> 3 (cycle detected: 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 4).\n     - Another cycle is 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since we have detected cycles in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
