    "To determine if you can finish all courses given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and you cannot complete all courses. If there is no cycle, it means you can complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses are labeled from 0 to 8.\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (5, 6): To take course 5, you must first take course 6.\n   - (4, 0): To take course 4, you must first take course 0.\n   - (6, 3): To take course 6, you must first take course 3.\n   - (8, 0): To take course 8, you must first take course 0.\n   - (0, 2): To take course 0, you must first take course 2.\n   - (3, 2): To take course 3, you must first take course 2.\n   - (2, 1): To take course 2, you must first take course 1.\n   - (7, 6): To take course 7, you must first take course 6.\n   - (0, 1): To take course 0, you must first take course 1.\n   - (5, 0): To take course 5, you must first take course 0.\n   - (8, 1): To take course 8, you must first take course 1.\n\n3. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a_i, b_i) is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes currently in the recursion stack (to detect back edges which indicate cycles).\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start from any unvisited node and perform DFS.\n   - If you encounter a node that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n   - If you complete DFS for all nodes without finding a cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\n6. **Apply the Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from course 0 and check for cycles.\n   - Continue the process for all courses.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - If a cycle is detected during the DFS traversal, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after checking all courses, return True.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, we find that there is no cycle in the graph, meaning it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<True>>>"
