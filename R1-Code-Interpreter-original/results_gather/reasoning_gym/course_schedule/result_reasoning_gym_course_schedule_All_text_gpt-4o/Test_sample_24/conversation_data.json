    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Dependencies:**\n   - Courses: 0 to 8\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (6, 8): To take course 6, you must first take course 8.\n     - (0, 4): To take course 0, you must first take course 4.\n     - (3, 1): To take course 3, you must first take course 1.\n     - (7, 2): To take course 7, you must first take course 2.\n     - (5, 2): To take course 5, you must first take course 2.\n     - (2, 3): To take course 2, you must first take course 3.\n     - (8, 1): To take course 8, you must first take course 1.\n     - (4, 1): To take course 4, you must first take course 1.\n     - (6, 1): To take course 6, you must first take course 1.\n     - (7, 8): To take course 7, you must first take course 8.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, with edges pointing from the prerequisite course to the dependent course.\n   - Example edges: 8 -> 6, 4 -> 0, 1 -> 3, 2 -> 7, 2 -> 5, 3 -> 2, 1 -> 8, 1 -> 4, 1 -> 6, 8 -> 7.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - A cycle in the graph would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n   - We can use a depth-first search (DFS) or a topological sort to detect cycles.\n\n4. **Perform Topological Sort or DFS:**\n   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree of 0).\n   - Remove them from the graph and reduce the in-degree of their dependent courses.\n   - If you can remove all courses in this manner, there is no cycle.\n   - If you cannot remove all courses, a cycle exists.\n\n5. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - By analyzing the given prerequisites, we can see that:\n     - Course 1 is a prerequisite for courses 3, 8, 4, and 6.\n     - Course 8 is a prerequisite for courses 6 and 7.\n     - Course 3 is a prerequisite for course 2.\n     - Course 2 is a prerequisite for courses 7 and 5.\n   - There is a cycle involving courses 1, 3, 2, 7, and 8:\n     - 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 7 -> 8 -> 1 (back to 1 through 8).\n\nSince there is a cycle in the course dependency graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<False>>>"
