    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 8 (labeled 0 to 7).\n   - Prerequisites: [(4, 2), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 0), (7, 6), (6, 0), (4, 7), (1, 0), (6, 4), (7, 1), (7, 5), (5, 0), (2, 6)].\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b_i to node a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes currently in the recursion stack (indicating the path being explored).\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n4. **Perform DFS for Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during DFS, return False.\n   - If DFS completes without finding a cycle, return True.\n\n5. **Analyze the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - Construct the graph based on the prerequisites.\n   - Perform DFS to check for cycles.\n\n6. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Start DFS from course 0:\n     - Course 0 has no prerequisites, so move to the next unvisited course.\n   - Start DFS from course 1:\n     - Course 1 depends on course 6.\n     - Course 6 depends on course 0 and course 4.\n     - Course 4 depends on course 2 and course 7.\n     - Course 2 depends on course 0 and course 6.\n     - Here, course 6 is revisited while still in the recursion stack, indicating a cycle.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - A cycle is detected in the graph, which means not all courses can be completed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
