    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n   - Prerequisites: (1, 6), (2, 1), (0, 3), (4, 5), (3, 1), (5, 6), (3, 6)\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b_i to node a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - 6 -> 1\n   - 1 -> 2\n   - 3 -> 0\n   - 5 -> 4\n   - 1 -> 3\n   - 6 -> 5\n   - 6 -> 3\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in this directed graph.\n   - A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start from any node and perform a Depth-First Search (DFS).\n   - Keep track of visited nodes and nodes currently in the recursion stack.\n   - If we encounter a node that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n6. **Perform DFS:**\n   - Start from course 6:\n     - 6 -> 1 -> 2 (no cycle here)\n     - 6 -> 5 -> 4 (no cycle here)\n     - 6 -> 3 -> 0 (no cycle here)\n     - 3 -> 1 (already visited, no cycle)\n   - No cycles detected in any path.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since no cycles are detected in the graph, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
