    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 7 (labeled 0 to 6).\n   - Prerequisites: [(0, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (5, 3), (4, 0), (5, 1), (2, 3), (6, 0)].\n\n2. **Build the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from b_i to a_i indicates that course b_i must be completed before course a_i.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - Course 1 is a prerequisite for courses 0, 2, 3, and 5.\n   - Course 3 is a prerequisite for courses 2 and 5.\n   - Course 0 is a prerequisite for courses 4 and 6.\n\n4. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - A cycle in the graph would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n   - We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Kahn's algorithm (topological sorting) to detect cycles.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree 0).\n   - Remove them from the graph and reduce the in-degree of their dependent courses.\n   - If we can remove all courses in this manner, there is no cycle.\n   - If some courses remain with non-zero in-degree, a cycle exists.\n\n6. **Apply Topological Sorting:**\n   - Initialize in-degrees for all courses.\n   - Process courses with in-degree 0.\n   - Update in-degrees of dependent courses.\n   - If all courses are processed, no cycle exists.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - After processing, if all courses can be taken (i.e., all nodes are visited), return True.\n   - If any course cannot be taken due to a cycle, return False.\n\nIn this case, after applying the above steps, we find that all courses can be completed without encountering a cycle.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<True>>>"
