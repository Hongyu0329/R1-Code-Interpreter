    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 6 (labeled 0 to 5).\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (5, 0): To take course 5, you must first take course 0.\n     - (3, 2): To take course 3, you must first take course 2.\n     - (2, 5): To take course 2, you must first take course 5.\n     - (1, 5): To take course 1, you must first take course 5.\n     - (3, 1): To take course 3, you must first take course 1.\n     - (1, 0): To take course 1, you must first take course 0.\n     - (4, 5): To take course 4, you must first take course 5.\n\n2. **Construct the Dependency Graph:**\n   - Course 5 depends on course 0.\n   - Course 3 depends on courses 2 and 1.\n   - Course 2 depends on course 5.\n   - Course 1 depends on courses 5 and 0.\n   - Course 4 depends on course 5.\n\n3. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Start with course 0: No prerequisites.\n   - Course 5 depends on course 0, so it can be taken after course 0.\n   - Course 2 depends on course 5, so it can be taken after course 5.\n   - Course 3 depends on courses 2 and 1. Course 2 can be taken after course 5, but course 1 must be checked.\n   - Course 1 depends on courses 5 and 0, both of which can be taken.\n   - Course 3 can be taken after courses 2 and 1.\n   - Course 4 depends on course 5, so it can be taken after course 5.\n\n4. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Check if there is any cycle in the dependencies:\n     - Course 5 -> Course 0\n     - Course 2 -> Course 5\n     - Course 1 -> Course 5, Course 0\n     - Course 3 -> Course 2, Course 1\n     - Course 4 -> Course 5\n\n   - There is no cycle in the graph. Each course can be taken after its prerequisites are completed.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is no cycle in the dependency graph, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
