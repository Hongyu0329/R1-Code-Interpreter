    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that there is a circular dependency, and it is impossible to complete all courses. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Prerequisites: [(0, 1), (0, 5), (4, 0), (2, 5), (1, 5), (4, 5), (3, 0)]\n\n2. **Build the Graph:**\n   - Represent the courses as nodes and prerequisites as directed edges.\n   - For example, (0, 1) means there is a directed edge from 1 to 0.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - 1 -> 0\n   - 5 -> 0\n   - 0 -> 4\n   - 5 -> 2\n   - 5 -> 1\n   - 5 -> 4\n   - 0 -> 3\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a method like Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes that are currently being visited in the current path.\n   - If a node is revisited in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection Analysis:**\n   - Start DFS from any unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during DFS, return False.\n   - If DFS completes without finding a cycle, return True.\n\n6. **Perform DFS:**\n   - Start from node 5:\n     - 5 -> 0 -> 4 (no cycle)\n     - 5 -> 2 (no cycle)\n     - 5 -> 1 (no cycle)\n   - Start from node 0:\n     - 0 -> 3 (no cycle)\n   - Start from node 1:\n     - 1 -> 0 -> 4 (no cycle)\n   - Start from node 2:\n     - 2 (no outgoing edges)\n   - Start from node 3:\n     - 3 (no outgoing edges)\n   - Start from node 4:\n     - 4 (no outgoing edges)\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - No cycles detected in any DFS path.\n   - All courses can be completed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
