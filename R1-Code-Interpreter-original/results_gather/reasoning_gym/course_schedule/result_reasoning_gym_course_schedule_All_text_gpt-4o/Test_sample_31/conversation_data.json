    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all. If there is no cycle, it means all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **List of Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (3, 4): To take course 3, you must first take course 4.\n     - (7, 1): To take course 7, you must first take course 1.\n     - (1, 5): To take course 1, you must first take course 5.\n     - (0, 5): To take course 0, you must first take course 5.\n     - (6, 5): To take course 6, you must first take course 5.\n     - (4, 5): To take course 4, you must first take course 5.\n     - (0, 4): To take course 0, you must first take course 4.\n     - (2, 6): To take course 2, you must first take course 6.\n     - (6, 3): To take course 6, you must first take course 3.\n\n2. **Graph Representation:**\n   - We can represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph where each course is a node and each prerequisite is a directed edge from one node to another.\n\n3. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in this directed graph. A cycle would mean that there is a circular dependency, making it impossible to complete all courses.\n\n4. **Topological Sorting:**\n   - One way to detect a cycle is to attempt a topological sort of the graph. If we can complete a topological sort, it means there is no cycle, and all courses can be completed.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree of 0).\n   - Remove these courses from the graph and reduce the in-degree of their dependent courses.\n   - Continue this process until all courses are removed or a cycle is detected (i.e., some courses still have non-zero in-degree).\n\n6. **Checking the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - Course 5 has no prerequisites, so it can be taken first.\n   - After taking course 5, courses 1, 0, 6, and 4 can be taken.\n   - After taking course 4, course 3 can be taken.\n   - After taking course 3, course 6 can be taken (if not already taken).\n   - After taking course 6, course 2 can be taken.\n   - Course 7 can be taken after course 1.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - By following the above steps, all courses can be taken without encountering a cycle.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites.\n\n<<<True>>>"
