    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - There are 9 courses labeled from 0 to 8.\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (3, 1): To take course 3, first take course 1.\n   - (5, 0): To take course 5, first take course 0.\n   - (6, 0): To take course 6, first take course 0.\n   - (1, 0): To take course 1, first take course 0.\n   - (4, 0): To take course 4, first take course 0.\n   - (6, 3): To take course 6, first take course 3.\n   - (2, 0): To take course 2, first take course 0.\n   - (8, 1): To take course 8, first take course 1.\n   - (0, 6): To take course 0, first take course 6.\n   - (7, 5): To take course 7, first take course 5.\n   - (1, 4): To take course 1, first take course 4.\n   - (4, 5): To take course 4, first take course 5.\n   - (3, 6): To take course 3, first take course 6.\n   - (8, 2): To take course 8, first take course 2.\n   - (7, 1): To take course 7, first take course 1.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph where each course is a node and each prerequisite is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n4. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Use a method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.\n   - A cycle exists if during the DFS traversal, we encounter a node that is already in the current path of traversal.\n\n5. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Start DFS from each course and track visited nodes and nodes in the current path.\n   - If a cycle is detected, return False as not all courses can be completed.\n   - If no cycles are detected after checking all courses, return True.\n\n6. **Cycle Analysis:**\n   - From the prerequisites, observe that there is a cycle involving courses 0, 6, and 3:\n     - (6, 0): To take course 6, first take course 0.\n     - (0, 6): To take course 0, first take course 6.\n     - (3, 6): To take course 3, first take course 6.\n     - (6, 3): To take course 6, first take course 3.\n   - This forms a cycle: 0 -> 6 -> 3 -> 6, indicating a circular dependency.\n\nSince there is a cycle in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<False>>>"
