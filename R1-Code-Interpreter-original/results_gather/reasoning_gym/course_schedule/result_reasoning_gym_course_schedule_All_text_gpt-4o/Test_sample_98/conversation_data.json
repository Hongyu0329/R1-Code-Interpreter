    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 9 (labeled 0 to 8).\n   - Prerequisites: [(5, 7), (0, 2), (4, 3), (7, 2), (3, 0), (6, 0), (8, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (6, 7)].\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b_i to node a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - Course 5 depends on course 7.\n   - Course 0 depends on course 2.\n   - Course 4 depends on course 3.\n   - Course 7 depends on course 2.\n   - Course 3 depends on course 0.\n   - Course 6 depends on course 0.\n   - Course 8 depends on course 0.\n   - Course 0 depends on course 1.\n   - Course 1 depends on course 2.\n   - Course 6 depends on course 7.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start with course 0: 0 -> 1 -> 2. No cycle here.\n   - Course 3 depends on 0, which depends on 1, which depends on 2. No cycle here.\n   - Course 4 depends on 3, which depends on 0, which depends on 1, which depends on 2. No cycle here.\n   - Course 5 depends on 7, which depends on 2. No cycle here.\n   - Course 6 depends on 0, which depends on 1, which depends on 2. No cycle here.\n   - Course 6 also depends on 7, which depends on 2. No cycle here.\n   - Course 8 depends on 0, which depends on 1, which depends on 2. No cycle here.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - After checking all dependencies, there are no cycles detected in the graph.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to complete all courses given the prerequisites.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<True>>>"
