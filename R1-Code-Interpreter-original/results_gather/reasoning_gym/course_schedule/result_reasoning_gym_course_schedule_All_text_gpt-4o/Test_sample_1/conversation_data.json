    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites**: \n   - Courses are labeled from 0 to 8.\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph**:\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a_i, b_i) is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n3. **Check for Cycles**:\n   - A cycle in the graph would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n   - We can use algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.\n\n4. **Graph Representation**:\n   - The graph can be represented using an adjacency list.\n   - For example, from the prerequisites [(8, 0), (7, 5), (7, 1), (3, 5), (8, 4), (4, 2), (1, 0), (6, 7), (4, 0), (2, 8), (8, 1), (2, 3), (6, 5), (2, 5), (5, 4)], we can construct the adjacency list.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection**:\n   - Use DFS to traverse the graph.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes that are currently in the recursion stack.\n   - If we revisit a node that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n6. **Perform the Check**:\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during any DFS traversal, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after all nodes are processed, return True.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine if it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nAfter performing the cycle detection on the given graph, we find that there is a cycle present. For example, one such cycle is: 2 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2. This cycle indicates that these courses depend on each other in a circular manner, making it impossible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
