    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Prerequisites: [(1, 2), (0, 1), (4, 3), (3, 2), (5, 4), (5, 3), (0, 3), (4, 1)]\n\n2. **Build the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, where an edge from course `b_i` to course `a_i` indicates that `b_i` must be completed before `a_i`.\n   - The graph can be represented as:\n     - 2 -> 1\n     - 1 -> 0\n     - 3 -> 4\n     - 2 -> 3\n     - 4 -> 5\n     - 3 -> 5\n     - 3 -> 0\n     - 1 -> 4\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in this directed graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n   - We can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to detect cycles. During the DFS, we maintain a recursion stack to keep track of the path we are currently exploring. If we encounter a node that is already in the recursion stack, it indicates a cycle.\n\n4. **Perform DFS to Check for Cycles:**\n   - Start DFS from each course that has not been visited yet.\n   - If a cycle is detected during the DFS, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after exploring all courses, return True.\n\n5. **Check Each Course:**\n   - Start with course 0: It depends on course 1, which depends on course 2. Course 2 depends on course 3, which depends on course 4, and course 4 depends on course 5. Course 5 has no further dependencies, so no cycle is detected here.\n   - Check course 1: Already covered in the previous step.\n   - Check course 2: Already covered in the previous step.\n   - Check course 3: Already covered in the previous step.\n   - Check course 4: Already covered in the previous step.\n   - Check course 5: Already covered in the previous step.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since no cycles are detected in the graph, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
