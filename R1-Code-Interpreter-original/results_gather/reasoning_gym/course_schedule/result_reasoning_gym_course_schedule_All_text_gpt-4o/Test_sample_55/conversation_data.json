    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Prerequisites: [(3, 4), (5, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (4, 3), (4, 5), (2, 1), (0, 2), (1, 4), (5, 2), (5, 3), (2, 3)]\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a_i, b_i) is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n3. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes that are currently being visited in the current path.\n   - If a node is revisited in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n\n4. **Perform DFS for Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during DFS, return False.\n   - If DFS completes without finding a cycle, return True.\n\n5. **Detailed Analysis of the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - Construct the graph:\n     - 3 -> 4\n     - 5 -> 4\n     - 0 -> 3\n     - 1 -> 3\n     - 4 -> 3\n     - 4 -> 5\n     - 2 -> 1\n     - 0 -> 2\n     - 1 -> 4\n     - 5 -> 2\n     - 5 -> 3\n     - 2 -> 3\n\n6. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from course 0:\n     - 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 (cycle detected: 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4)\n   - A cycle is detected, so it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nBased on the above analysis, there is a cycle in the graph, which means not all courses can be completed.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<False>>>."
