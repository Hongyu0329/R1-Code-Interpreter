    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 7 (labeled 0 to 6).\n   - Prerequisites: [(2, 1), (0, 5), (0, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (5, 1)].\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b_i to node a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - Course 2 depends on course 1.\n   - Course 0 depends on courses 5 and 4.\n   - Course 3 depends on course 5.\n   - Course 4 depends on course 6.\n   - Course 1 depends on course 6.\n   - Course 2 depends on course 6.\n   - Course 5 depends on course 1.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in this directed graph.\n   - A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start with course 0: It depends on 5 and 4.\n   - Course 5 depends on 1.\n   - Course 1 depends on 6.\n   - Course 6 has no further dependencies.\n   - Course 4 depends on 6.\n   - Course 2 depends on 1 and 6.\n   - Course 3 depends on 5.\n   - Check for cycles: \n     - Course 5 -> Course 1 -> Course 6 (no cycle here).\n     - Course 2 -> Course 1 -> Course 6 (no cycle here).\n     - Course 0 -> Course 5 -> Course 1 -> Course 6 (no cycle here).\n     - Course 0 -> Course 4 -> Course 6 (no cycle here).\n     - Course 3 -> Course 5 -> Course 1 -> Course 6 (no cycle here).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is a cycle: Course 5 -> Course 1 -> Course 6 -> Course 2 -> Course 1.\n   - This cycle makes it impossible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites.\n\nFinal answer: <<<False>>>"
