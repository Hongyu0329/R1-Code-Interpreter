    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **List of Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n   - Prerequisites: [(2, 4), (3, 1), (2, 0), (1, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (2, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (0, 3)]\n\n2. **Graph Representation:**\n   - We can represent the courses and their prerequisites as a directed graph where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node b to node a indicates that course b must be taken before course a.\n\n3. **Building the Graph:**\n   - From the prerequisites, we can build the following directed edges:\n     - 4 -> 2\n     - 1 -> 3\n     - 0 -> 2\n     - 2 -> 1\n     - 4 -> 3\n     - 0 -> 4\n     - 3 -> 2\n     - 4 -> 0\n     - 4 -> 1\n     - 3 -> 0\n\n4. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - To determine if all courses can be completed, we need to check for cycles in the graph.\n   - A cycle in the graph would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n\n5. **Checking for Cycles:**\n   - Start with course 0:\n     - 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 0 (Cycle detected)\n   - Since a cycle is detected, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The presence of a cycle in the course dependency graph indicates that not all courses can be completed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
