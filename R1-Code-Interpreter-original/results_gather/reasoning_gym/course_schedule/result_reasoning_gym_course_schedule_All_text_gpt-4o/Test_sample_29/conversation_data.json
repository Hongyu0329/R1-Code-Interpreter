    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 8 (labeled 0 to 7).\n   - Prerequisites: [(4, 0), (4, 5), (7, 5), (0, 3), (6, 0), (1, 3), (2, 3), (5, 3), (2, 6), (1, 7)].\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b_i to node a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited list to track the state of each node: unvisited, visiting, or visited.\n   - If during the DFS traversal, we encounter a node that is already in the visiting state, a cycle is detected.\n\n4. **Perform DFS on Each Node:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during any DFS traversal, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after all nodes have been processed, return True.\n\n5. **Detailed Analysis of the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - Construct the graph based on the prerequisites.\n   - Perform DFS starting from each course.\n   - Track the state of each course to detect cycles.\n\n6. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - For the given prerequisites, perform DFS:\n     - Start from course 0, follow the prerequisites, and mark nodes as visiting.\n     - Continue the process for all courses.\n     - If a node is revisited while it is still in the visiting state, a cycle is present.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - After performing the above steps, if no cycles are detected, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nIn this specific case, after analyzing the graph formed by the prerequisites, we find that there are no cycles. Therefore, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<True>>>"
