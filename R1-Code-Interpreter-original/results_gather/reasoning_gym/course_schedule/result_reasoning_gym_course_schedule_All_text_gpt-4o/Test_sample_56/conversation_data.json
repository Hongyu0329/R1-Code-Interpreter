    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete all courses. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - We have 8 courses labeled from 0 to 7.\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (5, 7): To take course 5, you must first take course 7.\n   - (0, 5): To take course 0, you must first take course 5.\n   - (4, 7): To take course 4, you must first take course 7.\n   - (1, 4): To take course 1, you must first take course 4.\n   - (6, 7): To take course 6, you must first take course 7.\n   - (2, 0): To take course 2, you must first take course 0.\n   - (3, 1): To take course 3, you must first take course 1.\n   - (4, 6): To take course 4, you must first take course 6.\n   - (0, 4): To take course 0, you must first take course 4.\n\n3. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a_i, b_i) is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method (such as Depth-First Search) to detect cycles.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes and nodes in the current path.\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Analyze the Graph:**\n   - Start from any course and follow the prerequisites.\n   - Check if you can visit all courses without revisiting any course in the current path.\n\n6. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - From the prerequisites, we can see that course 0 depends on course 4, which depends on course 6, which depends on course 7.\n   - Course 0 also directly depends on course 5, which depends on course 7.\n   - Course 1 depends on course 4, which again depends on course 6 and then on course 7.\n   - Course 2 depends on course 0, which again leads to the chain of dependencies.\n   - Course 3 depends on course 1, which again leads to the chain of dependencies.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is no cycle in the graph as all dependencies can be resolved in a linear order.\n   - Therefore, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>."
