    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (1, 6): To take course 1, you must first take course 6.\n     - (4, 2): To take course 4, you must first take course 2.\n     - (2, 6): To take course 2, you must first take course 6.\n     - (3, 1): To take course 3, you must first take course 1.\n     - (0, 6): To take course 0, you must first take course 6.\n     - (5, 2): To take course 5, you must first take course 2.\n     - (3, 6): To take course 3, you must first take course 6.\n     - (4, 6): To take course 4, you must first take course 6.\n     - (5, 0): To take course 5, you must first take course 0.\n     - (5, 3): To take course 5, you must first take course 3.\n     - (0, 2): To take course 0, you must first take course 2.\n     - (4, 5): To take course 4, you must first take course 5.\n     - (3, 2): To take course 3, you must first take course 2.\n     - (6, 4): To take course 6, you must first take course 4.\n     - (1, 2): To take course 1, you must first take course 2.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a, b) is a directed edge from b to a.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method like Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes currently in the recursion stack.\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n4. **Cycle Detection Analysis:**\n   - Start with course 0 and follow the prerequisites.\n   - Course 0 requires course 6, which requires course 4, which requires course 5, which requires course 3, which requires course 1, which requires course 2, which requires course 6.\n   - This forms a cycle: 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since a cycle is detected, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
