    "To determine if you can finish all the courses given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a way to take all courses without violating any prerequisite conditions. This is essentially a problem of detecting cycles in a directed graph, where courses are nodes and prerequisites are directed edges.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n   - Prerequisites: (3, 0), (4, 3), (2, 0), (1, 2)\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - The graph is directed, where an edge from b_i to a_i indicates that course b_i must be taken before course a_i.\n   - Edges based on prerequisites:\n     - 0 -> 3\n     - 3 -> 4\n     - 0 -> 2\n     - 2 -> 1\n\n3. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - A cycle in this graph would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them.\n   - We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or a topological sort to detect cycles.\n\n4. **Perform Topological Sort or DFS:**\n   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree of 0).\n   - Remove them from the graph and reduce the in-degree of their dependent courses.\n   - If at any point, all courses are removed, it means there is no cycle, and all courses can be completed.\n   - If there are courses left with non-zero in-degree, it indicates a cycle.\n\n5. **Apply the Algorithm:**\n   - Courses 0 and 3 have no prerequisites, so they can be taken first.\n   - After taking course 0, courses 3 and 2 become available.\n   - After taking course 3, course 4 becomes available.\n   - After taking course 2, course 1 becomes available.\n   - All courses can be taken in the order: 0, 3, 2, 4, 1.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since we can take all courses without encountering a cycle, it is possible to finish all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
