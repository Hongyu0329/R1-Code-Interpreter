    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 9 (labeled 0 to 8).\n   - Prerequisites: [(1, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (7, 0), (0, 1), (6, 3), (2, 7), (6, 1), (8, 7), (4, 0), (3, 1)].\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b_i to node a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method (such as Depth-First Search) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited list to track the state of each node: unvisited, visiting, or visited.\n   - If a node is encountered that is already in the visiting state, a cycle is detected.\n\n4. **Graph Representation:**\n   - The graph can be represented as an adjacency list:\n     - 0: [5, 7, 4]\n     - 1: [0, 6, 3]\n     - 2: [7]\n     - 3: [5, 6]\n     - 4: []\n     - 5: []\n     - 6: [1]\n     - 7: [2, 8]\n     - 8: []\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during DFS, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after checking all nodes, return True.\n\n6. **Perform DFS:**\n   - Start from course 0, and mark it as visiting.\n   - Follow the edges and mark nodes as visiting.\n   - If a node is revisited while it is still in the visiting state, a cycle is present.\n   - If a node is fully processed (all its descendants are visited), mark it as visited.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - After performing the above steps, if no cycles are detected, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nIn this case, after performing the cycle detection, we find that there is a cycle involving courses 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6. Therefore, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<False>>>"
