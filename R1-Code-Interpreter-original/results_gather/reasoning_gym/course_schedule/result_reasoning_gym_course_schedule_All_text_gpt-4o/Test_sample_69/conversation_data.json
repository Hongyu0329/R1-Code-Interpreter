    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and it is impossible to complete all courses. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites**: \n   - Courses are labeled from 0 to 8.\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph**:\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from b_i to a_i indicates that b_i is a prerequisite for a_i.\n\n3. **List of Prerequisites**:\n   - (2, 7): To take course 2, first take course 7.\n   - (3, 2): To take course 3, first take course 2.\n   - (0, 4): To take course 0, first take course 4.\n   - (7, 6): To take course 7, first take course 6.\n   - (4, 7): To take course 4, first take course 7.\n   - (2, 6): To take course 2, first take course 6.\n   - (0, 1): To take course 0, first take course 1.\n   - (5, 6): To take course 5, first take course 6.\n   - (3, 1): To take course 3, first take course 1.\n   - (4, 1): To take course 4, first take course 1.\n   - (1, 7): To take course 1, first take course 7.\n   - (8, 7): To take course 8, first take course 7.\n   - (5, 2): To take course 5, first take course 2.\n   - (7, 0): To take course 7, first take course 0.\n   - (1, 6): To take course 1, first take course 6.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles**:\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes currently in the recursion stack.\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection**:\n   - Start from any course and perform DFS.\n   - If a cycle is detected during DFS, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after checking all courses, return True.\n\n6. **Check for Cycles**:\n   - From the prerequisites, we can see that there is a cycle involving courses 0, 4, 7, and 1:\n     - 0 requires 4, 4 requires 7, 7 requires 0 (cycle detected).\n   - This cycle makes it impossible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that it is not possible to complete all courses due to the presence of a cycle in the prerequisites.\n\n<<<False>>>"
