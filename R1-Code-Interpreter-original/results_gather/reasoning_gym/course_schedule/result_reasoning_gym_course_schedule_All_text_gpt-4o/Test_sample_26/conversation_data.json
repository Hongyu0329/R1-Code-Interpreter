    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - We have 9 courses labeled from 0 to 8.\n   - The prerequisites are given as pairs, where the first element of the pair is the course that depends on the second element.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b_i to node a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (6, 4): Course 4 is a prerequisite for course 6.\n   - (3, 0): Course 0 is a prerequisite for course 3.\n   - (3, 1): Course 1 is a prerequisite for course 3.\n   - (5, 2): Course 2 is a prerequisite for course 5.\n   - (0, 4): Course 4 is a prerequisite for course 0.\n   - (4, 2): Course 2 is a prerequisite for course 4.\n   - (7, 2): Course 2 is a prerequisite for course 7.\n   - (1, 0): Course 0 is a prerequisite for course 1.\n   - (6, 0): Course 0 is a prerequisite for course 6.\n   - (8, 7): Course 7 is a prerequisite for course 8.\n   - (8, 1): Course 1 is a prerequisite for course 8.\n   - (0, 7): Course 7 is a prerequisite for course 0.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n   - We can use a depth-first search (DFS) or a topological sort to detect cycles.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start with any course and perform a DFS.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes and nodes currently in the recursion stack.\n   - If we encounter a node that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n6. **Analysis of the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - By analyzing the prerequisites, we can see that there is a cycle involving courses 0, 4, 2, and 7:\n     - 0 -> 4 -> 2 -> 7 -> 0\n   - This cycle makes it impossible to complete all courses because each course in the cycle depends on another course in the cycle.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is a cycle in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
