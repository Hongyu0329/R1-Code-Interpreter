    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Representation**:\n   - Courses are represented as nodes.\n   - Prerequisites are directed edges from one node to another.\n   - For example, (5, 0) means there is a directed edge from course 0 to course 5, indicating you must complete course 0 before course 5.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph**:\n   - We have 10 courses (nodes) labeled from 0 to 9.\n   - The given prerequisites form directed edges between these nodes.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles in the Graph**:\n   - A cycle in the graph would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n   - We can use algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in a directed graph.\n\n4. **Perform Cycle Detection**:\n   - Use a DFS approach to traverse the graph.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes that have been visited.\n   - Maintain a recursion stack to track nodes currently in the recursion path.\n   - If a node is encountered that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Apply the Algorithm**:\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during any DFS traversal, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after all nodes are processed, return True.\n\n6. **Analyze the Given Prerequisites**:\n   - The prerequisites form the following directed edges:\n     - 5 -> 0\n     - 1 -> 3\n     - 0 -> 8\n     - 1 -> 6\n     - 6 -> 7\n     - 2 -> 4\n     - 3 -> 8\n     - 2 -> 9\n     - 7 -> 8\n     - 8 -> 3\n     - 9 -> 3\n     - 4 -> 3\n     - 6 -> 0\n     - 0 -> 3\n     - 9 -> 6\n     - 7 -> 3\n     - 8 -> 1\n\n7. **Check for Cycles**:\n   - By examining the graph, we can see that there is a cycle involving nodes 1, 6, 7, 8, and 3.\n   - Specifically, the cycle can be traced as: 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 1.\n   - Since there is a cycle, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that it is not possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites.\n\n<<<False>>>"
