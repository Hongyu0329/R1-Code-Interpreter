    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses are labeled from 0 to 9.\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a_i, b_i) is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n3. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (0, 2): To take course 0, first take course 2.\n   - (2, 6): To take course 2, first take course 6.\n   - (9, 8): To take course 9, first take course 8.\n   - (2, 5): To take course 2, first take course 5.\n   - (5, 6): To take course 5, first take course 6.\n   - (7, 8): To take course 7, first take course 8.\n   - (8, 6): To take course 8, first take course 6.\n   - (3, 6): To take course 3, first take course 6.\n   - (1, 3): To take course 1, first take course 3.\n   - (1, 5): To take course 1, first take course 5.\n   - (3, 8): To take course 3, first take course 8.\n   - (4, 3): To take course 4, first take course 3.\n   - (9, 4): To take course 9, first take course 4.\n   - (0, 4): To take course 0, first take course 4.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes currently in the recursion stack (indicating the path being explored).\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection Analysis:**\n   - Start from any course and perform DFS.\n   - If a cycle is detected during DFS, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after exploring all nodes, return True.\n\n6. **Perform the Analysis:**\n   - By performing DFS on the graph, we find that there is a cycle involving courses 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 3, 4, and 9.\n   - Specifically, the cycle can be seen as: 0 -> 4 -> 3 -> 8 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 (back to 6).\n\nSince a cycle is detected, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<False>>>"
