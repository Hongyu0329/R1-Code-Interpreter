    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Representation**:\n   - Courses are represented as nodes.\n   - Prerequisites are directed edges between nodes.\n   - An edge from node `b_i` to node `a_i` indicates that course `b_i` must be completed before course `a_i`.\n\n2. **List of Prerequisites**:\n   - The given prerequisites are: \n     - (5, 6): Course 6 must be completed before course 5.\n     - (3, 7): Course 7 must be completed before course 3.\n     - (7, 4): Course 4 must be completed before course 7.\n     - (8, 4): Course 4 must be completed before course 8.\n     - (6, 4): Course 4 must be completed before course 6.\n     - (1, 6): Course 6 must be completed before course 1.\n     - (3, 6): Course 6 must be completed before course 3.\n     - (2, 0): Course 0 must be completed before course 2.\n     - (0, 5): Course 5 must be completed before course 0.\n     - (0, 7): Course 7 must be completed before course 0.\n     - (0, 3): Course 3 must be completed before course 0.\n     - (7, 6): Course 6 must be completed before course 7.\n     - (6, 0): Course 0 must be completed before course 6.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles**:\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph formed by these prerequisites.\n   - A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\n4. **Cycle Detection**:\n   - Start with course 0 and follow the prerequisites:\n     - Course 0 requires course 5, which requires course 6, which requires course 4, which requires course 7, which requires course 6 again. This forms a cycle: 6 -> 4 -> 7 -> 6.\n   - Another cycle can be detected starting from course 0:\n     - Course 0 requires course 7, which requires course 6, which requires course 0 again. This forms another cycle: 0 -> 7 -> 6 -> 0.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are cycles in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
