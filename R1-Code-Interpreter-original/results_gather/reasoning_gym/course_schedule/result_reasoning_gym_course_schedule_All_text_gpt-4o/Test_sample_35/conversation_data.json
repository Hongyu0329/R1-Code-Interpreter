    "To determine if you can finish all courses given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a way to take all courses without violating any prerequisite conditions. This problem can be visualized as a graph problem where courses are nodes and prerequisites are directed edges. The goal is to check if there is a cycle in the graph, as a cycle would mean that it's impossible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Prerequisites List**: [(3, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (0, 1), (2, 4), (3, 4)]\n   - (3, 1): To take course 3, you must first take course 1.\n   - (0, 3): To take course 0, you must first take course 3.\n   - (1, 2): To take course 1, you must first take course 2.\n   - (0, 1): To take course 0, you must first take course 1.\n   - (2, 4): To take course 2, you must first take course 4.\n   - (3, 4): To take course 3, you must first take course 4.\n\n2. **Graph Representation**:\n   - Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n   - Edges: 1 -> 3, 3 -> 0, 2 -> 1, 1 -> 0, 4 -> 2, 4 -> 3\n\n3. **Cycle Detection**:\n   - Start from course 4:\n     - Course 4 has edges to courses 2 and 3.\n     - Course 2 has an edge to course 1.\n     - Course 1 has edges to courses 3 and 0.\n     - Course 3 has an edge to course 0.\n     - Course 0 has no outgoing edges.\n   - There is no backtracking to any previously visited node in the current path, indicating no cycle.\n\n4. **Topological Sort**:\n   - A topological sort of the graph would be possible if there is no cycle.\n   - Possible order: 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 0\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is no cycle detected in the graph, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
