    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **List of Prerequisites**: \n   - (2, 3): To take course 2, you must first take course 3.\n   - (6, 2): To take course 6, you must first take course 2.\n   - (1, 6): To take course 1, you must first take course 6.\n   - (6, 3): To take course 6, you must first take course 3.\n   - (4, 3): To take course 4, you must first take course 3.\n   - (2, 1): To take course 2, you must first take course 1.\n   - (0, 2): To take course 0, you must first take course 2.\n   - (5, 3): To take course 5, you must first take course 3.\n   - (5, 2): To take course 5, you must first take course 2.\n   - (1, 0): To take course 1, you must first take course 0.\n   - (0, 3): To take course 0, you must first take course 3.\n   - (3, 6): To take course 3, you must first take course 6.\n   - (1, 5): To take course 1, you must first take course 5.\n\n2. **Graph Representation**:\n   - We can represent the courses and their prerequisites as a directed graph where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node b to node a indicates that course b is a prerequisite for course a.\n\n3. **Cycle Detection**:\n   - To determine if all courses can be completed, we need to check if this directed graph contains any cycles.\n   - A cycle in the graph would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n\n4. **Constructing the Graph**:\n   - Let's construct the graph based on the given prerequisites:\n     - Course 2 depends on 3.\n     - Course 6 depends on 2 and 3.\n     - Course 1 depends on 6, 0, and 5.\n     - Course 4 depends on 3.\n     - Course 0 depends on 2 and 3.\n     - Course 5 depends on 3 and 2.\n     - Course 3 depends on 6.\n\n5. **Checking for Cycles**:\n   - Start from any course and follow the prerequisites to see if you return to the starting course.\n   - For example, starting from course 1:\n     - 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 (cycle detected: 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1)\n   - The presence of this cycle means that it is impossible to complete all courses.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is a cycle in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
