    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (0, 3): To take course 0, you must first take course 3.\n     - (3, 1): To take course 3, you must first take course 1.\n     - (6, 2): To take course 6, you must first take course 2.\n     - (2, 4): To take course 2, you must first take course 4.\n     - (4, 1): To take course 4, you must first take course 1.\n     - (2, 5): To take course 2, you must first take course 5.\n     - (5, 4): To take course 5, you must first take course 4.\n     - (5, 1): To take course 5, you must first take course 1.\n     - (3, 4): To take course 3, you must first take course 4.\n     - (6, 1): To take course 6, you must first take course 1.\n     - (0, 2): To take course 0, you must first take course 2.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Represent the courses as nodes and prerequisites as directed edges.\n   - The graph is directed because each prerequisite is a directed dependency.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes currently in the recursion stack (to detect back edges which indicate cycles).\n\n4. **Perform DFS for Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Check Each Course:**\n   - If any course is part of a cycle, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after checking all courses, return True.\n\n6. **Analyze the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - By performing DFS on the graph constructed from the prerequisites, we find that there is a cycle involving courses 2, 5, and 4:\n     - 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2 (cycle detected)\n\nSince a cycle is detected, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<False>>>"
