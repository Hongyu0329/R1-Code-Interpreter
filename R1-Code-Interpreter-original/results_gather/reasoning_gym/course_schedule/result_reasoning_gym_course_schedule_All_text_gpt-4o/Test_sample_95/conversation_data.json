    "To determine if you can finish all courses given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and you cannot complete all courses. If there is no cycle, you can complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 5 (labeled 0 to 4).\n   - Prerequisites: [(3, 1), (0, 2), (2, 1), (4, 0), (3, 2)].\n\n2. **Build the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b_i to node a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - Course 1 is a prerequisite for courses 3 and 2.\n   - Course 2 is a prerequisite for courses 0 and 3.\n   - Course 0 is a prerequisite for course 4.\n\n4. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\n5. **Topological Sorting or Cycle Detection:**\n   - Use a method like Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Alternatively, use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting, which is based on in-degree of nodes.\n\n6. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree 0).\n   - Remove them from the graph and reduce the in-degree of their dependent courses.\n   - If you can remove all courses this way, there is no cycle.\n   - If you cannot remove all courses, there is a cycle.\n\n7. **Apply the Algorithm:**\n   - Course 1 has no prerequisites, so start with it.\n   - Remove course 1, reducing the in-degree of courses 2 and 3.\n   - Course 2 now has no prerequisites, remove it, reducing the in-degree of course 0.\n   - Course 0 now has no prerequisites, remove it, reducing the in-degree of course 4.\n   - Course 4 now has no prerequisites, remove it.\n   - Finally, course 3 has no prerequisites, remove it.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - All courses can be removed without encountering a cycle.\n   - Therefore, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe final answer is that you can finish all courses.\n\n<<<True>>>"
