    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n   - Prerequisites: [(4, 1), (0, 6), (0, 1), (3, 6), (5, 6), (6, 5), (2, 6), (5, 0), (1, 2), (0, 3), (5, 2), (1, 6)]\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a_i, b_i) is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes that are currently being visited in the current path.\n   - If a node is revisited in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n\n4. **Perform Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - For each node, mark it as visited and add it to the current path.\n   - Recursively visit all its neighbors.\n   - If a neighbor is already in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n   - After visiting all neighbors, remove the node from the current path.\n\n5. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - If any cycle is detected during the DFS traversal, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after checking all nodes, return True.\n\nLet's apply this logic to the given prerequisites:\n\n- Start DFS from course 0:\n  - Visit 6, then 5, then 2, then 1, then 4.\n  - No cycle detected in this path.\n\n- Start DFS from course 1:\n  - Visit 2, then 6, then 5, then 0, then 3.\n  - No cycle detected in this path.\n\n- Start DFS from course 2:\n  - Visit 6, then 5, then 0, then 3.\n  - No cycle detected in this path.\n\n- Start DFS from course 3:\n  - Visit 6, then 5, then 0.\n  - No cycle detected in this path.\n\n- Start DFS from course 4:\n  - No outgoing edges, no cycle.\n\n- Start DFS from course 5:\n  - Visit 6, then 0, then 3.\n  - No cycle detected in this path.\n\n- Start DFS from course 6:\n  - Visit 5, then 0, then 3.\n  - No cycle detected in this path.\n\nAfter checking all courses, no cycles are detected. Therefore, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<True>>>"
