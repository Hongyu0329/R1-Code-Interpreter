    "To determine if you can finish all courses given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and you cannot complete all courses. If there is no cycle, you can complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 7 (labeled 0 to 6).\n   - Prerequisites: [(4, 2), (6, 5), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 5), (1, 5), (5, 0), (3, 6)].\n\n2. **Build the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b_i to node a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - Course 0: No prerequisites.\n   - Course 1: Prerequisites are 0 and 5.\n   - Course 2: Prerequisite is 0.\n   - Course 3: Prerequisites are 5 and 6.\n   - Course 4: Prerequisite is 2.\n   - Course 5: Prerequisite is 0.\n   - Course 6: Prerequisite is 5.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method (e.g., Depth-First Search) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes currently in the recursion stack (to detect back edges indicating cycles).\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start from each unvisited node and perform DFS.\n   - If you revisit a node that is already in the current path (recursion stack), a cycle is detected.\n\n6. **Perform DFS:**\n   - Start with course 0: No outgoing edges, mark as completed.\n   - Course 1: Depends on 0 and 5. Check 5.\n   - Course 5: Depends on 0. Check 0 (already completed).\n   - Course 6: Depends on 5. Check 5 (already visited in current path, no cycle).\n   - Course 3: Depends on 5 and 6. Check 5 (already visited in current path, no cycle), then 6 (already visited in current path, no cycle).\n   - Course 2: Depends on 0 (already completed).\n   - Course 4: Depends on 2 (already completed).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - No cycles detected in the graph traversal.\n   - All courses can be completed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
