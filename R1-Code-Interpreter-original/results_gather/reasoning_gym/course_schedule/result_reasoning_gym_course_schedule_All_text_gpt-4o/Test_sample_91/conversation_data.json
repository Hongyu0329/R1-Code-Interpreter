    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (0, 3): To take course 0, you must first take course 3.\n     - (2, 0): To take course 2, you must first take course 0.\n     - (0, 4): To take course 0, you must first take course 4.\n     - (1, 3): To take course 1, you must first take course 3.\n     - (4, 3): To take course 4, you must first take course 3.\n\n2. **Construct the Dependency Graph:**\n   - Course 0 depends on courses 3 and 4.\n   - Course 2 depends on course 0.\n   - Course 1 depends on course 3.\n   - Course 4 depends on course 3.\n\n3. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Start with course 0:\n     - Course 0 depends on course 3 and course 4.\n     - Course 4 depends on course 3.\n     - Course 3 has no dependencies listed, so it can be taken first.\n     - After taking course 3, course 4 can be taken.\n     - After taking course 4, course 0 can be taken.\n   - Course 2 depends on course 0, which can be taken after courses 3 and 4.\n   - Course 1 depends on course 3, which can be taken first.\n\n4. **Determine if All Courses Can Be Completed:**\n   - There are no circular dependencies in the graph.\n   - All courses can be taken in the order: 3, 4, 0, 2, 1 or 3, 1, 4, 0, 2, etc.\n\nSince there are no cycles in the dependency graph, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<True>>>"
