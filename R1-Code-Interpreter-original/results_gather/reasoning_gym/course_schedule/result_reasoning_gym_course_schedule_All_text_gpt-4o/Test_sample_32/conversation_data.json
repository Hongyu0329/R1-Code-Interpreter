    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means that there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 8 (labeled 0 to 7).\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (5, 2): To take course 5, first take course 2.\n   - (4, 0): To take course 4, first take course 0.\n   - (1, 4): To take course 1, first take course 4.\n   - (3, 2): To take course 3, first take course 2.\n   - (4, 7): To take course 4, first take course 7.\n   - (7, 2): To take course 7, first take course 2.\n   - (0, 2): To take course 0, first take course 2.\n   - (7, 1): To take course 7, first take course 1.\n   - (3, 7): To take course 3, first take course 7.\n   - (1, 5): To take course 1, first take course 5.\n   - (0, 6): To take course 0, first take course 6.\n   - (2, 3): To take course 2, first take course 3.\n   - (6, 2): To take course 6, first take course 2.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph where each course is a node and each prerequisite is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n4. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Use a method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. If a cycle is detected, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed.\n\n5. **Analysis of the Graph:**\n   - Start with course 2, which is a prerequisite for many courses.\n   - Follow the dependencies:\n     - 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 7 -> 3 -> 2 (Cycle detected)\n   - The presence of the cycle (2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 7 -> 3 -> 2) indicates that it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since a cycle is detected in the prerequisite graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
