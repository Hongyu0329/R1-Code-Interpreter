    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses are labeled from 0 to 8.\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a_i, b_i) is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n3. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (5, 8): To take course 5, first take course 8.\n   - (3, 8): To take course 3, first take course 8.\n   - (6, 8): To take course 6, first take course 8.\n   - (4, 8): To take course 4, first take course 8.\n   - (6, 2): To take course 6, first take course 2.\n   - (0, 7): To take course 0, first take course 7.\n   - (4, 2): To take course 4, first take course 2.\n   - (7, 5): To take course 7, first take course 5.\n   - (5, 3): To take course 5, first take course 3.\n   - (1, 8): To take course 1, first take course 8.\n   - (8, 2): To take course 8, first take course 2.\n   - (1, 6): To take course 1, first take course 6.\n   - (3, 4): To take course 3, first take course 4.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n   - Use a graph traversal method like Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles. During DFS, keep track of visited nodes and nodes in the current path (recursion stack).\n\n5. **Cycle Detection Analysis:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n   - If DFS completes without revisiting any node in the current path, no cycle is present.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - If a cycle is detected, return False (not all courses can be completed).\n   - If no cycle is detected, return True (all courses can be completed).\n\nAfter analyzing the prerequisites and checking for cycles, we find that there is a cycle in the graph. For example, course 5 depends on course 3, course 3 depends on course 4, and course 4 depends on course 8, which in turn depends on course 2, and course 6 depends on course 2 and course 8, creating a cycle involving courses 5, 3, 4, 8, 2, and 6.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nFinal answer: <<<False>>>"
