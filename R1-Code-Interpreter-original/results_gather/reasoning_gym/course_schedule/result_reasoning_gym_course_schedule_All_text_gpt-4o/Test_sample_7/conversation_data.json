    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that there is a circular dependency, and it would be impossible to complete all courses. If there is no cycle, then it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 6 (labeled 0 to 5).\n   - Prerequisites: [(5, 1), (4, 5), (2, 4), (0, 4), (3, 1), (0, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1)].\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b_i to node a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - Course 5 depends on course 1.\n   - Course 4 depends on course 5.\n   - Course 2 depends on course 4.\n   - Course 0 depends on course 4.\n   - Course 3 depends on course 1.\n   - Course 0 depends on course 1.\n   - Course 3 depends on course 5.\n   - Course 4 depends on course 1.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes that are currently being visited in the current path.\n   - If a node is revisited in the current path, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during DFS, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after all nodes are processed, return True.\n\n6. **Perform DFS:**\n   - Start from course 0: Visit 0 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1. No cycle detected.\n   - Start from course 1: Already visited.\n   - Start from course 2: Visit 2 -> 4. No cycle detected.\n   - Start from course 3: Visit 3 -> 1. No cycle detected.\n   - Start from course 4: Already visited.\n   - Start from course 5: Already visited.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - No cycles were detected in the graph traversal.\n   - Therefore, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<True>>>."
