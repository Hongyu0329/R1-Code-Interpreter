    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Representation**:\n   - Courses are nodes in a graph.\n   - Prerequisites are directed edges between nodes. For example, (9, 7) means there is a directed edge from 7 to 9, indicating you must complete course 7 before course 9.\n\n2. **List of Prerequisites**:\n   - (9, 7): 7 -> 9\n   - (8, 2): 2 -> 8\n   - (7, 3): 3 -> 7\n   - (8, 7): 7 -> 8\n   - (1, 9): 9 -> 1\n   - (1, 7): 7 -> 1\n   - (2, 7): 7 -> 2\n   - (5, 8): 8 -> 5\n   - (9, 5): 5 -> 9\n   - (2, 3): 3 -> 2\n   - (6, 5): 5 -> 6\n   - (3, 7): 7 -> 3\n   - (4, 5): 5 -> 4\n   - (3, 1): 1 -> 3\n   - (0, 8): 8 -> 0\n   - (5, 3): 3 -> 5\n\n3. **Detect Cycles**:\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n   - We can use a depth-first search (DFS) or a topological sort to detect cycles in the graph.\n\n4. **Cycle Detection**:\n   - Start with any course and perform a DFS.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes and nodes currently in the recursion stack.\n   - If we encounter a node that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n5. **Analysis**:\n   - Let's perform a DFS starting from any node and check for cycles.\n   - For example, starting from course 7, we can follow the path 7 -> 3 -> 1 -> 9 -> 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 7, which forms a cycle.\n   - Since a cycle is detected, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The presence of a cycle in the graph indicates that not all courses can be completed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
