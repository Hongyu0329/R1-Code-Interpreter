    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the prerequisites step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Dependencies:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (4, 5): To take course 4, you must first take course 5.\n     - (4, 1): To take course 4, you must first take course 1.\n     - (1, 5): To take course 1, you must first take course 5.\n     - (3, 5): To take course 3, you must first take course 5.\n     - (0, 4): To take course 0, you must first take course 4.\n     - (2, 4): To take course 2, you must first take course 4.\n     - (4, 3): To take course 4, you must first take course 3.\n     - (5, 0): To take course 5, you must first take course 0.\n\n2. **Construct the Dependency Graph:**\n   - The graph can be represented as:\n     - 5 -> 4\n     - 1 -> 4\n     - 5 -> 1\n     - 5 -> 3\n     - 4 -> 0\n     - 4 -> 2\n     - 3 -> 4\n     - 0 -> 5\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Start from any course and follow the dependencies to see if you return to the same course (cycle detection).\n   - For example, starting from course 5:\n     - 5 -> 4 -> 0 -> 5 (Cycle detected: 5 -> 4 -> 0 -> 5)\n   - Another cycle can be detected starting from course 3:\n     - 3 -> 4 -> 3 (Cycle detected: 3 -> 4 -> 3)\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are cycles in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that it is not possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites.\n\n<<<False>>>"
