    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - We have 10 courses labeled from 0 to 9.\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from b_i to a_i indicates that b_i is a prerequisite for a_i.\n\n3. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (2, 7): To take course 2, first take course 7.\n   - (6, 5): To take course 6, first take course 5.\n   - (4, 3): To take course 4, first take course 3.\n   - (8, 4): To take course 8, first take course 4.\n   - (9, 0): To take course 9, first take course 0.\n   - (9, 8): To take course 9, first take course 8.\n   - (7, 1): To take course 7, first take course 1.\n   - (6, 3): To take course 6, first take course 3.\n   - (0, 7): To take course 0, first take course 7.\n   - (1, 2): To take course 1, first take course 2.\n   - (6, 2): To take course 6, first take course 2.\n   - (1, 7): To take course 1, first take course 7.\n   - (1, 6): To take course 1, first take course 6.\n   - (3, 2): To take course 3, first take course 2.\n   - (5, 1): To take course 5, first take course 1.\n   - (5, 0): To take course 5, first take course 0.\n   - (0, 1): To take course 0, first take course 1.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n   - We can use algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in a directed graph.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start from any course and perform a DFS.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes and nodes currently in the recursion stack.\n   - If a node is encountered that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n6. **Analysis of the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - By analyzing the prerequisites, we can see that there is a cycle involving courses 0, 1, 2, 7, and 6.\n   - For example, to take course 0, you need course 1, which needs course 2, which needs course 7, which needs course 1 again, forming a cycle.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is a cycle in the graph, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
