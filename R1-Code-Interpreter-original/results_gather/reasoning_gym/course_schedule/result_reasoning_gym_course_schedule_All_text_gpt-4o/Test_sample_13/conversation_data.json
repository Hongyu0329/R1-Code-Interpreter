    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - We have 7 courses labeled from 0 to 6.\n   - The prerequisites are given as pairs: (a_i, b_i) means to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (1, 5): To take course 1, you must first take course 5.\n   - (3, 5): To take course 3, you must first take course 5.\n   - (6, 1): To take course 6, you must first take course 1.\n   - (4, 5): To take course 4, you must first take course 5.\n   - (0, 4): To take course 0, you must first take course 4.\n   - (3, 6): To take course 3, you must first take course 6.\n   - (6, 5): To take course 6, you must first take course 5.\n   - (2, 5): To take course 2, you must first take course 5.\n\n3. **Construct the Dependency Graph:**\n   - The graph can be represented as a directed graph where an edge from b_i to a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n4. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - A cycle in the graph would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n   - We can use a depth-first search (DFS) or a topological sort to detect cycles in the graph.\n\n5. **Perform Topological Sort or DFS:**\n   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites and try to complete them.\n   - Remove completed courses from the graph and update the list of courses with no prerequisites.\n   - If you can remove all courses from the graph, it means there is no cycle, and all courses can be completed.\n   - If there are courses left in the graph that cannot be removed, it indicates a cycle.\n\n6. **Analyze the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - Let's try to find a topological order:\n     - Courses 5 has no prerequisites, so it can be taken first.\n     - After taking course 5, courses 1, 3, 4, 6, and 2 can be taken.\n     - After taking course 1, course 6 can be taken.\n     - After taking course 4, course 0 can be taken.\n     - After taking course 6, course 3 can be taken.\n   - All courses can be taken in the order: 5, 1, 4, 2, 6, 0, 3.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since we can find a valid order to take all courses without encountering a cycle, it is possible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
