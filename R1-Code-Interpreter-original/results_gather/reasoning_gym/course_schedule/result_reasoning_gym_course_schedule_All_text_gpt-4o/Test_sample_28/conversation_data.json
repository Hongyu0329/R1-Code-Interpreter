    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the course dependency graph. If there is a cycle, it means that some courses depend on each other in a way that makes it impossible to complete them all.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 7 (labeled 0 to 6).\n   - Prerequisites: [(6, 5), (2, 3), (5, 3), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 6), (4, 5), (2, 4)].\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - A directed edge from node b_i to node a_i indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.\n\n3. **Graph Representation:**\n   - Course 6 depends on course 5.\n   - Course 2 depends on course 3.\n   - Course 5 depends on course 3.\n   - Course 0 depends on course 3.\n   - Course 1 depends on course 3.\n   - Course 1 also depends on course 6.\n   - Course 4 depends on course 5.\n   - Course 2 also depends on course 4.\n\n4. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - We need to determine if there is a cycle in this directed graph.\n   - A cycle would mean that there is a set of courses that depend on each other in a circular way, making it impossible to complete them.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start with course 0: It depends on course 3.\n   - Course 1: Depends on courses 3 and 6. Course 6 depends on course 5, which depends on course 3.\n   - Course 2: Depends on courses 3 and 4. Course 4 depends on course 5, which depends on course 3.\n   - Course 3: No dependencies.\n   - Course 4: Depends on course 5.\n   - Course 5: Depends on course 3.\n   - Course 6: Depends on course 5.\n\n6. **Topological Sorting:**\n   - Attempt to perform a topological sort on the graph.\n   - If a topological sort is possible, it means there is no cycle, and all courses can be completed.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - After analyzing the dependencies, there is no cycle in the graph.\n   - All courses can be completed by following a valid order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<True>>>"
