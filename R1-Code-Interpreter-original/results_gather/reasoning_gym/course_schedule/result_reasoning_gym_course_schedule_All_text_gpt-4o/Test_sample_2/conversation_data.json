    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check if there is a cycle in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Total courses: 9 (labeled 0 to 8).\n   - Prerequisites are given as pairs (a_i, b_i), meaning to take course a_i, you must first complete course b_i.\n\n2. **List of Prerequisites:**\n   - (8, 4): To take course 8, first take course 4.\n   - (5, 2): To take course 5, first take course 2.\n   - (7, 2): To take course 7, first take course 2.\n   - (8, 2): To take course 8, first take course 2.\n   - (6, 7): To take course 6, first take course 7.\n   - (3, 4): To take course 3, first take course 4.\n   - (1, 4): To take course 1, first take course 4.\n   - (6, 8): To take course 6, first take course 8.\n   - (0, 2): To take course 0, first take course 2.\n   - (3, 2): To take course 3, first take course 2.\n   - (5, 1): To take course 5, first take course 1.\n   - (4, 2): To take course 4, first take course 2.\n\n3. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Each course is a node.\n   - Each prerequisite pair (a_i, b_i) is a directed edge from b_i to a_i.\n\n4. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method (such as Depth-First Search) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes currently in the recursion stack (to detect back edges indicating cycles).\n\n5. **Check for Cycles:**\n   - Start from each course and perform a DFS.\n   - If a back edge is found during DFS, a cycle exists.\n   - If no back edge is found for any course, no cycle exists.\n\n6. **Analyze the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - Construct the graph and perform DFS.\n   - Check for cycles in the graph.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - If a cycle is detected, return False (not all courses can be completed).\n   - If no cycle is detected, return True (all courses can be completed).\n\nAfter analyzing the prerequisites and checking for cycles, we find that there is a cycle involving courses 6, 7, and 8. Specifically, the cycle is: 6 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 7 -> 6. This cycle makes it impossible to complete all courses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
