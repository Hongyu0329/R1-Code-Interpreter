    "To determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites, we need to check for the presence of cycles in the prerequisite graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a circular dependency, and not all courses can be completed. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Courses and Prerequisites:**\n   - Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n   - Prerequisites: \n     - (4, 2): To take course 4, you must first take course 2.\n     - (4, 6): To take course 4, you must first take course 6.\n     - (3, 2): To take course 3, you must first take course 2.\n     - (2, 1): To take course 2, you must first take course 1.\n     - (3, 0): To take course 3, you must first take course 0.\n     - (1, 5): To take course 1, you must first take course 5.\n     - (5, 3): To take course 5, you must first take course 3.\n     - (0, 2): To take course 0, you must first take course 2.\n     - (5, 4): To take course 5, you must first take course 4.\n     - (2, 6): To take course 2, you must first take course 6.\n     - (5, 2): To take course 5, you must first take course 2.\n     - (1, 3): To take course 1, you must first take course 3.\n\n2. **Construct the Graph:**\n   - Represent the courses as nodes and prerequisites as directed edges.\n   - The graph is directed, where an edge from node b to node a indicates that course b is a prerequisite for course a.\n\n3. **Detect Cycles:**\n   - Use a graph traversal method such as Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.\n   - Maintain a visited set to track nodes currently in the recursion stack (indicating the path being explored).\n   - If a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected.\n\n4. **Perform Cycle Detection:**\n   - Start DFS from each unvisited node.\n   - If a cycle is detected during DFS, return False.\n   - If no cycles are detected after exploring all nodes, return True.\n\n5. **Analyze the Given Prerequisites:**\n   - Start with course 0 and follow the prerequisites.\n   - Course 0 requires course 2.\n   - Course 2 requires course 1.\n   - Course 1 requires course 5.\n   - Course 5 requires course 3.\n   - Course 3 requires course 2 (cycle detected: 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2).\n\nSince a cycle is detected, it is not possible to complete all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<False>>>."
