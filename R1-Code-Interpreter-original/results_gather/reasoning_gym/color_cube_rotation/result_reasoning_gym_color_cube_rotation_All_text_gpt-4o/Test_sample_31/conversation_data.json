    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Yellow\n   - Bottom: Orange\n   - Front: Brown\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Right: Gold\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the bottom (Orange) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Orange\n     - Bottom: Yellow\n     - Front: Brown\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Left: Blue\n     - Right: Gold\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is turned to make the right face (Gold) the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Gold\n     - Bottom: Blue\n     - Front: Brown\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Right: Yellow\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to place its front side (Brown) at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Brown\n     - Bottom: Magenta\n     - Front: Yellow\n     - Back: Orange\n     - Left: Gold\n     - Right: Blue\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the bottom side of the cube is Magenta.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Magenta>>>."
