    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Purple\n   - Right: Violet\n   - Front: Gray\n   - Left: White\n   - Back: Green\n   - Bottom: Indigo\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Gray) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Gray\n     - Right: Violet\n     - Front: Indigo (since the bottom becomes the front)\n     - Left: White\n     - Back: Green\n     - Bottom: Purple (since the top becomes the bottom)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Green) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Green\n     - Right: Violet\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Left: White\n     - Back: Purple (since the bottom becomes the back)\n     - Bottom: Gray (since the top becomes the bottom)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Purple) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Right: Violet\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Left: White\n     - Back: Gray (since the bottom becomes the back)\n     - Bottom: Green (since the top becomes the bottom)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the front side of the cube is Indigo.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Indigo>>>"
