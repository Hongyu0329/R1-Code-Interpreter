    "To determine the color of the left side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step of the rotation process:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Silver\n   - Right: White\n   - Front: Red\n   - Left: Magenta\n   - Back: Orange\n   - Bottom: Purple\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Red) is rotated to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Right: White\n     - Front: Purple (since the bottom becomes the new front)\n     - Left: Magenta\n     - Back: Silver (since the top becomes the new back)\n     - Bottom: Orange (since the back becomes the new bottom)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Magenta) is rotated to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Magenta\n     - Right: White\n     - Front: Purple\n     - Left: Orange (since the bottom becomes the new left)\n     - Back: Silver\n     - Bottom: Red (since the top becomes the new bottom)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Purple) is rotated to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Right: White\n     - Front: Red (since the bottom becomes the new front)\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Back: Magenta (since the top becomes the new back)\n     - Bottom: Silver (since the back becomes the new bottom)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Orange.\n\n<<<Orange>>>"
