    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is oriented initially and how it changes after the specified rotation. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation of the Cube:**\n   - Top side: Silver\n   - Right side: Cyan\n   - Front side: Indigo\n   - Left side: Purple\n   - Back side: Blue\n   - Bottom side: Red\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the back (Blue) is now at the top.\n\n3. **New Orientation After Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Blue) moves to the top.\n   - The top side (Silver) will move to the front.\n   - The front side (Indigo) will move to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Red) will move to the back.\n   - The left side (Purple) and right side (Cyan) remain unchanged.\n\n4. **Resulting Orientation:**\n   - Top side: Blue (was the back side)\n   - Right side: Cyan\n   - Front side: Silver (was the top side)\n   - Left side: Purple\n   - Back side: Red (was the bottom side)\n   - Bottom side: Indigo (was the front side)\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - After the rotation, the color of the back side of the cube is Red.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Red>>>"
