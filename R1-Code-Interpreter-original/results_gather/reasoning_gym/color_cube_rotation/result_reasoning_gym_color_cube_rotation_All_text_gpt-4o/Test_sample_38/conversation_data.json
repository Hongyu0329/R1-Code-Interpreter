    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of rotations applied to the cube and track the position of each colored side.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Right: Violet\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Left: Brown\n   - Back: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Gray\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the front side (Silver) moves to the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Silver (was Front)\n     - Front: Gray (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Red (was Top)\n     - Back: Indigo (remains the same)\n     - Left: Brown (remains the same)\n     - Right: Violet (remains the same)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the back side (Indigo) to the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Indigo (was Back)\n     - Back: Red (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Gray (remains the same)\n     - Front: Silver (was Top)\n     - Left: Brown (remains the same)\n     - Right: Violet (remains the same)\n\nAfter these two rotations, the color of the bottom side of the cube is Gray.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Gray>>>."
