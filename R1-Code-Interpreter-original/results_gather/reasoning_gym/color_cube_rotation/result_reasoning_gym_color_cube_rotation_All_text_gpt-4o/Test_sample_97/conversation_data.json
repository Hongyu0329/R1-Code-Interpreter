    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Bottom: White\n   - Front: Blue\n   - Back: Pink\n   - Left: Gold\n   - Right: Violet\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Blue) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Blue\n     - Bottom: White\n     - Front: White (since the bottom moves to the front)\n     - Back: Indigo (since the top moves to the back)\n     - Left: Gold\n     - Right: Violet\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The front side (White) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: White\n     - Bottom: Blue (since the top moves to the bottom)\n     - Front: Indigo (since the back moves to the front)\n     - Back: Gold (since the left moves to the back)\n     - Left: Pink (since the back moves to the left)\n     - Right: Violet\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Gold) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Gold\n     - Bottom: Pink (since the left moves to the bottom)\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Back: Blue (since the bottom moves to the back)\n     - Left: White (since the top moves to the left)\n     - Right: Violet\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the bottom side of the cube is Pink.\n\n<<<Pink>>>"
