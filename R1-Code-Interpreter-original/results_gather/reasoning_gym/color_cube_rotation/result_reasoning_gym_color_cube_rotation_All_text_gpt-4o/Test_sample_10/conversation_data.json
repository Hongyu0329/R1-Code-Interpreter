    "To determine the new color of the back side of the cube after the rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation:\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top: Pink\n   - Bottom: Cyan\n   - Front: Orange\n   - Back: Indigo\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Right: Gray\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the bottom (Cyan) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The bottom (Cyan) moves to the top.\n   - The top (Pink) moves to the bottom.\n   - The front (Orange), back (Indigo), left (Purple), and right (Gray) sides will shift positions, but their relative positions to each other remain the same.\n\n4. **Determining the New Back Side:**\n   - Since the cube is rotated such that the bottom becomes the top, the front and back sides will swap their vertical positions.\n   - The front (Orange) will move to the position where the back (Indigo) was.\n   - The back (Indigo) will move to the position where the front (Orange) was.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - After the rotation, the back side of the cube, which was originally Indigo, is now Orange.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotation is <<<orange>>>."
