    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Orange\n   - Right: Indigo\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Back: Pink\n   - Bottom: Green\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the right (Indigo) is now on the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Right: Green (since the bottom moves to the right)\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Left: Purple\n     - Back: Pink\n     - Bottom: Orange (since the top moves to the bottom)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The bottom (Orange) is moved to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Orange\n     - Right: Green\n     - Front: Indigo (since the top moves to the front)\n     - Left: Purple\n     - Back: Silver (since the front moves to the back)\n     - Bottom: Pink (since the back moves to the bottom)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Purple) is moved to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Right: Green\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Left: Pink (since the bottom moves to the left)\n     - Back: Silver\n     - Bottom: Orange (since the top moves to the bottom)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Pink.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Pink>>>."
