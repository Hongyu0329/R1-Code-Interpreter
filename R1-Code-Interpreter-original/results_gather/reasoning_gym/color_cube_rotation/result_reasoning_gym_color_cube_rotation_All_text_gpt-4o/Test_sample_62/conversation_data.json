    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and track the changes in the position of each face as the cube is rotated.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Right: Gray\n   - Front: Brown\n   - Left: Cyan\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the right side (Gray) becomes the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Gray (was Right)\n     - Right: Yellow (was Bottom)\n     - Front: Brown (remains the same)\n     - Left: Cyan (remains the same)\n     - Back: Magenta (remains the same)\n     - Bottom: Indigo (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Magenta) is rotated to become the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Magenta (was Back)\n     - Right: Yellow (remains the same)\n     - Front: Gray (was Top)\n     - Left: Cyan (remains the same)\n     - Back: Indigo (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Brown (was Front)\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the front side after these rotations. After the second rotation, the front side is the face that was originally the top face, which was Indigo.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube after the rotations is:\n\n<<<Gray>>>"
