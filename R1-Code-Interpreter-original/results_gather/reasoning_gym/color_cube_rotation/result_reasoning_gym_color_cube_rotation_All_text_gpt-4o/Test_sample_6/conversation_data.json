    "To determine the final color of the left side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step of the rotation process.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Right: Yellow\n   - Front: Brown\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Back: Cyan\n   - Bottom: White\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Blue) is rotated to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Blue\n     - Right: Yellow\n     - Front: Brown\n     - Left: White (previously the bottom)\n     - Back: Cyan\n     - Bottom: Indigo (previously the top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Indigo) is rotated to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Right: Yellow\n     - Front: Blue (previously the top)\n     - Left: White\n     - Back: Cyan\n     - Bottom: Brown (previously the front)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The left side (White) is rotated to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: White\n     - Right: Yellow\n     - Front: Indigo (previously the top)\n     - Left: Brown (previously the bottom)\n     - Back: Cyan\n     - Bottom: Blue (previously the front)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Brown.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Brown>>>."
