    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Gold\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: White\n   - Left: Violet\n   - Back: Green\n   - Bottom: Magenta\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the front side (White) becomes the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: White (was Front)\n     - Front: Magenta (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Gold (was Top)\n     - Back: Green (remains unchanged)\n     - Right: Cyan (remains unchanged)\n     - Left: Violet (remains unchanged)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Magenta) is rotated to become the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Magenta (was Front)\n     - Front: Gold (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: White (was Top)\n     - Back: Green (remains unchanged)\n     - Right: Cyan (remains unchanged)\n     - Left: Violet (remains unchanged)\n\nAfter these two rotations, the color of the top side of the cube is Magenta.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Magenta>>>"
