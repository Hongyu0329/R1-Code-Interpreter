    "To determine the new color of the right side of the cube after the rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation:\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Back: Pink\n   - Left: Brown\n   - Right: Indigo\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the bottom (Yellow) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Yellow) moves to the top.\n   - The top side (Red) moves to the bottom.\n   - The front, back, left, and right sides will shift positions accordingly.\n\n4. **Determining the New Positions:**\n   - Since the cube is rotated such that the bottom becomes the top, the sides will rotate around the horizontal axis that runs from the front to the back.\n   - The front (Silver) and back (Pink) sides remain in their positions.\n   - The left (Brown) side moves to the right.\n   - The right (Indigo) side moves to the left.\n\n5. **New Configuration:**\n   - Top: Yellow\n   - Bottom: Red\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Back: Pink\n   - Left: Indigo\n   - Right: Brown\n\nTherefore, after the rotation, the color of the right side of the cube is Brown.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Brown>>>."
