    "To determine the final position of the cube's sides, we need to carefully analyze each rotation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Right: Brown\n   - Front: Yellow\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Back: Blue\n   - Bottom: Indigo\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the front side (Yellow) is now at the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Right: Brown\n     - Front: Indigo (was the bottom)\n     - Left: Purple\n     - Back: Gray (was the top)\n     - Bottom: Blue\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the left side (Purple) to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Right: Brown\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Left: Blue (was the bottom)\n     - Back: Gray\n     - Bottom: Yellow (was the top)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to place the right side (Brown) at the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Brown\n     - Right: Yellow (was the bottom)\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Left: Purple (was the top)\n     - Back: Gray\n     - Bottom: Blue\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Purple.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Purple>>>."
