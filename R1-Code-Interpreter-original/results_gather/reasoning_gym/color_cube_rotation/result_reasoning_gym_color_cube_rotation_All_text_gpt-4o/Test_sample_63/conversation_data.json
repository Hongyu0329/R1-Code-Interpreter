    "To determine the color of the front side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step of the rotation process.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Right: Purple\n   - Front: Gold\n   - Left: Cyan\n   - Back: Orange\n   - Bottom: Brown\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the left (Cyan) is now at the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Cyan (was Left)\n     - Right: Purple (remains Right)\n     - Front: Gold (remains Front)\n     - Left: Brown (was Bottom)\n     - Back: Orange (remains Back)\n     - Bottom: Indigo (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is turned to make the back (Orange) face the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Orange (was Back)\n     - Right: Purple (remains Right)\n     - Front: Cyan (was Top)\n     - Left: Brown (remains Left)\n     - Back: Indigo (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Gold (was Front)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the front side of the cube is Cyan.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Cyan>>>"
