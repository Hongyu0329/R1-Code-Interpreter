    "To determine the new color of the front side of the cube after the specified rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation.\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top: Green\n   - Right: Yellow\n   - Front: Gray\n   - Left: Indigo\n   - Back: Silver\n   - Bottom: White\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the left (Indigo) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Understanding the Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Indigo) moves to the top.\n   - This implies a 90-degree clockwise rotation around the axis that runs from the front to the back of the cube.\n\n4. **Effect on Other Sides:**\n   - The top side (Green) will move to the right.\n   - The right side (Yellow) will move to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (White) will move to the left.\n   - The front side (Gray) and the back side (Silver) remain unchanged in their positions.\n\n5. **New Configuration:**\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Right: Green\n   - Front: Gray\n   - Left: White\n   - Back: Silver\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n\n6. **Determine the New Front Side:**\n   - After the rotation, the front side remains the same as it was initially.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube after the rotation is still Gray.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Gray>>>"
