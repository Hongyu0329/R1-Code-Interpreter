    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Silver\n   - Bottom: Brown\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Back: Yellow\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Right: Purple\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the bottom side (Brown) becomes the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Brown\n     - Bottom: Silver\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Back: Yellow\n     - Left: Blue\n     - Right: Purple\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is turned to make the right face (Purple) the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Bottom: Blue\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Back: Yellow\n     - Left: Brown\n     - Right: Silver\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Pink) is rotated to become the top face.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Pink\n     - Bottom: Yellow\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Back: Brown\n     - Left: Purple\n     - Right: Blue\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the back side of the cube is Brown.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Brown>>>."
