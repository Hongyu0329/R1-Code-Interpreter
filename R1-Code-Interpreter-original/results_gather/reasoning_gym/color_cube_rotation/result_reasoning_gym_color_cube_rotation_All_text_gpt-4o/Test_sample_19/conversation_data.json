    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Bottom: Gray\n   - Front: Magenta\n   - Back: Violet\n   - Left: Orange\n   - Right: Green\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Orange) is now on the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Orange\n     - Bottom: Gray\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Back: Violet\n     - Left: Gray (previously bottom)\n     - Right: Red (previously top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The side that was at the back (Violet) is now on the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Bottom: Magenta (previously front)\n     - Front: Orange (previously top)\n     - Back: Gray (previously bottom)\n     - Left: Gray (remains unchanged)\n     - Right: Red (remains unchanged)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Gray) is now on the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Gray\n     - Bottom: Orange (previously front)\n     - Front: Violet (previously top)\n     - Back: Magenta (previously bottom)\n     - Left: Red (previously right)\n     - Right: Orange (previously bottom)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Red.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Red>>>."
