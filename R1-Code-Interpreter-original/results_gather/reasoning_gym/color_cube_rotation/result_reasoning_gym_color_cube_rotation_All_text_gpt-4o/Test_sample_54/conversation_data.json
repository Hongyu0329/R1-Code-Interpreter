    "To determine the color of the back side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step of the rotation process.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Right: Pink\n   - Front: Blue\n   - Left: Cyan\n   - Back: Yellow\n   - Bottom: Gold\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the back (Yellow) is now at the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Yellow (was Back)\n     - Right: Pink (remains Right)\n     - Front: Blue (remains Front)\n     - Left: Cyan (remains Left)\n     - Back: Gold (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Gray (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is turned to make the right face (Pink) the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Pink (was Right)\n     - Right: Gray (was Bottom)\n     - Front: Blue (remains Front)\n     - Left: Yellow (was Top)\n     - Back: Cyan (was Left)\n     - Bottom: Gold (remains Bottom)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the back side of the cube is Cyan.\n\n<<<Cyan>>>"
