    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Brown\n   - Right: Pink\n   - Front: Orange\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Back: Purple\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the right (Pink) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Pink (was Right)\n     - Right: Yellow (was Bottom)\n     - Front: Orange (remains the same)\n     - Left: Blue (remains the same)\n     - Back: Purple (remains the same)\n     - Bottom: Brown (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the left side (Blue) to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Blue (was Left)\n     - Right: Pink (was Top)\n     - Front: Orange (remains the same)\n     - Left: Brown (was Bottom)\n     - Back: Purple (remains the same)\n     - Bottom: Yellow (was Right)\n\nAfter these rotations, we need to determine the color of the front side of the cube. The front side remains unchanged throughout the rotations.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube is Orange.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Orange>>>"
