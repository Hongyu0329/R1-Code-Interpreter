    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube through each of the described rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Right: Pink\n   - Front: Indigo\n   - Left: Cyan\n   - Back: Yellow\n   - Bottom: Green\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the back (Yellow) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Right: Pink\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Left: Cyan\n     - Back: Green (was bottom)\n     - Bottom: Gray (was top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is turned to make the bottom (Gray) face the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Gray\n     - Right: Pink\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Left: Cyan\n     - Back: Yellow (was top)\n     - Bottom: Green\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The cube is turned to make the back (Yellow) face the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Right: Pink\n     - Front: Gray (was top)\n     - Left: Cyan\n     - Back: Green\n     - Bottom: Indigo (was front)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the top side of the cube is Yellow.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yellow>>>"
