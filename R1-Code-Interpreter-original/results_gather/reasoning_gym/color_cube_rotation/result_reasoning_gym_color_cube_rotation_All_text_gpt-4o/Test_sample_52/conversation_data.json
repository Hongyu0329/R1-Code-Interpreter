    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube through each rotation step. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Green\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Back: White\n   - Bottom: Purple\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Blue) is now on the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Blue\n     - Right: Cyan\n     - Front: Violet\n     - Left: Purple (was the bottom)\n     - Back: White\n     - Bottom: Green (was the top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Green) is moved to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Green\n     - Right: Cyan\n     - Front: Blue (was the top)\n     - Left: Purple\n     - Back: White\n     - Bottom: Violet (was the front)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The back side (White) is moved to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: White\n     - Right: Cyan\n     - Front: Green (was the top)\n     - Left: Purple\n     - Back: Violet (was the bottom)\n     - Bottom: Blue (was the front)\n\nAfter these rotations, the left side of the cube is now Purple.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube is <<<Purple>>>."
