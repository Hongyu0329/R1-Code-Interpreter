    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes a series of rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Bottom: Pink\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Back: White\n   - Left: Brown\n   - Right: Magenta\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Pink) is moved to the top.\n   - This means the top side (Red) moves to the bottom.\n   - The front, back, left, and right sides remain unchanged in their relative positions, but they rotate around the vertical axis.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Pink\n     - Bottom: Red\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Back: White\n     - Left: Brown\n     - Right: Magenta\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The back side (White) is moved to the top.\n   - The top side (Pink) moves to the front.\n   - The front side (Silver) moves to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Red) moves to the back.\n   - The left and right sides remain unchanged in their relative positions.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: White\n     - Bottom: Silver\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Back: Red\n     - Left: Brown\n     - Right: Magenta\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Pink) is moved to the top.\n   - The top side (White) moves to the back.\n   - The back side (Red) moves to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Silver) moves to the front.\n   - The left and right sides remain unchanged in their relative positions.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Pink\n     - Bottom: Red\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Back: White\n     - Left: Brown\n     - Right: Magenta\n\nAfter these rotations, the left side of the cube is still Brown.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube is <<<Brown>>>."
