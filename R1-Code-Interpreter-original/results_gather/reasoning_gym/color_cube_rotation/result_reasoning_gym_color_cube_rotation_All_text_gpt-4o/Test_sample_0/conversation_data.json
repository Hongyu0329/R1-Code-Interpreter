    "To determine the color of the back side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step of the rotation process.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Cyan\n   - Bottom: Gold\n   - Front: Purple\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Left: Orange\n   - Right: Green\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the bottom side (Gold) is now at the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Gold (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Cyan (was Top)\n     - Front: Purple (remains the same)\n     - Back: Magenta (remains the same)\n     - Left: Orange (remains the same)\n     - Right: Green (remains the same)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is turned to make the right face (Green) the top.\n   - To achieve this, the cube is rotated around the front-back axis.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Green (was Right)\n     - Bottom: Orange (was Left)\n     - Front: Purple (remains the same)\n     - Back: Gold (was Top)\n     - Left: Cyan (was Bottom)\n     - Right: Magenta (was Back)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the back side of the cube is Gold.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Gold>>>"
