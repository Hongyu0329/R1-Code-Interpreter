    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of rotations applied to the cube and track the position of each colored side.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Bottom: Violet\n   - Front: Gold\n   - Back: Blue\n   - Left: Pink\n   - Right: White\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the left (Pink) is now at the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Pink (was Left)\n     - Bottom: Violet (remains the same)\n     - Front: Gold (remains the same)\n     - Back: Blue (remains the same)\n     - Left: Violet (was Bottom)\n     - Right: Gray (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the front side (Gold) to the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Gold (was Front)\n     - Bottom: Violet (remains the same)\n     - Front: Gray (was Right)\n     - Back: Pink (was Top)\n     - Left: Violet (remains the same)\n     - Right: Blue (was Back)\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the back side of the cube after these rotations.\n\nThe back side is now Pink.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Pink>>>"
