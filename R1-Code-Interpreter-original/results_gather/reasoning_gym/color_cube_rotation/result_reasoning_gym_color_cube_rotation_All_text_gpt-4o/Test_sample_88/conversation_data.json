    "To determine the color of the bottom side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step of the rotation process.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Bottom: Brown\n   - Front: Indigo\n   - Back: Gold\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Right: White\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the front side (Indigo) is now at the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Bottom: Brown\n     - Front: Brown (since the bottom moves to the front)\n     - Back: Red (since the top moves to the back)\n     - Left: Blue\n     - Right: White\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to place its right side (White) at the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: White\n     - Bottom: Blue (since the left side moves to the bottom)\n     - Front: Brown\n     - Back: Red\n     - Left: Indigo (since the top moves to the left)\n     - Right: Gold (since the back moves to the right)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the bottom side of the cube is Blue.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Blue>>>."
