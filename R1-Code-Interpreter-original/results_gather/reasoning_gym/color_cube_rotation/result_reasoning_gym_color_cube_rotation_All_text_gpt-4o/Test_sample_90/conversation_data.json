    "To determine the color of the front side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step of the rotation process.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Violet\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Cyan\n   - Left: Magenta\n   - Back: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Brown\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Cyan) is rotated to the top.\n   - This means the top side (Violet) will move to the back, the bottom side (Brown) will move to the front, and the back side (Indigo) will move to the bottom.\n   - The left (Magenta) and right (Gold) sides remain unchanged in their relative positions.\n\n   After the first rotation:\n   - Top: Cyan\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Brown\n   - Left: Magenta\n   - Back: Violet\n   - Bottom: Indigo\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Magenta) is rotated to the top.\n   - This means the top side (Cyan) will move to the right, the bottom side (Indigo) will move to the left, and the right side (Gold) will move to the bottom.\n   - The front (Brown) and back (Violet) sides remain unchanged in their relative positions.\n\n   After the second rotation:\n   - Top: Magenta\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: Brown\n   - Left: Indigo\n   - Back: Violet\n   - Bottom: Gold\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the front side of the cube is Brown.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Brown>>>"
