    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Purple\n   - Bottom: White\n   - Front: Magenta\n   - Back: Orange\n   - Left: Cyan\n   - Right: Gray\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Cyan) is now on the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Cyan\n     - Bottom: White\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Back: Orange\n     - Left: White (was bottom)\n     - Right: Purple (was top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the back (Orange) is now on the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Orange\n     - Bottom: Magenta (was front)\n     - Front: Cyan (was top)\n     - Back: White (was bottom)\n     - Left: White\n     - Right: Purple\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the front (Cyan) is now on the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Cyan\n     - Bottom: White (was back)\n     - Front: Orange (was top)\n     - Back: Magenta (was bottom)\n     - Left: White\n     - Right: Purple\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the front side of the cube is Orange.\n\n<<<Orange>>>"
