    "To determine the final color of the right side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step of the rotation process:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Orange\n   - Right: Indigo\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Left: Gray\n   - Back: Violet\n   - Bottom: Magenta\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the front side (Silver) is now at the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Silver\n     - Right: Indigo\n     - Front: Magenta (since the bottom moves to the front)\n     - Left: Gray\n     - Back: Orange (since the top moves to the back)\n     - Bottom: Violet (since the back moves to the bottom)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the right side (Indigo) to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Right: Violet (since the bottom moves to the right)\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Left: Silver (since the top moves to the left)\n     - Back: Orange\n     - Bottom: Gray (since the left moves to the bottom)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The cube is turned to make the bottom (Gray) face the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Gray\n     - Right: Magenta (since the front moves to the right)\n     - Front: Indigo (since the top moves to the front)\n     - Left: Silver\n     - Back: Orange\n     - Bottom: Violet (since the back moves to the bottom)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the right side of the cube is Magenta.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Magenta>>>."
