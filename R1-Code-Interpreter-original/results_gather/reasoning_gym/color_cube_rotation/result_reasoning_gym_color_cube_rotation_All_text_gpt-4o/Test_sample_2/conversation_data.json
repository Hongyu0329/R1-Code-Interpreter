    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Pink\n   - Front: White\n   - Back: Violet\n   - Left: Brown\n   - Right: Gold\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the bottom side (Pink) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Pink (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Indigo (was Top)\n     - Front: White (remains the same)\n     - Back: Violet (remains the same)\n     - Left: Brown (remains the same)\n     - Right: Gold (remains the same)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the right side (Gold) to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Gold (was Right)\n     - Bottom: Brown (was Left)\n     - Front: White (remains the same)\n     - Back: Violet (remains the same)\n     - Left: Pink (was Top)\n     - Right: Indigo (was Bottom)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the right side of the cube is now Indigo.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Indigo>>>."
