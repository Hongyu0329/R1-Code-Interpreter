    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Green\n   - Bottom: Violet\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Back: Yellow\n   - Left: Red\n   - Right: Gold\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the back (Yellow) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Bottom: Violet\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Back: Green\n     - Left: Red\n     - Right: Gold\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is turned to make the back (Green) face the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Green\n     - Bottom: Violet\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Back: Yellow\n     - Left: Red\n     - Right: Gold\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the front (Pink) side to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Pink\n     - Bottom: Violet\n     - Front: Gold\n     - Back: Red\n     - Left: Green\n     - Right: Yellow\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the back side of the cube is Red.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Red>>>."
