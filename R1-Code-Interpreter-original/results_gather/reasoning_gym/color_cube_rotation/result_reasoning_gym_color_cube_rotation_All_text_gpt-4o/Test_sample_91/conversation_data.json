    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is oriented initially and how it changes after the specified rotation. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation of the Cube:**\n   - Top side: Gray\n   - Right side: Yellow\n   - Front side: Brown\n   - Left side: Orange\n   - Back side: Blue\n   - Bottom side: Pink\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the left is now at the top.\n\n3. **Understanding the Rotation:**\n   - The left side of the cube initially is the Orange side.\n   - When the Orange side moves to the top, the cube is essentially rotated around the axis that runs from the front to the back.\n   - This means the top (Gray) moves to the right, the right (Yellow) moves to the bottom, the bottom (Pink) moves to the left, and the left (Orange) moves to the top.\n\n4. **New Orientation of the Cube:**\n   - Top side: Orange (was left)\n   - Right side: Gray (was top)\n   - Front side: Brown (remains unchanged)\n   - Left side: Pink (was bottom)\n   - Back side: Blue (remains unchanged)\n   - Bottom side: Yellow (was right)\n\n5. **Determine the New Color of the Back Side:**\n   - The back side of the cube remains unchanged in this rotation.\n   - Initially, the back side was Blue.\n\nTherefore, after the rotation, the color of the back side of the cube is still Blue.\n\nFinal answer: <<<blue>>>."
