    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Cyan\n   - Bottom: Magenta\n   - Front: Gold\n   - Back: Blue\n   - Left: Orange\n   - Right: Gray\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Gold) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Gold\n     - Bottom: Magenta\n     - Front: Magenta (since the top was cyan and the bottom is now the front)\n     - Back: Blue\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Right: Gray\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Blue) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Blue\n     - Bottom: Magenta\n     - Front: Gold\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Right: Gray\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Orange) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Orange\n     - Bottom: Gray (since the right side becomes the bottom)\n     - Front: Gold\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Left: Magenta\n     - Right: Blue\n\nAfter these rotations, the bottom side of the cube is now Gray.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Gray>>>."
