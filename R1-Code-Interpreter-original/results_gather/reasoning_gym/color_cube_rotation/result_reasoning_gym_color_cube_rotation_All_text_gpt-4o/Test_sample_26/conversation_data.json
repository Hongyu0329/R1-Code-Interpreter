    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of rotations applied to the cube and track the position of each colored face.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Gold\n   - Bottom: Brown\n   - Front: White\n   - Back: Orange\n   - Left: Gray\n   - Right: Green\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the bottom side (Brown) becomes the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Brown (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Gold (was Top)\n     - Front: White (remains the same)\n     - Back: Orange (remains the same)\n     - Left: Gray (remains the same)\n     - Right: Green (remains the same)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Green) is rotated to become the top face.\n   - To achieve this, the cube is rotated around the axis that connects the front and back faces.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Green (was Right)\n     - Bottom: Gray (was Left)\n     - Front: White (remains the same)\n     - Back: Orange (remains the same)\n     - Left: Brown (was Top)\n     - Right: Gold (was Bottom)\n\nAfter these two rotations, the color of the top side of the cube is Green.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Green>>>"
