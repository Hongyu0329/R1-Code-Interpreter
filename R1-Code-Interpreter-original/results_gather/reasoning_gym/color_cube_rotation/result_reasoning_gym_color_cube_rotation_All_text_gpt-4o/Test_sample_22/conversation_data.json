    "To determine the new color of the back side of the cube after the specified rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation:\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top: Orange\n   - Right: Red\n   - Front: Gray\n   - Left: Green\n   - Back: Silver\n   - Bottom: Gold\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the back (Silver) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Silver) moves to the top.\n   - The top side (Orange) moves to the front.\n   - The front side (Gray) moves to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Gold) moves to the back.\n   - The left side (Green) and the right side (Red) remain unchanged.\n\n4. **New Configuration:**\n   - Top: Silver (was Back)\n   - Right: Red (unchanged)\n   - Front: Orange (was Top)\n   - Left: Green (unchanged)\n   - Back: Gold (was Bottom)\n   - Bottom: Gray (was Front)\n\nAfter analyzing the rotation, the new color of the back side of the cube is Gold.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Gold>>>"
