    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Brown\n   - Bottom: Purple\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Left: Cyan\n   - Right: Red\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the left (Cyan) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Cyan (was Left)\n     - Bottom: Purple (remains the same)\n     - Front: Pink (remains the same)\n     - Back: Magenta (remains the same)\n     - Left: Purple (was Bottom)\n     - Right: Brown (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the bottom side (Purple) to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Purple (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Cyan (was Top)\n     - Front: Pink (remains the same)\n     - Back: Magenta (remains the same)\n     - Left: Cyan (was Top)\n     - Right: Brown (remains the same)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the back side of the cube is still Magenta, as it has not changed position during the rotations.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Magenta>>>"
