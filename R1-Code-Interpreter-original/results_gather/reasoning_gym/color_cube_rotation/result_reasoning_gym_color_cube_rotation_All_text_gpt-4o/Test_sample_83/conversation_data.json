    "To determine the final color of the top side of the cube, we need to carefully analyze each rotation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Purple\n   - Front: Cyan\n   - Back: Blue\n   - Left: Pink\n   - Right: Red\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the bottom (Purple) is now at the top.\n   - New Position:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Bottom: Indigo\n     - Front: Cyan\n     - Back: Blue\n     - Left: Pink\n     - Right: Red\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to place its front side (Cyan) at the top.\n   - New Position:\n     - Top: Cyan\n     - Bottom: Indigo\n     - Front: Purple\n     - Back: Red\n     - Left: Pink\n     - Right: Blue\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The cube is turned to make the front (Purple) face the top.\n   - New Position:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Bottom: Cyan\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Back: Red\n     - Left: Pink\n     - Right: Blue\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the top side of the cube is Purple.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Purple>>>."
