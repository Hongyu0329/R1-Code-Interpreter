    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Bottom: Gold\n   - Front: Blue\n   - Back: Silver\n   - Left: Brown\n   - Right: Violet\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the back (Silver) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Silver (was Back)\n     - Bottom: Gold (remains the same)\n     - Front: Blue (remains the same)\n     - Back: Red (was Top)\n     - Left: Brown (remains the same)\n     - Right: Violet (remains the same)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the right side (Violet) to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Violet (was Right)\n     - Bottom: Brown (was Left)\n     - Front: Blue (remains the same)\n     - Back: Red (remains the same)\n     - Left: Silver (was Top)\n     - Right: Gold (was Bottom)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Gold) is rotated to become the top face.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Gold (was Right)\n     - Bottom: Blue (was Front)\n     - Front: Violet (was Top)\n     - Back: Brown (was Bottom)\n     - Left: Silver (remains the same)\n     - Right: Red (was Back)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the bottom side of the cube is Blue.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Blue>>>."
