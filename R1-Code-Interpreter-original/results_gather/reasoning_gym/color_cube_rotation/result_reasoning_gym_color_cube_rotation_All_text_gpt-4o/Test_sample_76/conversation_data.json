    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is oriented initially and how it changes after the rotation. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Orange\n   - Right: Pink\n   - Front: Brown\n   - Left: Gray\n   - Back: Gold\n   - Bottom: Blue\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the right (Pink) is now at the top.\n\n3. **New Orientation After Rotation:**\n   - The Pink side, which was initially on the right, is now on the top.\n   - The Orange side, which was initially on the top, will move to the opposite side of the rotation, which is the right side.\n   - The Brown front side remains unchanged.\n   - The Gray left side remains unchanged.\n   - The Gold back side remains unchanged.\n   - The Blue bottom side remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Final Orientation:**\n   - Top: Pink\n   - Right: Orange\n   - Front: Brown\n   - Left: Gray\n   - Back: Gold\n   - Bottom: Blue\n\n5. **Determine the Color of the Right Side:**\n   - After the rotation, the right side of the cube is now the Orange side.\n\nTherefore, the color of the right side of the cube after the rotation is Orange.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Orange>>>."
