    "To determine the color of the front side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step of the rotation process.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Bottom: Gold\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Back: Purple\n   - Left: Magenta\n   - Right: Green\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Magenta) is rotated to the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Magenta (was Left)\n     - Bottom: Gold (remains the same)\n     - Front: Silver (remains the same)\n     - Back: Purple (remains the same)\n     - Left: Gold (was Bottom)\n     - Right: Red (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The side that is now on the right (Red) is rotated to the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Red (was Right)\n     - Bottom: Gold (remains the same)\n     - Front: Green (was Right)\n     - Back: Magenta (was Top)\n     - Left: Silver (was Front)\n     - Right: Purple (was Back)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the front side of the cube is Green.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Green>>>."
