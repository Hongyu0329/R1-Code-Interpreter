    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and understand how the rotation affects the position of each side. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position of the Cube:**\n   - Top: Brown\n   - Right: Purple\n   - Front: Magenta\n   - Left: Red\n   - Back: Gray\n   - Bottom: Blue\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the left (Red) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Understanding the Rotation:**\n   - If the left side (Red) moves to the top, the cube is rotated around the axis that runs from the front to the back.\n   - This means the top (Brown) will move to the right, the right (Purple) will move to the bottom, the bottom (Blue) will move to the left, and the left (Red) will move to the top.\n\n4. **New Position of Each Side:**\n   - Top: Red (since the left side moved to the top)\n   - Right: Brown (since the top side moved to the right)\n   - Front: Magenta (the front side remains unchanged)\n   - Left: Blue (since the bottom side moved to the left)\n   - Back: Gray (the back side remains unchanged)\n   - Bottom: Purple (since the right side moved to the bottom)\n\n5. **Determine the New Front Side:**\n   - The front side remains unchanged during this rotation, so it is still Magenta.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube after the rotation is:\n\n<<<Magenta>>>"
