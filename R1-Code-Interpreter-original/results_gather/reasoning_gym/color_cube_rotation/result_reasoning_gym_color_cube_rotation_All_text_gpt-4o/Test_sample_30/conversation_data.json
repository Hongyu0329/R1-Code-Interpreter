    "To determine the final color of the top side of the cube, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of rotations described in the problem.\n\n1. **Initial Position of the Cube:**\n   - Top: Gold\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: Gray\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Bottom: Red\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the back (Magenta) is now at the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Magenta (was Back)\n     - Right: Cyan (remains the same)\n     - Front: Gold (was Top)\n     - Left: Purple (remains the same)\n     - Back: Red (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Gray (was Front)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to place its bottom side (Gray) at the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Gray (was Bottom)\n     - Right: Magenta (was Top)\n     - Front: Gold (remains the same)\n     - Left: Purple (remains the same)\n     - Back: Cyan (was Right)\n     - Bottom: Red (was Back)\n\nAfter these two rotations, the color of the top side of the cube is Gray.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Gray>>>."
