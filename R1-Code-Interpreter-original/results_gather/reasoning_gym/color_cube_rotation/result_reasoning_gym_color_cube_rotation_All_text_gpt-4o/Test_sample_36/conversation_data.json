    "To determine the new color of the bottom side of the cube after the rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation.\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top side: Red\n   - Bottom side: Blue\n   - Front side: White\n   - Back side: Orange\n   - Left side: Pink\n   - Right side: Silver\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the bottom (Blue) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The Blue side, initially at the bottom, moves to the top.\n   - The Red side, initially at the top, moves to the bottom.\n\n4. **New Configuration:**\n   - Top side: Blue (was the bottom)\n   - Bottom side: Red (was the top)\n   - The other sides (front, back, left, right) remain unchanged in terms of their relative positions to each other.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - After the rotation, the color of the bottom side is now Red.\n\nTherefore, the color of the bottom side of the cube after the rotation is <<<red>>>."
