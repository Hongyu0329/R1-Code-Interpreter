    "To determine the new color of the left side of the cube after the specified rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation:\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top: Gold\n   - Right: Brown\n   - Front: Cyan\n   - Left: Magenta\n   - Back: Green\n   - Bottom: Purple\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the right (Brown) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The Brown side moves from the right to the top.\n   - The Gold side, which was initially on the top, will move to the left.\n   - The Magenta side, which was initially on the left, will move to the bottom.\n   - The Purple side, which was initially on the bottom, will move to the right.\n   - The Cyan side, which was initially on the front, remains on the front.\n   - The Green side, which was initially on the back, remains on the back.\n\n4. **New Configuration:**\n   - Top: Brown\n   - Right: Purple\n   - Front: Cyan\n   - Left: Gold\n   - Back: Green\n   - Bottom: Magenta\n\n5. **Determine the New Left Side:**\n   - After the rotation, the left side of the cube is now the side that was initially the top side.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube after the rotation is Gold.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Gold>>>."
