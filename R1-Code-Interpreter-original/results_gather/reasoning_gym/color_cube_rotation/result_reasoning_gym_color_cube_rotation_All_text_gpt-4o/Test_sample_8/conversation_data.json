    "To determine the new color of the back side of the cube after the specified rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation.\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top side: Green\n   - Right side: Cyan\n   - Front side: Purple\n   - Left side: Gold\n   - Back side: Violet\n   - Bottom side: Pink\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the front (Purple) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Purple) moves to the top.\n   - The top side (Green) moves to the back.\n   - The back side (Violet) moves to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Pink) moves to the front.\n   - The left side (Gold) and right side (Cyan) remain unchanged.\n\n4. **New Configuration:**\n   - Top side: Purple (was front)\n   - Right side: Cyan (unchanged)\n   - Front side: Pink (was bottom)\n   - Left side: Gold (unchanged)\n   - Back side: Green (was top)\n   - Bottom side: Violet (was back)\n\n5. **Determine the New Color of the Back Side:**\n   - After the rotation, the back side of the cube is now the side that was originally the top side.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotation is Green.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Green>>>."
