    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the positions of each colored side of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Bottom: Pink\n   - Front: Magenta\n   - Back: Yellow\n   - Left: Orange\n   - Right: Purple\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the right (Purple) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Bottom: Pink\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Back: Yellow\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Right: Gray\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Pink) is rotated to become the top face.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Pink\n     - Bottom: Purple\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Back: Yellow\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Right: Gray\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Yellow) is rotated to become the top face.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Bottom: Purple\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Right: Gray\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Orange.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Orange>>>"
