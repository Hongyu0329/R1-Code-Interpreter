    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: White\n   - Right: Orange\n   - Front: Red\n   - Left: Green\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Bottom: Indigo\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the front (Red) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Red (was Front)\n     - Front: Indigo (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: White (was Top)\n     - Back: Magenta (remains the same)\n     - Right: Orange (remains the same)\n     - Left: Green (remains the same)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated again to bring the front side (Indigo) to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Indigo (was Front)\n     - Front: White (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Red (was Top)\n     - Back: Magenta (remains the same)\n     - Right: Orange (remains the same)\n     - Left: Green (remains the same)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is still Green, as the left side did not change during the rotations.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Green>>>."
