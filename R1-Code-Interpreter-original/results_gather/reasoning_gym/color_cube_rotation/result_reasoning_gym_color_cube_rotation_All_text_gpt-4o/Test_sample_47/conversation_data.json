    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Silver\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Left: Green\n   - Back: Purple\n   - Bottom: Brown\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the left (Green) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Green\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Violet\n     - Left: Brown (since the bottom becomes the left)\n     - Back: Purple\n     - Bottom: Silver (since the top becomes the bottom)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to place its front side (Violet) at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Silver (since the bottom becomes the front)\n     - Left: Brown\n     - Back: Green (since the top becomes the back)\n     - Bottom: Purple\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the back side (Green) to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Green\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Left: Violet (since the top becomes the left)\n     - Back: Purple\n     - Bottom: Brown\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Violet.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Violet>>>."
