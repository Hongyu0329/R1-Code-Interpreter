    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Orange\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Back: Brown\n   - Left: Red\n   - Right: Blue\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the right (Blue) is now on the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Blue\n     - Bottom: Yellow\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Back: Brown\n     - Left: Red\n     - Right: Orange (since the top was Orange and it moves to the right)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Red) is now on the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Bottom: Yellow\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Back: Brown\n     - Left: Yellow (since the bottom was Yellow and it moves to the left)\n     - Right: Blue (since the top was Blue and it moves to the right)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - Again, the side that was on the left (Yellow) is now on the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Bottom: Red (since the top was Red and it moves to the bottom)\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Back: Brown\n     - Left: Blue (since the right was Blue and it moves to the left)\n     - Right: Brown (since the back was Brown and it moves to the right)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the right side of the cube is Brown.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Brown>>>."
