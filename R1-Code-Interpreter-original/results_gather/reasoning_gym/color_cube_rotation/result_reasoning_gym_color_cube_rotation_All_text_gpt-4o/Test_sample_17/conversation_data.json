    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: White\n   - Bottom: Magenta\n   - Front: Yellow\n   - Back: Violet\n   - Right: Pink\n   - Left: Gold\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was at the bottom (Magenta) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Magenta\n     - Bottom: White\n     - Front: Yellow\n     - Back: Violet\n     - Right: Pink\n     - Left: Gold\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The side that is currently at the bottom (White) is moved to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: White\n     - Bottom: Magenta\n     - Front: Yellow\n     - Back: Violet\n     - Right: Pink\n     - Left: Gold\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The side that is currently at the front (Yellow) is moved to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Bottom: Violet\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Back: White\n     - Right: Pink\n     - Left: Gold\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the back side of the cube is White.\n\nFinal answer: <<<White>>>."
