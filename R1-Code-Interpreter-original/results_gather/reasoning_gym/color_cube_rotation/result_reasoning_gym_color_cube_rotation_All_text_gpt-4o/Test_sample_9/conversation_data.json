    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Green\n   - Right: Violet\n   - Front: Magenta\n   - Left: Red\n   - Back: Pink\n   - Bottom: Indigo\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the front (Magenta) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Magenta (was Front)\n     - Front: Indigo (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Green (was Top)\n     - The other sides (Right, Left, Back) remain unchanged in their relative positions:\n       - Right: Violet\n       - Left: Red\n       - Back: Pink\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to place its front side (Indigo) at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Indigo (was Front)\n     - Bottom: Magenta (was Top)\n     - The other sides (Right, Left, Back) adjust accordingly:\n       - Front: Green (was Bottom)\n       - Right: Violet\n       - Left: Red\n       - Back: Pink\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the bottom side of the cube is Magenta.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Magenta>>>."
