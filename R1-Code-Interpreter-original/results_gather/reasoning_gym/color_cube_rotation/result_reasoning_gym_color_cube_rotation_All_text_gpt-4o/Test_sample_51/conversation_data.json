    "To determine the new color of the right side of the cube after the specified rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation:\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top: Cyan\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Yellow\n   - Left: White\n   - Back: Gray\n   - Bottom: Magenta\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the back (Gray) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Gray) moves to the top.\n   - The top side (Cyan) moves to the front.\n   - The front side (Yellow) moves to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Magenta) moves to the back.\n   - The left side (White) remains on the left.\n   - The right side (Gold) remains on the right.\n\n4. **New Configuration:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Cyan\n   - Left: White\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n\n5. **Determine the New Right Side:**\n   - After the rotation, the right side remains unchanged in terms of its position relative to the cube's orientation. Therefore, the color of the right side remains Gold.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Gold>>>."
