    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes a series of rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: White\n   - Bottom: Blue\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Left: Silver\n   - Right: Yellow\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Silver) is now on the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Silver\n     - Bottom: Blue\n     - Front: Violet\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Left: Blue (since the bottom becomes the left)\n     - Right: Yellow\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Blue) is rotated to become the top face.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Blue\n     - Bottom: Silver (since the top becomes the bottom)\n     - Front: Violet\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Left: Silver\n     - Right: Yellow\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Magenta) is rotated to become the top face.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Magenta\n     - Bottom: Silver\n     - Front: Blue (since the top becomes the front)\n     - Back: Silver\n     - Left: Silver\n     - Right: Yellow\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the front side of the cube is Blue.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Blue>>>."
