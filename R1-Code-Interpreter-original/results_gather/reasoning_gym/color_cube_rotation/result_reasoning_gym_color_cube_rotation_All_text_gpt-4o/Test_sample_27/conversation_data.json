    "To determine the new color of the front side of the cube after the rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation:\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top side: Gold\n   - Bottom side: Yellow\n   - Front side: Silver\n   - Back side: Orange\n   - Left side: Gray\n   - Right side: Indigo\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the bottom (Yellow) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The Yellow side, which was initially at the bottom, moves to the top.\n   - The Gold side, which was initially at the top, moves to the bottom.\n   - The other sides (Front, Back, Left, Right) will rotate around the vertical axis passing through the top and bottom faces.\n\n4. **Determining the New Front Side:**\n   - Since the cube is rotated around the vertical axis, the sides that were initially vertical (Front, Back, Left, Right) will shift positions.\n   - The side that was initially at the front (Silver) will move to the position that was previously occupied by the top side (Gold).\n   - The side that was initially at the back (Orange) will move to the position that was previously occupied by the bottom side (Yellow).\n   - The side that was initially at the left (Gray) will move to the position that was previously occupied by the front side (Silver).\n   - The side that was initially at the right (Indigo) will move to the position that was previously occupied by the back side (Orange).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - After the rotation, the Gray side, which was initially on the left, will now be at the front.\n\nTherefore, the new color of the front side of the cube is <<<gray>>>."
