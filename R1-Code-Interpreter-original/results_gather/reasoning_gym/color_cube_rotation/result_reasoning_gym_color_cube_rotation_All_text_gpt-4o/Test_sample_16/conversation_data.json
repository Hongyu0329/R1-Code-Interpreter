    "To determine the new color of the back side of the cube after the rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation.\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top: Orange\n   - Bottom: Pink\n   - Front: Indigo\n   - Back: Red\n   - Left: Gray\n   - Right: Violet\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the bottom (Pink) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The Pink side, initially at the bottom, moves to the top.\n   - The Orange side, initially at the top, moves to the bottom.\n   - The other sides (Front, Back, Left, Right) will rotate around the horizontal axis that runs from the left to the right side of the cube.\n\n4. **Determine the New Position of Each Side:**\n   - The Front (Indigo) side will move to the position of the Bottom (Orange) side.\n   - The Back (Red) side will move to the position of the Top (Pink) side.\n   - The Left (Gray) and Right (Violet) sides remain in their respective positions.\n\n5. **New Configuration:**\n   - Top: Pink\n   - Bottom: Orange\n   - Front: Gray\n   - Back: Indigo\n   - Left: Violet\n   - Right: Red\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - After the rotation, the color of the back side of the cube is Indigo.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Indigo>>>"
