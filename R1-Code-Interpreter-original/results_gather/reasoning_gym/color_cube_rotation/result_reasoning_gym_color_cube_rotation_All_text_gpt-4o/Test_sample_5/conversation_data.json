    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Pink\n   - Bottom: White\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Back: Silver\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Right: Green\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the back (Silver) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Silver (was Back)\n     - Bottom: White (remains the same)\n     - Front: Violet (remains the same)\n     - Back: Pink (was Top)\n     - Left: Purple (remains the same)\n     - Right: Green (remains the same)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated again to bring the back side (Pink) to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Pink (was Back)\n     - Bottom: White (remains the same)\n     - Front: Silver (was Top)\n     - Back: Violet (was Front)\n     - Left: Purple (remains the same)\n     - Right: Green (remains the same)\n\nAfter these rotations, we need to determine the color of the right side of the cube. The right side has not changed its position throughout the rotations and remains Green.\n\nTherefore, the color of the right side of the cube is <<<Green>>>."
