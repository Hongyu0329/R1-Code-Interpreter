    "To determine the final color of the bottom side of the cube, we need to carefully analyze each rotation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Green\n   - Bottom: Indigo\n   - Front: Cyan\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Left: Orange\n   - Right: White\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Orange) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Orange\n     - Bottom: Indigo\n     - Front: Cyan\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Left: Indigo (previously bottom)\n     - Right: Green (previously top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the bottom (Indigo) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Bottom: Orange (previously top)\n     - Front: Cyan\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Left: Indigo\n     - Right: Green\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Indigo) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Bottom: Green (previously right)\n     - Front: Cyan\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Right: Orange\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the bottom side of the cube is Green.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Green>>>."
