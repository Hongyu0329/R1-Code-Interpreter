    "To determine the color of the left side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step of the rotation process.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Left: Brown\n   - Back: Green\n   - Bottom: Blue\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the right (Cyan) is now at the top.\n   - This means the cube is rotated such that the right side moves to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Cyan (was Right)\n     - Right: Blue (was Bottom)\n     - Front: Pink (remains the same)\n     - Left: Brown (remains the same)\n     - Back: Green (remains the same)\n     - Bottom: Gray (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The side that is currently on the right (Blue) is moved to the top.\n   - This means the cube is rotated such that the right side moves to the top again.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Blue (was Right)\n     - Right: Gray (was Bottom)\n     - Front: Pink (remains the same)\n     - Left: Cyan (was Top)\n     - Back: Green (remains the same)\n     - Bottom: Brown (was Left)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Cyan.\n\nFinal answer: <<<cyan>>>."
