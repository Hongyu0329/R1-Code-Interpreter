    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Purple\n   - Bottom: Cyan\n   - Front: Indigo\n   - Back: Brown\n   - Left: Red\n   - Right: Violet\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the bottom side (Cyan) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Cyan (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Purple (was Top)\n     - Front: Indigo (remains the same)\n     - Back: Brown (remains the same)\n     - Left: Red (remains the same)\n     - Right: Violet (remains the same)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the back side (Brown) to the top.\n   - This means the cube is rotated forward.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Brown (was Back)\n     - Bottom: Indigo (was Front)\n     - Front: Purple (was Bottom)\n     - Back: Cyan (was Top)\n     - Left: Red (remains the same)\n     - Right: Violet (remains the same)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the bottom side of the cube is Indigo.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Indigo>>>."
