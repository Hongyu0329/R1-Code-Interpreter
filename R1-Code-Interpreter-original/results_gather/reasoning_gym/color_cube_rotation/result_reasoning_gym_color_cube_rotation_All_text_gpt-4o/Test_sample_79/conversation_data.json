    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Brown\n   - Right: Gray\n   - Front: Red\n   - Left: Green\n   - Back: White\n   - Bottom: Gold\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the back (White) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: White (was Back)\n     - Right: Gray (remains the same)\n     - Front: Red (remains the same)\n     - Left: Green (remains the same)\n     - Back: Gold (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Brown (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is turned to make the left face (Green) the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Green (was Left)\n     - Right: Gray (remains the same)\n     - Front: White (was Top)\n     - Left: Red (was Front)\n     - Back: Gold (remains the same)\n     - Bottom: Brown (remains the same)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Red.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Red>>>"
