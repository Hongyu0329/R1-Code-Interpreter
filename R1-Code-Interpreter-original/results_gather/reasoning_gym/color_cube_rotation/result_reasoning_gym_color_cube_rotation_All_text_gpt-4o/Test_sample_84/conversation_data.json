    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Magenta\n   - Right: Indigo\n   - Front: Purple\n   - Left: Orange\n   - Back: White\n   - Bottom: Brown\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the right (Indigo) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Indigo (was Right)\n     - Right: Brown (was Bottom)\n     - Front: Purple (remains Front)\n     - Left: Magenta (was Top)\n     - Back: White (remains Back)\n     - Bottom: Orange (was Left)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to place its left side (Magenta) at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Magenta (was Left)\n     - Right: Brown (remains Right)\n     - Front: Indigo (was Top)\n     - Left: Orange (was Bottom)\n     - Back: White (remains Back)\n     - Bottom: Purple (was Front)\n\nAfter these rotations, we need to determine the color of the back side of the cube. According to the final orientation, the back side remains White.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube is:\n\n<<<white>>>"
