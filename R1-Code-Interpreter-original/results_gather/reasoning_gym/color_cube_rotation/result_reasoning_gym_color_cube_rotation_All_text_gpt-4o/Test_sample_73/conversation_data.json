    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Blue\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Back: Purple\n   - Left: Pink\n   - Right: Yellow\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Violet) is rotated to the top.\n   - This means the top side (Indigo) will move to the back.\n   - The back side (Purple) will move to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Blue) will move to the front.\n   - The left (Pink) and right (Yellow) sides remain unchanged.\n\n   After the first rotation, the orientation is:\n   - Top: Violet\n   - Bottom: Purple\n   - Front: Blue\n   - Back: Indigo\n   - Left: Pink\n   - Right: Yellow\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Indigo) is rotated to the top.\n   - This means the top side (Violet) will move to the front.\n   - The front side (Blue) will move to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Purple) will move to the back.\n   - The left (Pink) and right (Yellow) sides remain unchanged.\n\n   After the second rotation, the orientation is:\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Blue\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Back: Purple\n   - Left: Pink\n   - Right: Yellow\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the back side of the cube after these rotations. According to the final orientation, the back side is now Purple.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube is <<<Purple>>>."
