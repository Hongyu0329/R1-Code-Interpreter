    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Brown\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Back: Red\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Right: White\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the bottom side (Yellow) becomes the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Bottom: Brown\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Back: Red\n     - Left: Purple\n     - Right: White\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The right side (White) is rotated to become the top face.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: White\n     - Bottom: Purple\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Back: Red\n     - Left: Yellow\n     - Right: Brown\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the bottom side (Purple) to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Bottom: White\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Back: Red\n     - Left: Yellow\n     - Right: Brown\n\nAfter these rotations, the front side of the cube remains unchanged in color throughout the process.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube is <<<pink>>>."
