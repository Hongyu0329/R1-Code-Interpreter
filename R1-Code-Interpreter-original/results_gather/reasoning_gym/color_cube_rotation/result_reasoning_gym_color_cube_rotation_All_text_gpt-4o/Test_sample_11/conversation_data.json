    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Back: Purple\n   - Left: Red\n   - Right: Brown\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Red) is now on the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Bottom: Yellow\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Back: Purple\n     - Left: Yellow (previously bottom)\n     - Right: Brown\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Yellow) is rotated to become the top face.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Bottom: Red (previously top)\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Back: Purple\n     - Left: Red (previously top)\n     - Right: Brown\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The bottom face (Red) is turned to become the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Bottom: Yellow\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Back: Purple\n     - Left: Purple (previously back)\n     - Right: Brown\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Purple.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Purple>>>."
