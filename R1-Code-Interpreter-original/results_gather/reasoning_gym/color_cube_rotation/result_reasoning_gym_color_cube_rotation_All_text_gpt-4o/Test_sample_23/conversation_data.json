    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Right: Purple\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Left: Brown\n   - Back: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Orange\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the back (Indigo) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Indigo (was Back)\n     - Right: Purple (remains the same)\n     - Front: Pink (remains the same)\n     - Left: Brown (remains the same)\n     - Back: Orange (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Red (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the bottom side (Red) to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Red (was Bottom)\n     - Right: Purple (remains the same)\n     - Front: Indigo (was Top)\n     - Left: Brown (remains the same)\n     - Back: Pink (was Front)\n     - Bottom: Orange (was Back)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the bottom side of the cube is Orange.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Orange>>>."
