    "To determine the new color of the right side of the cube after the specified rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation:\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Right: Yellow\n   - Front: Indigo\n   - Left: Green\n   - Back: Pink\n   - Bottom: Purple\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the back (Pink) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Pink) moves to the top.\n   - The top side (Red) moves to the front.\n   - The front side (Indigo) moves to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Purple) moves to the back.\n   - The left side (Green) remains on the left.\n   - The right side (Yellow) remains on the right.\n\n4. **New Configuration:**\n   - Top: Pink\n   - Right: Yellow\n   - Front: Red\n   - Left: Green\n   - Back: Purple\n   - Bottom: Indigo\n\n5. **Determine the New Right Side:**\n   - After the rotation, the right side remains unchanged in terms of its position relative to the cube's orientation. Therefore, the color of the right side remains Yellow.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Yellow>>>."
