    "To determine the final color of the top side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step of the rotation process.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: White\n   - Right: Gray\n   - Front: Yellow\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Back: Green\n   - Bottom: Cyan\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the right (Gray) is now at the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Gray (was Right)\n     - Right: Cyan (was Bottom)\n     - Front: Yellow (remains Front)\n     - Left: Blue (remains Left)\n     - Back: Green (remains Back)\n     - Bottom: White (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to place its front side (Yellow) at the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Yellow (was Front)\n     - Front: White (was Bottom)\n     - Right: Cyan (remains Right)\n     - Left: Blue (remains Left)\n     - Back: Gray (was Top)\n     - Bottom: Green (was Back)\n\nAfter these two rotations, the color of the top side of the cube is Yellow.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yellow>>>."
