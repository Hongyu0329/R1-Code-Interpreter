    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is oriented initially and how it changes after the specified rotation. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation of the Cube:**\n   - Top: Violet\n   - Right: Indigo\n   - Front: Orange\n   - Left: White\n   - Back: Pink\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the back (Pink) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Understanding the Rotation:**\n   - If the back side (Pink) moves to the top, the cube is essentially rotated forward around the horizontal axis that runs from left to right.\n   - This means the top side (Violet) will move to the front.\n   - The front side (Orange) will move to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Yellow) will move to the back.\n   - The left (White) and right (Indigo) sides remain unchanged.\n\n4. **New Orientation of the Cube:**\n   - Top: Pink (was Back)\n   - Right: Indigo (unchanged)\n   - Front: Violet (was Top)\n   - Left: White (unchanged)\n   - Back: Yellow (was Bottom)\n   - Bottom: Orange (was Front)\n\n5. **Determine the Color of the Back Side:**\n   - After the rotation, the back side of the cube is now the side that was originally the bottom side.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotation is Yellow.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yellow>>>."
