    "To determine the new color of the bottom side of the cube after the specified rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation.\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top: Cyan\n   - Right: Gray\n   - Front: Green\n   - Left: Gold\n   - Back: Silver\n   - Bottom: Purple\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the left (Gold) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Understanding the Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Gold) moves to the top.\n   - The top side (Cyan) will move to the right.\n   - The right side (Gray) will move to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Purple) will move to the left.\n   - The front (Green) and back (Silver) sides remain unchanged in terms of their relative positions.\n\n4. **New Configuration After Rotation:**\n   - Top: Gold (was Left)\n   - Right: Cyan (was Top)\n   - Front: Green (remains Front)\n   - Left: Purple (was Bottom)\n   - Back: Silver (remains Back)\n   - Bottom: Gray (was Right)\n\n5. **Determine the New Bottom Side:**\n   - After the rotation, the side that was originally the right side (Gray) is now the bottom side.\n\nTherefore, the color of the bottom side of the cube after the rotation is Gray.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Gray>>>."
