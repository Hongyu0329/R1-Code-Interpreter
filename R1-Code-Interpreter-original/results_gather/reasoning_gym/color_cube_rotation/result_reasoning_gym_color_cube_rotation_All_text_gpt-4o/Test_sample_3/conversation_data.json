    "To determine the final color of the top side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Red\n   - Front: Yellow\n   - Back: Brown\n   - Left: Violet\n   - Right: Green\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the bottom side (Red) is now at the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Bottom: Indigo\n     - Front: Yellow\n     - Back: Brown\n     - Left: Violet\n     - Right: Green\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the right side (Green) to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Green\n     - Bottom: Violet\n     - Front: Yellow\n     - Back: Brown\n     - Left: Red\n     - Right: Indigo\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the left side (Red) to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Bottom: Green\n     - Front: Yellow\n     - Back: Brown\n     - Left: Indigo\n     - Right: Violet\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the top side of the cube is Red.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Red>>>."
