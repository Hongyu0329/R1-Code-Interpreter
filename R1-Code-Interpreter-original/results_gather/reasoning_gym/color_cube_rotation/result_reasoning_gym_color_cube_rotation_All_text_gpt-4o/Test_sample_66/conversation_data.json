    "To determine the final color of the top side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step of the rotation process.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Blue\n   - Right: Yellow\n   - Front: Green\n   - Left: Indigo\n   - Back: Brown\n   - Bottom: Cyan\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the right (Yellow) is now at the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Yellow (was Right)\n     - Right: Cyan (was Bottom)\n     - Front: Green (remains the same)\n     - Left: Indigo (remains the same)\n     - Back: Brown (remains the same)\n     - Bottom: Blue (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the left side (Indigo) to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Indigo (was Left)\n     - Right: Cyan (remains the same)\n     - Front: Yellow (was Top)\n     - Left: Blue (was Bottom)\n     - Back: Green (was Front)\n     - Bottom: Brown (was Back)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the top side of the cube is Indigo.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Indigo>>>."
