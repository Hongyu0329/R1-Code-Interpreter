    "To determine the color of the left side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step of the rotation process:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Right: Red\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Left: Silver\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Bottom: Gold\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the right (Red) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Right: Gold (since the bottom moves to the right)\n     - Front: Violet\n     - Left: Silver\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Bottom: Gray (since the top moves to the bottom)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Silver) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Silver\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Violet\n     - Left: Gray (since the bottom moves to the left)\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Bottom: Red (since the top moves to the bottom)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the front (Violet) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Red (since the bottom moves to the front)\n     - Left: Gray\n     - Back: Silver (since the top moves to the back)\n     - Bottom: Magenta (since the back moves to the bottom)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Gray.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Gray>>>"
