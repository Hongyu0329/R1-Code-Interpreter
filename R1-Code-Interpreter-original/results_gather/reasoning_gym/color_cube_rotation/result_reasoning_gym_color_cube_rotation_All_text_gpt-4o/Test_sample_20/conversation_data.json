    "To determine the new color of the left side of the cube after the rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation:\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top: Cyan\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n   - Front: White\n   - Back: Gray\n   - Left: Silver\n   - Right: Gold\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the bottom (Yellow) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The Yellow side, initially at the bottom, moves to the top.\n   - The Cyan side, initially at the top, moves to the bottom.\n   - The Front (White), Back (Gray), Left (Silver), and Right (Gold) sides will rotate around the vertical axis.\n\n4. **Determining the New Positions:**\n   - Since the cube is rotated such that the bottom becomes the top, the sides will shift positions accordingly.\n   - The Front (White) side will move to the position of the Left (Silver) side.\n   - The Back (Gray) side will move to the position of the Right (Gold) side.\n   - The Left (Silver) side will move to the position of the Back (Gray) side.\n   - The Right (Gold) side will move to the position of the Front (White) side.\n\n5. **New Configuration:**\n   - Top: Yellow\n   - Bottom: Cyan\n   - Front: Gold\n   - Back: Silver\n   - Left: Gray\n   - Right: White\n\nAfter the rotation, the color of the left side of the cube is Gray.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Gray>>>."
