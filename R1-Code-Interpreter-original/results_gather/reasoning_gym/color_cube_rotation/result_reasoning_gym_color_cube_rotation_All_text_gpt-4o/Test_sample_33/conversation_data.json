    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Orange\n   - Right: Purple\n   - Front: Red\n   - Left: Green\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Bottom: Blue\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the front side (Red) moves to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Red (was Front)\n     - Front: Blue (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Orange (was Top)\n     - Back: Magenta (remains the same)\n     - Right: Purple (remains the same)\n     - Left: Green (remains the same)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the back side (Magenta) to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Magenta (was Back)\n     - Back: Orange (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Blue (remains the same)\n     - Front: Red (remains the same)\n     - Right: Purple (remains the same)\n     - Left: Green (remains the same)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the back side is now Orange.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Orange>>>."
