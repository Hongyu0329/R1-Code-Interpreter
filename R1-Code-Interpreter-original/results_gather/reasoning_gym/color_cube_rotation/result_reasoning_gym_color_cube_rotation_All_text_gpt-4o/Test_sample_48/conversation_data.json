    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of rotations applied to the cube and track the position of each colored side.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Green\n   - Bottom: Red\n   - Front: Gray\n   - Back: White\n   - Left: Yellow\n   - Right: Pink\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the front (Gray) is now at the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Gray (was Front)\n     - Bottom: Red (remains the same)\n     - Front: Red (was Bottom)\n     - Back: Green (was Top)\n     - Left: Yellow (remains the same)\n     - Right: Pink (remains the same)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated again to bring the front side (currently Red) to the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Red (was Front)\n     - Bottom: Green (was Back)\n     - Front: Pink (was Right)\n     - Back: Yellow (was Left)\n     - Left: Gray (was Top)\n     - Right: White (was Back)\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the back side of the cube after these rotations.\n\nThe back side is now Yellow.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Yellow>>>"
