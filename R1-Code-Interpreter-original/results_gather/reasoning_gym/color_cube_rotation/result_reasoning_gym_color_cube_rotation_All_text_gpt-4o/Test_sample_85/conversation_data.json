    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Left: Cyan\n   - Back: Gray\n   - Bottom: White\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the right (Gold) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Gold\n     - Right: White (since the bottom becomes the right)\n     - Front: Violet\n     - Left: Cyan\n     - Back: Gray\n     - Bottom: Red (since the top becomes the bottom)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the front side (Violet) to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Right: White\n     - Front: Red (since the bottom becomes the front)\n     - Left: Cyan\n     - Back: Gold (since the top becomes the back)\n     - Bottom: Gray\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The cube is turned to make the left face (Cyan) the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Cyan\n     - Right: White\n     - Front: Red\n     - Left: Gray (since the bottom becomes the left)\n     - Back: Gold\n     - Bottom: Violet\n\nAfter these rotations, we need to determine the color of the left side of the cube. According to the final orientation, the left side is now Gray.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube is <<<Gray>>>."
