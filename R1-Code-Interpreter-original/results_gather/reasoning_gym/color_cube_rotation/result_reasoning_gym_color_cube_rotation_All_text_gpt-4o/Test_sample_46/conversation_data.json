    "To determine the new color of the front side of the cube after the rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation:\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top side: Pink\n   - Right side: Brown\n   - Front side: Gold\n   - Left side: Gray\n   - Back side: Indigo\n   - Bottom side: Yellow\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the front (Gold) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The Gold side, which was initially at the front, moves to the top.\n   - The Pink side, which was initially at the top, will move to the back.\n   - The Indigo side, which was initially at the back, will move to the bottom.\n   - The Yellow side, which was initially at the bottom, will move to the front.\n   - The Brown side (right) and Gray side (left) remain unchanged in their positions.\n\n4. **New Configuration:**\n   - Top side: Gold\n   - Right side: Brown\n   - Front side: Yellow\n   - Left side: Gray\n   - Back side: Pink\n   - Bottom side: Indigo\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - After the rotation, the color of the front side of the cube is Yellow.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Yellow>>>"
