    "To determine the new color of the left side of the cube after the rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation.\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top: Orange\n   - Right: White\n   - Front: Red\n   - Left: Indigo\n   - Back: Green\n   - Bottom: Gold\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the right (White) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The right side (White) moves to the top.\n   - The top side (Orange) moves to the left.\n   - The left side (Indigo) moves to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Gold) moves to the right.\n   - The front (Red) and back (Green) sides remain unchanged.\n\n4. **New Configuration:**\n   - Top: White (was Right)\n   - Right: Gold (was Bottom)\n   - Front: Red (unchanged)\n   - Left: Orange (was Top)\n   - Back: Green (unchanged)\n   - Bottom: Indigo (was Left)\n\n5. **Determine the New Left Side:**\n   - After the rotation, the left side of the cube is now the side that was originally the top side, which is Orange.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube after the rotation is Orange.\n\n<<<Orange>>>"
