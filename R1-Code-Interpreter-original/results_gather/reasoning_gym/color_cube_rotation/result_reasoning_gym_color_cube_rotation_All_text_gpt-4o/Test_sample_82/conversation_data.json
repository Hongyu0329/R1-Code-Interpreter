    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Silver\n   - Bottom: Purple\n   - Front: Magenta\n   - Back: Gold\n   - Left: Violet\n   - Right: Brown\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Violet) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Bottom: Purple\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Back: Gold\n     - Left: Purple (was bottom)\n     - Right: Silver (was top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Purple) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Bottom: Violet (was top)\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Back: Gold\n     - Left: Gold (was back)\n     - Right: Magenta (was front)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Magenta) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Magenta\n     - Bottom: Violet\n     - Front: Gold (was left)\n     - Back: Purple (was bottom)\n     - Left: Violet (was bottom)\n     - Right: Gold (was back)\n\nAfter these rotations, the top side of the cube is now Magenta.\n\n<<<Magenta>>>"
