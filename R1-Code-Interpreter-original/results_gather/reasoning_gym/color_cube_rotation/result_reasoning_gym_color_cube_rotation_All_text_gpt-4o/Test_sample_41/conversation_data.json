    "To determine the new color of the left side of the cube after the specified rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation.\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top side: Cyan\n   - Right side: Red\n   - Front side: Orange\n   - Left side: Magenta\n   - Back side: Silver\n   - Bottom side: Purple\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was previously at the left (Magenta) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The Magenta side moves from the left to the top.\n   - The Cyan side, which was originally on the top, will move to the opposite side of the Magenta, which is now the bottom.\n   - The other sides will shift accordingly:\n     - The Orange front side remains in the front.\n     - The Silver back side remains in the back.\n     - The Red right side remains on the right.\n     - The side that was originally on the bottom (Purple) will now move to the left.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - After the rotation, the left side of the cube is now the side that was originally on the bottom.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube after the rotation is Purple.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Purple>>>."
