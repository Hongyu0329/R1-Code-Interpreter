    "To determine the new color of the top side of the cube after the rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation:\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top side: Brown\n   - Bottom side: Blue\n   - Front side: White\n   - Back side: Red\n   - Left side: Pink\n   - Right side: Orange\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the bottom is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Blue) moves to the top.\n   - The top side (Brown) moves to the bottom.\n   - The front, back, left, and right sides remain unchanged in terms of their relative positions to each other, but they all rotate around the horizontal axis.\n\n4. **New Configuration:**\n   - Top side: Blue (since the bottom side moved to the top)\n   - Bottom side: Brown (since the top side moved to the bottom)\n   - The other sides (front, back, left, right) maintain their relative positions but are rotated around the horizontal axis.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - After the rotation, the color of the top side of the cube is Blue.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Blue>>>"
