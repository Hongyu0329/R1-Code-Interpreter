    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Violet\n   - Bottom: Cyan\n   - Front: Purple\n   - Back: Gold\n   - Left: Magenta\n   - Right: White\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the bottom side (Cyan) becomes the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Cyan\n     - Bottom: Violet (since the top and bottom swap places)\n     - Front: Purple (remains unchanged)\n     - Back: Gold (remains unchanged)\n     - Left: Magenta (remains unchanged)\n     - Right: White (remains unchanged)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the left side (Magenta) to the top.\n   - This is a 90-degree rotation around the front-back axis.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Magenta\n     - Bottom: White (since the right side becomes the bottom)\n     - Front: Purple (remains unchanged)\n     - Back: Gold (remains unchanged)\n     - Left: Violet (since the top becomes the left)\n     - Right: Cyan (since the bottom becomes the right)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Gold) is rotated to become the top.\n   - This is a 90-degree rotation around the left-right axis.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Gold\n     - Bottom: Purple (since the front becomes the bottom)\n     - Front: Magenta (since the top becomes the front)\n     - Back: White (since the bottom becomes the back)\n     - Left: Violet (remains unchanged)\n     - Right: Cyan (remains unchanged)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Violet.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Violet>>>."
