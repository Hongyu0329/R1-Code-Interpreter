    "To determine the new color of the front side of the cube after the specified rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation.\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: Blue\n   - Left: Violet\n   - Back: Red\n   - Bottom: Gold\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the right (Cyan) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Cyan) moves to the top.\n   - The top side (Indigo) moves to the left.\n   - The left side (Violet) moves to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Gold) moves to the right.\n   - The front side (Blue) and the back side (Red) remain unchanged in their positions.\n\n4. **New Configuration:**\n   - Top: Cyan (was Right)\n   - Right: Gold (was Bottom)\n   - Front: Blue (remains the same)\n   - Left: Indigo (was Top)\n   - Back: Red (remains the same)\n   - Bottom: Violet (was Left)\n\n5. **Determine the New Front Side:**\n   - After the rotation, the front side remains unchanged in its position and color.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube after the rotation is Blue.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Blue>>>."
