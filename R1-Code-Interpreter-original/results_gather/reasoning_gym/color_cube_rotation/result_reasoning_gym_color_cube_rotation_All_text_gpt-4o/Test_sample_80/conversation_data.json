    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Brown\n   - Right: Orange\n   - Front: Red\n   - Left: Yellow\n   - Back: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Green\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the front side (Red) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Right: Orange\n     - Front: Green (since the bottom becomes the front)\n     - Left: Yellow\n     - Back: Brown (since the top becomes the back)\n     - Bottom: Indigo (since the back becomes the bottom)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to place its back side (Brown) at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Brown\n     - Right: Orange\n     - Front: Red (since the top becomes the front)\n     - Left: Yellow\n     - Back: Indigo\n     - Bottom: Green\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The cube is turned to make the back (Indigo) face the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Right: Orange\n     - Front: Brown (since the top becomes the front)\n     - Left: Yellow\n     - Back: Green (since the bottom becomes the back)\n     - Bottom: Red (since the front becomes the bottom)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the front side of the cube is Brown.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Brown>>>."
