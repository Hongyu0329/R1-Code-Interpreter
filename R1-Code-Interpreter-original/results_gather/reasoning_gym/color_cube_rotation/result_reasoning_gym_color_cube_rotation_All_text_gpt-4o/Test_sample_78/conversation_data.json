    "To determine the new color of the top side of the cube after the rotation, we need to carefully analyze the initial configuration and the effect of the rotation:\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top side: Indigo\n   - Bottom side: Magenta\n   - Right side: Red\n   - Left side: Blue\n   - Front side: Orange\n   - Back side: Cyan\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the bottom (Magenta) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Effect of the Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Magenta) moves to the top.\n   - Consequently, the top side (Indigo) moves to the bottom.\n   - The other sides (right, left, front, back) will shift positions, but since the question only asks for the new top side, we don't need to determine their new positions.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - After the rotation, the top side of the cube is now the side that was originally at the bottom, which is Magenta.\n\nTherefore, the color of the top side of the cube after the rotation is:\n\n<<<magenta>>>"
