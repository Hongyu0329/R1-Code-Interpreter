    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is oriented initially and how it changes after the specified rotation. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation of the Cube:**\n   - Top side: White\n   - Right side: Pink\n   - Front side: Indigo\n   - Left side: Red\n   - Back side: Violet\n   - Bottom side: Orange\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the back (Violet) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Understanding the Rotation:**\n   - If the back side (Violet) moves to the top, the top side (White) must move to the bottom.\n   - The other sides will adjust accordingly, but for this question, we only need to determine the new bottom side.\n\n4. **New Orientation of the Cube:**\n   - Top side: Violet (since the back side moved to the top)\n   - Bottom side: White (since the top side moved to the bottom)\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - After the rotation, the color of the bottom side of the cube is White.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<white>>>"
