    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and understand how the rotation affects the position of each side. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position of the Cube:**\n   - Top: Green\n   - Right: Orange\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Left: Indigo\n   - Back: Yellow\n   - Bottom: Red\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the left (Indigo) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Understanding the Rotation:**\n   - When the left side (Indigo) moves to the top, the top side (Green) will move to the right.\n   - The right side (Orange) will move to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Red) will move to the left.\n   - The front side (Silver) and the back side (Yellow) will remain in their respective positions.\n\n4. **New Position of Each Side:**\n   - Top: Indigo (was Left)\n   - Right: Green (was Top)\n   - Front: Silver (remains Front)\n   - Left: Red (was Bottom)\n   - Back: Yellow (remains Back)\n   - Bottom: Orange (was Right)\n\n5. **Determine the Color of the Back Side:**\n   - After the rotation, the back side remains the same as it was initially.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotation is Yellow.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yellow>>>."
