    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is oriented initially and how it changes after the rotation.\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Purple\n   - Right: Yellow\n   - Front: Orange\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Back: Cyan\n   - Bottom: Red\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the front side (Orange) moves to the top.\n\n3. **Understanding the Rotation:**\n   - When the front side (Orange) moves to the top, the top side (Purple) will move to the back.\n   - The right side (Yellow) and left side (Blue) remain unchanged in their relative positions.\n   - The back side (Cyan) will move to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Red) will move to the front.\n\n4. **New Orientation After Rotation:**\n   - Top: Orange (was Front)\n   - Right: Yellow (unchanged)\n   - Front: Red (was Bottom)\n   - Left: Blue (unchanged)\n   - Back: Purple (was Top)\n   - Bottom: Cyan (was Back)\n\n5. **Determine the Color of the Back Side:**\n   - After the rotation, the back side is now the color that was originally on the top.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotation is Purple.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Purple>>>."
