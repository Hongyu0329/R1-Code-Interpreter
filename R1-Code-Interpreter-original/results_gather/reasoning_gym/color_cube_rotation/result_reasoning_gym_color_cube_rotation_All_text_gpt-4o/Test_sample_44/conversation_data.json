    "To determine the color of the back side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step of the rotation process.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Right: Indigo\n   - Front: Cyan\n   - Left: Green\n   - Back: Orange\n   - Bottom: Brown\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the front side (Cyan) moves to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Cyan (was Front)\n     - Front: Brown (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Gray (was Top)\n     - Back: Orange (remains the same)\n     - Left: Green (remains the same)\n     - Right: Indigo (remains the same)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated to bring the left side (Green) to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Green (was Left)\n     - Left: Gray (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Indigo (was Right)\n     - Right: Cyan (was Top)\n     - Front: Brown (remains the same)\n     - Back: Orange (remains the same)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the back side of the cube is Orange.\n\n<<<Orange>>>"
