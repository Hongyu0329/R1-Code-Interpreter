    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and understand how the rotation affects the position of each side. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position of the Cube:**\n   - Top: White\n   - Right: Pink\n   - Front: Gold\n   - Left: Gray\n   - Back: Green\n   - Bottom: Brown\n\n2. **Rotation Description:**\n   - The cube is rotated such that the side which was at the left (Gray) is now at the top.\n\n3. **Understanding the Rotation:**\n   - If the left side (Gray) moves to the top, the cube is rotated around the axis that runs from the front to the back.\n   - This means the top (White) will move to the right side.\n   - The right side (Pink) will move to the bottom.\n   - The bottom (Brown) will move to the left side.\n   - The left side (Gray) moves to the top.\n   - The front (Gold) and back (Green) sides remain unchanged in their positions.\n\n4. **New Position of the Cube:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Right: White\n   - Front: Gold\n   - Left: Brown\n   - Back: Green\n   - Bottom: Pink\n\n5. **Determine the Color of the Front Side:**\n   - After the rotation, the front side remains unchanged in its position.\n   - Initially, the front side was Gold.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube after the rotation is still Gold.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Gold>>>."
