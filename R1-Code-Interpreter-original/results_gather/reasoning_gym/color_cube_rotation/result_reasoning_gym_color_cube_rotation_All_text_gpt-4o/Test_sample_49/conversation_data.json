    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube through each of the described rotations. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Magenta\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: Green\n   - Left: Gray\n   - Back: White\n   - Bottom: Violet\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Gray) is now on the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Gray\n     - Right: Cyan\n     - Front: Green\n     - Left: Violet (since the bottom becomes the left)\n     - Back: White\n     - Bottom: Magenta (since the top becomes the bottom)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The front (Green) is turned to face the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Green\n     - Right: Cyan\n     - Front: Magenta (since the bottom becomes the front)\n     - Left: Violet\n     - Back: Gray (since the top becomes the back)\n     - Bottom: White (since the back becomes the bottom)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Violet) is brought to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Right: Green (since the front becomes the right)\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Left: White (since the bottom becomes the left)\n     - Back: Gray\n     - Bottom: Cyan (since the right becomes the bottom)\n\nAfter following these steps, the color of the bottom side of the cube is Cyan.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Cyan>>>."
