    "To determine the final color of the top side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to carefully analyze each step of the rotation process.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Blue\n   - Right: Silver\n   - Front: Gold\n   - Left: Pink\n   - Back: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Magenta\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the front side (Gold) becomes the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Gold (was Front)\n     - Right: Silver\n     - Front: Magenta (was Bottom)\n     - Left: Pink\n     - Back: Indigo\n     - Bottom: Blue (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Silver) is rotated to become the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Silver (was Right)\n     - Right: Blue (was Bottom)\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Left: Gold (was Top)\n     - Back: Indigo\n     - Bottom: Pink (was Left)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the top side of the cube is Silver.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Silver>>>."
