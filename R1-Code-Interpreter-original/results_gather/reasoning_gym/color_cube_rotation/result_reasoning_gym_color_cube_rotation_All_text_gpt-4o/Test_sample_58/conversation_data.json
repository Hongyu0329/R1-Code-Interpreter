    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Back: Brown\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the left (Blue) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Blue (was Left)\n     - Right: Gold (unchanged)\n     - Front: Silver (unchanged)\n     - Left: Yellow (was Bottom)\n     - Back: Brown (unchanged)\n     - Bottom: Red (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is turned to make the right face (Gold) the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Gold (was Right)\n     - Right: Red (was Bottom)\n     - Front: Silver (unchanged)\n     - Left: Blue (was Top)\n     - Back: Brown (unchanged)\n     - Bottom: Yellow (was Left)\n\nAfter these rotations, we need to determine the color of the back side of the cube. From the final orientation, the back side remains unchanged from the initial orientation, which is Brown.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube is:\n\n<<<Brown>>>"
