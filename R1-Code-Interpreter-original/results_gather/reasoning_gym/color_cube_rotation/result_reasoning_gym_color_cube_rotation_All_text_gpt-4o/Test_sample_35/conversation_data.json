    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and understand how the rotations affect the positions of the colored sides. Let's go through the steps one by one:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Brown\n   - Right: Yellow\n   - Front: Orange\n   - Left: Red\n   - Back: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Violet\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the right (Yellow) is now at the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Yellow (was Right)\n     - Right: Violet (was Bottom)\n     - Front: Orange (remains Front)\n     - Left: Red (remains Left)\n     - Back: Indigo (remains Back)\n     - Bottom: Brown (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The cube is turned to make the front (Orange) face the top.\n   - After this rotation:\n     - Top: Orange (was Front)\n     - Front: Brown (was Bottom)\n     - Right: Violet (remains Right)\n     - Left: Yellow (was Top)\n     - Back: Yellow (was Top)\n     - Bottom: Indigo (was Back)\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the left side of the cube after these rotations. From the final position after the second rotation, the left side is Yellow.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube is <<<Yellow>>>."
