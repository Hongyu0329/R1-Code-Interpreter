    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the rotation of the cube and how it affects the position of the sides.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Pink\n- Right: Brown\n- Front: Gold\n- Left: Gray\n- Back: Indigo\n- Bottom: Yellow\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the front side (Gold) moves to the top. This means the top side (Pink) will move to the back, and the bottom side (Yellow) will move to the front. The left and right sides remain unchanged.\n\nLet's summarize the new positions after the rotation:\n- Top: Gold (was Front)\n- Right: Brown\n- Front: Yellow (was Bottom)\n- Left: Gray\n- Back: Pink (was Top)\n- Bottom: Indigo (was Back)\n\nNow, we can determine the color of the front side after the rotation, which is Yellow.\n\n<<<Yellow>>>"
