    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Right: Green\n   - Front: Magenta\n   - Left: Orange\n   - Back: Violet\n   - Bottom: Gray\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Orange) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Orange\n     - Right: Green\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Left: Gray (previously bottom)\n     - Back: Violet\n     - Bottom: Red (previously top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Violet) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Right: Green\n     - Front: Orange (previously top)\n     - Left: Gray\n     - Back: Red (previously bottom)\n     - Bottom: Magenta (previously front)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Gray) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Gray\n     - Right: Green\n     - Front: Orange\n     - Left: Magenta (previously bottom)\n     - Back: Red\n     - Bottom: Violet (previously top)\n\nAfter these rotations, the left side of the cube is now the side that was previously the bottom side after the second rotation, which was Magenta.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube is Magenta.\n\n<<<Magenta>>>"
