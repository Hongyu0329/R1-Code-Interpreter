    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Silver\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Left: Green\n   - Back: Purple\n   - Bottom: Brown\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Green) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Green\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Violet\n     - Left: Brown (since the bottom side moves to the left)\n     - Back: Purple\n     - Bottom: Silver (since the top side moves to the bottom)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the front (Violet) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Silver (since the bottom side moves to the front)\n     - Left: Brown\n     - Back: Green (since the top side moves to the back)\n     - Bottom: Purple (since the back side moves to the bottom)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the back (Green) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Green\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Left: Brown\n     - Back: Purple\n     - Bottom: Violet (since the top side moves to the bottom)\n\nAfter these rotations, the left side of the cube is Brown.\n\n<<<Brown>>>"
