    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the sequence of rotations and how they affect the orientation of the cube's sides.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following orientation:\n- Top: Green\n- Right: Pink\n- Front: Gray\n- Left: Yellow\n- Back: White\n- Bottom: Red\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The front side (Gray) is rotated to the top.\n- This means the top side (Green) moves to the back.\n- The back side (White) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (Red) moves to the front.\n- The left (Yellow) and right (Pink) sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the orientation is:\n- Top: Gray\n- Right: Pink\n- Front: Red\n- Left: Yellow\n- Back: Green\n- Bottom: White\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The front side (Red) is rotated to the top.\n- This means the top side (Gray) moves to the back.\n- The back side (Green) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (White) moves to the front.\n- The left (Yellow) and right (Pink) sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the orientation is:\n- Top: Red\n- Right: Pink\n- Front: White\n- Left: Yellow\n- Back: Gray\n- Bottom: Green\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the back side of the cube after these rotations. According to the final orientation, the back side is Gray.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotations is:\n\n<<<gray>>>"
