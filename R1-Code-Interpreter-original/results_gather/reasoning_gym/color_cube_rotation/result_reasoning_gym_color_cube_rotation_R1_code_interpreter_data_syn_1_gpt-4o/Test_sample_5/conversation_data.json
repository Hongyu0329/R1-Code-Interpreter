    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the sequence of rotations and how they affect the orientation of the cube's sides.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Pink\n- Right: Green\n- Front: Violet\n- Left: Purple\n- Back: Silver\n- Bottom: White\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The cube is rotated so that the side which was at the back (Silver) is now at the top.\n- After this rotation, the configuration is:\n  - Top: Silver\n  - Right: Green\n  - Front: Violet\n  - Left: Purple\n  - Back: White (since the bottom becomes the back)\n  - Bottom: Pink (since the top becomes the bottom)\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The cube is rotated again to bring the back side (White) to the top.\n- After this rotation, the configuration is:\n  - Top: White\n  - Right: Green\n  - Front: Silver (since the top becomes the front)\n  - Left: Purple\n  - Back: Pink (since the bottom becomes the back)\n  - Bottom: Violet (since the front becomes the bottom)\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the right side of the cube after these rotations. The right side remains unchanged through these rotations, so it remains Green.\n\nTherefore, the color of the right side of the cube is:\n\n<<<green>>>"
