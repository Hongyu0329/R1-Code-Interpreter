    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how the sides are affected by this rotation.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Purple\n- Right: Yellow\n- Front: Orange\n- Left: Blue\n- Back: Cyan\n- Bottom: Red\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the front side (Orange) moves to the top. This is equivalent to rotating the cube around the horizontal axis that runs from left to right.\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The top side becomes Orange (previously the front side).\n- The front side becomes Red (previously the bottom side).\n- The bottom side becomes Purple (previously the top side).\n- The back side becomes the previous top side, which was Purple.\n\nNow, let's determine the new color of the back side:\n- Initially, the back side was Cyan.\n- After the rotation, the back side becomes the previous top side, which was Purple.\n\nTherefore, the new color of the back side is Purple.\n\n<<<Purple>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a purple top side\n- a yellow right side\n- a orange front side\n- a blue left side\n- a cyan back side\n- a red bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the front is now at the top.\n\nWhat is now the color of the back side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
