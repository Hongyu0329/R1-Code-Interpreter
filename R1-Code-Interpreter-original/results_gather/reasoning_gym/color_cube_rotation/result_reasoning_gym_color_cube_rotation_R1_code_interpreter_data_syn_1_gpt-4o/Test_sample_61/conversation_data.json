    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes a series of rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Brown\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Back: Red\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Right: White\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Yellow) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Bottom: Brown\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Back: Red\n     - Left: Purple\n     - Right: White\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The right side (White) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: White\n     - Bottom: Purple\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Back: Red\n     - Left: Yellow\n     - Right: Brown\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Purple) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Bottom: White\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Back: Red\n     - Left: Yellow\n     - Right: Brown\n\nAfter these rotations, the front side of the cube remains Pink.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube is:\n\n<<<pink>>>"
