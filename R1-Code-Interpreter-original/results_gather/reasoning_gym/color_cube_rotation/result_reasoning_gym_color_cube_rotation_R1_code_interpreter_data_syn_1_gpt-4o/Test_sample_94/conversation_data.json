    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Silver\n   - Right: White\n   - Front: Red\n   - Left: Magenta\n   - Back: Orange\n   - Bottom: Purple\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Red) is rotated to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Front: Purple (previously bottom)\n     - Bottom: Silver (previously top)\n     - Back: Orange\n     - Left: Magenta\n     - Right: White\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Magenta) is rotated to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Magenta\n     - Left: Silver (previously bottom)\n     - Bottom: Red (previously top)\n     - Right: White\n     - Front: Purple\n     - Back: Orange\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Purple) is rotated to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Front: Red (previously bottom)\n     - Bottom: Magenta (previously top)\n     - Back: Orange\n     - Left: Silver\n     - Right: White\n\nAfter these rotations, the left side of the cube is now Silver.\n\n<<<Silver>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a silver top side\n- a white right side\n- a red front side\n- a magenta left side\n- a orange back side\n- a purple bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the front is now at the top.\n\nNext, the left side is rotated to become the top face.\n\nThen the cube is rotated to bring the front side to the top.\n\nWhat is now the color of the left side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
