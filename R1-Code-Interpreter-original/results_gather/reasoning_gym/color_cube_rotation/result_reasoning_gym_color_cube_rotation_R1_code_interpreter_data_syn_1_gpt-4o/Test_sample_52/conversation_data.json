    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Green\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Back: White\n   - Bottom: Purple\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Blue) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Blue\n     - Right: Cyan\n     - Front: Violet\n     - Left: Purple (since the bottom moves to the left)\n     - Back: White\n     - Bottom: Green (since the top moves to the bottom)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Green) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Green\n     - Right: Cyan\n     - Front: Blue (since the top moves to the front)\n     - Left: Purple\n     - Back: White\n     - Bottom: Violet (since the front moves to the bottom)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The back side (White) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: White\n     - Right: Cyan\n     - Front: Green (since the top moves to the front)\n     - Left: Purple\n     - Back: Violet (since the bottom moves to the back)\n     - Bottom: Blue (since the front moves to the bottom)\n\nAfter these rotations, the left side of the cube is Purple.\n\n<<<Purple>>>"
