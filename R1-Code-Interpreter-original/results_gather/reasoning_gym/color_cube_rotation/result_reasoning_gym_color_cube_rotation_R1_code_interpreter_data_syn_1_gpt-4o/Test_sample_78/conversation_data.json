    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the initial orientation of the cube and how the rotation affects it. Initially, the cube has the following orientation:\n\n- Top: Indigo\n- Bottom: Magenta\n- Right: Red\n- Left: Blue\n- Front: Orange\n- Back: Cyan\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the side which was at the bottom (Magenta) is now at the top. This means the cube is flipped upside down. After this rotation, the new orientation of the cube will be:\n\n- Top: Magenta (was Bottom)\n- Bottom: Indigo (was Top)\n- Right: Red\n- Left: Blue\n- Front: Orange\n- Back: Cyan\n\nThe question asks for the color of the top side after the rotation. Based on the new orientation, the top side is now Magenta.\n\n<<<Magenta>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a indigo top side\n- a red right side\n- a orange front side\n- a blue left side\n- a cyan back side\n- a magenta bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the bottom is now at the top.\n\nWhat is now the color of the top side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
