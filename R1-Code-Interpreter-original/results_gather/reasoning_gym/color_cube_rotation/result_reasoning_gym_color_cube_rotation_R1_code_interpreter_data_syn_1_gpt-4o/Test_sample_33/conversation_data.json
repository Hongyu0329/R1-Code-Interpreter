    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes the specified rotations.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Orange\n- Right: Purple\n- Front: Red\n- Left: Green\n- Back: Magenta\n- Bottom: Blue\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The front side (Red) is moved to the top.\n- The top side (Orange) moves to the back.\n- The back side (Magenta) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (Blue) moves to the front.\n- The left (Green) and right (Purple) sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Red\n- Right: Purple\n- Front: Blue\n- Left: Green\n- Back: Orange\n- Bottom: Magenta\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The back side (Orange) is moved to the top.\n- The top side (Red) moves to the front.\n- The front side (Blue) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (Magenta) moves to the back.\n- The left (Green) and right (Purple) sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Orange\n- Right: Purple\n- Front: Red\n- Left: Green\n- Back: Magenta\n- Bottom: Blue\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the back side of the cube after these rotations. From the final configuration, the back side is Magenta.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube is:\n\n<<<magenta>>>"
