    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and its rotations step by step.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Red\n- Right: Gold\n- Front: Silver\n- Left: Blue\n- Back: Brown\n- Bottom: Yellow\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The side that was on the left (Blue) is now on the top.\n- The top (Red) moves to the right.\n- The right (Gold) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom (Yellow) moves to the left.\n- The left (Blue) moves to the top.\n- The front (Silver) and back (Brown) remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Blue\n- Right: Red\n- Front: Silver\n- Left: Yellow\n- Back: Brown\n- Bottom: Gold\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The side that was on the right (Red) is now on the top.\n- The top (Blue) moves to the back.\n- The back (Brown) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom (Gold) moves to the front.\n- The front (Silver) moves to the right.\n- The left (Yellow) remains unchanged.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Red\n- Right: Silver\n- Front: Gold\n- Left: Yellow\n- Back: Blue\n- Bottom: Brown\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the back side of the cube after these rotations. According to the final configuration, the back side is Blue.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotations is:\n\n<<<Blue>>>"
