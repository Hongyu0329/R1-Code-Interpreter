    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes the specified rotations.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Purple\n- Bottom: Cyan\n- Front: Indigo\n- Back: Brown\n- Left: Red\n- Right: Violet\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The bottom side (Cyan) is moved to the top.\n- The top side (Purple) moves to the bottom.\n- The front, back, left, and right sides remain in their respective positions.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Cyan\n- Bottom: Purple\n- Front: Indigo\n- Back: Brown\n- Left: Red\n- Right: Violet\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The back side (Brown) is moved to the top.\n- The top side (Cyan) moves to the front.\n- The front side (Indigo) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (Purple) moves to the back.\n- The left and right sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Brown\n- Bottom: Indigo\n- Front: Cyan\n- Back: Purple\n- Left: Red\n- Right: Violet\n\nThe color of the bottom side after these rotations is Indigo.\n\n<<<indigo>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a purple top side\n- a violet right side\n- a indigo front side\n- a red left side\n- a brown back side\n- a cyan bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the bottom is now at the top.\n\nThen the cube is rotated to bring the back side to the top.\n\nWhat is now the color of the bottom side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
