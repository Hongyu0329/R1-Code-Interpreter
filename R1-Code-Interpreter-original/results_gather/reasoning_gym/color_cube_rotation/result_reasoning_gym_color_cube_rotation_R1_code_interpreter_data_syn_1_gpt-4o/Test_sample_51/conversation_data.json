    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how the sides are repositioned after the rotation.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Cyan\n- Right: Gold\n- Front: Yellow\n- Left: White\n- Back: Gray\n- Bottom: Magenta\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the back side (Gray) moves to the top. This means the cube is rotated forward. After this rotation, the new positions of the sides are:\n- Top: Gray (since the back side moved to the top)\n- Front: Cyan (since the top side moved to the front)\n- Bottom: Yellow (since the front side moved to the bottom)\n- Back: Magenta (since the bottom side moved to the back)\n- Left: White (remains unchanged)\n- Right: Gold (remains unchanged)\n\nThe right side of the cube remains unchanged during this rotation, so the color of the right side is still Gold.\n\nTherefore, the color of the right side of the cube after the rotation is Gold.\n\n<<<Gold>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a cyan top side\n- a gold right side\n- a yellow front side\n- a white left side\n- a gray back side\n- a magenta bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the back is now at the top.\n\nWhat is now the color of the right side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
