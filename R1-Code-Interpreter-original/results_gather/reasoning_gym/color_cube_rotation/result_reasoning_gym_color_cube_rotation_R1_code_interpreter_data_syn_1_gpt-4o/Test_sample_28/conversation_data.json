    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how the colors of the sides change as a result of this rotation.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Gold\n- Right: Brown\n- Front: Cyan\n- Left: Magenta\n- Back: Green\n- Bottom: Purple\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the side which was previously on the right (Brown) is now on the top. This implies a rotation around the front-back axis.\n\nLet's visualize the rotation:\n1. The right side (Brown) moves to the top.\n2. The top side (Gold) moves to the left.\n3. The left side (Magenta) moves to the bottom.\n4. The bottom side (Purple) moves to the right.\n\nAfter the rotation, the new configuration of the cube is:\n- Top: Brown\n- Right: Purple\n- Front: Cyan\n- Left: Gold\n- Back: Green\n- Bottom: Magenta\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the left side after the rotation. According to the new configuration, the left side is now Gold.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube after the rotation is Gold.\n\n<<<Gold>>>"
