    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how the sides are affected by this rotation.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Green\n- Right: Yellow\n- Front: Gray\n- Left: Indigo\n- Back: Silver\n- Bottom: White\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the side which was on the left (Indigo) is now on the top. This means the cube is rotated 90 degrees around the axis that goes from the front to the back.\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The Indigo side (Left) moves to the Top.\n- The Green side (Top) moves to the Right.\n- The Yellow side (Right) moves to the Bottom.\n- The White side (Bottom) moves to the Left.\n- The Gray side (Front) remains at the Front.\n- The Silver side (Back) remains at the Back.\n\nThus, the color of the front side remains unchanged after this rotation.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube is still Gray.\n\n<<<Gray>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a green top side\n- a yellow right side\n- a gray front side\n- a indigo left side\n- a silver back side\n- a white bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the left is now at the top.\n\nWhat is now the color of the front side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
