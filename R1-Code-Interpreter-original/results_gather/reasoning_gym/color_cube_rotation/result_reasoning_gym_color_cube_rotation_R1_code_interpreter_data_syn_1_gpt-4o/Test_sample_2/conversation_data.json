    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the sequence of rotations applied to the cube and track the position of each colored side.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Indigo\n- Bottom: Pink\n- Front: White\n- Back: Violet\n- Left: Brown\n- Right: Gold\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The cube is rotated so that the bottom side (Pink) is now at the top.\n- New configuration:\n  - Top: Pink\n  - Bottom: Indigo\n  - Front: White\n  - Back: Violet\n  - Left: Brown\n  - Right: Gold\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The cube is rotated to bring the right side (Gold) to the top.\n- To achieve this, the cube is rotated around the front-back axis.\n- New configuration:\n  - Top: Gold\n  - Bottom: Brown\n  - Front: White\n  - Back: Violet\n  - Left: Pink\n  - Right: Indigo\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the right side of the cube after these rotations. According to the final configuration, the right side is now the Indigo side.\n\nTherefore, the color of the right side of the cube after the rotations is Indigo.\n\n<<<Indigo>>>"
