    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes a series of rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Blue\n   - Right: Brown\n   - Front: Purple\n   - Left: Indigo\n   - Back: Gray\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Indigo) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Right: Brown\n     - Front: Purple\n     - Left: Yellow (previously bottom)\n     - Back: Gray\n     - Bottom: Blue (previously top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Gray) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Gray\n     - Right: Brown\n     - Front: Indigo (previously top)\n     - Left: Yellow\n     - Back: Blue (previously bottom)\n     - Bottom: Purple (previously front)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Yellow) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Right: Brown\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Left: Purple (previously bottom)\n     - Back: Blue\n     - Bottom: Gray (previously top)\n\nAfter these rotations, the front side of the cube is now Indigo.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube is:\n\n<<<indigo>>>"
