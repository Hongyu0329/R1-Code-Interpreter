    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes a series of rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Right: Purple\n   - Front: Magenta\n   - Left: Orange\n   - Back: Yellow\n   - Bottom: Pink\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Purple) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Right: Pink (previously bottom)\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Back: Yellow\n     - Bottom: Gray (previously top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Gray) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Gray\n     - Right: Pink\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Back: Yellow\n     - Bottom: Purple (previously top)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Yellow) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Right: Pink\n     - Front: Gray (previously top)\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Back: Purple (previously bottom)\n     - Bottom: Magenta (previously front)\n\nAfter these rotations, we need to determine the color of the left side of the cube. According to the final positions, the left side remains Orange.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube is Orange.\n\n<<<Orange>>>"
