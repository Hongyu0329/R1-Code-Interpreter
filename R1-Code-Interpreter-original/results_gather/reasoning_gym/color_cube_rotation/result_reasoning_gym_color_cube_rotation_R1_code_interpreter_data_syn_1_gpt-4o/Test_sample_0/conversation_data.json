    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and its rotations step by step.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Cyan\n- Bottom: Gold\n- Front: Purple\n- Back: Magenta\n- Left: Orange\n- Right: Green\n\n**Step 1: Rotate the cube so that the bottom side (Gold) is now at the top.**\n\nAfter this rotation, the configuration will be:\n- Top: Gold (was Bottom)\n- Bottom: Cyan (was Top)\n- Front: Purple (remains the same)\n- Back: Magenta (remains the same)\n- Left: Orange (remains the same)\n- Right: Green (remains the same)\n\n**Step 2: Turn the cube to make the right face (Green) the top.**\n\nAfter this rotation, the configuration will be:\n- Top: Green (was Right)\n- Bottom: Orange (was Left)\n- Front: Purple (remains the same)\n- Back: Gold (was Top)\n- Left: Cyan (was Bottom)\n- Right: Magenta (was Back)\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the back side of the cube after these rotations. From the final configuration, the back side is Gold.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotations is:\n\n<<<gold>>>"
