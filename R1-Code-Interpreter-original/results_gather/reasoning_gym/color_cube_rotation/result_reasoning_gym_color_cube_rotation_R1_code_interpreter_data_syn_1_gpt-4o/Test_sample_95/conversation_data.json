    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the rotations of the cube and track the positions of the colored sides.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Brown\n- Right: Pink\n- Front: Orange\n- Left: Blue\n- Back: Purple\n- Bottom: Yellow\n\n1. **First Rotation**: The side that was on the right (Pink) is moved to the top.\n   - New configuration:\n     - Top: Pink\n     - Right: Yellow (since the bottom moves to the right)\n     - Front: Orange\n     - Left: Blue\n     - Back: Purple\n     - Bottom: Brown (since the top moves to the bottom)\n\n2. **Second Rotation**: The side that was on the left (Blue) is moved to the top.\n   - New configuration:\n     - Top: Blue\n     - Right: Yellow\n     - Front: Pink (since the top moves to the front)\n     - Left: Brown (since the bottom moves to the left)\n     - Back: Orange (since the front moves to the back)\n     - Bottom: Purple (since the back moves to the bottom)\n\nAfter these two rotations, the color of the front side of the cube is Pink.\n\n<<<pink>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a brown top side\n- a pink right side\n- a orange front side\n- a blue left side\n- a purple back side\n- a yellow bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the right is now at the top.\n\nThen the cube is rotated to bring the left side to the top.\n\nWhat is now the color of the front side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
