    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the sequence of rotations and how they affect the position of each face of the cube.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Blue\n- Right: Violet\n- Front: Purple\n- Left: Red\n- Back: Indigo\n- Bottom: Gray\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The front side (Purple) is rotated to the top.\n- This means the top side (Blue) will move to the back.\n- The back side (Indigo) will move to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (Gray) will move to the front.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Purple\n- Right: Violet\n- Front: Gray\n- Left: Red\n- Back: Blue\n- Bottom: Indigo\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The front side (Gray) is rotated to the top.\n- This means the top side (Purple) will move to the back.\n- The back side (Blue) will move to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (Indigo) will move to the front.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Gray\n- Right: Violet\n- Front: Indigo\n- Left: Red\n- Back: Purple\n- Bottom: Blue\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the back side of the cube after these rotations. According to the final configuration, the back side is now Purple.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotations is:\n\n<<<purple>>>"
