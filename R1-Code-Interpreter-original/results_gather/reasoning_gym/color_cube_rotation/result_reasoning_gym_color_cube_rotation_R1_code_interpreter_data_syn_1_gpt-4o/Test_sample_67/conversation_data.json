    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how the colors of the sides change as a result of this rotation.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: White\n- Right: Pink\n- Front: Indigo\n- Left: Red\n- Back: Violet\n- Bottom: Orange\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the side which was at the back (Violet) is now at the top. This means the cube is rotated forward around the horizontal axis that runs from left to right.\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The back side (Violet) moves to the top.\n- The top side (White) moves to the front.\n- The front side (Indigo) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (Orange) moves to the back.\n- The left side (Red) and right side (Pink) remain unchanged.\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the bottom side after this rotation. The front side (Indigo) moves to the bottom.\n\nTherefore, the color of the bottom side of the cube after the rotation is Indigo.\n\n<<<indigo>>>"
