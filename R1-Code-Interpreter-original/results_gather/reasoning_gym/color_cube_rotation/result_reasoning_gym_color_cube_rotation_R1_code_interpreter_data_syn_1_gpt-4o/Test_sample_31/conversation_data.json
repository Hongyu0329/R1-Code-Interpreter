    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Yellow\n   - Bottom: Orange\n   - Front: Brown\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Right: Gold\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Orange) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Orange\n     - Bottom: Yellow\n     - Front: Brown\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Left: Blue\n     - Right: Gold\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Gold) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Gold\n     - Bottom: Blue\n     - Front: Brown\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Right: Yellow\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Brown) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Brown\n     - Bottom: Magenta\n     - Front: Yellow\n     - Back: Blue\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Right: Gold\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the bottom side is Magenta.\n\n<<<magenta>>>"
