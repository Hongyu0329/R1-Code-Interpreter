    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how the colors of the sides change as a result of this rotation.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Orange\n- Right: White\n- Front: Red\n- Left: Indigo\n- Back: Green\n- Bottom: Gold\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the side which was previously at the right (White) is now at the top. This implies a 90-degree rotation around the front-back axis.\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The top side becomes the right side (White moves to the top).\n- The right side becomes the bottom side (Gold moves to the right).\n- The bottom side becomes the left side (Indigo moves to the bottom).\n- The left side becomes the top side (Orange moves to the left).\n- The front and back sides remain unchanged.\n\nLet's visualize the new configuration:\n- Top: White\n- Right: Gold\n- Front: Red\n- Left: Orange\n- Back: Green\n- Bottom: Indigo\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the left side after the rotation. According to the new configuration, the left side is now Orange.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube after the rotation is Orange.\n\n<<<Orange>>>"
