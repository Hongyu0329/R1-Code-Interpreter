    "To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in the position of the cube's faces as it is rotated. Let's break down the rotations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Silver\n   - Bottom: Purple\n   - Front: Magenta\n   - Back: Gold\n   - Left: Violet\n   - Right: Brown\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Violet) is rotated to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Bottom: Purple\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Back: Gold\n     - Left: Purple (was bottom)\n     - Right: Brown\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Purple) is rotated to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Bottom: Violet (was top)\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Back: Gold\n     - Left: Brown (was right)\n     - Right: Violet (was bottom)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Violet) is rotated to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Bottom: Purple\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Back: Gold\n     - Left: Brown\n     - Right: Silver (was top)\n\nAfter these rotations, the top side of the cube is Violet.\n\n<<<Violet>>>"
