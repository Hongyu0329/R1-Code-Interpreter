    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the initial orientation of the cube and how the rotation affects the position of each side.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following orientation:\n- Top: Silver\n- Right: Cyan\n- Front: Indigo\n- Left: Purple\n- Back: Blue\n- Bottom: Red\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the back side (Blue) moves to the top. This means the cube is rotated forward, and the sides will shift as follows:\n- The top side (Silver) will move to the front.\n- The front side (Indigo) will move to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (Red) will move to the back.\n- The back side (Blue) will move to the top.\n- The left side (Purple) and right side (Cyan) remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the rotation, the new orientation of the cube is:\n- Top: Blue\n- Right: Cyan\n- Front: Silver\n- Left: Purple\n- Back: Red\n- Bottom: Indigo\n\nThe question asks for the color of the back side after the rotation. According to the new orientation, the back side is now Red.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotation is Red.\n\n<<<Red>>>"
