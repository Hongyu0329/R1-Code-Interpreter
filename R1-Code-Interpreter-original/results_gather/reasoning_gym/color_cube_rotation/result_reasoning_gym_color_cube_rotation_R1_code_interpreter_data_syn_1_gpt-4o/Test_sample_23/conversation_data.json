    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the sequence of rotations applied to the cube and how they affect the position of each colored side.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Red\n- Right: Purple\n- Front: Pink\n- Left: Brown\n- Back: Indigo\n- Bottom: Orange\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The cube is rotated so that the back side (Indigo) is now at the top.\n- New configuration:\n  - Top: Indigo\n  - Right: Purple\n  - Front: Pink\n  - Left: Brown\n  - Back: Orange (since the bottom becomes the back)\n  - Bottom: Red (since the top becomes the bottom)\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The cube is rotated to bring the bottom side (Red) to the top.\n- New configuration:\n  - Top: Red\n  - Right: Purple\n  - Front: Indigo (since the front becomes the top)\n  - Left: Brown\n  - Back: Pink (since the front becomes the back)\n  - Bottom: Orange (since the bottom remains unchanged)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the bottom side is Orange.\n\n<<<Orange>>>"
