    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and understand the sequence of rotations.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Gold\n- Bottom: Brown\n- Front: White\n- Back: Orange\n- Left: Gray\n- Right: Green\n\n1. **First Rotation**: The bottom side (Brown) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Top: Brown\n   - New Bottom: Gold\n   - Front: White\n   - Back: Orange\n   - Left: Gray\n   - Right: Green\n\n2. **Second Rotation**: The right side (Green) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Top: Green\n   - New Bottom: Gray (since the left side becomes the bottom)\n   - Front: White\n   - Back: Orange\n   - Left: Brown (since the previous top becomes the left)\n   - Right: Gold (since the previous bottom becomes the right)\n\nAfter these rotations, the top side of the cube is Green.\n\n<<<Green>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a gold top side\n- a green right side\n- a white front side\n- a gray left side\n- a orange back side\n- a brown bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the bottom is now at the top.\n\nNext, the right side is rotated to become the top face.\n\nWhat is now the color of the top side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
