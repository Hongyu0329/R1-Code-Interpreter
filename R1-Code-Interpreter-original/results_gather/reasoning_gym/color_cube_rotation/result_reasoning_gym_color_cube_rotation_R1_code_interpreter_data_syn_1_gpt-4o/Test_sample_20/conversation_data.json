    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how the sides are affected by this rotation.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Cyan\n- Bottom: Yellow\n- Front: White\n- Back: Gray\n- Left: Silver\n- Right: Gold\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the bottom side (Yellow) moves to the top. This means the cube is rotated 180 degrees around the horizontal axis that runs from the front to the back.\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The top side becomes Yellow (previously the bottom).\n- The bottom side becomes Cyan (previously the top).\n- The front and back sides remain unchanged (White and Gray, respectively).\n- The left and right sides swap places. The left side becomes Gold (previously the right), and the right side becomes Silver (previously the left).\n\nTherefore, after the rotation, the left side of the cube is now Gold.\n\n<<<Gold>>>"
