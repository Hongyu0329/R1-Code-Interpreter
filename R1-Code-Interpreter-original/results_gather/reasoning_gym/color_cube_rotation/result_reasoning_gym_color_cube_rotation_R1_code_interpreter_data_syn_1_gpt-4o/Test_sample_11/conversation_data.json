    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Back: Purple\n   - Left: Red\n   - Right: Brown\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Red) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Bottom: Yellow\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Back: Purple\n     - Left: Yellow\n     - Right: Brown\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Yellow) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Bottom: Red\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Back: Purple\n     - Left: Red\n     - Right: Brown\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Red) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Bottom: Yellow\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Back: Purple\n     - Left: Yellow\n     - Right: Brown\n\nAfter these rotations, the left side of the cube is Yellow.\n\n<<<Yellow>>>"
