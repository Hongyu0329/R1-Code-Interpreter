    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube's orientation changes when it is rotated. Initially, the cube has the following configuration:\n\n- Top: Orange\n- Bottom: Pink\n- Front: Indigo\n- Back: Red\n- Left: Gray\n- Right: Violet\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the bottom side (Pink) moves to the top. This means the cube is rotated 180 degrees around the horizontal axis that connects the left and right sides. \n\nAfter this rotation, the new configuration of the cube will be:\n\n- Top: Pink (was Bottom)\n- Bottom: Orange (was Top)\n- Front: Indigo (remains the same)\n- Back: Red (remains the same)\n- Left: Gray (remains the same)\n- Right: Violet (remains the same)\n\nThe back side of the cube remains unchanged in this rotation. Therefore, the color of the back side of the cube is still Red.\n\n<<<red>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a orange top side\n- a violet right side\n- a indigo front side\n- a gray left side\n- a red back side\n- a pink bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the bottom is now at the top.\n\nWhat is now the color of the back side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
