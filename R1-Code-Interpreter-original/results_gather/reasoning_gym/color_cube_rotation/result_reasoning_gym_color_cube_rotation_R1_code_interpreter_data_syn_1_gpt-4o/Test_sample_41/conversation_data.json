    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how the colors of the sides change as a result of this rotation.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Cyan\n- Right: Red\n- Front: Orange\n- Left: Magenta\n- Back: Silver\n- Bottom: Purple\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the side which was previously at the left (Magenta) is now at the top. This means the cube is rotated around the axis that goes from the front to the back.\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The top side becomes the left side (Magenta moves to the top).\n- The top side (Cyan) moves to the right side.\n- The right side (Red) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (Purple) moves to the left.\n- The left side (Magenta) moves to the top.\n- The front and back sides remain unchanged.\n\nNow, we need to determine the new color of the left side. After the rotation, the bottom side (Purple) moves to the left side.\n\nTherefore, the new color of the left side is Purple.\n\n<<<Purple>>>"
