    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and its rotations step by step.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Gray\n- Right: White\n- Front: Gold\n- Left: Pink\n- Back: Blue\n- Bottom: Violet\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The side that was on the left (Pink) is now on the top.\n- This means the cube is rotated around the axis that goes from front to back.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Pink\n- Right: White\n- Front: Gold\n- Left: Violet (since the bottom side moves to the left)\n- Back: Blue\n- Bottom: Gray (since the top side moves to the bottom)\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The side that was at the front (Gold) is now on the top.\n- This means the cube is rotated around the axis that goes from left to right.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Gold\n- Right: White\n- Front: Gray (since the bottom side moves to the front)\n- Left: Violet\n- Back: Pink (since the top side moves to the back)\n- Bottom: Blue (since the back side moves to the bottom)\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the back side of the cube after these rotations. According to the final configuration, the back side is now Pink.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube is:\n\n<<<pink>>>"
