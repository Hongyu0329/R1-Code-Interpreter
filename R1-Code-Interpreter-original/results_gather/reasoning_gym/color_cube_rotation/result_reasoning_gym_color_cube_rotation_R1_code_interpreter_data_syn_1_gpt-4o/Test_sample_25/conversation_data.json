    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Violet\n   - Bottom: Cyan\n   - Front: Purple\n   - Back: Gold\n   - Left: Magenta\n   - Right: White\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The bottom (Cyan) becomes the top.\n   - The top (Violet) becomes the bottom.\n   - The front, back, left, and right sides remain unchanged in their relative positions.\n   \n   New positions:\n   - Top: Cyan\n   - Bottom: Violet\n   - Front: Purple\n   - Back: Gold\n   - Left: Magenta\n   - Right: White\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Magenta) becomes the top.\n   - The top (Cyan) becomes the right side.\n   - The right side (White) becomes the bottom.\n   - The bottom (Violet) becomes the left side.\n   - The front and back sides remain unchanged in their relative positions.\n   \n   New positions:\n   - Top: Magenta\n   - Bottom: White\n   - Front: Purple\n   - Back: Gold\n   - Left: Violet\n   - Right: Cyan\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Gold) becomes the top.\n   - The top (Magenta) becomes the front.\n   - The front (Purple) becomes the bottom.\n   - The bottom (White) becomes the back.\n   - The left and right sides remain unchanged in their relative positions.\n   \n   New positions:\n   - Top: Gold\n   - Bottom: Purple\n   - Front: Magenta\n   - Back: White\n   - Left: Violet\n   - Right: Cyan\n\nAfter these rotations, the left side of the cube is now Violet.\n\n<<<Violet>>>"
