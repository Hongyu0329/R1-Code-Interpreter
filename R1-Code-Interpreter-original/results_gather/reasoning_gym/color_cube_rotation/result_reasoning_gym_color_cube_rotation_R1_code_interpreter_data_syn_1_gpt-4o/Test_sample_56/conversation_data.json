    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Purple\n   - Right: Violet\n   - Front: Gray\n   - Left: White\n   - Back: Green\n   - Bottom: Indigo\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Gray) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Gray\n     - Front: Indigo (since the bottom moves to the front)\n     - Bottom: Green (since the back moves to the bottom)\n     - Back: Purple (since the top moves to the back)\n     - Right: Violet\n     - Left: White\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Purple) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Back: Indigo (since the bottom moves to the back)\n     - Bottom: Gray (since the top moves to the bottom)\n     - Front: Green (since the back moves to the front)\n     - Right: Violet\n     - Left: White\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Indigo) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Back: Gray (since the bottom moves to the back)\n     - Bottom: Purple (since the top moves to the bottom)\n     - Front: Violet (since the right moves to the front)\n     - Right: Green (since the front moves to the right)\n     - Left: White\n\nAfter these rotations, the front side of the cube is now Violet.\n\n<<<Violet>>>"
