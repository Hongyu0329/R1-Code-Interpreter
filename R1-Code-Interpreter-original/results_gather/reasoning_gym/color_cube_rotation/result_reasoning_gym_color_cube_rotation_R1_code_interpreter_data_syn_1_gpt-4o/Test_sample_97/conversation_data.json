    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's faces as it undergoes a series of rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Bottom: White\n   - Front: Blue\n   - Back: Pink\n   - Left: Gold\n   - Right: Violet\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Blue) becomes the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Blue\n     - Bottom: White\n     - Front: White (since the top becomes the front)\n     - Back: Indigo (since the bottom becomes the back)\n     - Left: Gold\n     - Right: Violet\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The front side (White) becomes the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: White\n     - Bottom: Indigo (since the back becomes the bottom)\n     - Front: Indigo (since the top becomes the front)\n     - Back: Blue (since the bottom becomes the back)\n     - Left: Gold\n     - Right: Violet\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Blue) becomes the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Blue\n     - Bottom: Indigo (remains unchanged)\n     - Front: White (since the top becomes the front)\n     - Back: Indigo (since the bottom becomes the back)\n     - Left: Gold\n     - Right: Violet\n\nAfter these rotations, the bottom side of the cube is Indigo.\n\nTherefore, the color of the bottom side of the cube is:\n\n<<<indigo>>>"
