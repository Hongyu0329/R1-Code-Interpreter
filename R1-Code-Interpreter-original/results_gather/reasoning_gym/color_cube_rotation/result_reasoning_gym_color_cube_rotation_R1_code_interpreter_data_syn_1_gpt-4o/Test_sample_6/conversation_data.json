    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes a series of rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Right: Yellow\n   - Front: Brown\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Back: Cyan\n   - Bottom: White\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Blue) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Blue\n     - Right: Yellow\n     - Front: Brown\n     - Left: White (previously bottom)\n     - Back: Cyan\n     - Bottom: Indigo (previously top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Indigo) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Right: Yellow\n     - Front: Blue (previously top)\n     - Left: White\n     - Back: Cyan\n     - Bottom: Brown (previously front)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The left side (White) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: White\n     - Right: Yellow\n     - Front: Indigo (previously top)\n     - Left: Brown (previously bottom)\n     - Back: Cyan\n     - Bottom: Blue (previously front)\n\nAfter these rotations, the left side of the cube is now Brown.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube is:\n\n<<<Brown>>>"
