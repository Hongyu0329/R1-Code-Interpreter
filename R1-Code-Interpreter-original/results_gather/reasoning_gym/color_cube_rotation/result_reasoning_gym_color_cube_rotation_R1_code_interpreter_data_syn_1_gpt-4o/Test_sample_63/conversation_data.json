    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and its rotations step by step.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Indigo\n- Right: Purple\n- Front: Gold\n- Left: Cyan\n- Back: Orange\n- Bottom: Brown\n\n**Step 1: Rotate the cube so that the side which was at the left is now at the top.**\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The top face (previously left) is now Cyan.\n- The left face (previously bottom) is now Brown.\n- The bottom face (previously right) is now Purple.\n- The right face (previously top) is now Indigo.\n- The front face remains Gold.\n- The back face remains Orange.\n\n**Step 2: Turn the cube to make the back face the top.**\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The top face (previously back) is now Orange.\n- The back face (previously bottom) is now Purple.\n- The bottom face (previously front) is now Gold.\n- The front face (previously top) is now Cyan.\n- The left face remains Brown.\n- The right face remains Indigo.\n\nNow, the color of the front side of the cube is Cyan.\n\n<<<cyan>>>"
