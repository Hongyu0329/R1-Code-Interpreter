    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the sequence of rotations and how they affect the position of each side of the cube.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Red\n- Right: Violet\n- Front: Silver\n- Left: Brown\n- Back: Indigo\n- Bottom: Gray\n\n1. **First Rotation**: The front side (Silver) is rotated to the top.\n   - New configuration:\n     - Top: Silver\n     - Right: Violet\n     - Front: Gray (since the bottom becomes the front)\n     - Left: Brown\n     - Back: Indigo\n     - Bottom: Red (since the top becomes the bottom)\n\n2. **Second Rotation**: The back side (Indigo) is rotated to the top.\n   - New configuration:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Right: Violet\n     - Front: Gray\n     - Left: Brown\n     - Back: Red (since the bottom becomes the back)\n     - Bottom: Silver (since the top becomes the bottom)\n\nAfter these two rotations, the bottom side of the cube is now Silver.\n\nTherefore, the color of the bottom side of the cube is:\n\n<<<silver>>>"
