    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and understand how the rotations affect the positions of the colored sides.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Brown\n- Right: Yellow\n- Front: Orange\n- Left: Red\n- Back: Indigo\n- Bottom: Violet\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The side that was on the right (Yellow) is now on the top.\n- This means the top (Brown) moves to the left, the left (Red) moves to the bottom, the bottom (Violet) moves to the right, and the right (Yellow) moves to the top.\n- The front (Orange) and back (Indigo) remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Yellow\n- Right: Violet\n- Front: Orange\n- Left: Brown\n- Back: Indigo\n- Bottom: Red\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The front face (Orange) is turned to the top.\n- This means the top (Yellow) moves to the back, the back (Indigo) moves to the bottom, the bottom (Red) moves to the front, and the front (Orange) moves to the top.\n- The left (Brown) and right (Violet) remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Orange\n- Right: Violet\n- Front: Red\n- Left: Brown\n- Back: Yellow\n- Bottom: Indigo\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the left side of the cube after these rotations. From the final configuration, the left side is Brown.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube after the rotations is:\n\n<<<brown>>>"
