    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and understand how the rotations affect the positions of the sides.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Gray\n- Right: Pink\n- Front: Blue\n- Left: Cyan\n- Back: Yellow\n- Bottom: Gold\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The side that was at the back (Yellow) is now at the top.\n- The front (Blue) becomes the bottom.\n- The top (Gray) becomes the front.\n- The bottom (Gold) becomes the back.\n- The left (Cyan) and right (Pink) sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Yellow\n- Right: Pink\n- Front: Gray\n- Left: Cyan\n- Back: Gold\n- Bottom: Blue\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The right side (Pink) is now at the top.\n- The top (Yellow) becomes the left.\n- The bottom (Blue) becomes the right.\n- The left (Cyan) becomes the bottom.\n- The back (Gold) remains unchanged.\n- The front (Gray) becomes the back.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Pink\n- Right: Blue\n- Front: Yellow\n- Left: Yellow\n- Back: Gray\n- Bottom: Cyan\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the back side of the cube after these rotations. From the final configuration, the back side is Gray.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotations is:\n\n<<<Gray>>>"
