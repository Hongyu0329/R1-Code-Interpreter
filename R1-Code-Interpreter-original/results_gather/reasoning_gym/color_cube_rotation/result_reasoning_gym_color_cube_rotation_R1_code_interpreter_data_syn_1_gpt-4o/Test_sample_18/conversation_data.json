    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the rotation of the cube and determine the new position of each face.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Brown\n- Right: Purple\n- Front: Magenta\n- Left: Red\n- Back: Gray\n- Bottom: Blue\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the left side (Red) moves to the top. This means the cube is rotated around the axis that goes from the front to the back. \n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The top face (Brown) will move to the right.\n- The right face (Purple) will move to the bottom.\n- The bottom face (Blue) will move to the left.\n- The left face (Red) will move to the top.\n- The front face (Magenta) and the back face (Gray) remain in their positions.\n\nThus, the new configuration of the cube is:\n- Top: Red\n- Right: Brown\n- Front: Magenta\n- Left: Blue\n- Back: Gray\n- Bottom: Purple\n\nThe question asks for the color of the front side after the rotation. The front side remains Magenta.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube after the rotation is:\n\n<<<Magenta>>>"
