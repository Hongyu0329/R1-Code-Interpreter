    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the initial orientation of the cube and how the rotation affects it. Initially, the cube has the following sides:\n\n- Top: Brown\n- Bottom: Blue\n- Front: White\n- Back: Red\n- Left: Pink\n- Right: Orange\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the bottom side (Blue) is now at the top. This means the top side (Brown) will move to the bottom. The other sides will also change positions, but we are only interested in the new top side.\n\nAfter the rotation, the new orientation of the cube will be:\n\n- Top: Blue (previously the bottom)\n- Bottom: Brown (previously the top)\n- The other sides will shift accordingly, but they are not relevant for this question.\n\nThus, the color of the new top side is Blue.\n\n<<<Blue>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a brown top side\n- a orange right side\n- a white front side\n- a pink left side\n- a red back side\n- a blue bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the bottom is now at the top.\n\nWhat is now the color of the top side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
