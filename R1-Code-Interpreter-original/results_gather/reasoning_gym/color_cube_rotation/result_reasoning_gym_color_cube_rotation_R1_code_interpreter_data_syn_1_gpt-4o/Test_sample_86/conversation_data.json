    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's faces as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Silver\n   - Bottom: Brown\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Back: Yellow\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Right: Purple\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Brown) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Brown\n     - Bottom: Silver\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Back: Yellow\n     - Left: Blue\n     - Right: Purple\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Purple) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Bottom: Silver\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Back: Yellow\n     - Left: Brown\n     - Right: Blue\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Pink) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Pink\n     - Bottom: Silver\n     - Front: Blue\n     - Back: Brown\n     - Left: Purple\n     - Right: Yellow\n\nAfter these rotations, the back side of the cube is now the face that was originally the left side, which was Blue. Therefore, the color of the back side of the cube is now Brown.\n\n<<<Brown>>>"
