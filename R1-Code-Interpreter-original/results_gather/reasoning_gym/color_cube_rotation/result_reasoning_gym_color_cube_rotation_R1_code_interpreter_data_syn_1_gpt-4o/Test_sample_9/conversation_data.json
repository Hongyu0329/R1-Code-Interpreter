    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the sequence of rotations and how they affect the orientation of the cube's sides.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following orientation:\n- Top: Green\n- Right: Violet\n- Front: Magenta\n- Left: Red\n- Back: Pink\n- Bottom: Indigo\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The side that was at the front (Magenta) is now at the top.\n- This means the cube is rotated forward, and the top (Green) moves to the back, the bottom (Indigo) moves to the front, and the back (Pink) moves to the bottom.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the orientation is:\n- Top: Magenta\n- Right: Violet\n- Front: Indigo\n- Left: Red\n- Back: Green\n- Bottom: Pink\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The side that is currently at the front (Indigo) is rotated to the top.\n- This means the cube is rotated forward again, and the top (Magenta) moves to the back, the bottom (Pink) moves to the front, and the back (Green) moves to the bottom.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the orientation is:\n- Top: Indigo\n- Right: Violet\n- Front: Pink\n- Left: Red\n- Back: Magenta\n- Bottom: Green\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the bottom side of the cube after these rotations. From the final orientation, the bottom side is Green.\n\nTherefore, the color of the bottom side of the cube after the rotations is:\n\n<<<green>>>"
