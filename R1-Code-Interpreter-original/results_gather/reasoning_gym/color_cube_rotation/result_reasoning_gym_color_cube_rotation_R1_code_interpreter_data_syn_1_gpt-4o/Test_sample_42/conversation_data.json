    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the sequence of rotations and how they affect the orientation of the cube's sides.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Brown\n- Right: Red\n- Front: Pink\n- Left: Cyan\n- Back: Magenta\n- Bottom: Purple\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The side that was on the left (Cyan) is now on the top.\n- This means the cube is rotated around the front-back axis.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Cyan (was Left)\n- Right: Red\n- Front: Pink\n- Left: Purple (was Bottom)\n- Back: Magenta\n- Bottom: Brown (was Top)\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The side that was on the bottom (Brown) is now on the top.\n- This means the cube is rotated around the left-right axis.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Brown (was Bottom)\n- Right: Cyan (was Right)\n- Front: Purple (was Left)\n- Left: Pink (was Front)\n- Back: Magenta\n- Bottom: Red (was Right)\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the back side of the cube after these rotations. From the final configuration, the back side remains Magenta.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotations is:\n\n<<<magenta>>>"
