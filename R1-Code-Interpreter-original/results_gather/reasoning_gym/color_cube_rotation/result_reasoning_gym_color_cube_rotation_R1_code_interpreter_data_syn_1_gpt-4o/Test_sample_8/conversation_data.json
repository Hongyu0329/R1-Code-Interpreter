    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how the colors of the sides change as a result of this rotation.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Green\n- Right: Cyan\n- Front: Purple\n- Left: Gold\n- Back: Violet\n- Bottom: Pink\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the front side (Purple) moves to the top. This is equivalent to rotating the cube around the horizontal axis that runs from left to right.\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The top side becomes Purple (since the front side moves to the top).\n- The front side becomes Pink (since the bottom side moves to the front).\n- The bottom side becomes Violet (since the back side moves to the bottom).\n- The back side becomes Green (since the top side moves to the back).\n- The left and right sides remain unchanged (Gold and Cyan, respectively).\n\nThus, the new configuration of the cube is:\n- Top: Purple\n- Right: Cyan\n- Front: Pink\n- Left: Gold\n- Back: Green\n- Bottom: Violet\n\nThe question asks for the color of the back side after the rotation. From the new configuration, we can see that the back side is now Green.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotation is:\n\n<<<Green>>>"
