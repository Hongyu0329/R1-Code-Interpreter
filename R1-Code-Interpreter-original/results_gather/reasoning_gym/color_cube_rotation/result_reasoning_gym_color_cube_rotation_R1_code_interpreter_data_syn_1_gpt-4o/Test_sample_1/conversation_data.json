    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the rotations of the cube and track the positions of the colored sides.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Red\n- Right: Green\n- Front: Silver\n- Left: Magenta\n- Back: Purple\n- Bottom: Gold\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The left side (Magenta) is rotated to the top.\n- This means the top (Red) moves to the right, the right (Green) moves to the bottom, the bottom (Gold) moves to the left, and the left (Magenta) moves to the top.\n- The front (Silver) and back (Purple) sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the first rotation:\n- Top: Magenta\n- Right: Red\n- Front: Silver\n- Left: Gold\n- Back: Purple\n- Bottom: Green\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The right side (Red) is rotated to the top.\n- This means the top (Magenta) moves to the back, the back (Purple) moves to the bottom, the bottom (Green) moves to the front, and the front (Silver) moves to the top.\n- The left (Gold) and right (Red) sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the second rotation:\n- Top: Red\n- Right: Gold\n- Front: Green\n- Left: Magenta\n- Back: Magenta\n- Bottom: Purple\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the front side of the cube after these rotations. According to the final configuration, the front side is now Green.\n\n<<<Green>>>"
