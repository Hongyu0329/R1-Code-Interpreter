    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the rotation of the cube and determine the new position of each face. Initially, the cube has the following configuration:\n\n- Top: White\n- Right: Pink\n- Front: Gold\n- Left: Gray\n- Back: Green\n- Bottom: Brown\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the left side (Gray) moves to the top. This means the cube is rotated around the axis that runs from the front to the back. After this rotation, the new configuration of the cube will be:\n\n- Top: Gray (since the left side moved to the top)\n- Right: Pink (remains the same)\n- Front: White (since the top side moves to the front)\n- Left: Brown (since the bottom side moves to the left)\n- Back: Gold (since the front side moves to the back)\n- Bottom: Green (since the back side moves to the bottom)\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the front side after the rotation. According to the new configuration, the front side is now White.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube after the rotation is:\n\n<<<White>>>"
