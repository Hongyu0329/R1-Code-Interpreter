    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how this affects the position of each colored side.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Gold\n- Bottom: Yellow\n- Front: Silver\n- Back: Orange\n- Left: Gray\n- Right: Indigo\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the bottom side (Yellow) moves to the top. This means the top side (Gold) will move to the bottom. The front, back, left, and right sides will also shift positions accordingly.\n\nTo determine the new position of the front side, we need to visualize or calculate the new configuration of the cube after the rotation. The rotation described is a 180-degree rotation around the horizontal axis that runs from the left side to the right side.\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The top side becomes Yellow (originally the bottom).\n- The bottom side becomes Gold (originally the top).\n- The front side becomes Gray (originally the left).\n- The back side becomes Indigo (originally the right).\n- The left side becomes Silver (originally the front).\n- The right side becomes Orange (originally the back).\n\nThus, the new color of the front side is Gray.\n\n<<<Gray>>>"
