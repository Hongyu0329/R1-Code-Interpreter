    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how the sides are affected by this rotation.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Indigo\n- Right: Cyan\n- Front: Blue\n- Left: Violet\n- Back: Red\n- Bottom: Gold\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the side which was at the right (Cyan) is now at the top. This implies a rotation around the front-back axis.\n\nLet's visualize the rotation:\n1. The right side (Cyan) moves to the top.\n2. The top side (Indigo) moves to the left.\n3. The left side (Violet) moves to the bottom.\n4. The bottom side (Gold) moves to the right.\n5. The front side (Blue) remains at the front.\n6. The back side (Red) remains at the back.\n\nAfter the rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Cyan\n- Right: Gold\n- Front: Blue\n- Left: Indigo\n- Back: Red\n- Bottom: Violet\n\nThe question asks for the color of the front side after the rotation. According to the new configuration, the front side remains Blue.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube after the rotation is Blue.\n\n<<<Blue>>>"
