    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how the sides are affected by this rotation.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Red\n- Right: Yellow\n- Front: Indigo\n- Left: Green\n- Back: Pink\n- Bottom: Purple\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the side which was at the back (Pink) is now at the top. This means the cube is rotated forward around the horizontal axis that runs from left to right.\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The Pink side (Back) moves to the Top.\n- The Red side (Top) moves to the Front.\n- The Indigo side (Front) moves to the Bottom.\n- The Purple side (Bottom) moves to the Back.\n- The Left (Green) and Right (Yellow) sides remain unchanged.\n\nThus, the new configuration of the cube is:\n- Top: Pink\n- Right: Yellow\n- Front: Red\n- Left: Green\n- Back: Purple\n- Bottom: Indigo\n\nThe color of the right side remains Yellow after the rotation.\n\nTherefore, the color of the right side of the cube after the rotation is Yellow.\n\n<<<Yellow>>>"
