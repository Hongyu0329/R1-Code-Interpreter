    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how the sides are affected by this rotation.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Pink\n- Bottom: Cyan\n- Front: Orange\n- Back: Indigo\n- Left: Purple\n- Right: Gray\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the bottom side (Cyan) moves to the top. This means the cube is rotated 180 degrees around the horizontal axis that runs from the front to the back.\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The top side becomes Cyan (previously the bottom).\n- The bottom side becomes Pink (previously the top).\n- The front side remains Orange.\n- The back side remains Indigo.\n- The left side remains Purple.\n- The right side remains Gray.\n\nThe back side of the cube remains unchanged in this rotation, so the color of the back side is still Indigo.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotation is Indigo.\n\n<<<Indigo>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a pink top side\n- a gray right side\n- a orange front side\n- a purple left side\n- a indigo back side\n- a cyan bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the bottom is now at the top.\n\nWhat is now the color of the back side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
