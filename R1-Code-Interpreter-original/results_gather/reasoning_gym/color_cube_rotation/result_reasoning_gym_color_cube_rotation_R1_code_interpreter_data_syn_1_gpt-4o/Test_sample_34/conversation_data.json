    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes a series of rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Right: Red\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Left: Silver\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Bottom: Gold\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Red) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Right: Gold (previously bottom)\n     - Front: Violet\n     - Left: Silver\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Bottom: Gray (previously top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Silver) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Silver\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Red (previously top)\n     - Left: Gray (previously bottom)\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Bottom: Violet (previously front)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Red) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Violet (previously bottom)\n     - Left: Silver (previously top)\n     - Back: Gray (previously left)\n     - Bottom: Magenta (previously back)\n\nAfter these rotations, the left side of the cube is now the side that was originally the top side, which is Gray.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube after all the rotations is:\n\n<<<Gray>>>"
