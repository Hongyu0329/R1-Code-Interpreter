    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the initial orientation of the cube and how the rotation affects it.\n\nInitially, the cube has:\n- Red on the top\n- Silver on the right\n- White on the front\n- Pink on the left\n- Orange on the back\n- Blue on the bottom\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the bottom side (which is blue) moves to the top. This means the top side (which was red) will move to the bottom.\n\nTherefore, after the rotation, the color of the bottom side will be red.\n\n<<<red>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a red top side\n- a silver right side\n- a white front side\n- a pink left side\n- a orange back side\n- a blue bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the bottom is now at the top.\n\nWhat is now the color of the bottom side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
