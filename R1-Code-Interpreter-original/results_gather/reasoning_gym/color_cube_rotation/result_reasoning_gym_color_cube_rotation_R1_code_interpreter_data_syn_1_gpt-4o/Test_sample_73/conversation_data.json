    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the sequence of rotations and how they affect the position of the cube's sides.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Indigo\n- Right: Yellow\n- Front: Violet\n- Left: Pink\n- Back: Purple\n- Bottom: Blue\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The front side (Violet) is rotated to the top.\n- The top side (Indigo) moves to the back.\n- The back side (Purple) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (Blue) moves to the front.\n- The left (Pink) and right (Yellow) sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Violet\n- Right: Yellow\n- Front: Blue\n- Left: Pink\n- Back: Indigo\n- Bottom: Purple\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The back side (Indigo) is rotated to the top.\n- The top side (Violet) moves to the front.\n- The front side (Blue) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (Purple) moves to the back.\n- The left (Pink) and right (Yellow) sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Indigo\n- Right: Yellow\n- Front: Violet\n- Left: Pink\n- Back: Purple\n- Bottom: Blue\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the back side after these rotations. From the final configuration, the back side is Purple.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotations is:\n\n<<<Purple>>>"
