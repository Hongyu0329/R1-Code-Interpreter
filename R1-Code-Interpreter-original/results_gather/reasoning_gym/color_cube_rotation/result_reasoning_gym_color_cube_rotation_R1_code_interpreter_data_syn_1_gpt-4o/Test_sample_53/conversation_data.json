    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down the rotations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Bottom: Gold\n   - Front: Blue\n   - Back: Silver\n   - Left: Brown\n   - Right: Violet\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was at the back (Silver) is now at the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Silver\n     - Bottom: Gold\n     - Front: Red (since the top moved to the front)\n     - Back: Blue (since the front moved to the back)\n     - Left: Brown\n     - Right: Violet\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The side that was at the right (Violet) is now at the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Bottom: Gold\n     - Front: Red\n     - Back: Blue\n     - Left: Silver (since the top moved to the left)\n     - Right: Brown (since the left moved to the right)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The side that was at the right (Brown) is now at the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Brown\n     - Bottom: Gold\n     - Front: Red\n     - Back: Blue\n     - Left: Violet (since the top moved to the left)\n     - Right: Silver (since the left moved to the right)\n\nAfter these rotations, the bottom side remains unchanged as Gold.\n\nThus, the color of the bottom side of the cube is Gold.\n\n<<<Gold>>>"
