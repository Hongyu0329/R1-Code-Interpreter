    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how the sides are affected by this rotation.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Red\n- Bottom: Yellow\n- Front: Silver\n- Back: Pink\n- Left: Brown\n- Right: Indigo\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the bottom side (Yellow) is now at the top. This means the cube is rotated 180 degrees around the horizontal axis that runs from the front to the back.\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The top side becomes the bottom side, so Yellow is now on top.\n- The bottom side becomes the top side, so Red is now on the bottom.\n- The front and back sides remain unchanged in their positions.\n- The left and right sides are swapped.\n\nTherefore, after the rotation:\n- Top: Yellow\n- Bottom: Red\n- Front: Silver\n- Back: Pink\n- Left: Indigo\n- Right: Brown\n\nThe color of the right side of the cube after the rotation is Brown.\n\n<<<Brown>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a red top side\n- a indigo right side\n- a silver front side\n- a brown left side\n- a pink back side\n- a yellow bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the bottom is now at the top.\n\nWhat is now the color of the right side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
