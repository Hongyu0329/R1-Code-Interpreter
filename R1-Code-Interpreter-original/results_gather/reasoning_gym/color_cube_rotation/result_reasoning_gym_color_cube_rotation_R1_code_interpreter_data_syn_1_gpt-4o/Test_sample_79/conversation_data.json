    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and understand how the rotations affect the positions of the sides.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Brown\n- Right: Gray\n- Front: Red\n- Left: Green\n- Back: White\n- Bottom: Gold\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The side that was at the back (White) is now at the top.\n- The top (Brown) moves to the front.\n- The front (Red) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom (Gold) moves to the back.\n- The left (Green) and right (Gray) sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: White\n- Right: Gray\n- Front: Brown\n- Left: Green\n- Back: Gold\n- Bottom: Red\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The side that was on the left (Green) is now at the top.\n- The top (White) moves to the right.\n- The right (Gray) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom (Red) moves to the left.\n- The front (Brown) and back (Gold) sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Green\n- Right: White\n- Front: Brown\n- Left: Red\n- Back: Gold\n- Bottom: Gray\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the left side of the cube after these rotations. According to the final configuration, the left side is now Red.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube after the rotations is:\n\n<<<red>>>"
