    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the initial orientation of the cube and how the rotation affects the position of each side.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following orientation:\n- Top: Orange\n- Right: Red\n- Front: Gray\n- Left: Green\n- Back: Silver\n- Bottom: Gold\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the side which was at the back (Silver) is now at the top. This means the cube is rotated forward, and each face moves accordingly.\n\nAfter the rotation:\n- The Silver side (initially at the back) moves to the top.\n- The Orange side (initially at the top) moves to the front.\n- The Gray side (initially at the front) moves to the bottom.\n- The Gold side (initially at the bottom) moves to the back.\n- The Red side (initially at the right) and the Green side (initially at the left) remain unchanged.\n\nNow, we need to determine the new color of the back side. After the rotation, the Gold side, which was initially at the bottom, is now at the back.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotation is Gold.\n\n<<<gold>>>"
