    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the sequence of rotations applied to the cube and how they affect the position of the colored sides.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Gold\n- Right: Cyan\n- Front: White\n- Left: Violet\n- Back: Green\n- Bottom: Magenta\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The front side (White) is rotated to the top.\n- New configuration:\n  - Top: White\n  - Right: Cyan\n  - Front: Magenta (since the bottom becomes the new front)\n  - Left: Violet\n  - Back: Gold (since the top becomes the new back)\n  - Bottom: Green (since the back becomes the new bottom)\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The front side (Magenta) is rotated to the top.\n- New configuration:\n  - Top: Magenta\n  - Right: Cyan\n  - Front: Green (since the bottom becomes the new front)\n  - Left: Violet\n  - Back: White (since the top becomes the new back)\n  - Bottom: Gold (since the back becomes the new bottom)\n\nAfter these two rotations, the top side of the cube is Magenta.\n\nTherefore, the color of the top side of the cube after the rotations is:\n\n<<<Magenta>>>"
