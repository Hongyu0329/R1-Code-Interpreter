    "To solve this problem, we need to track the orientation of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Orientation:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Bottom: Green\n   - Front: Indigo\n   - Back: Yellow\n   - Left: Cyan\n   - Right: Pink\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was at the back (Yellow) is now at the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Bottom: Green\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Back: Gray\n     - Left: Cyan\n     - Right: Pink\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The bottom (Green) is moved to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Green\n     - Bottom: Yellow\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Back: Gray\n     - Left: Cyan\n     - Right: Pink\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The back (Gray) is moved to the top.\n   - New Orientation:\n     - Top: Gray\n     - Bottom: Yellow\n     - Front: Green\n     - Back: Indigo\n     - Left: Cyan\n     - Right: Pink\n\nAfter these rotations, the top side of the cube is Gray.\n\n<<<Gray>>>"
