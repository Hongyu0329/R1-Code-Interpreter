    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and its rotations step by step.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: White\n- Right: Orange\n- Front: Red\n- Left: Green\n- Back: Magenta\n- Bottom: Indigo\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The cube is rotated so that the front side (Red) is now at the top.\n- New configuration:\n  - Top: Red\n  - Right: Orange\n  - Front: Indigo (since the bottom moves to the front)\n  - Left: Green\n  - Back: White (since the top moves to the back)\n  - Bottom: Magenta (since the back moves to the bottom)\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The cube is rotated again to bring the front side (Indigo) to the top.\n- New configuration:\n  - Top: Indigo\n  - Right: Orange\n  - Front: Magenta (since the bottom moves to the front)\n  - Left: Green\n  - Back: Red (since the top moves to the back)\n  - Bottom: White (since the back moves to the bottom)\n\nAfter these two rotations, the left side of the cube is still Green.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube is:\n\n<<<green>>>"
