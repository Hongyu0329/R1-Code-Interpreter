    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how the sides are affected by this rotation.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Orange\n- Right: Pink\n- Front: Brown\n- Left: Gray\n- Back: Gold\n- Bottom: Blue\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the side which was previously at the right (Pink) is now at the top. This means the cube is rotated 90 degrees around the axis that goes from the front to the back.\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The Pink side moves from the Right to the Top.\n- The Orange side moves from the Top to the Left.\n- The Gray side moves from the Left to the Bottom.\n- The Blue side moves from the Bottom to the Right.\n- The Brown side remains at the Front.\n- The Gold side remains at the Back.\n\nNow, we need to determine the new color of the right side of the cube. According to the rotation, the Blue side, which was initially at the bottom, is now at the right.\n\nTherefore, the color of the right side of the cube after the rotation is Blue.\n\n<<<blue>>>"
