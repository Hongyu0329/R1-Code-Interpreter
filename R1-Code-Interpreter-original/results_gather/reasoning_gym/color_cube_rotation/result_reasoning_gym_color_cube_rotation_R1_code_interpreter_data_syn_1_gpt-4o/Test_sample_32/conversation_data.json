    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the sequence of rotations applied to the cube and how they affect the position of the colored sides.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Blue\n- Right: Silver\n- Front: Gold\n- Left: Pink\n- Back: Indigo\n- Bottom: Magenta\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The front side (Gold) is rotated to the top.\n- This means the top side (Blue) will move to the back, the back side (Indigo) will move to the bottom, the bottom side (Magenta) will move to the front, and the left and right sides (Pink and Silver) remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Gold\n- Right: Silver\n- Front: Magenta\n- Left: Pink\n- Back: Blue\n- Bottom: Indigo\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The right side (Silver) is rotated to the top.\n- This means the top side (Gold) will move to the left, the left side (Pink) will move to the bottom, the bottom side (Indigo) will move to the right, and the front and back sides (Magenta and Blue) remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Silver\n- Right: Indigo\n- Front: Magenta\n- Left: Gold\n- Back: Blue\n- Bottom: Pink\n\nThe color of the top side of the cube after these rotations is Silver.\n\n<<<Silver>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a blue top side\n- a silver right side\n- a gold front side\n- a pink left side\n- a indigo back side\n- a magenta bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the front is now at the top.\n\nNext, the right side is rotated to become the top face.\n\nWhat is now the color of the top side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
