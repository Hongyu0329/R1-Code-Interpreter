    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the initial orientation of the cube and how the rotation affects it.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following orientation:\n- Top: Violet\n- Right: Indigo\n- Front: Orange\n- Left: White\n- Back: Pink\n- Bottom: Yellow\n\nThe cube is then rotated such that the side which was at the back (Pink) is now at the top. This means the cube is rotated forward.\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The Pink side moves from the back to the top.\n- The Violet side moves from the top to the front.\n- The Orange side moves from the front to the bottom.\n- The Yellow side moves from the bottom to the back.\n- The Indigo and White sides remain on the right and left, respectively.\n\nThus, the new orientation of the cube is:\n- Top: Pink\n- Right: Indigo\n- Front: Violet\n- Left: White\n- Back: Yellow\n- Bottom: Orange\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotation is Yellow.\n\n<<<yellow>>>"
