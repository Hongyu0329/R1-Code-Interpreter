    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes a series of rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Right: Brown\n   - Front: Yellow\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Back: Blue\n   - Bottom: Indigo\n\n2. **First Rotation (Front to Top):**\n   - The front side (Yellow) moves to the top.\n   - The top side (Gray) moves to the back.\n   - The back side (Blue) moves to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Indigo) moves to the front.\n   - The left and right sides remain unchanged.\n   \n   New positions:\n   - Top: Yellow\n   - Right: Brown\n   - Front: Indigo\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Back: Gray\n   - Bottom: Blue\n\n3. **Second Rotation (Left to Top):**\n   - The left side (Purple) moves to the top.\n   - The top side (Yellow) moves to the right.\n   - The right side (Brown) moves to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Blue) moves to the left.\n   - The front and back sides remain unchanged.\n   \n   New positions:\n   - Top: Purple\n   - Right: Yellow\n   - Front: Indigo\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Back: Gray\n   - Bottom: Brown\n\n4. **Third Rotation (Right to Top):**\n   - The right side (Yellow) moves to the top.\n   - The top side (Purple) moves to the left.\n   - The left side (Blue) moves to the bottom.\n   - The bottom side (Brown) moves to the right.\n   - The front and back sides remain unchanged.\n   \n   New positions:\n   - Top: Yellow\n   - Right: Brown\n   - Front: Indigo\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Back: Gray\n   - Bottom: Blue\n\nAfter these rotations, the left side of the cube is now Purple.\n\n<<<Purple>>>"
