    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and its rotations step by step.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Gray\n- Right: Indigo\n- Front: Cyan\n- Left: Green\n- Back: Orange\n- Bottom: Brown\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The front side (Cyan) is rotated to the top.\n- The top side (Gray) moves to the back.\n- The back side (Orange) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (Brown) moves to the front.\n- The left (Green) and right (Indigo) sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Cyan\n- Right: Indigo\n- Front: Brown\n- Left: Green\n- Back: Gray\n- Bottom: Orange\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The left side (Green) is rotated to the top.\n- The top side (Cyan) moves to the right.\n- The right side (Indigo) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (Orange) moves to the left.\n- The back (Gray) and front (Brown) sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Green\n- Right: Cyan\n- Front: Brown\n- Left: Orange\n- Back: Gray\n- Bottom: Indigo\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the back side of the cube after these rotations. From the final configuration, the back side is Gray.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after the rotations is:\n\n<<<gray>>>"
