    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the cube is rotated and how the sides are affected by this rotation.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Green\n- Right: Orange\n- Front: Silver\n- Left: Indigo\n- Back: Yellow\n- Bottom: Red\n\nThe cube is rotated such that the side which was at the left (Indigo) is now at the top. This means the cube is rotated 90 degrees around the front-back axis.\n\nAfter this rotation:\n- The Indigo side (Left) moves to the Top.\n- The Green side (Top) moves to the Right.\n- The Orange side (Right) moves to the Bottom.\n- The Red side (Bottom) moves to the Left.\n- The Silver side (Front) remains at the Front.\n- The Yellow side (Back) remains at the Back.\n\nThus, the color of the back side of the cube remains unchanged.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer.\n\n<<<yellow>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a green top side\n- a orange right side\n- a silver front side\n- a indigo left side\n- a yellow back side\n- a red bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the left is now at the top.\n\nWhat is now the color of the back side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
