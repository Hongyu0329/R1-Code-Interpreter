    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and understand how the rotations affect the positions of the sides.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Indigo\n- Right: Gray\n- Front: Brown\n- Left: Cyan\n- Back: Magenta\n- Bottom: Yellow\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The right side (Gray) is rotated to the top.\n- This means the top (Indigo) moves to the left, the left (Cyan) moves to the bottom, the bottom (Yellow) moves to the right, and the front (Brown) and back (Magenta) remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Gray\n- Right: Yellow\n- Front: Brown\n- Left: Indigo\n- Back: Magenta\n- Bottom: Cyan\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The back side (Magenta) is rotated to the top.\n- This means the top (Gray) moves to the front, the front (Brown) moves to the bottom, the bottom (Cyan) moves to the back, and the left (Indigo) and right (Yellow) remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Magenta\n- Right: Yellow\n- Front: Gray\n- Left: Indigo\n- Back: Cyan\n- Bottom: Brown\n\nNow, the front side of the cube is Gray.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube after the rotations is:\n\n<<<Gray>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a indigo top side\n- a gray right side\n- a brown front side\n- a cyan left side\n- a magenta back side\n- a yellow bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the right is now at the top.\n\nNext, the back side is rotated to become the top face.\n\nWhat is now the color of the front side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
