    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and track the changes in the position of each face as the cube is rotated.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Magenta\n- Right: Indigo\n- Front: Purple\n- Left: Orange\n- Back: White\n- Bottom: Brown\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The side that was at the right (Indigo) is now at the top.\n- The top (Magenta) moves to the left.\n- The left (Orange) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom (Brown) moves to the right.\n- The front (Purple) and back (White) remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Indigo\n- Right: Brown\n- Front: Purple\n- Left: Magenta\n- Back: White\n- Bottom: Orange\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The side that was at the left (Magenta) is now at the top.\n- The top (Indigo) moves to the right.\n- The right (Brown) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom (Orange) moves to the left.\n- The front (Purple) and back (White) remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Magenta\n- Right: Indigo\n- Front: Purple\n- Left: Orange\n- Back: White\n- Bottom: Brown\n\nThe back side remains White after both rotations.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube is:\n\n<<<white>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a magenta top side\n- a indigo right side\n- a purple front side\n- a orange left side\n- a white back side\n- a brown bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the right is now at the top.\n\nNow the cube is rotated to place its left side at the top.\n\nWhat is now the color of the back side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
