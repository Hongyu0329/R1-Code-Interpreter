    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes a series of rotations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Cyan\n   - Bottom: Magenta\n   - Front: Gold\n   - Back: Blue\n   - Left: Orange\n   - Right: Gray\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Gold) is rotated to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Gold\n     - Bottom: Magenta\n     - Front: Magenta (previously bottom)\n     - Back: Cyan (previously top)\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Right: Gray\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Cyan) is rotated to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Cyan\n     - Bottom: Magenta\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Back: Gold (previously top)\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Right: Gray\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Orange) is rotated to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Orange\n     - Bottom: Gray (previously right)\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Back: Gold\n     - Left: Magenta (previously bottom)\n     - Right: Cyan (previously top)\n\nAfter these rotations, the bottom side of the cube is now Gray.\n\n<<<Gray>>>"
