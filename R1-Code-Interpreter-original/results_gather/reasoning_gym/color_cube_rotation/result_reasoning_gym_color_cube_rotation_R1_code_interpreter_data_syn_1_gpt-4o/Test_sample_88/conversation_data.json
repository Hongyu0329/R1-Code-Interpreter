    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes the specified rotations.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Red\n- Bottom: Brown\n- Front: Indigo\n- Back: Gold\n- Left: Blue\n- Right: White\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The front side (Indigo) is moved to the top.\n- The top side (Red) moves to the back.\n- The back side (Gold) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (Brown) moves to the front.\n- The left and right sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the first rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: Indigo\n- Bottom: Gold\n- Front: Brown\n- Back: Red\n- Left: Blue\n- Right: White\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- The right side (White) is moved to the top.\n- The top side (Indigo) moves to the left.\n- The left side (Blue) moves to the bottom.\n- The bottom side (Gold) moves to the right.\n- The front and back sides remain unchanged.\n\nAfter the second rotation, the configuration is:\n- Top: White\n- Bottom: Blue\n- Front: Brown\n- Back: Red\n- Left: Indigo\n- Right: Gold\n\nThe color of the bottom side after these rotations is Blue.\n\n<<<blue>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A cube has:\n- a red top side\n- a white right side\n- a indigo front side\n- a blue left side\n- a gold back side\n- a brown bottom side\n\nThe cube is rotated so that the side which was before at the front is now at the top.\n\nNow the cube is rotated to place its right side at the top.\n\nWhat is now the color of the bottom side of the cube?\nProvide only the color as your final answer.\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
