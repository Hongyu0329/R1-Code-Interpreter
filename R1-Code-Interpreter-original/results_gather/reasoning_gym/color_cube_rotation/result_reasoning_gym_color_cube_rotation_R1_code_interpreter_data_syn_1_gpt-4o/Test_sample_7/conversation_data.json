    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and its rotations step by step.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Gray\n- Right: Cyan\n- Front: Pink\n- Left: Brown\n- Back: Green\n- Bottom: Blue\n\n**First Rotation:**\n- The side that was at the right (Cyan) is now at the top.\n- This means the cube is rotated around the front-back axis.\n\nAfter the first rotation:\n- Top: Cyan (was Right)\n- Right: Blue (was Bottom)\n- Front: Pink (remains Front)\n- Left: Gray (was Top)\n- Back: Green (remains Back)\n- Bottom: Brown (was Left)\n\n**Second Rotation:**\n- Now, the side that is currently at the right (Blue) is moved to the top.\n- This means the cube is rotated around the front-back axis again.\n\nAfter the second rotation:\n- Top: Blue (was Right)\n- Right: Brown (was Bottom)\n- Front: Pink (remains Front)\n- Left: Cyan (was Top)\n- Back: Green (remains Back)\n- Bottom: Gray (was Left)\n\nNow, we need to determine the color of the left side of the cube after these rotations. After the second rotation, the left side is Cyan.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube is:\n\n<<<cyan>>>"
