    "\nassistant > To determine the color of the top side of the cube after the specified rotations, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Red\n   - Front: Yellow\n   - Back: Brown\n   - Left: Violet\n   - Right: Green\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Red) is moved to the top.\n   - New Top: Red\n   - New Bottom: Indigo\n   - Front, Back, Left, Right remain the same.\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Green) is moved to the top.\n   - New Top: Green\n   - New Right: Indigo\n   - New Bottom: Red\n   - New Left: Violet\n   - Front and Back remain the same.\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Violet) is moved to the top.\n   - New Top: Violet\n   - New Left: Red\n   - New Bottom: Green\n   - New Right: Indigo\n   - Front and Back remain the same.\n\nAfter these rotations, the top side of the cube is Violet.\n\nTherefore, the color of the top side of the cube is:\n\n<<<violet>>>"
