    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to track the movements of the cube's faces as it is rotated.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Silver\n- Right: Brown\n- Front: Magenta\n- Left: Violet\n- Back: Gold\n- Bottom: Purple\n\n1. **First Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Violet) is rotated to the top.\n   - New configuration:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Right: Brown\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Left: Purple (previously bottom)\n     - Back: Gold\n     - Bottom: Silver (previously top)\n\n2. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Purple) is rotated to the top.\n   - New configuration:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Right: Brown\n     - Front: Violet (previously top)\n     - Left: Silver (previously bottom)\n     - Back: Gold\n     - Bottom: Magenta (previously front)\n\n3. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Brown) is rotated to the top.\n   - New configuration:\n     - Top: Brown\n     - Right: Magenta (previously bottom)\n     - Front: Violet\n     - Left: Silver\n     - Back: Gold\n     - Bottom: Purple (previously top)\n\nAfter these rotations, the top side of the cube is now Brown.\n\nTherefore, the color of the top side of the cube is:\n\n<<<Brown>>>"
