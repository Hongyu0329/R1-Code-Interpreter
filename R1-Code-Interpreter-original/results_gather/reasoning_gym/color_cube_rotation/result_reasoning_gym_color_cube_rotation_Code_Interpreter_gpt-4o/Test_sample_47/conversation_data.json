    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides through the series of rotations described.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Silver\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Left: Green\n   - Back: Purple\n   - Bottom: Brown\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Green) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Green\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Violet\n     - Left: Brown\n     - Back: Purple\n     - Bottom: Silver\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the front (Violet) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Brown\n     - Left: Green\n     - Back: Silver\n     - Bottom: Purple\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the back (Silver) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Silver\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Brown\n     - Left: Violet\n     - Back: Green\n     - Bottom: Purple\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Violet.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Violet>>>"
