    "\nassistant > When the cube is rotated such that the bottom side becomes the top, the original top side moves to the bottom, and the other sides shift accordingly. \n\nInitially, the sides are:\n- Top: Orange\n- Bottom: Pink\n- Front: Indigo\n- Back: Red\n- Left: Gray\n- Right: Violet\n\nAfter the rotation:\n- New Top: Pink (was Bottom)\n- New Bottom: Orange (was Top)\n- Front: Indigo (remains the same)\n- Back: Red (remains the same)\n- Left: Gray (remains the same)\n- Right: Violet (remains the same)\n\nThe back side remains the same color as before the rotation.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube is <<<red>>>."
