    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's track the positions of the cube's sides through the rotations:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Back: Brown\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n\n2. **First Rotation (Left side to Top):**\n   - Top: Blue (was Left)\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Left: Yellow (was Bottom)\n   - Back: Brown\n   - Bottom: Red (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation (Right side to Top):**\n   - Top: Gold (was Right)\n   - Right: Red (was Bottom)\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Back: Brown\n   - Bottom: Yellow (was Left)\n\nAfter these rotations, the back side of the cube is still Brown.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube is:\n\n<<<brown>>>"
