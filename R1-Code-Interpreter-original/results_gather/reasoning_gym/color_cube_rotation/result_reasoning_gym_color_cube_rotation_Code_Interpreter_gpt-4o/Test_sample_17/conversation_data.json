    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes the specified rotations.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: White\n   - Bottom: Magenta\n   - Front: Yellow\n   - Back: Violet\n   - Left: Gold\n   - Right: Pink\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Magenta) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Magenta\n     - Bottom: White\n     - Front: Yellow\n     - Back: Violet\n     - Left: Gold\n     - Right: Pink\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (White) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: White\n     - Bottom: Magenta\n     - Front: Yellow\n     - Back: Violet\n     - Left: Gold\n     - Right: Pink\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Yellow) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Bottom: Violet\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Back: White\n     - Left: Gold\n     - Right: Pink\n\nAfter these rotations, the back side of the cube is now White.\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube is:\n\n<<<White>>>"
