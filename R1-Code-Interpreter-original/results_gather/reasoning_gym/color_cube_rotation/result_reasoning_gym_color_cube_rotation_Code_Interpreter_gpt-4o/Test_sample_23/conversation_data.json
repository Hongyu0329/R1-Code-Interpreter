    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's track the positions of the sides of the cube through the rotations:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Right: Purple\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Left: Brown\n   - Back: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Orange\n\n2. **First Rotation (Back to Top):**\n   - Top: Indigo (was Back)\n   - Right: Purple\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Left: Brown\n   - Back: Orange (was Bottom)\n   - Bottom: Red (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation (Bottom to Top):**\n   - Top: Red (was Bottom)\n   - Right: Purple\n   - Front: Indigo (was Top)\n   - Left: Brown\n   - Back: Pink (was Front)\n   - Bottom: Orange (was Back)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the bottom side is now Orange.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Orange>>>"
