    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides through the given rotations:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Green\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Left: Red\n   - Back: Yellow\n   - Bottom: Violet\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was at the back (Yellow) is now at the top.\n   - New Position:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Left: Red\n     - Back: Violet\n     - Bottom: Green\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The back (Violet) is moved to the top.\n   - New Position:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Pink\n     - Left: Red\n     - Back: Green\n     - Bottom: Yellow\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The front (Pink) is moved to the top.\n   - New Position:\n     - Top: Pink\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Yellow\n     - Left: Red\n     - Back: Violet\n     - Bottom: Green\n\nThe color of the back side of the cube is now Violet.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Violet>>>"
