    "\nassistant > To determine the color of the right side of the cube after the specified rotations, let's analyze the sequence of rotations:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Pink\n   - Bottom: White\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Back: Silver\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Right: Green\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Silver) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Silver\n     - Bottom: Violet\n     - Front: White\n     - Back: Pink\n     - Left: Purple\n     - Right: Green\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Pink) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Pink\n     - Bottom: White\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Back: Violet\n     - Left: Purple\n     - Right: Green\n\nAfter these rotations, the right side of the cube is still Green.\n\nTherefore, the color of the right side of the cube is <<<green>>>."
