    "\nassistant > To determine the color of the right side of the cube after the specified rotations, we need to track the positions of the cube's faces through each rotation.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Orange\n   - Right: Blue\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Left: Red\n   - Back: Brown\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n\n2. **First Rotation (Right side to Top):**\n   - Top: Blue\n   - Right: Yellow\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Left: Red\n   - Back: Brown\n   - Bottom: Orange\n\n3. **Second Rotation (Left side to Top):**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Right: Yellow\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Left: Orange\n   - Back: Brown\n   - Bottom: Blue\n\n4. **Third Rotation (Left side to Top):**\n   - Top: Orange\n   - Right: Yellow\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Back: Brown\n   - Bottom: Red\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the right side of the cube is Yellow.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Yellow>>>"
