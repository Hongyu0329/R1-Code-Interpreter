    "\nassistant > When the cube is rotated such that the back side (gray) is now at the top, the original top side (cyan) moves to the front, the original front side (yellow) moves to the bottom, the original bottom side (magenta) moves to the back, and the original back side (gray) is now at the top. The left and right sides remain unchanged in their relative positions.\n\nTherefore, the right side, which was originally gold, remains gold.\n\nThe color of the right side of the cube is <<<gold>>>."
