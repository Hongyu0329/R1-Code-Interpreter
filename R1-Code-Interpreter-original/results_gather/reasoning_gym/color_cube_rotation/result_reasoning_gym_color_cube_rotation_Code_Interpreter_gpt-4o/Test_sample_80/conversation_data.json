    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides as it undergoes the specified rotations.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Brown\n   - Right: Orange\n   - Front: Red\n   - Left: Yellow\n   - Back: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Green\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Red) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Right: Orange\n     - Front: Green (since the bottom moves to the front)\n     - Left: Yellow\n     - Back: Indigo\n     - Bottom: Brown\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Indigo) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Right: Orange\n     - Front: Red (since the top moves to the front)\n     - Left: Yellow\n     - Back: Brown (since the bottom moves to the back)\n     - Bottom: Green\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Brown) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Brown\n     - Right: Orange\n     - Front: Indigo (since the top moves to the front)\n     - Left: Yellow\n     - Back: Green (since the bottom moves to the back)\n     - Bottom: Red\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the front side of the cube is Indigo.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Indigo>>>"
