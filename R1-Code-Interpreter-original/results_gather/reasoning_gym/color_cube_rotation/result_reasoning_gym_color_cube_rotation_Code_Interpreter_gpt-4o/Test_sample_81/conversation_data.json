    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the colored sides of the cube as it undergoes the specified rotations.\n\nInitially, the cube has the following configuration:\n- Top: Blue\n- Right: Brown\n- Front: Purple\n- Left: Indigo\n- Back: Gray\n- Bottom: Yellow\n\n1. **First Rotation**: The side that was on the left (Indigo) is now on the top.\n   - New configuration:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Right: Brown\n     - Front: Purple\n     - Left: Yellow (was bottom)\n     - Back: Gray\n     - Bottom: Blue (was top)\n\n2. **Second Rotation**: The back side (Gray) is rotated to become the top face.\n   - New configuration:\n     - Top: Gray\n     - Right: Brown\n     - Front: Indigo (was top)\n     - Left: Yellow\n     - Back: Blue (was bottom)\n     - Bottom: Purple (was front)\n\n3. **Third Rotation**: The left side (Yellow) is rotated to become the top face.\n   - New configuration:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Right: Brown\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Left: Purple (was bottom)\n     - Back: Blue\n     - Bottom: Gray (was top)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the front side of the cube is Indigo.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Indigo>>>"
