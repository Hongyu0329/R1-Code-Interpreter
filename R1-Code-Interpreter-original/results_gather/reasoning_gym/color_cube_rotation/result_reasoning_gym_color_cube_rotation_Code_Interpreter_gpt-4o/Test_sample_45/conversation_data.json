    "\nassistant > Initially, the cube has the following configuration:\n\n- Top: Blue\n- Right: Violet\n- Front: Purple\n- Left: Red\n- Back: Indigo\n- Bottom: Gray\n\n1. The cube is rotated so that the front side (Purple) becomes the top. After this rotation, the configuration is:\n\n   - Top: Purple\n   - Right: Violet\n   - Front: Gray (since the bottom becomes the front)\n   - Left: Red\n   - Back: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Blue (since the top becomes the bottom)\n\n2. Next, the front side (Gray) is rotated to become the top. After this rotation, the configuration is:\n\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Right: Violet\n   - Front: Blue (since the bottom becomes the front)\n   - Left: Red\n   - Back: Purple (since the top becomes the back)\n   - Bottom: Indigo (since the back becomes the bottom)\n\nThe color of the back side of the cube is now Purple.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Purple>>>"
