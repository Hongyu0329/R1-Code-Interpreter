    "\nassistant > Initially, the cube has the following configuration:\n\n- Top: Blue\n- Right: Yellow\n- Front: Green\n- Left: Indigo\n- Back: Brown\n- Bottom: Cyan\n\n1. The cube is first rotated so that the right side (Yellow) is now at the top. The new configuration is:\n\n   - Top: Yellow\n   - Right: Cyan (originally the bottom)\n   - Front: Green\n   - Left: Indigo\n   - Back: Brown\n   - Bottom: Blue (originally the top)\n\n2. Next, the cube is rotated to bring the left side (Indigo) to the top. The new configuration is:\n\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: Yellow (originally the top in the previous step)\n   - Left: Blue (originally the bottom in the previous step)\n   - Back: Brown\n   - Bottom: Green (originally the front)\n\nThe color of the top side of the cube is now Indigo.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Indigo>>>"
