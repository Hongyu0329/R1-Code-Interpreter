    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to visualize the cube and its rotations:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Cyan\n   - Bottom: Gold\n   - Front: Purple\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Left: Orange\n   - Right: Green\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The bottom (Gold) becomes the top.\n   - The top (Cyan) becomes the bottom.\n   - The front, back, left, and right sides remain the same.\n\n   After the first rotation:\n   - Top: Gold\n   - Bottom: Cyan\n   - Front: Purple\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Left: Orange\n   - Right: Green\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Green) becomes the top.\n   - The top (Gold) becomes the left.\n   - The left (Orange) becomes the bottom.\n   - The bottom (Cyan) becomes the right.\n   - The front and back sides remain the same.\n\n   After the second rotation:\n   - Top: Green\n   - Bottom: Orange\n   - Front: Purple\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Left: Gold\n   - Right: Cyan\n\nThe color of the back side of the cube is now Magenta.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Magenta>>>"
