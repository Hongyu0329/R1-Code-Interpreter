    "\nassistant > Initially, the cube has the following configuration:\n\n- Top: Magenta\n- Right: Indigo\n- Front: Purple\n- Left: Orange\n- Back: White\n- Bottom: Brown\n\n1. The cube is first rotated so that the right side (Indigo) is now at the top. After this rotation, the configuration is:\n\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Right: Brown (originally the bottom)\n   - Front: Purple\n   - Left: Magenta (originally the top)\n   - Back: White\n   - Bottom: Orange (originally the left)\n\n2. Next, the cube is rotated to place its left side (Magenta) at the top. After this rotation, the configuration is:\n\n   - Top: Magenta\n   - Right: Brown\n   - Front: Indigo (originally the top)\n   - Left: Orange\n   - Back: Purple (originally the front)\n   - Bottom: White\n\nThe color of the back side of the cube is now Purple.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Purple>>>"
