    "\nassistant > To determine the color of the bottom side of the cube after the specified rotations, let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - Top: Green\n   - Right: White\n   - Front: Cyan\n   - Left: Orange\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Bottom: Indigo\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Orange) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Configuration:\n     - Top: Orange\n     - Right: White\n     - Front: Cyan\n     - Left: Indigo (previously bottom)\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Bottom: Green (previously top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Green) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Configuration:\n     - Top: Green\n     - Right: White\n     - Front: Orange (previously top)\n     - Left: Indigo\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Bottom: Cyan (previously front)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Indigo) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Configuration:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Right: Green (previously top)\n     - Front: Orange\n     - Left: Cyan (previously bottom)\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Bottom: White (previously right)\n\nThe color of the bottom side of the cube is now White.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<White>>>"
