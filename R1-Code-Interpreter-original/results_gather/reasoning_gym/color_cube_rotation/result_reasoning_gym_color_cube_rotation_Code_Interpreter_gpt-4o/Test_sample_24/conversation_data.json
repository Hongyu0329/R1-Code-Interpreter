    "\nassistant > To determine the color of the right side of the cube after the specified rotations, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Orange\n   - Right: Indigo\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Left: Gray\n   - Back: Violet\n   - Bottom: Magenta\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Silver) is moved to the top.\n   - New Position:\n     - Top: Silver\n     - Right: Indigo\n     - Front: Magenta (was bottom)\n     - Left: Gray\n     - Back: Orange (was top)\n     - Bottom: Violet (was back)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Indigo) is moved to the top.\n   - New Position:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Right: Magenta (was front)\n     - Front: Silver (was top)\n     - Left: Gray\n     - Back: Orange\n     - Bottom: Violet\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Violet) is moved to the top.\n   - New Position:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Right: Silver (was front)\n     - Front: Indigo (was top)\n     - Left: Gray\n     - Back: Orange\n     - Bottom: Magenta\n\nAfter these rotations, the right side of the cube is now Silver.\n\nThus, the color of the right side of the cube is:\n\n<<<Silver>>>"
