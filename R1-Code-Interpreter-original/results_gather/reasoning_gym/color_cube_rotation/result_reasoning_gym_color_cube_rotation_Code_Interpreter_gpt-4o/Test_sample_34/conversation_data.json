    "\nassistant > To determine the color of the left side of the cube after the specified rotations, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Right: Red\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Left: Silver\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Bottom: Gold\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Red) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Right: Gold (previously bottom)\n     - Front: Violet\n     - Left: Silver\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Bottom: Gray (previously top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Silver) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Silver\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Violet\n     - Left: Gray (previously bottom)\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Bottom: Red (previously top)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Violet) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Right: Gold\n     - Front: Red (previously bottom)\n     - Left: Gray\n     - Back: Silver (previously top)\n     - Bottom: Magenta\n\nAfter these rotations, the left side of the cube is now Gray.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Gray>>>"
