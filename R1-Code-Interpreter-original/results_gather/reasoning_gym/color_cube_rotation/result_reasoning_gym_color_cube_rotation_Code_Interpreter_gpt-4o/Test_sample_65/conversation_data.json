    "\nassistant > To determine the color of the front side of the cube after the specified rotations, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Green\n   - Right: Yellow\n   - Front: Indigo\n   - Left: White\n   - Back: Blue\n   - Bottom: Silver\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was at the back (Blue) is now at the top.\n   - New Position:\n     - Top: Blue\n     - Right: Yellow\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Left: White\n     - Back: Silver\n     - Bottom: Green\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The back (Silver) is now at the top.\n   - New Position:\n     - Top: Silver\n     - Right: Yellow\n     - Front: Blue\n     - Left: White\n     - Back: Green\n     - Bottom: Indigo\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Yellow) is now at the top.\n   - New Position:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Right: Indigo\n     - Front: Blue\n     - Left: Silver\n     - Back: Green\n     - Bottom: White\n\nAfter these rotations, the front side of the cube is Blue.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube is:\n\n<<<Blue>>>"
