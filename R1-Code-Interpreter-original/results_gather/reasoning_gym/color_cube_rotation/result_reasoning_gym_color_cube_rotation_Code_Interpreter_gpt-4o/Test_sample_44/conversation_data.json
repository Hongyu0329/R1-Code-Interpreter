    "\nassistant > Initially, the cube has the following configuration:\n\n- Top: Gray\n- Right: Indigo\n- Front: Cyan\n- Left: Green\n- Back: Orange\n- Bottom: Brown\n\n1. The cube is first rotated so that the front side (Cyan) is now at the top. The new configuration is:\n\n   - Top: Cyan\n   - Right: Indigo\n   - Front: Brown (since the bottom becomes the front)\n   - Left: Green\n   - Back: Gray (since the top becomes the back)\n   - Bottom: Orange (since the back becomes the bottom)\n\n2. Next, the cube is rotated to bring the left side (Green) to the top. The new configuration is:\n\n   - Top: Green\n   - Right: Cyan (since the top becomes the right)\n   - Front: Brown\n   - Left: Orange (since the bottom becomes the left)\n   - Back: Indigo (since the right becomes the back)\n   - Bottom: Gray (since the back becomes the bottom)\n\nThe color of the back side of the cube is now Indigo.\n\n<<<Indigo>>>"
