    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides through the series of rotations described.\n\nInitially, the cube's sides are positioned as follows:\n- Top: Gray\n- Right: Purple\n- Front: Magenta\n- Left: Orange\n- Back: Yellow\n- Bottom: Pink\n\n1. **First Rotation**: The side that was on the right (Purple) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Right: Pink (was Bottom)\n     - Front: Magenta\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Back: Yellow\n     - Bottom: Gray (was Top)\n\n2. **Second Rotation**: The bottom side (Gray) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Gray\n     - Right: Pink\n     - Front: Purple (was Top)\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Back: Yellow\n     - Bottom: Magenta (was Front)\n\n3. **Third Rotation**: The back side (Yellow) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Right: Pink\n     - Front: Gray (was Top)\n     - Left: Orange\n     - Back: Magenta (was Bottom)\n     - Bottom: Purple (was Front)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Orange.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Orange>>>"
