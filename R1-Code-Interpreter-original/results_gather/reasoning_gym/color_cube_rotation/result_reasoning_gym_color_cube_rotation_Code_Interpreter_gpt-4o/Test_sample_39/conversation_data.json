    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides through the series of rotations described.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Orange\n   - Right: Indigo\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Back: Pink\n   - Bottom: Green\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the right (Indigo) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Indigo\n     - Right: Green (was bottom)\n     - Front: Silver\n     - Left: Purple\n     - Back: Pink\n     - Bottom: Orange (was top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The bottom (Orange) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Orange\n     - Right: Green\n     - Front: Indigo (was top)\n     - Left: Purple\n     - Back: Pink\n     - Bottom: Silver (was front)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Purple) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Purple\n     - Right: Green\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Left: Silver (was bottom)\n     - Back: Pink\n     - Bottom: Orange\n\nAfter these rotations, the left side of the cube is now Silver.\n\nThe color of the left side of the cube is <<<Silver>>>."
