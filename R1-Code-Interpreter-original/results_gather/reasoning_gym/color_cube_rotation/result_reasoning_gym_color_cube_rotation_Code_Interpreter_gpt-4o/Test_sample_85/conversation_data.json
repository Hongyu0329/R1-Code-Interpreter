    "\nassistant > To determine the final position of the colors on the cube, let's go through the rotations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Red\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Left: Cyan\n   - Back: Gray\n   - Bottom: White\n\n2. **First Rotation (Right side to Top):**\n   - Top: Gold\n   - Right: White (since the bottom becomes the right)\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Left: Cyan\n   - Back: Gray\n   - Bottom: Red (since the top becomes the bottom)\n\n3. **Second Rotation (Front side to Top):**\n   - Top: Violet\n   - Right: White\n   - Front: Red (since the bottom becomes the front)\n   - Left: Cyan\n   - Back: Gold (since the top becomes the back)\n   - Bottom: Gray (since the back becomes the bottom)\n\n4. **Third Rotation (Left side to Top):**\n   - Top: Cyan\n   - Right: White\n   - Front: Red\n   - Left: Gray (since the bottom becomes the left)\n   - Back: Gold\n   - Bottom: Violet (since the top becomes the bottom)\n\nAfter these rotations, the left side of the cube is now Gray.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<gray>>>"
