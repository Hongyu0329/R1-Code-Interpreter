    "\nassistant > To determine the color of the back side of the cube after the specified rotations, let's analyze the sequence of rotations:\n\n1. Initially, the cube has the following configuration:\n   - Top: Brown\n   - Right: Red\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Left: Cyan\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Bottom: Purple\n\n2. The first rotation is such that the left side (Cyan) is moved to the top. After this rotation, the configuration is:\n   - Top: Cyan\n   - Right: Red\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Left: Purple (previously the bottom)\n   - Back: Magenta\n   - Bottom: Brown (previously the top)\n\n3. The second rotation brings the bottom side (Brown) to the top. After this rotation, the configuration is:\n   - Top: Brown\n   - Right: Red\n   - Front: Purple (previously the left)\n   - Left: Pink (previously the front)\n   - Back: Cyan (previously the top)\n   - Bottom: Magenta (previously the back)\n\nTherefore, the color of the back side of the cube after these rotations is Cyan.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Cyan>>>."
