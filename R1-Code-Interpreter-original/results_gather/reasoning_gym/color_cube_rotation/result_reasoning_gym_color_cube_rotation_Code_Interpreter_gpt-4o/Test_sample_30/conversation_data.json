    "\nassistant > Initially, the cube has the following configuration:\n\n- Top: Gold\n- Right: Cyan\n- Front: Gray\n- Left: Purple\n- Back: Magenta\n- Bottom: Red\n\n1. The cube is first rotated so that the back side (Magenta) is now at the top. The new configuration is:\n\n   - Top: Magenta\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: Gray\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Back: Red\n   - Bottom: Gold\n\n2. Next, the cube is rotated to place its bottom side (Gold) at the top. The new configuration is:\n\n   - Top: Gold\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: Magenta\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Back: Red\n   - Bottom: Gray\n\nTherefore, the color of the top side of the cube is Gold.\n\n<<<Gold>>>"
