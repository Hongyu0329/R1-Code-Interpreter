    "\nassistant > When the cube is rotated such that the bottom side (yellow) is now at the top, the original top side (red) moves to the bottom. The other sides rotate accordingly:\n\n- The original right side (indigo) becomes the new front side.\n- The original front side (silver) becomes the new left side.\n- The original left side (brown) becomes the new back side.\n- The original back side (pink) becomes the new right side.\n\nTherefore, the color of the right side of the cube after the rotation is pink.\n\n<<<pink>>>"
