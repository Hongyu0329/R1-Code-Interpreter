    "\nassistant > To determine the color of the back side of the cube after the specified rotations, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Silver\n   - Bottom: Brown\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Back: Yellow\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Right: Purple\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The bottom (Brown) becomes the top.\n   - The top (Silver) becomes the bottom.\n   - The front, back, left, and right sides remain unchanged.\n   \n   New positions:\n   - Top: Brown\n   - Bottom: Silver\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Back: Yellow\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Right: Purple\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The right side (Purple) becomes the top.\n   - The top (Brown) becomes the left.\n   - The left (Blue) becomes the bottom.\n   - The bottom (Silver) becomes the right.\n   - The front and back remain unchanged.\n   \n   New positions:\n   - Top: Purple\n   - Bottom: Blue\n   - Front: Pink\n   - Back: Yellow\n   - Left: Brown\n   - Right: Silver\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The front (Pink) becomes the top.\n   - The top (Purple) becomes the back.\n   - The back (Yellow) becomes the bottom.\n   - The bottom (Blue) becomes the front.\n   - The left and right remain unchanged.\n   \n   New positions:\n   - Top: Pink\n   - Bottom: Yellow\n   - Front: Blue\n   - Back: Purple\n   - Left: Brown\n   - Right: Silver\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the back side of the cube is Purple.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Purple>>>"
