    "\nassistant > To determine the color of the front side of the cube after the specified rotations, let's analyze the steps:\n\n1. Initially, the cube has:\n   - Top: Violet\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Cyan\n   - Left: Magenta\n   - Back: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Brown\n\n2. The cube is first rotated so that the front side (Cyan) moves to the top. After this rotation, the configuration is:\n   - Top: Cyan\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Brown (since the bottom becomes the front)\n   - Left: Magenta\n   - Back: Violet (since the top becomes the back)\n   - Bottom: Indigo (since the back becomes the bottom)\n\n3. Next, the left side (Magenta) is rotated to become the top. After this rotation, the configuration is:\n   - Top: Magenta\n   - Right: Gold\n   - Front: Cyan (since the top becomes the front)\n   - Left: Indigo (since the bottom becomes the left)\n   - Back: Brown (since the front becomes the back)\n   - Bottom: Violet (since the back becomes the bottom)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the front side of the cube is Cyan.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<cyan>>>"
