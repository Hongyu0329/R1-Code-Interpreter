    "\nassistant > To determine the color of the back side of the cube after the specified rotations, let's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Right: White\n   - Front: Gold\n   - Left: Pink\n   - Back: Blue\n   - Bottom: Violet\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Pink) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Pink\n     - Right: White\n     - Front: Gold\n     - Left: Violet (since the bottom becomes the left)\n     - Back: Blue\n     - Bottom: Gray (since the top becomes the bottom)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Gold) is brought to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Gold\n     - Right: White\n     - Front: Gray (since the bottom becomes the front)\n     - Left: Violet\n     - Back: Pink (since the top becomes the back)\n     - Bottom: Blue (since the back becomes the bottom)\n\nThe color of the back side of the cube after these rotations is Pink.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Pink>>>"
