    "\nassistant > To determine the color of the bottom side of the cube after the specified rotations, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Bottom: White\n   - Front: Blue\n   - Back: Pink\n   - Left: Gold\n   - Right: Violet\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Blue) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Position:\n     - Top: Blue\n     - Bottom: White\n     - Front: White (since the top becomes the front)\n     - Back: Indigo (since the bottom becomes the back)\n     - Left: Gold\n     - Right: Violet\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The front side (White) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Position:\n     - Top: White\n     - Bottom: Indigo (since the top becomes the bottom)\n     - Front: Indigo (since the bottom becomes the front)\n     - Back: Blue\n     - Left: Gold\n     - Right: Violet\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The back side (Blue) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Position:\n     - Top: Blue\n     - Bottom: Gold (since the left becomes the bottom)\n     - Front: Indigo\n     - Back: White\n     - Left: White\n     - Right: Violet\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the bottom side of the cube is Gold.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<gold>>>"
