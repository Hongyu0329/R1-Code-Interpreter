    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides through the series of rotations described.\n\nInitially, the cube's sides are positioned as follows:\n- Top: Purple\n- Right: Violet\n- Front: Gray\n- Left: White\n- Back: Green\n- Bottom: Indigo\n\nLet's go through the rotations step by step:\n\n1. **First Rotation**: The front side (Gray) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Top: Gray\n   - New Front: Indigo (since the bottom becomes the front)\n   - New Bottom: Purple (since the top becomes the bottom)\n   - Other sides remain the same.\n\n2. **Second Rotation**: The back side (Green) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Top: Green\n   - New Back: Purple (since the bottom becomes the back)\n   - New Bottom: Gray (since the top becomes the bottom)\n   - Other sides remain the same.\n\n3. **Third Rotation**: The back side (Purple) is rotated to the top.\n   - New Top: Purple\n   - New Back: Gray (since the bottom becomes the back)\n   - New Bottom: Green (since the top becomes the bottom)\n   - Other sides remain the same.\n\nAfter these rotations, the front side is now the side that was originally the right side, which is Violet.\n\nTherefore, the color of the front side of the cube is:\n\n<<<Violet>>>"
