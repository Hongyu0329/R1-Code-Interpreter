    "\nassistant > To determine the color of the top side of the cube after the specified rotations, let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Top: Indigo\n   - Bottom: Purple\n   - Front: Cyan\n   - Back: Blue\n   - Left: Pink\n   - Right: Red\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The bottom side (Purple) is moved to the top.\n   - New Top: Purple\n   - New Bottom: Indigo\n   - Front, Back, Left, Right remain unchanged.\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Cyan) is moved to the top.\n   - New Top: Cyan\n   - New Front: Indigo (since the previous top, which was Purple, is now the front)\n   - Bottom: Purple\n   - Back: Blue\n   - Left: Pink\n   - Right: Red\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Indigo) is moved to the top.\n   - New Top: Indigo\n   - New Front: Purple (since the previous top, which was Cyan, is now the front)\n   - Bottom: Cyan\n   - Back: Blue\n   - Left: Pink\n   - Right: Red\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the top side of the cube is Indigo.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Indigo>>>."
