    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides through the series of rotations described.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Green\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Left: Blue\n   - Back: White\n   - Bottom: Purple\n\n2. **First Rotation (Left side to Top):**\n   - Top: Blue (was Left)\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Left: Purple (was Bottom)\n   - Back: White\n   - Bottom: Green (was Top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation (Bottom side to Top):**\n   - Top: Green (was Bottom)\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: Blue (was Top)\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Back: White\n   - Bottom: Violet (was Front)\n\n4. **Third Rotation (Back side to Top):**\n   - Top: White (was Back)\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: Green (was Top)\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Back: Violet (was Bottom)\n   - Bottom: Blue (was Front)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Purple.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Purple>>>"
