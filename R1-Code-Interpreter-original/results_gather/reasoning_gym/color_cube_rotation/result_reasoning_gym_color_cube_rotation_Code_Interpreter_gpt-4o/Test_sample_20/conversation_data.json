    "\nassistant > When the cube is rotated such that the bottom side (yellow) is now at the top, the original top side (cyan) moves to the bottom. The original left side (silver) becomes the new front side, the original front side (white) becomes the new right side, the original right side (gold) becomes the new back side, and the original back side (gray) becomes the new left side.\n\nTherefore, the color of the left side of the cube is now gray.\n\n<<<gray>>>"
