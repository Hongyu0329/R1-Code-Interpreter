    "\nassistant > To determine the color of the left side of the cube after the specified rotations, let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Gray\n   - Right: Brown\n   - Front: Yellow\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Back: Blue\n   - Bottom: Indigo\n\n2. **First Rotation (Front to Top):**\n   - Top: Yellow (was Front)\n   - Right: Brown\n   - Front: Indigo (was Bottom)\n   - Left: Purple\n   - Back: Gray (was Top)\n   - Bottom: Blue (was Back)\n\n3. **Second Rotation (Left to Top):**\n   - Top: Purple (was Left)\n   - Right: Brown\n   - Front: Indigo\n   - Left: Blue (was Bottom)\n   - Back: Gray\n   - Bottom: Yellow (was Top)\n\n4. **Third Rotation (Right to Top):**\n   - Top: Brown (was Right)\n   - Right: Yellow (was Bottom)\n   - Front: Indigo\n   - Left: Purple (was Top)\n   - Back: Gray\n   - Bottom: Blue (was Left)\n\nAfter these rotations, the color of the left side of the cube is Purple.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Purple>>>"
