    "\nassistant > When the cube is rotated such that the side which was previously at the back (violet) is now at the top, the side that was previously at the bottom (orange) will move to the back. Consequently, the side that was previously at the front (indigo) will move to the bottom.\n\nTherefore, the color of the bottom side of the cube is indigo.\n\n<<<indigo>>>"
