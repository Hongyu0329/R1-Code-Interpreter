    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides through the series of rotations described.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Magenta\n   - Right: Brown\n   - Front: Silver\n   - Left: Yellow\n   - Back: Gray\n   - Bottom: Red\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Silver) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Silver\n     - Right: Brown\n     - Front: Red (previously bottom)\n     - Left: Yellow\n     - Back: Magenta (previously top)\n     - Bottom: Gray (previously back)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The left side (Yellow) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Yellow\n     - Right: Brown\n     - Front: Red\n     - Left: Gray (previously bottom)\n     - Back: Magenta\n     - Bottom: Silver (previously top)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The front side (Red) is moved to the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Red\n     - Right: Brown\n     - Front: Silver (previously bottom)\n     - Left: Gray\n     - Back: Yellow (previously top)\n     - Bottom: Magenta (previously back)\n\nAfter these rotations, the front side of the cube is now Silver.\n\nThe color of the front side of the cube is <<<Silver>>>."
