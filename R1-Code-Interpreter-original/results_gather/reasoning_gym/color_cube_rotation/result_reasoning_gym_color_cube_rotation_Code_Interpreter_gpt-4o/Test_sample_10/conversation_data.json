    "\nassistant > When the cube is rotated such that the bottom side (cyan) is now at the top, the original top side (pink) moves to the bottom. The other sides rotate accordingly:\n\n- The original front side (orange) becomes the new bottom side.\n- The original back side (indigo) becomes the new front side.\n- The original left side (purple) becomes the new right side.\n- The original right side (gray) becomes the new left side.\n\nTherefore, the new back side of the cube is the original top side, which was pink.\n\nThe color of the back side of the cube is <<<pink>>>."
