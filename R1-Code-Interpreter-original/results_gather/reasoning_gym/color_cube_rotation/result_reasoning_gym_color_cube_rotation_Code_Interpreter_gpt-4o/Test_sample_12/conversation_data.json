    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of the cube's sides through the series of rotations described.\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n   - Top: Orange\n   - Right: Cyan\n   - Front: Violet\n   - Left: Pink\n   - Back: Gray\n   - Bottom: Gold\n\n2. **First Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the left (Pink) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Pink\n     - Right: Cyan\n     - Front: Violet\n     - Left: Gold (was bottom)\n     - Back: Gray\n     - Bottom: Orange (was top)\n\n3. **Second Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the back (Gray) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Gray\n     - Right: Cyan\n     - Front: Pink (was top)\n     - Left: Gold\n     - Back: Orange (was bottom)\n     - Bottom: Violet (was front)\n\n4. **Third Rotation:**\n   - The side that was on the bottom (Violet) is now on the top.\n   - New positions:\n     - Top: Violet\n     - Right: Cyan\n     - Front: Gray (was top)\n     - Left: Gold\n     - Back: Orange\n     - Bottom: Pink (was front)\n\nAfter these rotations, the left side of the cube is Gold.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<gold>>>"
