    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon, we first need to calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon. For a polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the sum of the interior angles is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a pentagon (\\( n = 5 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 3 \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the measure of the remaining interior angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining angle} = 540^\\circ - (157.0^\\circ + 21.0^\\circ + 100.0^\\circ + 117.0^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangles = [157.0, 21.0, 100.0, 117.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a pentagon\ntotal_sum = 3 * 180\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum(angles)\nremaining_angle\nassistant > The measure of the remaining interior angle is <<<145.0>>>."
