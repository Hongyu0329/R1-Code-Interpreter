    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 6-gon, we first need to determine the sum of the interior angles of the hexagon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the measure of the remaining angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nGiven angles: 158.0°, 144.0°, 18.0°, 72.0°, 82.0°\n\nLet's calculate the remaining angle.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangles = [158.0, 144.0, 18.0, 72.0, 82.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a hexagon\ntotal_sum = 720.0\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum(angles)\nremaining_angle\nassistant > The measure of the remaining angle is <<<246>>>."
