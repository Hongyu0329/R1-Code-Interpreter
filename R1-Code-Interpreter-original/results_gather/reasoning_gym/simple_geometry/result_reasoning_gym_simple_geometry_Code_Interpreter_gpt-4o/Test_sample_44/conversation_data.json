    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon, we first need to calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon. For a polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the sum of the interior angles is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a pentagon (\\( n = 5 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 3 \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThe sum of the first four interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n128.0^\\circ + 109.0^\\circ + 61.0^\\circ + 86.0^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThe measure of the remaining interior angle is the difference between the total sum of the interior angles and the sum of the first four angles.
