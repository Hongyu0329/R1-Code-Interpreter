    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 3-gon (triangle), we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Given the first two angles are 34.0° and 105.0°, we can calculate the third angle as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Third angle} = 180° - (34.0° + 105.0°)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 34.0\nangle2 = 105.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nthird_angle = 180 - (angle1 + angle2)\nthird_angle\nassistant > The measure of the remaining angle is <<<41.0>>>."
