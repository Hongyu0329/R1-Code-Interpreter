    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 5-gon, we first need to determine the sum of the interior angles of the polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a 5-gon (\\( n = 5 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 3 \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the measure of the remaining angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining angle} = 540^\\circ - (158^\\circ + 37^\\circ + 10^\\circ + 89^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangles = [158.0, 37.0, 10.0, 89.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a 5-gon\ntotal_sum = 3 * 180\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum(angles)\nremaining_angle\nassistant > The measure of the remaining angle is <<<246>>>."
