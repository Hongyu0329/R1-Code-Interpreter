    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 5 sides, we first need to calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a pentagon (\\( n = 5 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 3 \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the measure of the last interior angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Last angle} = 540^\\circ - (60.0^\\circ + 39.0^\\circ + 147.0^\\circ + 38.0^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangles = [60.0, 39.0, 147.0, 38.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a pentagon\ntotal_sum = 3 * 180\n\n# Calculate the last angle\nlast_angle = total_sum - sum(angles)\nlast_angle\nassistant > The measure of the last interior angle is <<<256>>>."
