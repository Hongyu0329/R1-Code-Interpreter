    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a triangle, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Given the first two angles, we can calculate the third angle as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Third angle} = 180^\\circ - (\\text{First angle} + \\text{Second angle})\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the third angle.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nfirst_angle = 164.0\nsecond_angle = 14.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nthird_angle = 180 - (first_angle + second_angle)\nthird_angle\nassistant > The measure of the remaining interior angle is <<<2.0>>>."
