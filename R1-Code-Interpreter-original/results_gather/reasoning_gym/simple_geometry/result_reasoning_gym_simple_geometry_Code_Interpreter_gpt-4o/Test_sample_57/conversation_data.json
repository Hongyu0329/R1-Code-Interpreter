    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a triangle, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Given the first two angles, we can calculate the third angle as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Third angle} = 180^\\circ - (\\text{First angle} + \\text{Second angle})\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Third angle} = 180^\\circ - (45.0^\\circ + 98.0^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 45.0\nangle2 = 98.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nthird_angle = 180 - (angle1 + angle2)\nthird_angle\nassistant > The measure of the remaining interior angle is <<<37.0>>>."
