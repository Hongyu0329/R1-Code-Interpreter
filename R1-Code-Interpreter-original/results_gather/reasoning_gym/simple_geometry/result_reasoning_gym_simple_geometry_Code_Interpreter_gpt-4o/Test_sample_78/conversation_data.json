    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 6-gon, we first need to determine the sum of the interior angles of the hexagon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the measure of the remaining angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining angle} = 720^\\circ - (163.0^\\circ + 73.0^\\circ + 115.0^\\circ + 133.0^\\circ + 80.0^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangles = [163.0, 73.0, 115.0, 133.0, 80.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a hexagon\ntotal_sum = 720\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum(angles)\nremaining_angle\nassistant > The measure of the remaining angle is <<<156.0>>>."
