    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex quadrilateral, we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon, which is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of sides of the polygon. For a quadrilateral (\\( n = 4 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (4 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThe sum of the given angles is:\n\n\\[\n56.0^\\circ + 52.0^\\circ + 63.0^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThe measure of the last angle is:\n\n\\[\n360^\\circ - (56.0^\\circ + 52.0^\\circ + 63.0^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 56.0\nangle2 = 52.0\nangle3 = 63.0\n\n# Sum of interior angles of a quadrilateral\nsum_of_angles = 360.0\n\n# Calculate the last angle\nlast_angle = sum_of_angles - (angle1 + angle2 + angle3)\nlast_angle\nassistant > The measure of the last interior angle is <<<189>>>."
