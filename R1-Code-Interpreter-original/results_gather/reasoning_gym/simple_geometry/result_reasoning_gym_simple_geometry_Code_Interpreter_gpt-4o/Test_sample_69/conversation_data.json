    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the remaining angle in a convex quadrilateral, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360 degrees. Given the first three angles, we can calculate the fourth angle as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fourth angle} = 360^\\circ - (\\text{First angle} + \\text{Second angle} + \\text{Third angle})\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the fourth angle.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 22.0\nangle2 = 138.0\nangle3 = 64.0\n\n# Calculate the fourth angle\nfourth_angle = 360 - (angle1 + angle2 + angle3)\nfourth_angle\nassistant > The measure of the remaining angle is <<<136.0>>>."
