    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 3 sides (a triangle), we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.\n\nGiven the measures of the first two interior angles are 83.0° and 46.0°, we can calculate the third angle as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Third angle} = 180° - (83.0° + 46.0°)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the third angle.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 83.0\nangle2 = 46.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nthird_angle = 180 - (angle1 + angle2)\nthird_angle\nassistant > The measure of the last interior angle is <<<51.0>>>."
