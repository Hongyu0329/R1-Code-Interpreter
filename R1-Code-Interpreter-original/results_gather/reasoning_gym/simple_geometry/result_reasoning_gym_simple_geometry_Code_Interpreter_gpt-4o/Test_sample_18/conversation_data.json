    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon, we first need to calculate the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon. For a polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the sum of the interior angles is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n(6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the measure of the remaining interior angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining angle} = 720^\\circ - (78^\\circ + 103^\\circ + 72^\\circ + 131^\\circ + 94^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangles = [78.0, 103.0, 72.0, 131.0, 94.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a hexagon\ntotal_sum = (6 - 2) * 180\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum(angles)\nremaining_angle\nassistant > The measure of the remaining interior angle is <<<242>>>."
