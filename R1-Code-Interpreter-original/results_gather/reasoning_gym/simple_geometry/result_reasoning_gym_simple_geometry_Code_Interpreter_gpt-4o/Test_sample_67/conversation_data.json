    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 6 sides, we first need to calculate the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we add up the given interior angles and subtract from the total sum to find the remaining angle.\n\nGiven angles: 107.0°, 61.0°, 163.0°, 55.0°, 68.0°\n\nLet's calculate the remaining angle.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangles = [107.0, 61.0, 163.0, 55.0, 68.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a hexagon\ntotal_sum = 720.0\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum(angles)\nremaining_angle\nassistant > The measure of the remaining interior angle is <<<266.0>>>."
