    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 3-gon (triangle), we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Given the first two angles are 60.0° and 48.0°, we can calculate the third angle as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Third angle} = 180° - (60.0° + 48.0°)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the third angle.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 60.0\nangle2 = 48.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nthird_angle = 180.0 - (angle1 + angle2)\nthird_angle\nassistant > The measure of the remaining angle is <<<72.0>>>."
