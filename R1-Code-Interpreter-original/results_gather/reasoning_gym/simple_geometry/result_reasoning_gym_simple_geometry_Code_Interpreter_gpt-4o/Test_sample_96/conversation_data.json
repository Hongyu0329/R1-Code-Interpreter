    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex quadrilateral, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360 degrees. Given the first three angles, we can calculate the fourth angle by subtracting the sum of the first three angles from 360 degrees.\n\nLet's calculate the remaining angle.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 113.0\nangle2 = 140.0\nangle3 = 103.0\n\n# Sum of interior angles of a quadrilateral\ntotal_sum = 360.0\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - (angle1 + angle2 + angle3)\nremaining_angle\nassistant > The measure of the remaining interior angle is <<<4.0>>>."
