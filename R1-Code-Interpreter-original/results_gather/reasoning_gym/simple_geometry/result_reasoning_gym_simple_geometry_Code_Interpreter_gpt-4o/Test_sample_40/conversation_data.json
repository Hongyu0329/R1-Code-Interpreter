    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a triangle, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Given the first two angles are 43.0° and 97.0°, we can calculate the third angle as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Third angle} = 180^\\circ - (43.0^\\circ + 97.0^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 43.0\nangle2 = 97.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nthird_angle = 180 - (angle1 + angle2)\nthird_angle\nassistant > The measure of the remaining interior angle is <<<40.0>>>."
