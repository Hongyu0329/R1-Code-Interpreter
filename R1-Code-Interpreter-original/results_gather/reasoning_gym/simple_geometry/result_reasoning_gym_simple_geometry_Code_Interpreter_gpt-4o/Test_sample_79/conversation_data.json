    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex quadrilateral, we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a quadrilateral (\\( n = 4 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (4 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n\\]\n\nGiven the measures of the first three interior angles are 90.0°, 136.0°, and 59.0°, we can find the measure of the fourth angle by subtracting the sum of the first three angles from 360°.\n\nLet's calculate the measure of the last interior angle.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 90.0\nangle2 = 136.0\nangle3 = 59.0\n\n# Sum of interior angles of a quadrilateral\nsum_of_angles = 360.0\n\n# Calculate the fourth angle\nangle4 = sum_of_angles - (angle1 + angle2 + angle3)\nangle4\nassistant > The measure of the last interior angle is <<<75.0>>>."
