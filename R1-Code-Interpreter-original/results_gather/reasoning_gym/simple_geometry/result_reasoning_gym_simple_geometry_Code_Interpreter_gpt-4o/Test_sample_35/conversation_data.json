    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 3 sides (a triangle), we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.\n\nGiven the measures of the first two interior angles are 39.0° and 114.0°, we can calculate the third angle as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Third angle} = 180° - (\\text{First angle} + \\text{Second angle})\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the third angle.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nfirst_angle = 39.0\nsecond_angle = 114.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nthird_angle = 180 - (first_angle + second_angle)\nthird_angle\nassistant > The measure of the last interior angle is <<<27.0>>>."
