    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex hexagon, we first need to calculate the sum of the interior angles of the hexagon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the measure of the last interior angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Last angle} = 720^\\circ - (56.0^\\circ + 152.0^\\circ + 65.0^\\circ + 92.0^\\circ + 85.0^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangles = [56.0, 152.0, 65.0, 92.0, 85.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a hexagon\ntotal_sum = (6 - 2) * 180\n\n# Calculate the last angle\nlast_angle = total_sum - sum(angles)\nlast_angle\nassistant > The measure of the last interior angle is <<<270>>>."
