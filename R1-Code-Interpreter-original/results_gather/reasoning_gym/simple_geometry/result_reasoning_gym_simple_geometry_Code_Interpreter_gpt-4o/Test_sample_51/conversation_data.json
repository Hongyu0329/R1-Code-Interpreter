    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon, we first need to calculate the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon. For a polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the sum of the interior angles is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the measure of the remaining interior angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate it.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangles = [127.0, 32.0, 42.0, 106.0, 18.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a hexagon\ntotal_sum = (6 - 2) * 180\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum(angles)\nremaining_angle\nassistant > The measure of the remaining interior angle is <<<395.0>>>."
