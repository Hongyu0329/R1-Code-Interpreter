    "\nassistant > To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex quadrilateral, we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. For a quadrilateral, the sum of the interior angles is \\(360^\\circ\\).\n\nGiven the measures of the first three angles, we can find the fourth angle by subtracting the sum of the first three angles from \\(360^\\circ\\).\n\nLet's calculate the measure of the last interior angle.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 133.0\nangle2 = 89.0\nangle3 = 45.0\n\n# Sum of interior angles of a quadrilateral\nsum_of_angles = 360.0\n\n# Calculate the last angle\nlast_angle = sum_of_angles - (angle1 + angle2 + angle3)\nlast_angle\nassistant > The measure of the last interior angle is <<<93>>>."
