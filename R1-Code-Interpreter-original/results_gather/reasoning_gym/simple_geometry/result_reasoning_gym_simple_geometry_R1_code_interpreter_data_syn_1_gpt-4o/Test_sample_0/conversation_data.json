    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 3 sides (a triangle), we need to use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.\n\nGiven:\n- First angle = 64.0°\n- Second angle = 47.0°\n\nWe need to find the third angle. Let's denote the third angle as \\( x \\).\n\nThe equation for the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is:\n\\[ 64.0 + 47.0 + x = 180 \\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( x \\) by rearranging the equation:\n\\[ x = 180 - (64.0 + 47.0) \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 64.0\nangle2 = 47.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nangle3 = 180 - (angle1 + angle2)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(angle3)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the measure of the last interior angle.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the measure of the last interior angle of the triangle. The sum of the first two angles is 64.0° + 47.0° = 111.0°. Therefore, the third angle is 180° - 111.0° = 69.0°.\n\nThus, the measure of the last interior angle is:\n\n<<<69.0>>>"
