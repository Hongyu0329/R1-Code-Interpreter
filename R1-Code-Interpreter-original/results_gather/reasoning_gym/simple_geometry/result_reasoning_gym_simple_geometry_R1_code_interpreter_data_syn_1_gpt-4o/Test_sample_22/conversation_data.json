    "To find the measure of the remaining angle in a convex quadrilateral, we need to use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360 degrees. Given the first three angles, we can calculate the fourth angle by subtracting the sum of the first three angles from 360 degrees.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the given angles and then subtract it from 360 to find the measure of the remaining angle.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 66.0\nangle2 = 124.0\nangle3 = 94.0\n\n# Sum of the given angles\nsum_of_given_angles = angle1 + angle2 + angle3\n\n# Total sum of angles in a quadrilateral\ntotal_sum_of_angles = 360.0\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum_of_angles - sum_of_given_angles\n\n# Output the remaining angle\nprint(remaining_angle)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the measure of the remaining angle.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the measure of the remaining angle in the quadrilateral. Based on the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral being 360 degrees, the remaining angle is:\n\n<<<76>>>"
