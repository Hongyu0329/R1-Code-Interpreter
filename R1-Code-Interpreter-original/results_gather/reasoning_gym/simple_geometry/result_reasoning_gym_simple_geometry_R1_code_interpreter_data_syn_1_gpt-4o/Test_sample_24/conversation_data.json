    "To solve this problem, we need to recall that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Given that we have a convex 3-gon (which is a triangle), we can use this property to find the measure of the remaining angle.\n\nWe are given two angles of the triangle: 34.0° and 105.0°. Let's denote the third angle as \\( x \\). According to the property of triangles, we have:\n\n\\[ 34.0 + 105.0 + x = 180 \\]\n\nWe can solve this equation to find the value of \\( x \\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 34.0\nangle2 = 105.0\n\n# Sum of angles in a triangle\ntotal_sum = 180.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nangle3 = total_sum - (angle1 + angle2)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(angle3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the measure of the remaining angle.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the measure of the remaining angle. Based on the sum of the interior angles of a triangle, the third angle is:\n\n<<<41.0>>>"
