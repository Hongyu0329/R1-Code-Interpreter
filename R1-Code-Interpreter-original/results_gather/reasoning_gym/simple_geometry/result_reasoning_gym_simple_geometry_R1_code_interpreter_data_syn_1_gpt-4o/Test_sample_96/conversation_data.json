    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ \\]\n\nFor a quadrilateral (\\( n = 4 \\)):\n\n\\[ \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (4 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ \\]\n\nGiven the first three interior angles are 113.0°, 140.0°, and 103.0°, we can find the fourth angle by subtracting the sum of these three angles from 360°.\n\nLet's calculate the remaining angle using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 113.0\nangle2 = 140.0\nangle3 = 103.0\n\n# Total sum of angles in a quadrilateral\ntotal_sum = 360.0\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - (angle1 + angle2 + angle3)\n\n# Output the remaining angle\nprint(remaining_angle)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the remaining angle.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the remaining interior angle of the quadrilateral is 4.0 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining interior angle is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
