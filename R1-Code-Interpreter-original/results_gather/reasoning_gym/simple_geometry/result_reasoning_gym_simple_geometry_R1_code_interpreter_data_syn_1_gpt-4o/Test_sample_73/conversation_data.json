    "To find the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 5-gon, we need to use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a 5-gon (pentagon), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n(5 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 3 \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\nWe are given the first four interior angles: 158.0°, 37.0°, 10.0°, and 89.0°. To find the measure of the remaining angle, we subtract the sum of these four angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the given angles and then find the remaining angle.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangles = [158.0, 37.0, 10.0, 89.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a 5-gon\ntotal_sum = 3 * 180\n\n# Sum of the given angles\nsum_given_angles = sum(angles)\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum_given_angles\n\n# Output the remaining angle\nprint(remaining_angle)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the remaining angle.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the remaining angle in the convex 5-gon is calculated to be 246.0 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the remaining angle is:\n\n<<<246>>>"
