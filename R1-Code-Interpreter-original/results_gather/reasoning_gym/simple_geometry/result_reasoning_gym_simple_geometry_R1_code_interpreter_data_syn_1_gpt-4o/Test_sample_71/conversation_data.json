    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon, we need to use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180\n\\]\n\nFor a hexagon (6-sided polygon), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n(6 - 2) \\times 180 = 720 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\nWe are given the measures of the first 5 interior angles: 65.0°, 29.0°, 164.0°, 41.0°, and 107.0°. To find the measure of the last interior angle, we subtract the sum of these 5 angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the given angles and then find the last angle.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangles = [65.0, 29.0, 164.0, 41.0, 107.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a hexagon\ntotal_sum = (6 - 2) * 180\n\n# Sum of the given angles\nsum_of_given_angles = sum(angles)\n\n# Calculate the last angle\nlast_angle = total_sum - sum_of_given_angles\n\nprint(last_angle)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the measure of the last interior angle.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output indicates that the measure of the last interior angle is 314.0 degrees. However, this result is incorrect because it exceeds the possible range for an interior angle of a convex polygon. Let's re-evaluate the calculation:\n\n1. The sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is 720 degrees.\n2. The sum of the given angles is calculated as follows:\n\n   \\[\n   65.0 + 29.0 + 164.0 + 41.0 + 107.0 = 406.0 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n3. The measure of the last interior angle is:\n\n   \\[\n   720 - 406.0 = 314.0 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\nThe calculation is correct, but the result indicates that the polygon is not convex. A convex polygon cannot have an interior angle greater than 180 degrees. Therefore, there might be an error in the problem statement or the given angles.\n\nGiven the constraints of a convex polygon, the problem as stated is not feasible. However, based on the calculation, the measure of the last interior angle is 314.0 degrees.\n\n<<<314.0>>>"
