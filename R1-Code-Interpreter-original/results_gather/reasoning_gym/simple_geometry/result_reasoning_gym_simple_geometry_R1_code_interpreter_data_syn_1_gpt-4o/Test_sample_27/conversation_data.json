    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon, we need to use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. For a polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the sum of the interior angles is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nIn this case, we have a quadrilateral (4-sided polygon), so the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n(4 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 2 \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n\\]\n\nWe are given the first three interior angles: 31.0°, 127.0°, and 15.0°. To find the measure of the remaining angle, we subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 31.0\nangle2 = 127.0\nangle3 = 15.0\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a quadrilateral\ntotal_sum = 360.0\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - (angle1 + angle2 + angle3)\n\n# Output the remaining angle\nprint(remaining_angle)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the remaining angle.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 187.0. This means the measure of the remaining interior angle of the quadrilateral is 187.0 degrees.\n\n<<<187.0>>>"
