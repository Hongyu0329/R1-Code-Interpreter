    "To find the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 6-gon, we need to use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a 6-gon (hexagon), \\( n = 6 \\), so the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n(6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n\\]\n\nWe are given the first 5 interior angles of the hexagon: 158.0°, 144.0°, 18.0°, 72.0°, and 82.0°. To find the measure of the remaining angle, we subtract the sum of these 5 angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the given angles and then find the remaining angle.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangles = [158.0, 144.0, 18.0, 72.0, 82.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a hexagon\ntotal_sum = 720.0\n\n# Sum of the given angles\nsum_given_angles = sum(angles)\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum_given_angles\n\n# Output the remaining angle\nprint(remaining_angle)\n```",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the remaining angle of the convex 6-gon. The sum of the given angles was subtracted from the total sum of the interior angles of the hexagon to find the measure of the remaining angle.\n\nThe measure of the remaining angle is:\n\n<<<246.0>>>"
