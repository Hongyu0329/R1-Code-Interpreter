    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon, we first need to determine the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon. For a polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the sum of the interior angles is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n(6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNext, we sum the given interior angles and subtract this sum from the total sum of the interior angles to find the measure of the remaining angle.\n\nGiven angles: 143.0°, 148.0°, 39.0°, 55.0°, 107.0°\n\nLet's calculate the sum of these angles and then find the remaining angle.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangles = [143.0, 148.0, 39.0, 55.0, 107.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a hexagon\ntotal_sum = 720.0\n\n# Sum of the given angles\nsum_given_angles = sum(angles)\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum_given_angles\n\n# Output the remaining angle\nprint(remaining_angle)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the measure of the remaining interior angle.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the measure of the remaining interior angle is 228.0 degrees. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<228>>>"
