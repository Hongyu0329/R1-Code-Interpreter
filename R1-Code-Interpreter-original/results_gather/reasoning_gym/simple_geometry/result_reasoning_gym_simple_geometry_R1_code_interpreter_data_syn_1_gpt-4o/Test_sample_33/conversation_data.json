    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon, we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of sides of the polygon. For a hexagon (6-sided polygon), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n(6 - 2) \\times 180 = 720 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\nGiven the measures of the first 5 interior angles, we can find the measure of the last angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of sides of the polygon\nn = 6\n\n# Sum of the interior angles of the polygon\nsum_of_interior_angles = (n - 2) * 180\n\n# Given angles\nangles = [83.0, 83.0, 141.0, 66.0, 123.0]\n\n# Calculate the sum of the given angles\nsum_of_given_angles = sum(angles)\n\n# Calculate the last angle\nlast_angle = sum_of_interior_angles - sum_of_given_angles\n\n# Output the last angle\nprint(last_angle)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the measure of the last interior angle.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the measure of the last interior angle of the hexagon. The sum of the given angles was subtracted from the total sum of the interior angles to find the missing angle.\n\nThe measure of the last interior angle is:\n\n<<<224>>>"
