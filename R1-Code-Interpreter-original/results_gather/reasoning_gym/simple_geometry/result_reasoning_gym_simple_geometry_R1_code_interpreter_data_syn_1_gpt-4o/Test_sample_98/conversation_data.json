    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon, we need to use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180\n\\]\n\nFor a hexagon (6-sided polygon), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n(6 - 2) \\times 180 = 720 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\nWe are given the first 5 interior angles of the hexagon: 79.0°, 122.0°, 127.0°, 15.0°, and 101.0°. To find the remaining angle, we subtract the sum of these 5 angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the given angles and then find the remaining angle.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangles = [79.0, 122.0, 127.0, 15.0, 101.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a hexagon\ntotal_sum = (6 - 2) * 180\n\n# Sum of the given angles\nsum_given_angles = sum(angles)\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum_given_angles\n\nprint(remaining_angle)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the measure of the remaining interior angle.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the measure of the remaining interior angle of the hexagon. The sum of the given angles was subtracted from the total sum of the interior angles to find the missing angle.\n\nThe measure of the remaining interior angle is:\n\n<<<276.0>>>"
