    "To solve this problem, we need to recall that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a triangle (a polygon with 3 sides), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n(3 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nGiven that the first two interior angles of the triangle are 16.0° and 80.0°, we can find the third angle by subtracting the sum of the first two angles from 180°.\n\nLet's calculate the third angle using this information.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 16.0\nangle2 = 80.0\n\n# Total sum of angles in a triangle\ntotal_sum = 180.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nangle3 = total_sum - (angle1 + angle2)\n\n# Output the third angle\nprint(angle3)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the measure of the remaining interior angle.",
