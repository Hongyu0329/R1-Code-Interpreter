    "To solve this problem, we need to recall that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a triangle (a polygon with 3 sides), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n(3 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nGiven that the first two interior angles of the triangle are 45.0° and 98.0°, we can find the third angle by subtracting the sum of the first two angles from 180°.\n\nLet's calculate the third angle using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 45.0\nangle2 = 98.0\n\n# Total sum of angles in a triangle\ntotal_sum = 180.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nangle3 = total_sum - (angle1 + angle2)\n\n# Output the third angle\nprint(angle3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the measure of the remaining interior angle.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the third angle of the triangle. Based on the sum of the interior angles of a triangle being 180°, and given the first two angles are 45.0° and 98.0°, the remaining angle is:\n\n<<<37.0>>>"
