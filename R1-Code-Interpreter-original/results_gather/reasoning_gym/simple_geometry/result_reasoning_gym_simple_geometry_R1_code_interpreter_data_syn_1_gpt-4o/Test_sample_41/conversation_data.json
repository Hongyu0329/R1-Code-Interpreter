    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon, we need to use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles \\( S \\) of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[ S = (n - 2) \\times 180 \\]\n\nFor a polygon with 5 sides (a pentagon), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[ S = (5 - 2) \\times 180 = 3 \\times 180 = 540 \\text{ degrees} \\]\n\nGiven the first four interior angles are 41.0°, 138.0°, 132.0°, and 154.0°, we can find the fifth angle by subtracting the sum of these four angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the given angles and then find the remaining angle.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangles = [41.0, 138.0, 132.0, 154.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a pentagon\ntotal_sum = 3 * 180\n\n# Sum of the given angles\nsum_given_angles = sum(angles)\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum_given_angles\n\nprint(remaining_angle)\n```",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the remaining interior angle of the pentagon. The sum of the given angles was subtracted from the total sum of the interior angles to find the measure of the remaining angle.\n\nThe measure of the remaining interior angle is:\n\n<<<75.0>>>"
