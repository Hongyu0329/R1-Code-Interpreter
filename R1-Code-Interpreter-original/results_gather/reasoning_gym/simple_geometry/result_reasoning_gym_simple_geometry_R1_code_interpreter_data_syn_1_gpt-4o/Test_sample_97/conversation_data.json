    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon, we need to use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles \\( S \\) of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[ S = (n - 2) \\times 180 \\]\n\nFor a polygon with 5 sides (a pentagon), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[ S = (5 - 2) \\times 180 = 3 \\times 180 = 540 \\]\n\nNow, we know the measures of the first four interior angles: 21.0°, 112.0°, 67.0°, and 94.0°. We can find the measure of the fifth angle by subtracting the sum of these four angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate the measure of the remaining angle using Python:\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangles = [21.0, 112.0, 67.0, 94.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a pentagon\ntotal_sum = 3 * 180\n\n# Sum of the given angles\nsum_of_given_angles = sum(angles)\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum_of_given_angles\n\nprint(remaining_angle)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the measure of the remaining interior angle.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the measure of the remaining interior angle. The sum of the given angles is subtracted from the total sum of the interior angles of the pentagon to find the missing angle.\n\nThe measure of the remaining interior angle is:\n\n<<<246>>>"
