    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon, we need to use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles \\( S \\) of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[ S = (n - 2) \\times 180 \\]\n\nFor a hexagon (6-sided polygon), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[ S = (6 - 2) \\times 180 = 720 \\]\n\nGiven the first 5 interior angles, we can find the 6th angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the given angles and then find the remaining angle.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangles = [41.0, 166.0, 113.0, 147.0, 14.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a hexagon\ntotal_sum = (6 - 2) * 180\n\n# Sum of the given angles\nsum_given_angles = sum(angles)\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum_given_angles\n\nprint(remaining_angle)\n```",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the measure of the remaining interior angle is 239.0 degrees. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<239>>>"
