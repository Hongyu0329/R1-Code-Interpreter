    "To find the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 5-gon, we need to use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a 5-gon (pentagon), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n(5 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 3 \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\nGiven the first four interior angles are 26.0°, 120.0°, 151.0°, and 126.0°, we can find the fifth angle by subtracting the sum of these four angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the given angles and then determine the remaining angle.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangles = [26.0, 120.0, 151.0, 126.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a pentagon\ntotal_sum = 3 * 180\n\n# Sum of the given angles\nsum_given_angles = sum(angles)\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum_given_angles\n\n# Output the remaining angle\nprint(remaining_angle)\n```",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the remaining angle of the pentagon. The sum of the given angles was subtracted from the total sum of the interior angles of the pentagon to find the measure of the remaining angle.\n\nThe measure of the remaining angle is:\n\n<<<117.0>>>"
