    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 3 sides (a triangle), we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.\n\nGiven:\n- First angle = 125.0°\n- Second angle = 44.0°\n\nWe need to find the third angle. The formula to find the third angle is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Third angle} = 180° - (\\text{First angle} + \\text{Second angle}) \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nfirst_angle = 125.0\nsecond_angle = 44.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nthird_angle = 180.0 - (first_angle + second_angle)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(third_angle)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the measure of the last interior angle.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the measure of the last interior angle. Based on the sum of the interior angles of a triangle being 180 degrees, the third angle is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Third angle} = 180° - (125.0° + 44.0°) = 11.0° \\]\n\nThus, the measure of the last interior angle is:\n\n<<<11.0>>>"
