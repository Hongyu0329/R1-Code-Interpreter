    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon, we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles \\( S \\) of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[ S = (n - 2) \\times 180 \\]\n\nFor a polygon with 5 sides (a pentagon), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[ S = (5 - 2) \\times 180 = 3 \\times 180 = 540 \\]\n\nGiven the first four interior angles are 93.0°, 60.0°, 71.0°, and 59.0°, we can find the fifth angle by subtracting the sum of these four angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate the fifth angle using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangles = [93.0, 60.0, 71.0, 59.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a pentagon\ntotal_sum = 3 * 180\n\n# Calculate the sum of the given angles\nsum_of_given_angles = sum(angles)\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum_of_given_angles\n\n# Output the remaining angle\nprint(remaining_angle)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the remaining angle.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the measure of the remaining interior angle is 257.0 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<257.0>>>"
