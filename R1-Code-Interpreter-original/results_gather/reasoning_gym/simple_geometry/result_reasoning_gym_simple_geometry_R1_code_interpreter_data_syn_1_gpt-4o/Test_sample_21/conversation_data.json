    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a quadrilateral (\\( n = 4 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (4 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 2 \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n\\]\n\nGiven the measures of the first three interior angles are 17.0°, 19.0°, and 53.0°, we can find the measure of the fourth angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate the measure of the last interior angle:\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 17.0\nangle2 = 19.0\nangle3 = 53.0\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a quadrilateral\ntotal_sum = 360.0\n\n# Calculate the fourth angle\nangle4 = total_sum - (angle1 + angle2 + angle3)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(angle4)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the measure of the last interior angle.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the measure of the last interior angle. Based on the calculations, the measure of the last interior angle in the quadrilateral is 271.0 degrees.\n\n<<<271.0>>>"
