    "To solve this problem, we need to recall that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a triangle (a polygon with 3 sides), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n(3 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nGiven that the first two interior angles of the triangle are 164.0° and 14.0°, we can find the third angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from 180°.\n\nLet's calculate the third angle using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 164.0\nangle2 = 14.0\n\n# Total sum of angles in a triangle\ntotal_sum = 180.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nangle3 = total_sum - (angle1 + angle2)\n\n# Output the third angle\nprint(angle3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the measure of the remaining interior angle.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output indicates that the measure of the remaining interior angle is 2.0 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2.0>>>"
