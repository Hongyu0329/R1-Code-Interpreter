    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a quadrilateral (\\( n = 4 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (4 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n\\]\n\nGiven the measures of the first three interior angles are 31.0°, 108.0°, and 80.0°, we can find the measure of the fourth angle by subtracting the sum of the first three angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate the measure of the last angle using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 31.0\nangle2 = 108.0\nangle3 = 80.0\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a quadrilateral\ntotal_sum = 360.0\n\n# Calculate the fourth angle\nangle4 = total_sum - (angle1 + angle2 + angle3)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(angle4)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the measure of the last interior angle.",
