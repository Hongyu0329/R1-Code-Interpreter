    "To solve this problem, we need to use the property of a convex quadrilateral. The sum of the interior angles of a convex quadrilateral is always 360 degrees. Given the first three angles, we can find the fourth angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from 360 degrees.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the given angles and then subtract it from 360 to find the measure of the remaining angle.\n\nGiven angles:\n- Angle 1 = 33.0°\n- Angle 2 = 133.0°\n- Angle 3 = 157.0°\n\nThe sum of these angles is:\n\\[ \\text{Sum of given angles} = 33.0 + 133.0 + 157.0 \\]\n\nThe measure of the remaining angle is:\n\\[ \\text{Remaining angle} = 360 - \\text{Sum of given angles} \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 33.0\nangle2 = 133.0\nangle3 = 157.0\n\n# Calculate the sum of the given angles\nsum_of_given_angles = angle1 + angle2 + angle3\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = 360 - sum_of_given_angles\n\n# Output the remaining angle\nprint(remaining_angle)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the measure of the remaining angle.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the measure of the remaining angle. Based on the sum of the interior angles of a convex quadrilateral being 360 degrees, the remaining angle is:\n\n<<<37.0>>>"
