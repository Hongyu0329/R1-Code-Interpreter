    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 3 sides (a triangle), we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. \n\nGiven:\n- First angle = 60.0°\n- Second angle = 68.0°\n\nWe need to find the third angle. Let's denote the third angle as \\( x \\).\n\nThe equation for the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is:\n\\[ 60.0 + 68.0 + x = 180 \\]\n\nWe can solve this equation to find \\( x \\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 60.0\nangle2 = 68.0\n\n# Sum of angles in a triangle\ntotal_sum = 180.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nangle3 = total_sum - (angle1 + angle2)\n\n# Output the third angle\nprint(angle3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the measure of the last interior angle.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the measure of the last interior angle of the triangle. \n\nThe sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Given the first two angles are 60.0° and 68.0°, the third angle can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ 180 - (60.0 + 68.0) = 52.0 \\]\n\nTherefore, the measure of the last interior angle is:\n\n<<<52.0>>>"
