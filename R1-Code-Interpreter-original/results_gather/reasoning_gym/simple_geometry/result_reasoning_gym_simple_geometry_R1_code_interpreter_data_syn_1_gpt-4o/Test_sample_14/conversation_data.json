    "To solve this problem, we need to recall that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Given that we have a convex 3-gon (which is essentially a triangle), we can use this property to find the measure of the remaining angle.\n\nThe steps to solve this are as follows:\n1. Sum the given angles.\n2. Subtract the sum of the given angles from 180 degrees to find the measure of the remaining angle.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 112.0\nangle2 = 20.0\n\n# Sum of angles in a triangle\ntotal_sum = 180.0\n\n# Calculate the remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - (angle1 + angle2)\n\n# Output the remaining angle\nprint(remaining_angle)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the measure of the remaining angle.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the measure of the remaining angle as 48.0 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the remaining angle in the triangle is:\n\n<<<48.0>>>"
