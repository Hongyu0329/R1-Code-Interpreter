    "To solve this problem, we need to recall that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle (a polygon with 3 sides) is always 180 degrees. Given two of the interior angles, we can find the third angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from 180 degrees.\n\nLet's denote the angles as follows:\n- Angle 1 = 34.0°\n- Angle 2 = 52.0°\n- Angle 3 = ?\n\nThe formula to find the third angle is:\n\\[ \\text{Angle 3} = 180° - (\\text{Angle 1} + \\text{Angle 2}) \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the third angle using this formula.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 34.0\nangle2 = 52.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nangle3 = 180.0 - (angle1 + angle2)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(angle3)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the measure of the remaining interior angle.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the third angle of the triangle. Based on the sum of the interior angles of a triangle being 180 degrees, and given the first two angles as 34.0° and 52.0°, the remaining angle is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Angle 3} = 180° - (34.0° + 52.0°) = 94.0° \\]\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining interior angle is:\n\n<<<94.0>>>"
