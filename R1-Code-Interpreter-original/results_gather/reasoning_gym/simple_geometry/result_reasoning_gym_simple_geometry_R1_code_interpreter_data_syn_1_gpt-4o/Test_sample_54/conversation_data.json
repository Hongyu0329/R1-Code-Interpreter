    "To solve this problem, we need to use the property of a triangle that states the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Given that we have a convex 3-gon (which is a triangle) and two of its interior angles, we can find the third angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from 180 degrees.\n\nLet's denote the angles as follows:\n- Angle 1 = 13.0°\n- Angle 2 = 27.0°\n- Angle 3 = x (the angle we need to find)\n\nThe equation based on the sum of angles in a triangle is:\n\\[ \\text{Angle 1} + \\text{Angle 2} + \\text{Angle 3} = 180° \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[ 13.0 + 27.0 + x = 180 \\]\n\nWe can solve for x by rearranging the equation:\n\\[ x = 180 - (13.0 + 27.0) \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of x using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 13.0\nangle2 = 27.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nangle3 = 180 - (angle1 + angle2)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(angle3)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the measure of the remaining angle.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the measure of the remaining angle in the triangle. Based on the sum of the interior angles of a triangle being 180 degrees, and given the first two angles as 13.0° and 27.0°, the remaining angle is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ x = 180 - (13.0 + 27.0) = 140.0 \\]\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining angle is:\n\n<<<140.0>>>"
