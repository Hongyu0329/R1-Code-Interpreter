    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon, we need to use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles \\( S \\) of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[ S = (n - 2) \\times 180 \\]\n\nFor a hexagon (6-sided polygon), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[ S = (6 - 2) \\times 180 = 4 \\times 180 = 720 \\]\n\nNow, we know the measures of the first 5 interior angles, which are 119.0°, 36.0°, 26.0°, 103.0°, and 128.0°. We can find the measure of the last interior angle by subtracting the sum of these 5 angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the first 5 angles and then find the last angle.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangles = [119.0, 36.0, 26.0, 103.0, 128.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a hexagon\ntotal_sum = 720\n\n# Sum of the given angles\nsum_of_given_angles = sum(angles)\n\n# Calculate the last angle\nlast_angle = total_sum - sum_of_given_angles\n\nprint(last_angle)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the measure of the last interior angle.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 308.0. This means the measure of the last interior angle of the hexagon is 308.0 degrees.\n\n<<<308>>>"
