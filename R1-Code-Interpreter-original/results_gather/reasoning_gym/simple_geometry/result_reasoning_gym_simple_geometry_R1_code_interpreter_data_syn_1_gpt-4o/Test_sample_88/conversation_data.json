    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a quadrilateral (\\( n = 4 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (4 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n\\]\n\nWe are given the first three interior angles: 58.0°, 160.0°, and 128.0°. To find the fourth angle, we subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate the fourth angle:\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 58.0\nangle2 = 160.0\nangle3 = 128.0\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a quadrilateral\ntotal_sum = 360.0\n\n# Calculate the fourth angle\nangle4 = total_sum - (angle1 + angle2 + angle3)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(angle4)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the measure of the remaining interior angle.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the measure of the remaining interior angle of the quadrilateral. The sum of the given angles (58.0°, 160.0°, and 128.0°) is subtracted from the total sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral (360°) to find the fourth angle.\n\nThe measure of the remaining interior angle is:\n\n<<<14.0>>>"
