    "To find the measure of the remaining angle in a convex quadrilateral, we need to use the property that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360 degrees. Given the first three angles, we can calculate the fourth angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from 360 degrees.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the given angles and then subtract it from 360 to find the measure of the remaining angle.\n\nGiven angles:\n- Angle 1 = 22.0°\n- Angle 2 = 138.0°\n- Angle 3 = 64.0°\n\nThe formula to find the fourth angle is:\n\\[ \\text{Angle 4} = 360° - (\\text{Angle 1} + \\text{Angle 2} + \\text{Angle 3}) \\]\n\nLet's compute this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 22.0\nangle2 = 138.0\nangle3 = 64.0\n\n# Calculate the fourth angle\nangle4 = 360.0 - (angle1 + angle2 + angle3)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(angle4)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the measure of the remaining angle.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 136.0. This means the measure of the remaining angle in the convex quadrilateral is 136.0 degrees.\n\n<<<136.0>>>"
