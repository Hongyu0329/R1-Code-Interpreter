    "To find the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 5-gon, we need to use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a 5-gon (pentagon), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n(5 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 3 \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\nWe are given the first four interior angles: 43.0°, 152.0°, 146.0°, and 87.0°. To find the measure of the remaining angle, we subtract the sum of these four angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the pentagon.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangles = [43.0, 152.0, 146.0, 87.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a pentagon\ntotal_sum = 3 * 180\n\n# Sum of the given angles\nsum_of_given_angles = sum(angles)\n\n# Remaining angle\nremaining_angle = total_sum - sum_of_given_angles\n\nprint(remaining_angle)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the measure of the remaining angle.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the measure of the remaining angle in the convex 5-gon. The sum of the given angles was subtracted from the total sum of the interior angles of the pentagon to find the remaining angle.\n\nThe measure of the remaining angle is:\n\n<<<112.0>>>"
