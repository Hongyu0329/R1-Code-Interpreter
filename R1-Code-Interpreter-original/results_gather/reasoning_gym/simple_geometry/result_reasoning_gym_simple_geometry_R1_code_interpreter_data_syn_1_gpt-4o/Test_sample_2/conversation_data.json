    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon, we need to use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles \\( S \\) of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n\n\\[ S = (n - 2) \\times 180 \\]\n\nFor a polygon with 5 sides (a pentagon), the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[ S = (5 - 2) \\times 180 = 3 \\times 180 = 540 \\]\n\nNow, we know the measures of the first four interior angles: 159.0°, 17.0°, 68.0°, and 17.0°. We can find the measure of the fifth angle by subtracting the sum of these four angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate the measure of the last angle using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangles = [159.0, 17.0, 68.0, 17.0]\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a pentagon\ntotal_sum = 3 * 180\n\n# Sum of the given angles\nsum_of_given_angles = sum(angles)\n\n# Measure of the last angle\nlast_angle = total_sum - sum_of_given_angles\n\nprint(last_angle)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the measure of the last interior angle.",
