    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 3 sides (a triangle), we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. \n\nGiven:\n- First angle = 94.0°\n- Second angle = 83.0°\n\nWe need to find the third angle. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sum of angles} = 180^\\circ \\]\n\nSo, the third angle can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Third angle} = 180^\\circ - (\\text{First angle} + \\text{Second angle}) \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nfirst_angle = 94.0\nsecond_angle = 83.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nthird_angle = 180.0 - (first_angle + second_angle)\n\n# Output the third angle\nprint(third_angle)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the third angle.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output is 3.0. This means the measure of the remaining interior angle of the triangle is 3.0 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3.0>>>"
