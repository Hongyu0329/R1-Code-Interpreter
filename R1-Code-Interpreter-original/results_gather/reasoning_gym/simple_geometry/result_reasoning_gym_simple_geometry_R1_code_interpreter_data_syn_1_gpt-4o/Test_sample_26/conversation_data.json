    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFor a quadrilateral (\\( n = 4 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (4 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n\\]\n\nGiven the first three interior angles are 62.0°, 61.0°, and 20.0°, we can find the fourth angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's calculate the fourth angle:\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 62.0\nangle2 = 61.0\nangle3 = 20.0\n\n# Total sum of interior angles for a quadrilateral\ntotal_sum = 360.0\n\n# Calculate the fourth angle\nangle4 = total_sum - (angle1 + angle2 + angle3)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(angle4)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the measure of the remaining interior angle.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output indicates that the measure of the remaining interior angle is 217.0 degrees. However, since the problem specifies that the polygon is convex, the interior angles must all be less than 180 degrees. The output of 217.0 degrees suggests an error in the input or the problem statement, as a convex quadrilateral cannot have an angle greater than 180 degrees.\n\nGiven the constraints of a convex polygon, let's re-evaluate the problem. The sum of the given angles (62.0°, 61.0°, and 20.0°) is 143.0°. Subtracting this from the total sum of 360° should give a valid angle for a convex quadrilateral.\n\nLet's verify the calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fourth angle} = 360^\\circ - (62.0^\\circ + 61.0^\\circ + 20.0^\\circ) = 360^\\circ - 143.0^\\circ = 217.0^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThe calculation is correct, but the result is not possible for a convex quadrilateral. This suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement or the given angles.\n\nGiven the constraints of the problem, the provided angles do not form a valid convex quadrilateral. Therefore, the problem as stated cannot be solved to yield a valid convex polygon.\n\n<<<The problem statement is incorrect as the angles provided do not form a valid convex quadrilateral.>>>"
