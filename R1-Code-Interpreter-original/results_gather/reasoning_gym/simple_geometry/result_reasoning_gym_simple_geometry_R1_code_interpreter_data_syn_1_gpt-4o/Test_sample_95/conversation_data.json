    "To solve this problem, we need to recall that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle (a polygon with 3 sides) is always 180 degrees. Given that we have two of the angles, 16.0° and 17.0°, we can find the third angle by subtracting the sum of the given angles from 180°.\n\nLet's calculate the third angle using this information.\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle1 = 16.0\nangle2 = 17.0\n\n# Sum of angles in a triangle\ntotal_sum = 180.0\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nangle3 = total_sum - (angle1 + angle2)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(angle3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the measure of the last interior angle.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the measure of the last interior angle. Based on the sum of the interior angles of a triangle being 180 degrees, and given the first two angles as 16.0° and 17.0°, the measure of the last interior angle is 147.0°.\n\n<<<147.0>>>"
