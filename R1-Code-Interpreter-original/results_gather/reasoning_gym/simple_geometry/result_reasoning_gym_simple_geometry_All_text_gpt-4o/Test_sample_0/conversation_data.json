    "To solve this problem, we need to find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon that has 3 sides. A polygon with 3 sides is a triangle. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Given this information, we can find the measure of the last interior angle by following these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the given angles**: We are given two interior angles of the triangle: 64.0° and 47.0°.\n\n2. **Recall the sum of interior angles in a triangle**: The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.\n\n3. **Set up the equation**: To find the measure of the last angle, we can set up the equation based on the sum of the angles:\n   \\[\n   \\text{First angle} + \\text{Second angle} + \\text{Third angle} = 180°\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given angles into the equation:\n   \\[\n   64.0° + 47.0° + \\text{Third angle} = 180°\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the sum of the given angles**: Add the measures of the first two angles:\n   \\[\n   64.0° + 47.0° = 111.0°\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for the third angle**: Subtract the sum of the first two angles from 180° to find the measure of the third angle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Third angle} = 180° - 111.0° = 69.0°\n   \\]\n\n6. **Verify the solution**: Check that the sum of all three angles equals 180°:\n   \\[\n   64.0° + 47.0° + 69.0° = 180.0°\n   \\]\n   The calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the last interior angle is 69.0°.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<69.0>>>"
