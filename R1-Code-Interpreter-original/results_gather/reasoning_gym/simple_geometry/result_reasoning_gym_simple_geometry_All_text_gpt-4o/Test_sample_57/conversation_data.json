    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 3 sides, which is a triangle. Here are the steps to find the solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Properties of a Triangle:**\n   - A triangle is a polygon with three sides.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.\n\n2. **Identify the Given Angles:**\n   - We are given two interior angles of the triangle: 45.0° and 98.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles:**\n   - Add the two given angles together: \n     \\[\n     45.0° + 98.0° = 143.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Measure of the Remaining Angle:**\n   - Since the sum of all interior angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, subtract the sum of the given angles from 180 degrees to find the remaining angle:\n     \\[\n     180° - 143.0° = 37.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Check that the sum of all three angles equals 180 degrees:\n     \\[\n     45.0° + 98.0° + 37.0° = 180.0°\n     \\]\n   - The calculation is correct.\n\n6. **Conclude with the Final Answer:**\n   - The measure of the remaining interior angle is 37.0 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<37.0>>>"
