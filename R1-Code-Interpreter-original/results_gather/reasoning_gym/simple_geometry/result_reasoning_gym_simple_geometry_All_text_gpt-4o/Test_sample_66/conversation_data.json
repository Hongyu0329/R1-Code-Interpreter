    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 5 sides (a pentagon), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**\n   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n   For a pentagon (\\( n = 5 \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 3 \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum the given interior angles:**\n   The first four interior angles of the pentagon are given as 157.0°, 21.0°, 100.0°, and 117.0°. We need to find their sum:\n   \\[\n   157.0^\\circ + 21.0^\\circ + 100.0^\\circ + 117.0^\\circ = 395.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the remaining interior angle:**\n   To find the measure of the remaining interior angle, subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the pentagon:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining angle} = 540^\\circ - 395.0^\\circ = 145.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining interior angle is 145.0°.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<145.0>>>"
