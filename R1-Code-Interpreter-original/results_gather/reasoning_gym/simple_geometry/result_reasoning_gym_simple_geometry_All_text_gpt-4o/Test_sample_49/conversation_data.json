    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 6 sides, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a convex hexagon (6-sided polygon) with 5 known interior angles. We need to find the measure of the 6th interior angle.\n\n2. **Sum of Interior Angles Formula**: The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n   For a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles**: Add the measures of the first 5 interior angles:\n   \\[\n   96.0^\\circ + 152.0^\\circ + 146.0^\\circ + 108.0^\\circ + 132.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 634.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the Remaining Angle**: Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles to find the measure of the remaining angle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining angle} = 720^\\circ - 634.0^\\circ = 86.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The measure of the remaining interior angle is 86.0°.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<86.0>>>"
