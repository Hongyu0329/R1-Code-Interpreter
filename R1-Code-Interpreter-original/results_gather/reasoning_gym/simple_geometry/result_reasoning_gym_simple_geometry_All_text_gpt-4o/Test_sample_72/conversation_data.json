    "To solve this problem, we need to find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 3 sides, which is a triangle. Here are the steps to find the solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Properties of a Triangle:**\n   - A triangle is a polygon with 3 sides.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.\n\n2. **Identify the Given Information:**\n   - We are given two interior angles of the triangle: 60.0° and 68.0°.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - Let the measure of the third angle be \\( x \\).\n   - According to the property of triangles, the sum of the interior angles is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     60.0 + 68.0 + x = 180\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for the Unknown Angle:**\n   - Combine the known angles:\n     \\[\n     60.0 + 68.0 = 128.0\n     \\]\n   - Substitute this back into the equation:\n     \\[\n     128.0 + x = 180\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( x \\) by subtracting 128.0 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     x = 180 - 128.0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 52.0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The measure of the last interior angle is 52.0 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<52.0>>>"
