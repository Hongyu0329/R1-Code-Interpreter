    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of a quadrilateral**: A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360 degrees.\n\n2. **Given angles**: We are provided with three of the four interior angles of the quadrilateral:\n   - First angle = 58.0°\n   - Second angle = 160.0°\n   - Third angle = 128.0°\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of the given angles**: Add the measures of the three given angles.\n   \\[\n   58.0° + 160.0° + 128.0° = 346.0°\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the measure of the remaining angle**: Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral.\n   \\[\n   360° - 346.0° = 14.0°\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The measure of the remaining interior angle is 14.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining interior angle is:\n\n<<<14.0>>>"
