    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a quadrilateral with three known interior angles: 62.0°, 61.0°, and 20.0°. We need to find the measure of the fourth angle.\n\n2. **Sum of Interior Angles of a Quadrilateral**: The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360°. This is a key property of quadrilaterals.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles**: Add the measures of the three given angles:\n   \\[\n   62.0° + 61.0° + 20.0° = 143.0°\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the Measure of the Remaining Angle**: Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral:\n   \\[\n   360° - 143.0° = 217.0°\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The measure of the remaining interior angle is 217.0°.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<217.0>>>"
