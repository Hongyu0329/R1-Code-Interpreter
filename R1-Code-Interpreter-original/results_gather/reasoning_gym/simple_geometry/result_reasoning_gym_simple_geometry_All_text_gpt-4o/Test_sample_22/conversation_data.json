    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex quadrilateral, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of a convex quadrilateral:**\n   - A convex quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon where all interior angles are less than 180°.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360°.\n\n2. **Identify the given angles:**\n   - The first three interior angles of the quadrilateral are given as 66.0°, 124.0°, and 94.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of the given angles:**\n   - Add the measures of the first three angles: \n     \\[\n     66.0° + 124.0° + 94.0° = 284.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the measure of the remaining angle:**\n   - Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral:\n     \\[\n     360.0° - 284.0° = 76.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the result:**\n   - Ensure that the calculated angle is less than 180°, which confirms that the quadrilateral is convex. In this case, 76.0° is indeed less than 180°.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the measure of the remaining angle in the quadrilateral.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<76.0>>>."
