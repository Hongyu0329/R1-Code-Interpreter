    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 3-gon (triangle), we need to use the property that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a triangle with two known interior angles: 34.0° and 105.0°. We need to find the measure of the third angle.\n\n2. **Recall the Triangle Angle Sum Property**: The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. This is a fundamental property of triangles.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation**: Let the measure of the third angle be \\( x \\). According to the angle sum property, we have:\n   \\[\n   34.0° + 105.0° + x = 180°\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for the Unknown Angle**:\n   - First, add the two given angles:\n     \\[\n     34.0° + 105.0° = 139.0°\n     \\]\n   - Next, subtract the sum of the known angles from 180° to find the unknown angle:\n     \\[\n     x = 180° - 139.0° = 41.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: Check that the sum of all three angles equals 180°:\n   \\[\n   34.0° + 105.0° + 41.0° = 180.0°\n   \\]\n   The calculation is correct, confirming that the measure of the third angle is indeed 41.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining angle is:\n\n<<<41.0>>>"
