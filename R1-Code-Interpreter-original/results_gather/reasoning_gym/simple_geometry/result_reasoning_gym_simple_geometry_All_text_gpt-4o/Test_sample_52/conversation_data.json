    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 5-gon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of a polygon:**\n   - A convex polygon is a polygon where all interior angles are less than 180°.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180°\n     \\]\n\n2. **Apply the formula to a 5-gon:**\n   - For a 5-gon (pentagon), \\( n = 5 \\).\n   - Therefore, the sum of the interior angles is:\n     \\[\n     (5 - 2) \\times 180° = 3 \\times 180° = 540°\n     \\]\n\n3. **Sum the given angles:**\n   - The first four interior angles are given as 19.0°, 135.0°, 11.0°, and 143.0°.\n   - Calculate the sum of these angles:\n     \\[\n     19.0° + 135.0° + 11.0° + 143.0° = 308.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the remaining angle:**\n   - The sum of all five interior angles must be 540°.\n   - Therefore, the measure of the remaining angle is:\n     \\[\n     540° - 308.0° = 232.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Ensure that the calculated remaining angle (232.0°) is less than 180° to confirm that the polygon is convex. However, since the problem states it is a convex polygon, this step is more of a verification.\n\nThus, the measure of the remaining angle is:\n\n<<<232.0>>>"
