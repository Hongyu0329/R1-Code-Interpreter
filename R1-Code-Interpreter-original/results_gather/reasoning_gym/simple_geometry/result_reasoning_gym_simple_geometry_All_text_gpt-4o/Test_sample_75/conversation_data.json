    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Sum of Interior Angles**: \n   - For any polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the sum of the interior angles is given by the formula: \n     \\[\n     (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Since we have a quadrilateral (4 sides), substitute \\( n = 4 \\) into the formula:\n     \\[\n     (4 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 2 \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \\( 360^\\circ \\).\n\n2. **Sum of Given Angles**:\n   - We are given the measures of the first three interior angles: \\( 133.0^\\circ \\), \\( 89.0^\\circ \\), and \\( 45.0^\\circ \\).\n   - Calculate the sum of these angles:\n     \\[\n     133.0^\\circ + 89.0^\\circ + 45.0^\\circ = 267.0^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the Measure of the Last Angle**:\n   - Since the total sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral is \\( 360^\\circ \\), the measure of the last angle can be found by subtracting the sum of the given angles from \\( 360^\\circ \\):\n     \\[\n     360^\\circ - 267.0^\\circ = 93.0^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The measure of the last interior angle is \\( 93.0^\\circ \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<93>>>"
