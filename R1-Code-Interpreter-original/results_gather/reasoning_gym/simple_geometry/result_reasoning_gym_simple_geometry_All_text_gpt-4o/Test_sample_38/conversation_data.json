    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 3 sides (a triangle), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of a triangle:**\n   - A triangle is a polygon with 3 sides.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.\n\n2. **Identify the given angles:**\n   - The measures of the first two interior angles are given as 125.0° and 44.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of the given angles:**\n   - Add the measures of the first two angles: \n     \\[\n     125.0° + 44.0° = 169.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the measure of the last angle:**\n   - Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of a triangle:\n     \\[\n     180° - 169.0° = 11.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the calculation:**\n   - Check that the sum of all three angles equals 180°:\n     \\[\n     125.0° + 44.0° + 11.0° = 180.0°\n     \\]\n   - The calculation is correct.\n\nThe measure of the last interior angle is 11.0°.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<11.0>>>"
