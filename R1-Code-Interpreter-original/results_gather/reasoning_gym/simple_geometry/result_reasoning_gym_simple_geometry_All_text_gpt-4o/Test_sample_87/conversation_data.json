    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 5 sides (a pentagon), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a pentagon with 5 sides and 4 of its interior angles. We need to find the measure of the 5th angle.\n\n2. **Sum of Interior Angles of a Polygon**: The formula to find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n   For a pentagon (\\( n = 5 \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 3 \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Given Angles**: The first four interior angles of the pentagon are given as 56.0°, 147.0°, 151.0°, and 120.0°.\n\n4. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles**: Add the measures of the given angles:\n   \\[\n   56.0^\\circ + 147.0^\\circ + 151.0^\\circ + 120.0^\\circ = 474.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the Remaining Angle**: Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the pentagon:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining angle} = 540^\\circ - 474.0^\\circ = 66.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The measure of the remaining interior angle is 66.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining interior angle is:\n\n<<<66.0>>>"
