    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Sum of Interior Angles**: \n   - For any polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the sum of the interior angles is given by the formula: \n     \\[\n     (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Since this is a quadrilateral (\\( n = 4 \\)), the sum of the interior angles is:\n     \\[\n     (4 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 2 \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n2. **Sum of Given Angles**:\n   - The measures of the first three interior angles are given as 26.0°, 70.0°, and 128.0°.\n   - Calculate the sum of these angles:\n     \\[\n     26.0^\\circ + 70.0^\\circ + 128.0^\\circ = 224.0^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Last Angle**:\n   - The sum of all four interior angles must be 360°.\n   - Therefore, the measure of the last angle is:\n     \\[\n     360^\\circ - 224.0^\\circ = 136.0^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The measure of the last interior angle is 136.0°.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<136.0>>>"
