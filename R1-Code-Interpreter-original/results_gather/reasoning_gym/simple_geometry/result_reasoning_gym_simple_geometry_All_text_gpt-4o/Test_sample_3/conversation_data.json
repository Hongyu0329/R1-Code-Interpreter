    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 5 sides, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a convex polygon with 5 sides, which is a pentagon. We know the measures of the first four interior angles and need to find the measure of the fifth angle.\n\n2. **Sum of Interior Angles Formula**: The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n   For a pentagon (\\( n = 5 \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 3 \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles**: Add the measures of the first four interior angles:\n   \\[\n   43.0^\\circ + 97.0^\\circ + 49.0^\\circ + 83.0^\\circ = 272.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the Measure of the Last Angle**: Subtract the sum of the first four angles from the total sum of the interior angles to find the measure of the fifth angle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Measure of the last angle} = 540^\\circ - 272.0^\\circ = 268.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The measure of the last interior angle is 268.0°.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<268.0>>>"
