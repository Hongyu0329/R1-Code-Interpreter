    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 6 sides, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a convex hexagon (6-sided polygon) and the measures of 5 of its interior angles. We need to find the measure of the 6th interior angle.\n\n2. **Sum of Interior Angles Formula**: The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n   For a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles**: Add the measures of the 5 given interior angles:\n   \\[\n   79.0^\\circ + 122.0^\\circ + 127.0^\\circ + 15.0^\\circ + 101.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 444.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the Measure of the Remaining Angle**: Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the hexagon:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining angle} = 720^\\circ - 444.0^\\circ = 276.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The measure of the remaining interior angle is 276.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining interior angle is:\n\n<<<276.0>>>"
