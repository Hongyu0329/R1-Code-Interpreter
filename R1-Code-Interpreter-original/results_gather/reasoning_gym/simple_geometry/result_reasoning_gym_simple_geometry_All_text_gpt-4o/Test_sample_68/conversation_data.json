    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex quadrilateral, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of a convex quadrilateral:**\n   - A convex quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon where all interior angles are less than 180°.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360°.\n\n2. **Identify the given angles:**\n   - We are given three interior angles of the quadrilateral: 127.0°, 126.0°, and 54.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of the given angles:**\n   - Add the three given angles together:\n     \\[\n     127.0° + 126.0° + 54.0° = 307.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the measure of the remaining angle:**\n   - Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral:\n     \\[\n     360° - 307.0° = 53.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Ensure that the calculated angle is less than 180°, which confirms that the quadrilateral is convex. In this case, 53.0° is indeed less than 180°.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the measure of the remaining angle.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<53.0>>>."
