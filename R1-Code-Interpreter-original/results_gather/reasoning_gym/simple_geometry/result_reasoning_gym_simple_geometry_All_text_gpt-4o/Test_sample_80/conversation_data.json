    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 6-gon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a convex 6-gon (hexagon) with five of its interior angles specified. We need to find the measure of the sixth angle.\n\n2. **Sum of Interior Angles of a Polygon**: The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n   For a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles**: Add the measures of the five given angles:\n   \\[\n   158.0^\\circ + 168.0^\\circ + 86.0^\\circ + 129.0^\\circ + 117.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 658.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Measure of the Remaining Angle**: Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the hexagon:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining angle} = 720^\\circ - 658.0^\\circ = 62.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The measure of the remaining angle is 62.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining angle is:\n\n<<<62>>>"
