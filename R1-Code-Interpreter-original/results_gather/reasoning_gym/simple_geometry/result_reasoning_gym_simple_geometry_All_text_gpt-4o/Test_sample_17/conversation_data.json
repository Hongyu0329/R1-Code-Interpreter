    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 3-gon (triangle), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Properties of a Triangle:**\n   - A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.\n\n2. **Identify the Given Angles:**\n   - We are given two interior angles of the triangle: 38.0° and 92.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles:**\n   - Add the two given angles together: \n     \\[\n     38.0° + 92.0° = 130.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Measure of the Remaining Angle:**\n   - Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of a triangle (180°):\n     \\[\n     180° - 130.0° = 50.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Ensure that the sum of all three angles equals 180°:\n     \\[\n     38.0° + 92.0° + 50.0° = 180.0°\n     \\]\n   - The calculation is correct, confirming that the measure of the remaining angle is accurate.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the measure of the remaining angle in the triangle.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<50.0>>>."
