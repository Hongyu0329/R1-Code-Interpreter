    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of a quadrilateral:**\n   - A quadrilateral is a polygon with 4 sides.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360°.\n\n2. **List the given angles:**\n   - The measures of the first three interior angles are given as 31.0°, 108.0°, and 80.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of the given angles:**\n   - Add the measures of the first three angles: \n     \\[\n     31.0° + 108.0° + 80.0° = 219.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the measure of the last angle:**\n   - Since the sum of all interior angles in a quadrilateral is 360°, subtract the sum of the given angles from 360° to find the measure of the last angle:\n     \\[\n     360° - 219.0° = 141.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the calculation:**\n   - Double-check the addition and subtraction to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. **Conclude with the final answer:**\n   - The measure of the last interior angle is 141.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the last interior angle is:\n\n<<<141.0>>>"
