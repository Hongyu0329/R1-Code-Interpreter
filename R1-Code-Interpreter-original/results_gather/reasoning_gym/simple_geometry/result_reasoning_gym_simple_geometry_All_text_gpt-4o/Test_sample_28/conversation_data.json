    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 5 sides, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a convex polygon with 5 sides, which is a pentagon. We know the measures of the first four interior angles: 82.0°, 157.0°, 49.0°, and 77.0°. We need to find the measure of the fifth interior angle.\n\n2. **Sum of Interior Angles of a Polygon**: The formula to find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180°\n   \\]\n   For a pentagon (\\( n = 5 \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \\times 180° = 3 \\times 180° = 540°\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles**: Add the measures of the first four interior angles:\n   \\[\n   82.0° + 157.0° + 49.0° + 77.0° = 365.0°\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the Remaining Angle**: Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the pentagon:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining angle} = 540° - 365.0° = 175.0°\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The measure of the remaining interior angle is 175.0°.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<175.0>>>"
