    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Sum of Interior Angles**: \n   - For any polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the sum of the interior angles is given by the formula: \n     \\[\n     (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Since we have a quadrilateral (4 sides), the sum of the interior angles is:\n     \\[\n     (4 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 2 \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n2. **Sum of Given Angles**:\n   - We are given three of the four interior angles: 167.0°, 37.0°, and 92.0°.\n   - Calculate the sum of these three angles:\n     \\[\n     167.0^\\circ + 37.0^\\circ + 92.0^\\circ = 296.0^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Remaining Angle**:\n   - Since the total sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral is 360°, the remaining angle can be found by subtracting the sum of the given angles from 360°:\n     \\[\n     360^\\circ - 296.0^\\circ = 64.0^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The measure of the remaining interior angle is 64.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining interior angle is:\n\n<<<64>>>"
