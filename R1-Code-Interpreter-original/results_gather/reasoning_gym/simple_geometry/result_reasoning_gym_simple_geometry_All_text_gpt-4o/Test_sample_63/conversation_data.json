    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Sum of Interior Angles**: \n   - For any polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the sum of the interior angles is given by the formula: \n     \\[\n     (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Since we have a quadrilateral (4 sides), the sum of the interior angles is:\n     \\[\n     (4 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 2 \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n2. **Sum of Given Angles**:\n   - We are given three interior angles: 136.0°, 17.0°, and 45.0°.\n   - Calculate the sum of these angles:\n     \\[\n     136.0^\\circ + 17.0^\\circ + 45.0^\\circ = 198.0^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Remaining Angle**:\n   - The sum of all four interior angles must be 360°.\n   - Therefore, the measure of the remaining angle is:\n     \\[\n     360^\\circ - 198.0^\\circ = 162.0^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The measure of the remaining interior angle is 162.0°.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<162.0>>>"
