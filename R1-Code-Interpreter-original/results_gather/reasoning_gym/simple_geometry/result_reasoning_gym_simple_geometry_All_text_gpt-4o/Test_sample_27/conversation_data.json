    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Sum of Interior Angles**: \n   - For any polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the sum of the interior angles is given by the formula: \n     \\[\n     (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Since we have a quadrilateral (4 sides), the sum of the interior angles is:\n     \\[\n     (4 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 2 \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n2. **List the Given Angles**:\n   - The first three interior angles of the quadrilateral are given as 31.0°, 127.0°, and 15.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles**:\n   - Add the measures of the first three angles:\n     \\[\n     31.0^\\circ + 127.0^\\circ + 15.0^\\circ = 173.0^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Remaining Angle**:\n   - Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral:\n     \\[\n     360^\\circ - 173.0^\\circ = 187.0^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - Ensure that the calculated remaining angle, when added to the given angles, equals the total sum of the interior angles:\n     \\[\n     31.0^\\circ + 127.0^\\circ + 15.0^\\circ + 187.0^\\circ = 360.0^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - The calculation is correct.\n\nThe measure of the remaining interior angle is therefore:\n\n<<<187.0>>>"
