    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of a quadrilateral:**\n   - A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360 degrees.\n\n2. **Given information:**\n   - The first three interior angles of the quadrilateral are given as 138.0°, 151.0°, and 51.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of the given angles:**\n   - Add the measures of the first three angles: \n     \\[\n     138.0° + 151.0° + 51.0° = 340.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the measure of the remaining angle:**\n   - Since the sum of all interior angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees, subtract the sum of the given angles from 360 degrees to find the measure of the remaining angle:\n     \\[\n     360.0° - 340.0° = 20.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The measure of the remaining interior angle is 20.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining interior angle is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
