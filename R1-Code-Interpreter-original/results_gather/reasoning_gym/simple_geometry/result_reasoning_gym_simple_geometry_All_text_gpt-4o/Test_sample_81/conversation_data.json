    "To solve this problem, we need to find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon that has 3 sides. A polygon with 3 sides is a triangle. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. \n\nLet's break down the steps to find the measure of the last interior angle:\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - The polygon is a triangle (3 sides).\n   - The measures of the first two interior angles are 80.0° and 14.0°.\n\n2. **Recall the property of a triangle:**\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.\n\n3. **Set up the equation:**\n   - Let the measure of the last interior angle be \\( x \\).\n   - According to the property of triangles, we have:\n     \\[\n     80.0 + 14.0 + x = 180\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - First, add the measures of the first two angles:\n     \\[\n     80.0 + 14.0 = 94.0\n     \\]\n   - Substitute this sum into the equation:\n     \\[\n     94.0 + x = 180\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( x \\) by subtracting 94.0 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     x = 180 - 94.0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 86.0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The measure of the last interior angle is 86.0 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<86.0>>>"
