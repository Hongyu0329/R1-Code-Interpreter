    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of a quadrilateral**: A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360 degrees.\n\n2. **Identify the given angles**: We are given the measures of the first three interior angles of the quadrilateral: 89.0°, 35.0°, and 102.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of the given angles**: Add the measures of the first three angles to find their total sum.\n   \\[\n   89.0° + 35.0° + 102.0° = 226.0°\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the measure of the last angle**: Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral to find the measure of the last angle.\n   \\[\n   360° - 226.0° = 134.0°\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the calculation**: Ensure that the sum of all four angles equals 360 degrees to confirm the calculation is correct.\n   \\[\n   89.0° + 35.0° + 102.0° + 134.0° = 360.0°\n   \\]\n\nThe measure of the last interior angle is therefore 134.0°.\n\nFinal answer: <<<134.0>>>"
