    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 5 sides (a pentagon), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**\n   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n   For a pentagon (\\( n = 5 \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 3 \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n2. **List the given interior angles:**\n   The first four interior angles of the pentagon are given as:\n   - First angle: \\( 21.0^\\circ \\)\n   - Second angle: \\( 112.0^\\circ \\)\n   - Third angle: \\( 67.0^\\circ \\)\n   - Fourth angle: \\( 94.0^\\circ \\)\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of the given angles:**\n   Add the measures of the first four angles:\n   \\[\n   21.0^\\circ + 112.0^\\circ + 67.0^\\circ + 94.0^\\circ = 294.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the measure of the remaining angle:**\n   Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the pentagon:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining angle} = 540^\\circ - 294.0^\\circ = 246.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the calculation:**\n   Ensure that the calculated remaining angle, when added to the sum of the given angles, equals the total sum of the interior angles:\n   \\[\n   294.0^\\circ + 246.0^\\circ = 540.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n   This confirms that the calculation is correct.\n\nThe measure of the remaining interior angle is \\( 246.0^\\circ \\).\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<246.0>>>"
