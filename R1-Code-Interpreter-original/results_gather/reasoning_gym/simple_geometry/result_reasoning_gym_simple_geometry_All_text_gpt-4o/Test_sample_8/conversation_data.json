    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 6-gon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a convex 6-gon (hexagon) with five of its interior angles specified. We need to find the measure of the sixth angle.\n\n2. **Sum of Interior Angles of a Polygon**: The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n   For a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles**: Add the measures of the five given angles:\n   \\[\n   158.0^\\circ + 144.0^\\circ + 18.0^\\circ + 72.0^\\circ + 82.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 474.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Measure of the Remaining Angle**: Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the hexagon:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining angle} = 720^\\circ - 474.0^\\circ = 246.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify Convexity**: Ensure that the calculated angle is consistent with the property of a convex polygon, where each interior angle must be less than \\( 180^\\circ \\). However, since the calculated angle is \\( 246.0^\\circ \\), it indicates a mistake in the assumption of convexity or the given angles. A convex polygon cannot have an interior angle greater than \\( 180^\\circ \\).\n\n6. **Re-evaluate the Problem**: Given the calculated angle exceeds \\( 180^\\circ \\), it suggests that the polygon is not convex, or there is an error in the given angles. However, based on the problem statement, we proceed with the calculation as is.\n\nThe measure of the remaining angle is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{246.0^\\circ}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<246>>>"
