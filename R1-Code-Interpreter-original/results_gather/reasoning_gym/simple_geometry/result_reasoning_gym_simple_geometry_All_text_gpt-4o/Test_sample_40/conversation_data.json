    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 3 sides, which is a triangle. Here are the steps to find the solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Properties of a Triangle:**\n   - A triangle is a polygon with three sides.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.\n\n2. **Identify the Given Angles:**\n   - We are given two interior angles of the triangle: 43.0° and 97.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles:**\n   - Add the two given angles together: \n     \\[\n     43.0° + 97.0° = 140.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Measure of the Remaining Angle:**\n   - Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of a triangle:\n     \\[\n     180° - 140.0° = 40.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The measure of the remaining interior angle is 40.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining interior angle is:\n\n<<<40>>>"
