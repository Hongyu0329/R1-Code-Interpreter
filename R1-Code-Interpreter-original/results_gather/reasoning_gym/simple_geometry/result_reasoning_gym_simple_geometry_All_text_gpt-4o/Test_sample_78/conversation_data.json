    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 6-gon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a convex 6-gon (hexagon) with five known interior angles. We need to find the measure of the sixth angle.\n\n2. **Sum of Interior Angles Formula**: For any n-sided polygon, the sum of the interior angles is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n   For a hexagon (n = 6), the sum of the interior angles is:\n   \\[\n   (6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles**: Add up the measures of the five given angles:\n   \\[\n   163.0^\\circ + 73.0^\\circ + 115.0^\\circ + 133.0^\\circ + 80.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Addition**:\n   \\[\n   163.0 + 73.0 = 236.0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   236.0 + 115.0 = 351.0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   351.0 + 133.0 = 484.0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   484.0 + 80.0 = 564.0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the Remaining Angle**: Subtract the sum of the five given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the hexagon:\n   \\[\n   720.0^\\circ - 564.0^\\circ = 156.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The measure of the remaining angle is 156.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining angle is:\n\n<<<156>>>"
