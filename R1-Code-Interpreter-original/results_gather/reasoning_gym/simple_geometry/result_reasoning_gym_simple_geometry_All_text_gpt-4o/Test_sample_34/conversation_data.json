    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 3-gon (triangle), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Properties of a Triangle:**\n   - A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.\n\n2. **Identify the Given Angles:**\n   - We are given two interior angles of the triangle: 85.0° and 75.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles:**\n   - Add the two given angles together: \n     \\[\n     85.0° + 75.0° = 160.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Measure of the Remaining Angle:**\n   - Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of a triangle:\n     \\[\n     180° - 160.0° = 20.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Ensure that the sum of all three angles equals 180°:\n     \\[\n     85.0° + 75.0° + 20.0° = 180.0°\n     \\]\n   - The calculation is correct, confirming that the measure of the remaining angle is accurate.\n\n6. **Output the Final Answer:**\n   - The measure of the remaining angle is 20.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining angle is:\n\n<<<20.0>>>"
