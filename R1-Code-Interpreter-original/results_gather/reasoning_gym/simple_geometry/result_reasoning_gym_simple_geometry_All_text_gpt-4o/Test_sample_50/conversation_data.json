    "To find the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of a quadrilateral:**\n   - A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360 degrees.\n\n2. **Given information:**\n   - The first three interior angles of the quadrilateral are 135.0°, 139.0°, and 84.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of the given angles:**\n   - Add the measures of the first three angles: \n     \\[\n     135.0° + 139.0° + 84.0° = 358.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the measure of the remaining angle:**\n   - Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral:\n     \\[\n     360° - 358.0° = 2.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The measure of the remaining interior angle is 2.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining interior angle is:\n\n<<<2.0>>>"
