    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the measure of the remaining interior angle of a convex polygon with 3 sides, which is a triangle. Here are the steps to find the solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Properties of a Triangle:**\n   - A triangle is a polygon with three sides and three interior angles.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.\n\n2. **Identify the Given Angles:**\n   - We are given two interior angles of the triangle: 34.0° and 52.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles:**\n   - Add the two given angles together: 34.0° + 52.0° = 86.0°.\n\n4. **Determine the Measure of the Remaining Angle:**\n   - Since the sum of all interior angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, subtract the sum of the given angles from 180° to find the remaining angle.\n   - Remaining angle = 180° - 86.0° = 94.0°.\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Check that the sum of all three angles equals 180°: 34.0° + 52.0° + 94.0° = 180.0°.\n   - This confirms that the calculation is correct.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the measure of the remaining interior angle.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<94.0>>>."
