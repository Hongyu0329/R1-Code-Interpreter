    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex quadrilateral, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of a convex quadrilateral:**\n   - A convex quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon where all interior angles are less than 180°.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360°.\n\n2. **Identify the given angles:**\n   - We are given three interior angles of the quadrilateral: 154.0°, 35.0°, and 96.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of the given angles:**\n   - Add the three given angles together:\n     \\[\n     154.0° + 35.0° + 96.0° = 285.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the measure of the remaining angle:**\n   - Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral:\n     \\[\n     360° - 285.0° = 75.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the result:**\n   - Ensure that the calculated angle is less than 180°, which confirms it is a valid angle for a convex quadrilateral.\n\nThe measure of the remaining angle is 75.0°.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<75.0>>>"
