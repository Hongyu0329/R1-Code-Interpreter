    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of a quadrilateral:**\n   - A quadrilateral is a polygon with 4 sides.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360 degrees.\n\n2. **Identify the given angles:**\n   - We are given the measures of the first three interior angles: 41.0°, 81.0°, and 87.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of the given angles:**\n   - Add the measures of the first three angles: \n     \\[\n     41.0° + 81.0° + 87.0° = 209.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the measure of the last angle:**\n   - Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral:\n     \\[\n     360° - 209.0° = 151.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclude the measure of the last angle:**\n   - The measure of the last interior angle is 151.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the last interior angle is:\n\n<<<151>>>"
