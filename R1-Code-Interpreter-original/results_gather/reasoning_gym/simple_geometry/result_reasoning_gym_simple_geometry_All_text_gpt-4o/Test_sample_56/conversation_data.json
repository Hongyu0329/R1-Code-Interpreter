    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 6-gon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a convex 6-gon (hexagon) with five known interior angles. We need to find the measure of the sixth angle.\n\n2. **Sum of Interior Angles Formula**: The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n   For a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles**: Add the measures of the five given angles:\n   \\[\n   58.0^\\circ + 95.0^\\circ + 57.0^\\circ + 170.0^\\circ + 13.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 58.0 + 95.0 + 57.0 + 170.0 + 13.0 = 393.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Remaining Angle**: Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the hexagon:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining angle} = 720^\\circ - 393.0^\\circ = 327.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify Convexity**: Ensure that the calculated angle is consistent with the property of a convex polygon, where each interior angle must be less than \\( 180^\\circ \\). Since 327.0° is greater than 180°, there seems to be an error in the problem statement or the assumption of convexity. However, based on the given data, the calculation is correct.\n\nThe measure of the remaining angle is:\n<<<327.0>>>"
