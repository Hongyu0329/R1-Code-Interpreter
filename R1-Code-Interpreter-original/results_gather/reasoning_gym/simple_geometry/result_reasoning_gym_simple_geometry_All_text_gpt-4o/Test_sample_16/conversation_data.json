    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 5-gon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of a convex polygon:**\n   - A convex polygon is a polygon where all interior angles are less than 180°.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180°\n     \\]\n   - For a 5-gon (pentagon), \\( n = 5 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the 5-gon:**\n   - Using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \\times 180° = 3 \\times 180° = 540°\n     \\]\n\n3. **Add the given interior angles:**\n   - The given angles are 43.0°, 152.0°, 146.0°, and 87.0°.\n   - Calculate their sum:\n     \\[\n     43.0° + 152.0° + 146.0° + 87.0° = 428.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the measure of the remaining angle:**\n   - Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the pentagon:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining angle} = 540° - 428.0° = 112.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Ensure that the calculated remaining angle is less than 180°, which confirms it is a valid angle for a convex polygon.\n\nThe measure of the remaining angle is 112.0°.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<112>>>"
