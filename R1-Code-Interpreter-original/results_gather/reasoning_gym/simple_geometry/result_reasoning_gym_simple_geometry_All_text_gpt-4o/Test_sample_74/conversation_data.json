    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 6 sides, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have a convex polygon with 6 sides, which means it is a hexagon. We are given the measures of 5 of its interior angles and need to find the measure of the 6th angle.\n\n2. **Formula for Sum of Interior Angles**: The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n   For a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum of Given Angles**: Add the measures of the first 5 interior angles:\n   \\[\n   14.0^\\circ + 152.0^\\circ + 144.0^\\circ + 131.0^\\circ + 24.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Calculate the sum:\n   \\[\n   14.0 + 152.0 + 144.0 + 131.0 + 24.0 = 465.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the Last Angle**: Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles to find the measure of the last angle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Last angle} = 720^\\circ - 465.0^\\circ = 255.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The measure of the last interior angle is 255.0°.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<255>>>"
