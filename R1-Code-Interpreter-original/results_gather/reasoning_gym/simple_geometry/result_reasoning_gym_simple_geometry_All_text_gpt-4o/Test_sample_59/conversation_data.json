    "To solve this problem, we need to find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon that has 3 sides, which is a triangle. Here are the steps to find the solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Properties of a Triangle:**\n   - A triangle is a polygon with 3 sides.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.\n\n2. **Identify the Given Angles:**\n   - We are given two interior angles of the triangle: 51.0° and 112.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles:**\n   - Add the measures of the two given angles: \n     \\[\n     51.0° + 112.0° = 163.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Measure of the Last Angle:**\n   - Since the sum of all interior angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, subtract the sum of the given angles from 180° to find the measure of the last angle:\n     \\[\n     180° - 163.0° = 17.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Check that the sum of all three angles equals 180°:\n     \\[\n     51.0° + 112.0° + 17.0° = 180.0°\n     \\]\n   - The calculation is correct, confirming that the measure of the last angle is accurate.\n\nThe measure of the last interior angle is 17.0 degrees.\n\nFinal answer: <<<17.0>>>"
