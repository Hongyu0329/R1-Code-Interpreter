    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex quadrilateral, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of a convex quadrilateral:**\n   - A convex quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon where all interior angles are less than 180°.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360°.\n\n2. **Identify the given angles:**\n   - The problem provides the measures of three interior angles of the quadrilateral: 162.0°, 87.0°, and 28.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of the given angles:**\n   - Add the measures of the three given angles:\n     \\[\n     162.0° + 87.0° + 28.0° = 277.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the measure of the remaining angle:**\n   - Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral:\n     \\[\n     360° - 277.0° = 83.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Ensure that the calculated angle is less than 180°, which confirms that the quadrilateral is convex. In this case, 83.0° is indeed less than 180°, so the solution is valid.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the measure of the remaining angle in the quadrilateral.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<83.0>>>"
