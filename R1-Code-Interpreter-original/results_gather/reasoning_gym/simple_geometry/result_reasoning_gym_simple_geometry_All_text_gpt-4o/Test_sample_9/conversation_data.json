    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 6-gon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a convex 6-gon with five known interior angles. We need to find the measure of the sixth angle.\n\n2. **Recall the Formula for the Sum of Interior Angles**: The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n   For a hexagon (\\( n = 6 \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (6 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles**: Add the measures of the first five interior angles:\n   \\[\n   95.0^\\circ + 69.0^\\circ + 52.0^\\circ + 108.0^\\circ + 157.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 481.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Measure of the Remaining Angle**: Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the hexagon:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining angle} = 720^\\circ - 481.0^\\circ = 239.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Convexity Condition**: In a convex polygon, each interior angle must be less than \\( 180^\\circ \\). However, since the sum of the angles is correct and the problem states it is a convex polygon, the given angles and the calculated angle should satisfy this condition. The problem might have a typo or misinterpretation, but based on the calculation, the remaining angle is \\( 239.0^\\circ \\).\n\nThus, the measure of the remaining angle is:\n\n<<<239.0>>>"
