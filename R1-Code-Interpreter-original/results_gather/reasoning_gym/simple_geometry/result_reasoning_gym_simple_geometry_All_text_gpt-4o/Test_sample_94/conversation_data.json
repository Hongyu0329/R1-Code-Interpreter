    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 3-gon (triangle), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of a triangle:**\n   - A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.\n\n2. **Identify the given angles:**\n   - The problem states that the first two interior angles of the triangle are 50.0° and 44.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of the given angles:**\n   - Add the two given angles together: \n     \\[\n     50.0° + 44.0° = 94.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the measure of the remaining angle:**\n   - Subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of a triangle:\n     \\[\n     180° - 94.0° = 86.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the calculation:**\n   - Check that the sum of all three angles equals 180°:\n     \\[\n     50.0° + 44.0° + 86.0° = 180.0°\n     \\]\n   - The calculation is correct, confirming that the measure of the remaining angle is accurate.\n\n6. **Output the final answer:**\n   - The measure of the remaining angle is 86.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining angle is:\n\n<<<86.0>>>"
