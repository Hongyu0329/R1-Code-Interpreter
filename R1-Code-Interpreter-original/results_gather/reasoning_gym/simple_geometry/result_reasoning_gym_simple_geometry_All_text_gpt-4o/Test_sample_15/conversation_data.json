    "To determine the measure of the remaining angle in a convex 5-gon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of a polygon**: A convex polygon is a polygon where all its interior angles are less than 180°. For a polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the sum of its interior angles is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the formula to a 5-gon**: Since we are dealing with a 5-gon (pentagon), we substitute \\( n = 5 \\) into the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 3 \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum the given angles**: We are given the first four interior angles of the pentagon: 26.0°, 120.0°, 151.0°, and 126.0°. We need to find their sum:\n   \\[\n   26.0^\\circ + 120.0^\\circ + 151.0^\\circ + 126.0^\\circ = 423.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the remaining angle**: The sum of all five interior angles must equal 540°. Therefore, the measure of the remaining angle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining angle} = 540^\\circ - 423.0^\\circ = 117.0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the solution**: Ensure that the calculated remaining angle, 117.0°, is less than 180°, which confirms that the polygon is convex.\n\nThus, the measure of the remaining angle in the convex 5-gon is:\n\n<<<117.0>>>"
