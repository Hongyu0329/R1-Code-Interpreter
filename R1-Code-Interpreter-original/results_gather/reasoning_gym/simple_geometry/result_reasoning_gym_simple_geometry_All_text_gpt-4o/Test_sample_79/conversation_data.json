    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Sum of Interior Angles**: \n   - The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - For a quadrilateral (\\( n = 4 \\)), the sum of the interior angles is:\n     \\[\n     (4 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 2 \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n2. **List the Given Angles**:\n   - The measures of the first three interior angles are given as 90.0°, 136.0°, and 59.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles**:\n   - Add the measures of the first three angles:\n     \\[\n     90.0^\\circ + 136.0^\\circ + 59.0^\\circ = 285.0^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the Measure of the Last Angle**:\n   - Subtract the sum of the first three angles from the total sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral:\n     \\[\n     360^\\circ - 285.0^\\circ = 75.0^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The measure of the last interior angle is 75.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the last interior angle is:\n\n<<<75>>>"
