    "To solve this problem, we need to find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon that has 3 sides. A polygon with 3 sides is a triangle. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Given this information, we can find the measure of the last interior angle by following these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Known Angles**: We are given two interior angles of the triangle: 78.0° and 32.0°.\n\n2. **Recall the Sum of Interior Angles**: For a triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation**: Let the measure of the last interior angle be \\( x \\). According to the property of triangles, we have:\n   \\[\n   78.0° + 32.0° + x = 180°\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)**: \n   - First, add the measures of the two given angles:\n     \\[\n     78.0° + 32.0° = 110.0°\n     \\]\n   - Next, subtract this sum from 180° to find the measure of the last angle:\n     \\[\n     x = 180° - 110.0° = 70.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation**: \n   - Add all three angles to ensure they sum to 180°:\n     \\[\n     78.0° + 32.0° + 70.0° = 180.0°\n     \\]\n   - The calculation is correct, confirming that the measure of the last interior angle is 70.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the last interior angle is 70.0.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<70>>>."
