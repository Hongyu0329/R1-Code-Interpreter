    "To find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Sum of Interior Angles**: \n   - For any polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the sum of the interior angles is given by the formula: \n     \\[\n     (n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Since this is a quadrilateral (\\( n = 4 \\)), the sum of the interior angles is:\n     \\[\n     (4 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 2 \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n2. **Sum of Given Angles**:\n   - The measures of the first three interior angles are given as 56.0°, 52.0°, and 63.0°.\n   - Calculate the sum of these angles:\n     \\[\n     56.0^\\circ + 52.0^\\circ + 63.0^\\circ = 171.0^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Last Angle**:\n   - Since the total sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral is 360°, the measure of the last angle can be found by subtracting the sum of the given angles from 360°:\n     \\[\n     360^\\circ - 171.0^\\circ = 189.0^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The measure of the last interior angle is 189.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the last interior angle is:\n\n<<<189.0>>>"
