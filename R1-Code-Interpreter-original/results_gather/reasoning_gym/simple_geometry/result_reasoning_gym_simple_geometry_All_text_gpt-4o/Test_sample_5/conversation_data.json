    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon with 3 sides, which is a triangle. Here are the steps to find the solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Properties of a Triangle:**\n   - A triangle is a polygon with 3 sides.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180°.\n\n2. **Identify the Given Angles:**\n   - The problem states that the measures of the first two interior angles are 19.0° and 104.0°.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Given Angles:**\n   - Add the measures of the first two angles: \n     \\[\n     19.0° + 104.0° = 123.0°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Measure of the Last Angle:**\n   - Since the sum of all interior angles in a triangle is 180°, subtract the sum of the given angles from 180° to find the measure of the last angle:\n     \\[\n     180° - 123.0° = 57.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Check that the sum of all three angles equals 180°:\n     \\[\n     19.0° + 104.0° + 57.0° = 180.0°\n     \\]\n   - The calculation is correct.\n\n6. **Output the Final Answer:**\n   - The measure of the last interior angle is 57.0°.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<57.0>>>"
