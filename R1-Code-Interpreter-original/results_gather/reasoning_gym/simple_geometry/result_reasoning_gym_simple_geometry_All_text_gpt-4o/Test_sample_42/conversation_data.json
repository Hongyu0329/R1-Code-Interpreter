    "To solve this problem, we need to find the measure of the last interior angle of a convex polygon that has 3 sides. A polygon with 3 sides is a triangle. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. \n\nLet's break down the steps to find the measure of the last interior angle:\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - The polygon is a triangle (3 sides).\n   - The measures of the first two interior angles are 91.0° and 40.0°.\n\n2. **Recall the property of a triangle:**\n   - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°.\n\n3. **Set up the equation:**\n   - Let the measure of the last interior angle be \\( x \\).\n   - According to the property of triangles, we have:\n     \\[\n     91.0° + 40.0° + x = 180°\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Combine the measures of the first two angles:\n     \\[\n     91.0° + 40.0° = 131.0°\n     \\]\n   - Substitute this sum into the equation:\n     \\[\n     131.0° + x = 180°\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( x \\) by subtracting 131.0° from both sides:\n     \\[\n     x = 180° - 131.0° = 49.0°\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The measure of the last interior angle is 49.0°.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the last interior angle is:\n\n<<<49.0>>>"
