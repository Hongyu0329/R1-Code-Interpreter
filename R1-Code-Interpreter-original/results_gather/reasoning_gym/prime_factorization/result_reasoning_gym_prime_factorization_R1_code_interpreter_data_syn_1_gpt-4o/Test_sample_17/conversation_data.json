    "To find the prime factorization of 70, we need to break it down into its prime factors. A prime factor is a factor that is a prime number, which means it is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n\nLet's start by dividing 70 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. If 70 is divisible by 2, then 2 is a prime factor. If not, we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3, and so on.\n\n1. Check divisibility by 2: 70 is even, so it is divisible by 2.\n   - 70 ÷ 2 = 35\n   - So, 2 is a prime factor.\n\n2. Now, we need to factor 35. Check divisibility by 2: 35 is not even, so it is not divisible by 2.\n\n3. Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 35 is 8, which is not divisible by 3, so 35 is not divisible by 3.\n\n4. Check divisibility by 5: 35 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.\n   - 35 ÷ 5 = 7\n   - So, 5 is a prime factor.\n\n5. Now, we need to factor 7. Since 7 is a prime number, it is a prime factor itself.\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 70 is 2, 5, and 7. We can express this as a product of prime factors: 2 × 5 × 7.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the factorization is correct.\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Check for number of 2s\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n    return factors\n\nfactors_of_70 = prime_factors(70)\nprint(\" × \".join(map(str, factors_of_70)))\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the prime factorization of 70.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed that the prime factorization of 70 is indeed 2 × 5 × 7. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2 × 5 × 7>>>"
