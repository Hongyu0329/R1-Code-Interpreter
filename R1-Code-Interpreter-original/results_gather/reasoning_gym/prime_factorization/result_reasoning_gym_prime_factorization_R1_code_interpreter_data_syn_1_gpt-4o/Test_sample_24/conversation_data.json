    "To find the prime factorization of 991, we need to determine if 991 is a prime number or if it can be divided by any prime numbers smaller than itself. \n\nThe process involves checking divisibility starting from the smallest prime number, which is 2, and moving upwards. We only need to check up to the square root of 991, because if 991 is divisible by any number larger than its square root, the corresponding factor would be smaller than the square root.\n\nLet's calculate the square root of 991 to determine the range of prime numbers we need to check.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the square root of 991\nsqrt_991 = math.isqrt(991)\nprint(sqrt_991)\n```\n\nThe code will output the integer part of the square root of 991, which will help us determine the range of prime numbers to check for divisibility.",
    "The integer part of the square root of 991 is 31. This means we need to check for divisibility by all prime numbers up to 31. The prime numbers up to 31 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31.\n\nNow, let's check if 991 is divisible by any of these prime numbers. If it is not divisible by any of them, then 991 is a prime number itself.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\n# Check if 991 is a prime number\nis_991_prime = is_prime(991)\nprint(is_991_prime)\n```\n\nThis code will determine if 991 is a prime number by checking divisibility against all relevant numbers. If the output is `True`, then 991 is a prime number. If `False`, it is not a prime number.",
    "The output `True` indicates that 991 is a prime number. Therefore, the prime factorization of 991 is simply 991 itself, as it cannot be divided by any other prime numbers.\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 991 is:\n\n<<<991>>>"
