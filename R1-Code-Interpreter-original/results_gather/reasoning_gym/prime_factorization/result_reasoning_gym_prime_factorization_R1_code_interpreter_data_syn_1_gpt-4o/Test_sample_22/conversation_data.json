    "To find the prime factorization of 937, we need to determine which prime numbers multiply together to give 937. The process involves checking divisibility by prime numbers starting from the smallest (2, 3, 5, 7, etc.) and continuing until the quotient is a prime number.\n\n1. **Check divisibility by 2**: 937 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.\n2. **Check divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits of 937 is 19, which is not divisible by 3.\n3. **Check divisibility by 5**: 937 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.\n4. **Check divisibility by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31**: We continue this process until we find a prime factor or confirm that 937 is a prime number.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and find the prime factors of 937.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Check for number of 2s\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n    return factors\n\nn = 937\nfactors = prime_factors(n)\nprint(\" × \".join(map(str, factors)))\n```\n\nThis script will determine the prime factors of 937 and print them in the required format. Let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The output indicates that 937 is a prime number since the only factor returned is 937 itself. This means that 937 cannot be divided evenly by any other prime numbers except for 1 and 937. Therefore, the prime factorization of 937 is simply 937.\n\n<<<937>>>"
