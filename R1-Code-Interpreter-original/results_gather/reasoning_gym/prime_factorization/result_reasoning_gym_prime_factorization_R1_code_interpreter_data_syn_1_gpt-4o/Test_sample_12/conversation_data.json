    "To find the prime factorization of 420, we need to break it down into its prime factors. A prime factor is a factor that is a prime number, which means it is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n\nThe process involves dividing 420 by the smallest prime number (2) and continuing the division with the quotient until we reach 1. If a number is not divisible by the current prime, we move to the next prime number.\n\nLet's perform the prime factorization step-by-step:\n\n1. Start with the smallest prime number, 2. Check if 420 is divisible by 2.\n2. If it is, divide 420 by 2 and continue with the quotient.\n3. Repeat the process with the quotient until it is no longer divisible by 2.\n4. Move to the next smallest prime number (3) and repeat the process.\n5. Continue this process with increasing prime numbers (5, 7, 11, etc.) until the quotient becomes 1.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and find the prime factorization of 420.\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Start with the smallest prime number\n    divisor = 2\n    while n > 1:\n        while n % divisor == 0:\n            factors.append(divisor)\n            n //= divisor\n        divisor += 1\n    return factors\n\n# Find the prime factors of 420\nfactors = prime_factors(420)\n# Format the output as required\nresult = \" × \".join(map(str, factors))\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis script will output the prime factors of 420 in the required format.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the prime factorization of 420. The prime factors are 2, 2, 3, 5, and 7. These factors are all prime numbers, and their product gives the original number, 420.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 420 is:\n\n<<<2 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 7>>>"
