    "To find the prime factorization of 392, we need to break it down into its prime factors. A prime factor is a factor that is a prime number, and the process involves dividing the number by the smallest prime number until we reach 1.\n\nLet's start by dividing 392 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue the process with the quotient until we can't divide evenly by 2 anymore. Then, we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3, and continue the process. We repeat this with subsequent prime numbers (5, 7, 11, etc.) until the quotient becomes 1.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this factorization:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Start with the smallest prime number\n    divisor = 2\n    while n > 1:\n        while n % divisor == 0:\n            factors.append(divisor)\n            n //= divisor\n        divisor += 1\n    return factors\n\n# Find the prime factors of 392\nfactors = prime_factors(392)\n# Format the output as requested\nresult = \" × \".join(map(str, factors))\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the prime factors of 392 and format them in the required way. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the prime factorization of 392 is correctly calculated as \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 7 \\times 7\\).\n\nThe prime factorization process involved dividing 392 by the smallest prime number, 2, until it could no longer be divided evenly, and then moving on to the next smallest prime number, 7, until the quotient became 1.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2 × 2 × 2 × 7 × 7>>>"
