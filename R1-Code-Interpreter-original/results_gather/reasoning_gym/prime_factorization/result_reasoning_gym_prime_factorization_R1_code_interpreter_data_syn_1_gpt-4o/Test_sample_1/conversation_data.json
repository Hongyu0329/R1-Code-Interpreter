    "To find the prime factorization of 586, we need to determine which prime numbers multiply together to give 586. The process involves dividing 586 by the smallest prime numbers until we reach a quotient of 1.\n\nLet's start by checking divisibility by the smallest prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.\n\n1. Check if 586 is divisible by 2. Since 586 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.\n2. Divide 586 by 2 to get 293.\n3. Now, check if 293 is a prime number or if it can be divided further by any prime numbers.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and find the prime factors of 586.\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Check for number of 2s\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n    return factors\n\nfactors = prime_factors(586)\nprint(\" × \".join(map(str, factors)))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the prime factors of 586.",
    "The code execution output indicates that the prime factors of 586 are 2 and 293. Since 293 is a prime number, the factorization is complete.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 586 is:\n\n<<<2 × 293>>>"
