    "To find the prime factorization of 362, we need to determine which prime numbers multiply together to give 362. The process involves dividing 362 by the smallest prime number and continuing the division with the quotient until we reach 1.\n\nLet's start by checking divisibility by the smallest prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, etc.\n\n1. Check if 362 is divisible by 2. Since 362 is even, it is divisible by 2.\n2. Divide 362 by 2 to get 181.\n3. Now, check if 181 is a prime number or if it can be divided by any smaller prime numbers.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and find the prime factors of 362.\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Check for number of 2s\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n    return factors\n\nfactors = prime_factors(362)\nprint(\" × \".join(map(str, factors)))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the prime factors of 362.",
    "The code execution has provided the prime factors of 362 as 2 and 181. Since 181 is a prime number, the prime factorization of 362 is complete.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 362 is:\n\n<<<2 × 181>>>"
