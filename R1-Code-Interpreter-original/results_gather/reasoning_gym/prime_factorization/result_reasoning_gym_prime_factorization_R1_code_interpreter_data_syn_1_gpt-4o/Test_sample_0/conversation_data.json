    "To find the prime factorization of 81, we need to determine which prime numbers multiply together to give 81. \n\n1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 81 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.\n2. Move to the next prime number, which is 3. Check if 81 is divisible by 3. If it is, divide 81 by 3 and continue the process with the quotient.\n3. Repeat the process until the quotient is 1.\n\nLet's perform these steps using a Python script to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Start with the smallest prime number\n    divisor = 2\n    while n >= divisor:\n        while n % divisor == 0:\n            factors.append(divisor)\n            n //= divisor\n        divisor += 1\n    return factors\n\n# Find the prime factors of 81\nfactors_of_81 = prime_factors(81)\n# Format the output as required\nformatted_factors = ' × '.join(map(str, factors_of_81))\nprint(formatted_factors)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the prime factorization of 81.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the prime factorization of 81. The prime factors of 81 are all 3s, and they multiply together to give 81. Therefore, the prime factorization of 81 is:\n\n<<<3 × 3 × 3 × 3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the prime factorization of 81.
