    "To find the prime factorization of 511, we need to determine which prime numbers multiply together to give 511. The process involves dividing 511 by the smallest prime numbers until we reach 1.\n\nLet's start by checking divisibility by the smallest prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on, until we find a prime factor. We will continue this process until the quotient is 1.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Start with the smallest prime number\n    divisor = 2\n    while n > 1:\n        while n % divisor == 0:\n            factors.append(divisor)\n            n //= divisor\n        divisor += 1\n    return factors\n\n# Find the prime factors of 511\nfactors = prime_factors(511)\nprint(\" × \".join(map(str, factors)))\n```\n\nThis script will output the prime factors of 511, separated by the multiplication symbol. Let's execute the code to find the prime factorization.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the prime factors of 511. The prime factorization of 511 is 7 and 73, both of which are prime numbers.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 511 is:\n\n<<<7 × 73>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the prime factorization of 511.
