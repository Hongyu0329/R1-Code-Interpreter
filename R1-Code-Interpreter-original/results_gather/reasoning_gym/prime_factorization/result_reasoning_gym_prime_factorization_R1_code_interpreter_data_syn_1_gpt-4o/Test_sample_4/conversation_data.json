    "To find the prime factorization of 338, we need to determine which prime numbers multiply together to give 338. The process involves dividing 338 by the smallest prime numbers until we reach a quotient of 1.\n\nLet's start by checking divisibility by the smallest prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.\n\n1. Check if 338 is divisible by 2. Since 338 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.\n2. Divide 338 by 2 to get 169.\n3. Now, check if 169 is divisible by the next smallest prime numbers.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and find the prime factors of 338.\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Check for number of 2s\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n    return factors\n\nfactors = prime_factors(338)\nprint(\" × \".join(map(str, factors)))\n```\n\nThis code will output the prime factors of 338. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the prime factorization of 338. The prime factors are 2, 13, and 13. Therefore, the prime factorization of 338 is:\n\n<<<2 × 13 × 13>>>"
