    "To find the prime factorization of 251, we need to determine if 251 is a prime number or if it can be divided by any prime numbers smaller than itself. \n\nThe process involves checking divisibility by prime numbers starting from the smallest (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.) up to the square root of 251. If 251 is not divisible by any of these primes, then it is itself a prime number.\n\nLet's write a Python script to check the divisibility of 251 by all prime numbers up to its square root.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Check for number of 2s\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n    # Check for odd factors from 3 to sqrt(n)\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n    return factors\n\nnumber = 251\nif is_prime(number):\n    print(f\"{number} is a prime number.\")\nelse:\n    factors = prime_factors(number)\n    print(\" × \".join(map(str, factors)))\n\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the prime factorization of 251.",
    "The code output indicates that 251 is a prime number. Since it is a prime number, its prime factorization is simply the number itself.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 251 is:\n\n<<<251>>>"
