    "To find the prime factorization of 471, we need to determine which prime numbers multiply together to give 471. The process involves dividing 471 by the smallest prime numbers until we reach 1.\n\n1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 471 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.\n2. Move to the next prime number, which is 3. Check if 471 is divisible by 3.\n3. If divisible, divide 471 by 3 and continue the process with the quotient.\n4. Repeat the process with the next smallest prime numbers (5, 7, 11, etc.) until the quotient is 1.\n\nLet's implement this process using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Start with the smallest prime number\n    divisor = 2\n    while n > 1:\n        while n % divisor == 0:\n            factors.append(divisor)\n            n //= divisor\n        divisor += 1\n    return factors\n\nfactors = prime_factors(471)\nprint(\" × \".join(map(str, factors)))\n```\n\nThis code will output the prime factors of 471. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the prime factorization of 471. The prime factors are 3 and 157. Therefore, the prime factorization of 471 is:\n\n<<<3 × 157>>>"
