    "To find the prime factorization of a number, we need to determine which prime numbers multiply together to give the original number. \n\n41 is a relatively small number, so we can start by checking if it is a prime number itself. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. \n\nTo check if 41 is a prime number, we need to test divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 41. The square root of 41 is approximately 6.4, so we need to check divisibility by the prime numbers 2, 3, and 5.\n\nLet's write a Python script to check if 41 is divisible by any of these prime numbers.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\nnumber = 41\nif is_prime(number):\n    print(f\"{number} is a prime number.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{number} is not a prime number.\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine if 41 is a prime number.",
    "Since 41 is a prime number, its prime factorization is simply the number itself. Therefore, the prime factorization of 41 is:\n\n<<<41>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
