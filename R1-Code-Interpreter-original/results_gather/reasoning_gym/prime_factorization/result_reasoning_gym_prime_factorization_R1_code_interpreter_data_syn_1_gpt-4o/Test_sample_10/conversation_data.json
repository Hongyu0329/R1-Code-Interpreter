    "To find the prime factorization of 656, we need to determine which prime numbers multiply together to give 656. The process involves dividing the number by the smallest prime number (2) and continuing the division with the quotient until we reach 1. If a division is not exact, we move to the next smallest prime number.\n\nLet's start by dividing 656 by the smallest prime number, 2, and continue the process:\n\n1. Check if 656 is divisible by 2.\n2. If it is, divide 656 by 2 and continue with the quotient.\n3. Repeat the process with the quotient until it is no longer divisible by 2.\n4. Move to the next smallest prime number and repeat the process until the quotient is 1.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the prime factors of 656.\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Start with the smallest prime number\n    divisor = 2\n    while n > 1:\n        while n % divisor == 0:\n            factors.append(divisor)\n            n //= divisor\n        divisor += 1\n    return factors\n\nfactors = prime_factors(656)\nprint(\" × \".join(map(str, factors)))\n```\n\nThis code will output the prime factors of 656 separated by the multiplication sign.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the prime factorization of 656. The prime factors are 2 and 41, with 2 appearing four times. Therefore, the prime factorization of 656 is:\n\n<<<2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 41>>>"
