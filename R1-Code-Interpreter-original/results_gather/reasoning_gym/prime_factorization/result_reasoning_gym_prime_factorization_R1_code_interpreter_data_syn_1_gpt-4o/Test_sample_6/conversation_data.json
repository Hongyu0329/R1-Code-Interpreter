    "To find the prime factorization of 656, we need to determine which prime numbers multiply together to give 656. The process involves dividing 656 by the smallest prime number and continuing the division with the quotient until we reach 1.\n\nLet's start by checking divisibility by the smallest prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. Since 656 is an even number, it is divisible by 2. We will continue dividing by 2 until we can no longer do so, then move to the next smallest prime number.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Start with the smallest prime number\n    divisor = 2\n    while n >= 2:\n        if n % divisor == 0:\n            factors.append(divisor)\n            n = n // divisor\n        else:\n            divisor += 1\n    return factors\n\n# Find the prime factors of 656\nfactors = prime_factors(656)\nprint(\" × \".join(map(str, factors)))\n```\n\nThis script will output the prime factors of 656 in the desired format. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the prime factorization of 656. The prime factors are 2, 2, 2, 2, and 41. Therefore, the prime factorization of 656 is:\n\n<<<2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 41>>>"
