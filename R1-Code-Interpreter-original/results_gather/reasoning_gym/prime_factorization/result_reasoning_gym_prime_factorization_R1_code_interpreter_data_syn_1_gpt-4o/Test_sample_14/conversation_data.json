    "To find the prime factorization of 911, we need to determine if 911 is a prime number or if it can be divided by any prime numbers. The process involves checking divisibility by prime numbers starting from the smallest (2, 3, 5, 7, etc.) up to the square root of 911.\n\n1. **Check divisibility by 2**: 911 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.\n2. **Check divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits of 911 is 9 + 1 + 1 = 11, which is not divisible by 3.\n3. **Check divisibility by 5**: 911 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.\n4. **Check divisibility by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.**: We continue this process until we reach a prime number greater than the square root of 911.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and determine if 911 is a prime number or find its prime factors.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Check for number of 2s\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n    # Check for odd factors\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n    return factors\n\nnumber = 911\nif is_prime(number):\n    print(f\"{number} is a prime number.\")\nelse:\n    factors = prime_factors(number)\n    print(\" × \".join(map(str, factors)))\n\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the prime factorization of 911.",
    "The code output indicates that 911 is a prime number. Since 911 is a prime number, it cannot be factored into smaller prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factorization of 911 is simply 911 itself.\n\n<<<911>>>"
