    "To find the prime factorization of 94, we need to determine which prime numbers multiply together to give 94. \n\n1. **Check divisibility by the smallest prime number, 2:**\n   - 94 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n   - Dividing 94 by 2 gives 47.\n\n2. **Check if 47 is a prime number:**\n   - A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n   - We need to check divisibility of 47 by prime numbers less than its square root (approximately 6.86), which are 2, 3, and 5.\n   - 47 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd), 3 (sum of digits 4 + 7 = 11, not divisible by 3), or 5 (does not end in 0 or 5).\n\nSince 47 is not divisible by any of these, it is a prime number.\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 94 is 2 × 47.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Check for number of 2s\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n    return factors\n\nfactors = prime_factors(94)\nprint(\" × \".join(map(str, factors)))\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the prime factors of 94.",
    "The code has confirmed that the prime factorization of 94 is indeed 2 × 47. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2 × 47>>>"
