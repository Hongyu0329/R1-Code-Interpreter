    "To find the prime factorization of 216, we need to break it down into its prime factors. A prime factor is a factor that is a prime number, and the process involves dividing the number by the smallest prime number until we reach 1.\n\nLet's start by dividing 216 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue the process with the quotient until we can no longer divide by 2. Then, we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3, and continue the process. \n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. 216 is even, so divide by 2:  \n   \\( 216 \\div 2 = 108 \\)\n\n2. 108 is even, so divide by 2:  \n   \\( 108 \\div 2 = 54 \\)\n\n3. 54 is even, so divide by 2:  \n   \\( 54 \\div 2 = 27 \\)\n\n4. 27 is not divisible by 2, so move to the next prime number, 3:  \n   \\( 27 \\div 3 = 9 \\)\n\n5. 9 is divisible by 3:  \n   \\( 9 \\div 3 = 3 \\)\n\n6. 3 is divisible by 3:  \n   \\( 3 \\div 3 = 1 \\)\n\nNow, we have reached 1, and the prime factors of 216 are all the divisors we used: 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, and 3.\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify this process and ensure the factorization is correct.\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Check for number of 2s\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n    # Check for odd numbers from 3 onwards\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n    return factors\n\nfactors = prime_factors(216)\nprint(\" × \".join(map(str, factors)))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the prime factorization of 216.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the prime factorization of 216 as expected. The prime factors are 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, and 3.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 216 is:\n\n<<<2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3>>>"
