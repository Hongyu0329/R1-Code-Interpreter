    "To find the prime factorization of 276, we need to determine which prime numbers multiply together to give 276. The process involves dividing 276 by the smallest prime number and continuing the division with the quotient until we reach 1.\n\nLet's start by dividing 276 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue the process:\n\n1. Check if 276 is divisible by 2. Since 276 is even, it is divisible by 2.\n2. Divide 276 by 2 to get 138.\n3. Check if 138 is divisible by 2. Since 138 is even, it is divisible by 2.\n4. Divide 138 by 2 to get 69.\n5. Check if 69 is divisible by 2. Since 69 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.\n6. Move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Check if 69 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 69 is 15, which is divisible by 3, so 69 is divisible by 3.\n7. Divide 69 by 3 to get 23.\n8. Check if 23 is a prime number. Since 23 is only divisible by 1 and itself, it is a prime number.\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 276 is 2 × 2 × 3 × 23. Let's verify this using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Check for number of 2s\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n    return factors\n\nfactors = prime_factors(276)\nprint(\" × \".join(map(str, factors)))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the prime factorization.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed that the prime factorization of 276 is indeed 2 × 2 × 3 × 23. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2 × 2 × 3 × 23>>>"
