    "To find the prime factorization of 543, we need to determine which prime numbers multiply together to give 543. The process involves dividing 543 by the smallest prime numbers until we are left with a prime number.\n\nLet's start by checking divisibility by the smallest prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.\n\n1. **Check divisibility by 2**: 543 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.\n2. **Check divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 543 is 5 + 4 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 543 is divisible by 3.\n\nLet's divide 543 by 3 and continue the process with the quotient.\n\n```python\n# Python code to find the prime factorization of 543\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Check for number of 2s\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n    return factors\n\nfactors = prime_factors(543)\nprint(\" × \".join(map(str, factors)))\n```\n\nThe code will find the prime factors of 543 and print them in the required format. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution has provided the prime factors of 543 as 3 and 181. Since 181 is a prime number, the prime factorization of 543 is complete.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 543 is:\n\n<<<3 × 181>>>"
