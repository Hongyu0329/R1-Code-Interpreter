    "To find the prime factorization of 633, we need to determine which prime numbers multiply together to give 633. The process involves dividing 633 by the smallest prime number and continuing the division with the quotient until we reach 1.\n\nLet's start by checking divisibility by the smallest prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.\n\n1. **Check divisibility by 2**: 633 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.\n2. **Check divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 633 is 6 + 3 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 633 is divisible by 3.\n\nLet's divide 633 by 3 and continue the process with the quotient.\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = []\n    # Check for number of 2s\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n    return factors\n\nfactors = prime_factors(633)\nprint(\" × \".join(map(str, factors)))\n```\n\nThe code will find the prime factors of 633 and print them in the required format. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the prime factors of 633 as 3 and 211. This means that 633 can be expressed as the product of these prime numbers.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 633 is:\n\n<<<3 × 211>>>"
