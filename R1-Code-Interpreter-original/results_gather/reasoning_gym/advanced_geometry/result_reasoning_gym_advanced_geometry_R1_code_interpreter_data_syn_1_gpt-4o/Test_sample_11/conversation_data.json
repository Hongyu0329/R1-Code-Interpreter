    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or its extension).\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-1, -6)\n- B = (4, 1)\n- C = (-7, 4)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes (which are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides).\n3. Find the equations of the altitudes.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's start by calculating the slopes of the sides:\n\n- Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\nThen, calculate the slopes of the altitudes:\n- Altitude from A is perpendicular to BC\n- Altitude from B is perpendicular to AC\n- Altitude from C is perpendicular to AB\n\nFinally, solve the system of equations for the altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-1, -6)\nB = (4, 1)\nC = (-7, 4)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Function to calculate the y-intercept of a line given a point and slope\ndef y_intercept(point, slope):\n    return point[1] - slope * point[0]\n\n# Equations of the altitudes\n# y = slope * x + intercept\nintercept_A = y_intercept(A, slope_altitude_A)\nintercept_B = y_intercept(B, slope_altitude_B)\nintercept_C = y_intercept(C, slope_altitude_C)\n\n# Solve the system of equations to find the intersection of two altitudes\n# Altitude from A and B\n# y = slope_altitude_A * x + intercept_A\n# y = slope_altitude_B * x + intercept_B\n\n# Set the equations equal to each other and solve for x\nx_orthocenter = (intercept_B - intercept_A) / (slope_altitude_A - slope_altitude_B)\ny_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + intercept_A\n\n# Round the results to 3 decimal places\nx_orthocenter = round(x_orthocenter, 3)\ny_orthocenter = round(y_orthocenter, 3)\n\nprint((x_orthocenter, y_orthocenter))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of two altitudes. Let's execute it to get the result.",
