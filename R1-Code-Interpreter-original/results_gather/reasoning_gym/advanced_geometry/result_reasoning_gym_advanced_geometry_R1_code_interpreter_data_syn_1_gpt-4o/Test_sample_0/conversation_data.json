    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle given its vertices, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of triangle ABC:\n- A = (-4, -6)\n- B = (-1, -3)\n- C = (5, -10)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle:**\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n   - Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation: \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\)\n\n4. **Find the intersection of any two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by the equations of two altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate these using Python:\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-4, -6)\nB = (-1, -3)\nC = (5, -10)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\n# Altitude from A: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n# Altitude from B: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\n# Altitude from A\n# y + 6 = slope_altitude_A * (x + 4)\n# y = slope_altitude_A * x + slope_altitude_A * 4 - 6\n\n# Altitude from B\n# y + 3 = slope_altitude_B * (x + 1)\n# y = slope_altitude_B * x + slope_altitude_B * 1 - 3\n\n# Solving the system of equations to find the intersection\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\neq1 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_A * x + slope_altitude_A * 4 - 6)\neq2 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_B * x + slope_altitude_B * 1 - 3)\n\n# Solve the equations\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of two altitudes. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the coordinates of the orthocenter of triangle ABC. The orthocenter is the point where the altitudes of the triangle intersect.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-4, -6)\n- B = (-1, -3)\n- C = (5, -10)\n\nThe calculated orthocenter is:\n<<<(-1.308, -3.692)>>>"
