    "To find the incircle radius (also known as the inradius) of a triangle, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{A}{s} \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the inradius, \\( A \\) is the area of the triangle, and \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the side lengths of the triangle using the distance formula:\n\n\\[ AB = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\\[ BC = \\sqrt{(x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2} \\]\n\\[ CA = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_3)^2 + (y_1 - y_3)^2} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the semi-perimeter \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the area \\( A \\) of the triangle using Heron's formula:\n\n\\[ A = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)} \\]\n\nFinally, we can find the inradius \\( r \\) using the formula mentioned above.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (1, 6)\nB = (-8, 2)\nC = (-1, -10)\n\n# Calculate the side lengths\nAB = math.sqrt((B[0] - A[0])**2 + (B[1] - A[1])**2)\nBC = math.sqrt((C[0] - B[0])**2 + (C[1] - B[1])**2)\nCA = math.sqrt((A[0] - C[0])**2 + (A[1] - C[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate the area using Heron's formula\narea = math.sqrt(s * (s - AB) * (s - BC) * (s - CA))\n\n# Calculate the inradius\ninradius = area / s\n\n# Print the inradius rounded to 3 decimal places\nprint(round(inradius, 3))\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the inradius of the triangle.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the inradius of the triangle. Based on the calculations, the inradius of triangle ABC with vertices A=(1, 6), B=(-8, 2), and C=(-1, -10) is:\n\n<<<3.411>>>"
