    "To find the radius of the incircle of triangle ABC, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the side lengths of the triangle** using the distance formula:\n   - \\( AB = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\)\n   - \\( BC = \\sqrt{(x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2} \\)\n   - \\( CA = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_3)^2 + (y_1 - y_3)^2} \\)\n\n2. **Calculate the semi-perimeter (s)** of the triangle:\n   - \\( s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} \\)\n\n3. **Calculate the area (A) of the triangle** using Heron's formula:\n   - \\( A = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)} \\)\n\n4. **Calculate the radius (r) of the incircle** using the formula:\n   - \\( r = \\frac{A}{s} \\)\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the radius of the incircle.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the triangle vertices\nA = (9, -3)\nB = (3, 5)\nC = (-2, 10)\n\n# Calculate the side lengths\nAB = math.sqrt((B[0] - A[0])**2 + (B[1] - A[1])**2)\nBC = math.sqrt((C[0] - B[0])**2 + (C[1] - B[1])**2)\nCA = math.sqrt((A[0] - C[0])**2 + (A[1] - C[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate the area using Heron's formula\narea = math.sqrt(s * (s - AB) * (s - BC) * (s - CA))\n\n# Calculate the radius of the incircle\nradius = area / s\n\n# Print the radius rounded to 3 decimal places\nprint(round(radius, 3))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the radius of the incircle.",
