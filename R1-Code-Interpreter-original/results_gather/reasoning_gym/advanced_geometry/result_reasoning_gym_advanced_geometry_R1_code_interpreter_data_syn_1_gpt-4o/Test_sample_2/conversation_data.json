    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A, B, and C, we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The angle \\(\\theta\\) between two vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\| \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\) is the dot product of vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\n- \\(\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|\\) are the magnitudes of vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\n\nFor this problem:\n- Vector \\(\\mathbf{u} = \\overrightarrow{BA} = A - B = (1 - (-10), 8 - (-3)) = (11, 11)\\)\n- Vector \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\overrightarrow{BC} = C - B = (-10 - (-10), 2 - (-3)) = (0, 5)\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the angle at B using these vectors.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the vectors\nu = (11, 11)\nv = (0, 5)\n\n# Calculate the dot product\ndot_product = u[0] * v[0] + u[1] * v[1]\n\n# Calculate the magnitudes of the vectors\nmagnitude_u = math.sqrt(u[0]**2 + u[1]**2)\nmagnitude_v = math.sqrt(v[0]**2 + v[1]**2)\n\n# Calculate the cosine of the angle\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_u * magnitude_v)\n\n# Calculate the angle in radians\ntheta_radians = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert the angle to degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(theta_radians)\n\n# Round the result to 3 decimal places\ntheta_degrees_rounded = round(theta_degrees, 3)\n\nprint(theta_degrees_rounded)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the angle at B.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the angle at vertex B in the triangle is calculated to be 45.0 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the angle at B is:\n\n<<<45.0°>>>"
