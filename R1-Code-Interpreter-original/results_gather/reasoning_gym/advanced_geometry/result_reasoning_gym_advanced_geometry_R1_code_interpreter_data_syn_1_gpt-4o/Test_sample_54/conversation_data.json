    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (7, 0)\n- B = (-10, -8)\n- C = (6, 10)\n\nWe will find the equations of two altitudes and then solve for their intersection point.\n\n1. **Find the slope of side BC**:\n   - The slope of BC is given by \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\).\n   - B = (-10, -8), C = (6, 10)\n   - Slope of BC = \\((10 - (-8)) / (6 - (-10)) = 18 / 16 = 9/8\\).\n\n2. **Find the equation of the altitude from A**:\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of 9/8, which is -8/9.\n   - Using point-slope form \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\) with A = (7, 0), the equation is:\n     \\(y - 0 = -\\frac{8}{9}(x - 7)\\).\n\n3. **Find the slope of side AC**:\n   - A = (7, 0), C = (6, 10)\n   - Slope of AC = \\((10 - 0) / (6 - 7) = 10 / -1 = -10\\).\n\n4. **Find the equation of the altitude from B**:\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of -10, which is 1/10.\n   - Using point-slope form with B = (-10, -8), the equation is:\n     \\(y - (-8) = \\frac{1}{10}(x - (-10))\\).\n\n5. **Solve the system of equations to find the intersection of the altitudes**:\n   - We have two equations:\n     1. \\(y = -\\frac{8}{9}x + \\frac{56}{9}\\)\n     2. \\(y = \\frac{1}{10}x - 9\\)\n\nLet's solve these equations to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A\neq1 = Eq(y, -8/9 * x + 56/9)\n\n# Equation of the altitude from B\neq2 = Eq(y, 1/10 * x - 9)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\n\n# Round the solution to 3 decimal places\northocenter = (round(solution[x], 3), round(solution[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the coordinates of the orthocenter of the triangle. The orthocenter is the point where the altitudes of the triangle intersect.\n\nThe coordinates of the orthocenter, rounded to three decimal places, are:\n\n<<<(15.393, -7.461)>>>"
