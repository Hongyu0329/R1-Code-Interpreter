    "To find the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with given coordinates, we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The angle between two vectors can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\| \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) are vectors.\n- \\(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\) is the dot product of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\n- \\(\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|\\) are the magnitudes of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\n\nFor angle ABC, we need vectors \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{BC}\\):\n- \\(\\mathbf{AB} = B - A = (-3, -2) - (-5, 10) = (2, -12)\\)\n- \\(\\mathbf{BC} = C - B = (5, 10) - (-3, -2) = (8, 12)\\)\n\nNow, we can calculate the dot product and magnitudes of these vectors, and then find the angle using the arccosine function.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the vectors AB and BC\nAB = (2, -12)\nBC = (8, 12)\n\n# Calculate the dot product of AB and BC\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Calculate the magnitudes of AB and BC\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Calculate the cosine of the angle\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Calculate the angle in radians and then convert to degrees\nangle_radians = math.acos(cos_theta)\nangle_degrees = math.degrees(angle_radians)\n\n# Round the angle to 3 decimal places\nangle_degrees_rounded = round(angle_degrees, 3)\n\nprint(angle_degrees_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the angle ABC in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the measure of angle ABC in degrees. The angle is rounded to three decimal places as required.\n\nThe measure of angle ABC is:\n\n<<<136.848°>>>"
