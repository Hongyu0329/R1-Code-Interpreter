    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-7, 3)\n- B = (4, 3)\n- C = (-2, 9)\n\nWe can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides:**\n   - Slope of AB: Since A and B have the same y-coordinate, the line AB is horizontal, and its slope is 0.\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (9 - 3) / (-2 - 4) = 6 / -6 = -1\\)\n   - Slope of CA: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (9 - 3) / (-2 + 7) = 6 / 5\\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from C to AB is vertical because AB is horizontal, so its slope is undefined.\n   - The altitude from A to BC is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of -1, which is 1.\n   - The altitude from B to CA is perpendicular to CA, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of 6/5, which is -5/6.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from C to AB is a vertical line through C, so its equation is \\(x = -2\\).\n   - The altitude from A to BC passes through A and has a slope of 1, so its equation is \\(y - 3 = 1(x + 7)\\).\n   - The altitude from B to CA passes through B and has a slope of -5/6, so its equation is \\(y - 3 = -\\frac{5}{6}(x - 4)\\).\n\n4. **Find the intersection of the altitudes:**\n   - The intersection of the altitude from C to AB and the altitude from A to BC will give us the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate the intersection point using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from C to AB (vertical line)\neq1 = Eq(x, -2)\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A to BC\neq2 = Eq(y, 1 * (x + 7) + 3)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\n\n# Print the solution\nprint((round(solution[x], 3), round(solution[y], 3)))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the intersection point of the altitudes, which is the orthocenter of the triangle.",
    "The code execution has provided the coordinates of the orthocenter as (-2, 8). This is the point where the altitudes of the triangle intersect.\n\n<<<(-2, 8)>>>"
