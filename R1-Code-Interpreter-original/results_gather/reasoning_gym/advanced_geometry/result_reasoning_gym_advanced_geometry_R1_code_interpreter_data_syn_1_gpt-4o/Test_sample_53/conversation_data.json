    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- \\( A = (9, -7) \\)\n- \\( B = (0, -4) \\)\n- \\( C = (-3, 4) \\)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n1. Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes (perpendicular to the sides).\n3. Find the equations of the altitudes.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\n### Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides\n- Slope of \\( BC \\): \\(\\frac{4 - (-4)}{-3 - 0} = \\frac{8}{-3} = -\\frac{8}{3}\\)\n- Slope of \\( AC \\): \\(\\frac{4 - (-7)}{-3 - 9} = \\frac{11}{-12} = -\\frac{11}{12}\\)\n- Slope of \\( AB \\): \\(\\frac{-4 - (-7)}{0 - 9} = \\frac{3}{-9} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n\n### Step 2: Determine the slopes of the altitudes\n- Altitude from \\( A \\) is perpendicular to \\( BC \\), so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{8}{3}\\), which is \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\).\n- Altitude from \\( B \\) is perpendicular to \\( AC \\), so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{11}{12}\\), which is \\(\\frac{12}{11}\\).\n- Altitude from \\( C \\) is perpendicular to \\( AB \\), so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\), which is \\(3\\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the equations of the altitudes\n- Equation of altitude from \\( A \\): \\( y + 7 = \\frac{3}{8}(x - 9) \\)\n- Equation of altitude from \\( B \\): \\( y + 4 = \\frac{12}{11}(x - 0) \\)\n- Equation of altitude from \\( C \\): \\( y - 4 = 3(x + 3) \\)\n\n### Step 4: Solve the system of equations\nWe will solve the equations of two altitudes to find the orthocenter. Let's use the altitudes from \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of altitude from A\neq1 = Eq(y + 7, (3/8)*(x - 9))\n\n# Equation of altitude from B\neq2 = Eq(y + 4, (12/11)*x)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter = (round(solution[x], 3), round(solution[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
    "The code execution has provided the coordinates of the orthocenter as \\((-8.905, -13.714)\\). \n\nTherefore, the orthocenter of the triangle with vertices \\( A = (9, -7) \\), \\( B = (0, -4) \\), and \\( C = (-3, 4) \\) is:\n\n<<<(-8.905, -13.714)>>>"
