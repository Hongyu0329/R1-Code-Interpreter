    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or the line containing the opposite side).\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-5, -5)\n- B = (-4, 2)\n- C = (-5, 7)\n\nLet's determine the equations of the altitudes:\n\n1. **Altitude from A to BC:**\n   - The line BC is vertical (since B and C have the same x-coordinate), so the altitude from A to BC is horizontal.\n   - The equation of the altitude from A is y = -5.\n\n2. **Altitude from B to AC:**\n   - The slope of AC is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of AC} = \\frac{y_C - y_A}{x_C - x_A} = \\frac{7 - (-5)}{-5 - (-5)} = \\text{undefined (vertical line)}\n     \\]\n   - Since AC is vertical, the altitude from B to AC is horizontal.\n   - The equation of the altitude from B is y = 2.\n\n3. **Altitude from C to AB:**\n   - The slope of AB is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of AB} = \\frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A} = \\frac{2 - (-5)}{-4 - (-5)} = \\frac{7}{1} = 7\n     \\]\n   - The perpendicular slope (altitude from C) is the negative reciprocal: \\(-\\frac{1}{7}\\).\n   - Using point C to find the equation of the line:\n     \\[\n     y - 7 = -\\frac{1}{7}(x + 5)\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{1}{7}x + \\frac{5}{7} + 7\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying further:\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{1}{7}x + \\frac{54}{7}\n     \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of these altitudes. The intersection of y = -5 and y = 2 is not possible, so we need to find the intersection of y = -5 and the altitude from C.\n\nLet's solve for the intersection of y = -5 and \\(y = -\\frac{1}{7}x + \\frac{54}{7}\\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from C\naltitude_C = Eq(y, -1/7 * x + 54/7)\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A\naltitude_A = Eq(y, -5)\n\n# Solve for the intersection\nintersection = solve((altitude_C, altitude_A), (x, y))\nprint(intersection)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the intersection point of the altitudes, which is the orthocenter of the triangle.",
    "The code output indicates that the intersection point of the altitudes is at \\(x = 89\\) and \\(y = -5\\). This means the orthocenter of the triangle is at the coordinates (89, -5).\n\n<<<(89, -5)>>>"
