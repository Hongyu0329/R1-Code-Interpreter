    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle given its vertices, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. The altitudes are the perpendicular lines drawn from each vertex to the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of triangle ABC:\n- A = (10, -2)\n- B = (-10, 5)\n- C = (7, 1)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle:**\n   - Slope of BC\n   - Slope of AC\n   - Slope of AB\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC.\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation for each altitude.\n\n4. **Find the intersection of any two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by any two altitude equations to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate these using Python:\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (10, -2)\nB = (-10, 5)\nC = (7, 1)\n\n# Function to calculate the slope of a line given two points\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    if p2[0] - p1[0] == 0:\n        return None  # Vertical line\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC if slope_BC is not None else None\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC if slope_AC is not None else None\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB if slope_AB is not None else None\n\n# Function to find the y-intercept of a line given a point and slope\ndef y_intercept(point, slope):\n    if slope is None:\n        return None\n    return point[1] - slope * point[0]\n\n# Equations of the altitudes\nintercept_A = y_intercept(A, slope_altitude_A)\nintercept_B = y_intercept(B, slope_altitude_B)\n\n# Solve the system of equations for the intersection of two altitudes\n# y = slope_altitude_A * x + intercept_A\n# y = slope_altitude_B * x + intercept_B\n\n# If both slopes are not None, solve for x\nif slope_altitude_A is not None and slope_altitude_B is not None:\n    x_orthocenter = (intercept_B - intercept_A) / (slope_altitude_A - slope_altitude_B)\n    y_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + intercept_A\nelse:\n    # Handle vertical line cases\n    if slope_altitude_A is None:\n        x_orthocenter = A[0]\n        y_orthocenter = slope_altitude_B * x_orthocenter + intercept_B\n    elif slope_altitude_B is None:\n        x_orthocenter = B[0]\n        y_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + intercept_A\n\n# Round the coordinates to 3 decimal places\nx_orthocenter = round(x_orthocenter, 3)\ny_orthocenter = round(y_orthocenter, 3)\n\nprint((x_orthocenter, y_orthocenter))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the orthocenter of the triangle.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we have obtained the coordinates of the orthocenter of triangle ABC. The orthocenter is the point where the altitudes of the triangle intersect.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to three decimal places, is:\n\n<<<(18.308, 33.308)>>>"
