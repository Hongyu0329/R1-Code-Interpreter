    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or the line containing the opposite side).\n\nGiven the vertices of triangle ABC:\n- A = (-4, 8)\n- B = (2, 10)\n- C = (-5, 9)\n\nWe can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle:**\n   - Slope of BC\n   - Slope of AC\n   - Slope of AB\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation for each altitude.\n\n4. **Find the intersection of any two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by any two altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate these steps using Python:\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-4, 8)\nB = (2, 10)\nC = (-5, 9)\n\n# Function to calculate the slope of a line given two points\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    if p2[0] - p1[0] == 0:\n        return None  # Vertical line\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = None if slope_BC is None else -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = None if slope_AC is None else -1 / slope_AC\nslope_altitude_C = None if slope_AB is None else -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Function to find the intersection of two lines given in point-slope form\ndef intersection(slope1, point1, slope2, point2):\n    if slope1 is None:  # Vertical line\n        x = point1[0]\n        y = slope2 * (x - point2[0]) + point2[1]\n    elif slope2 is None:  # Vertical line\n        x = point2[0]\n        y = slope1 * (x - point1[0]) + point1[1]\n    else:\n        x = (slope1 * point1[0] - slope2 * point2[0] + point2[1] - point1[1]) / (slope1 - slope2)\n        y = slope1 * (x - point1[0]) + point1[1]\n    return (x, y)\n\n# Find the intersection of the altitudes from A and B\northocenter = intersection(slope_altitude_A, A, slope_altitude_B, B)\n\n# Round the coordinates to 3 decimal places\northocenter = (round(orthocenter[0], 3), round(orthocenter[1], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of the altitudes from vertices A and B. Let's execute the code to find the orthocenter.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the coordinates of the orthocenter of triangle ABC. The orthocenter is the point where the altitudes of the triangle intersect.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to three decimal places, is:\n\n<<<(-3.5, 4.5)>>>"
