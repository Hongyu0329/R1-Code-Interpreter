    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle:**\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_3 - y_2) / (x_3 - x_2)\\)\n   - Slope of CA: \\((y_1 - y_3) / (x_1 - x_3)\\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of CA.\n   - The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation: \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is a point on the line.\n\n4. **Find the intersection of two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by the equations of two altitudes to find their intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate these steps using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-2, 2)\nB = (-10, -4)\nC = (-3, 2)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    if p2[0] == p1[0]:  # vertical line\n        return None\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_CA = slope(C, A)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = None if slope_BC is None else -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = None if slope_CA is None else -1 / slope_CA\nslope_altitude_C = None if slope_AB is None else -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equation of altitude from A (using point-slope form)\n# y - y1 = m(x - x1) => y = m*x + (y1 - m*x1)\nif slope_altitude_A is not None:\n    intercept_A = A[1] - slope_altitude_A * A[0]\nelse:\n    intercept_A = A[0]  # x = constant\n\n# Equation of altitude from B\nif slope_altitude_B is not None:\n    intercept_B = B[1] - slope_altitude_B * B[0]\nelse:\n    intercept_B = B[0]  # x = constant\n\n# Solve for intersection of altitudes from A and B\nif slope_altitude_A is not None and slope_altitude_B is not None:\n    # y = m1*x + c1 and y = m2*x + c2\n    # m1*x + c1 = m2*x + c2 => (m1 - m2)*x = c2 - c1\n    x_orthocenter = (intercept_B - intercept_A) / (slope_altitude_A - slope_altitude_B)\n    y_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + intercept_A\nelif slope_altitude_A is None:\n    # Altitude from A is vertical, x = intercept_A\n    x_orthocenter = intercept_A\n    y_orthocenter = slope_altitude_B * x_orthocenter + intercept_B\nelse:\n    # Altitude from B is vertical, x = intercept_B\n    x_orthocenter = intercept_B\n    y_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + intercept_A\n\n# Round the coordinates to 3 decimal places\nx_orthocenter = round(x_orthocenter, 3)\ny_orthocenter = round(y_orthocenter, 3)\n\nprint((x_orthocenter, y_orthocenter))\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the orthocenter of triangle ABC.",
    "The error indicates that one of the slopes of the sides of the triangle is zero, leading to a division by zero when calculating the negative reciprocal for the altitude. This happens because one of the sides is horizontal, which is expected since points A and C have the same y-coordinate.\n\nLet's address this by handling the case where the slope is zero separately. If a side is horizontal, the corresponding altitude will be vertical, and vice versa.\n\nHere's the corrected approach:\n\n1. If a side is horizontal (slope = 0), the altitude from the opposite vertex is vertical (x = constant).\n2. If a side is vertical (slope is undefined), the altitude from the opposite vertex is horizontal (y = constant).\n\nLet's update the code to handle these cases:\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-2, 2)\nB = (-10, -4)\nC = (-3, 2)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    if p2[0] == p1[0]:  # vertical line\n        return None\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_CA = slope(C, A)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = None if slope_BC is None else (-1 / slope_BC if slope_BC != 0 else None)\nslope_altitude_B = None if slope_CA is None else (-1 / slope_CA if slope_CA != 0 else None)\nslope_altitude_C = None if slope_AB is None else (-1 / slope_AB if slope_AB != 0 else None)\n\n# Equation of altitude from A (using point-slope form)\nif slope_altitude_A is not None:\n    intercept_A = A[1] - slope_altitude_A * A[0]\nelse:\n    intercept_A = A[0]  # x = constant\n\n# Equation of altitude from B\nif slope_altitude_B is not None:\n    intercept_B = B[1] - slope_altitude_B * B[0]\nelse:\n    intercept_B = B[0]  # x = constant\n\n# Solve for intersection of altitudes from A and B\nif slope_altitude_A is not None and slope_altitude_B is not None:\n    x_orthocenter = (intercept_B - intercept_A) / (slope_altitude_A - slope_altitude_B)\n    y_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + intercept_A\nelif slope_altitude_A is None:\n    x_orthocenter = intercept_A\n    y_orthocenter = slope_altitude_B * x_orthocenter + intercept_B\nelse:\n    x_orthocenter = intercept_B\n    y_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + intercept_A\n\n# Round the coordinates to 3 decimal places\nx_orthocenter = round(x_orthocenter, 3)\ny_orthocenter = round(y_orthocenter, 3)\n\nprint((x_orthocenter, y_orthocenter))\n```\n\nLet's execute the corrected code to find the orthocenter of triangle ABC.",
