    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of triangle ABC:\n- A = (-1, 3)\n- B = (-3, 4)\n- C = (-1, -2)\n\nWe can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle:**\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n   - Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation: \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\)\n\n4. **Find the intersection of two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by the equations of two altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate these using Python:\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-1, 3)\nB = (-3, 4)\nC = (-1, -2)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    if p2[0] - p1[0] == 0:\n        return None  # Vertical line\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = None if slope_BC is None else -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = None if slope_AC is None else -1 / slope_AC\nslope_altitude_C = None if slope_AB is None else -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equation of altitude from A (using point-slope form)\n# y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n# y = m(x - x1) + y1\nif slope_altitude_A is not None:\n    intercept_A = A[1] - slope_altitude_A * A[0]\nelse:\n    intercept_A = A[0]  # x = constant\n\n# Equation of altitude from B\nif slope_altitude_B is not None:\n    intercept_B = B[1] - slope_altitude_B * B[0]\nelse:\n    intercept_B = B[0]  # x = constant\n\n# Solve for intersection of altitudes from A and B\nif slope_altitude_A is not None and slope_altitude_B is not None:\n    # y = slope_altitude_A * x + intercept_A\n    # y = slope_altitude_B * x + intercept_B\n    # slope_altitude_A * x + intercept_A = slope_altitude_B * x + intercept_B\n    x_orthocenter = (intercept_B - intercept_A) / (slope_altitude_A - slope_altitude_B)\n    y_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + intercept_A\nelif slope_altitude_A is None:\n    # Altitude from A is vertical, x = intercept_A\n    x_orthocenter = intercept_A\n    y_orthocenter = slope_altitude_B * x_orthocenter + intercept_B\nelif slope_altitude_B is None:\n    # Altitude from B is vertical, x = intercept_B\n    x_orthocenter = intercept_B\n    y_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + intercept_A\n\n# Round the coordinates to 3 decimal places\nx_orthocenter = round(x_orthocenter, 3)\ny_orthocenter = round(y_orthocenter, 3)\n\nprint((x_orthocenter, y_orthocenter))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the orthocenter of the triangle.",
    "The code execution has provided the coordinates of the orthocenter as (-3, 2.333). This result is derived from the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle formed by the given vertices A, B, and C.\n\n<<<(-3, 2.333)>>>"
