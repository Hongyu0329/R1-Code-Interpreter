    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle given its vertices, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or its extension).\n\nGiven the vertices of triangle ABC:\n- A = (8, -7)\n- B = (0, -3)\n- C = (10, 9)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes (which are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides).\n3. Find the equations of the altitudes.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's start by calculating the slopes of the sides:\n\n- Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\nThen, we find the slopes of the altitudes:\n- Altitude from A is perpendicular to BC.\n- Altitude from B is perpendicular to AC.\n- Altitude from C is perpendicular to AB.\n\nFinally, we solve the equations of two altitudes to find their intersection point.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (8, -7)\nB = (0, -3)\nC = (10, 9)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A (y - y1 = m(x - x1))\n# y + 7 = slope_altitude_A * (x - 8)\n# y = slope_altitude_A * x - slope_altitude_A * 8 - 7\n\n# Equation of the altitude from B (y - y1 = m(x - x1))\n# y + 3 = slope_altitude_B * (x - 0)\n# y = slope_altitude_B * x - 3\n\n# Solving the system of equations for altitudes from A and B\n# slope_altitude_A * x - y = slope_altitude_A * 8 + 7\n# slope_altitude_B * x - y = 3\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\neq1 = Eq(slope_altitude_A * x - y, slope_altitude_A * 8 + 7)\neq2 = Eq(slope_altitude_B * x - y, 3)\n\n# Solve the equations\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by solving the system of equations for the altitudes from vertices A and B. Let's execute it to find the orthocenter.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we have found the orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A, B, and C. The orthocenter is the point where the altitudes of the triangle intersect.\n\nThe coordinates of the orthocenter are:\n\n<<<(3.765, -3.471)>>>"
