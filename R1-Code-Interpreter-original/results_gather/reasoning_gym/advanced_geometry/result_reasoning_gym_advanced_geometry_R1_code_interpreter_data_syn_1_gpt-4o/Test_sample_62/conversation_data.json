    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-5, -7), B=(-2, -1), and C=(3, -10), we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC using the distance formula:\n\n1. Distance AB = \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\)\n2. Distance BC = \\(\\sqrt{(x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2}\\)\n3. Distance AC = \\(\\sqrt{(x_3 - x_1)^2 + (y_3 - y_1)^2}\\)\n\nThen, we can apply the law of cosines to find the angle at B:\n\n\\[ \\cos(B) = \\frac{AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2}{2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BC} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the angle from radians to degrees.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nA = (-5, -7)\nB = (-2, -1)\nC = (3, -10)\n\n# Function to calculate distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nAC = distance(A, C)\n\n# Calculate the angle at B using the law of cosines\ncos_B = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\nangle_B_rad = math.acos(cos_B)\n\n# Convert the angle from radians to degrees\nangle_B_deg = math.degrees(angle_B_rad)\n\n# Round the result to 3 decimal places\nangle_B_deg_rounded = round(angle_B_deg, 3)\n\nprint(angle_B_deg_rounded)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the angle at B.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the angle at vertex B. The angle at B in the triangle with vertices A=(-5, -7), B=(-2, -1), and C=(3, -10) is approximately 55.62 degrees.\n\n<<<55.62°>>>"
