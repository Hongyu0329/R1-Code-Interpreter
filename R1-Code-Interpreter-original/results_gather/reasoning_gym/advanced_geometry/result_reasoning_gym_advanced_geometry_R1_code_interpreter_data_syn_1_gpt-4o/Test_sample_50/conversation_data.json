    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (5, 6)\n- B = (-1, -5)\n- C = (-5, -2)\n\nWe can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle:**\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_C - y_B) / (x_C - x_B)\\)\n   - Slope of AC: \\((y_C - y_A) / (x_C - x_A)\\)\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_B - y_A) / (x_B - x_A)\\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation: \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is a point on the line.\n\n4. **Find the intersection of any two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by the equations of two altitudes to find their intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate these steps using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (5, 6)\nB = (-1, -5)\nC = (-5, -2)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\n# Altitude from A: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n# Altitude from B: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\n# Altitude from A: y - 6 = slope_altitude_A * (x - 5)\n# Altitude from B: y + 5 = slope_altitude_B * (x + 1)\n\n# Solving the system of equations to find the intersection\n# y = slope_altitude_A * (x - 5) + 6\n# y = slope_altitude_B * (x + 1) - 5\n\n# Equating the two expressions for y\n# slope_altitude_A * (x - 5) + 6 = slope_altitude_B * (x + 1) - 5\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\neq1 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_A * (x - 5) + 6)\neq2 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_B * (x + 1) - 5)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter = (round(solution[x], 3), round(solution[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of two altitudes. Let's execute the code to find the orthocenter.",
