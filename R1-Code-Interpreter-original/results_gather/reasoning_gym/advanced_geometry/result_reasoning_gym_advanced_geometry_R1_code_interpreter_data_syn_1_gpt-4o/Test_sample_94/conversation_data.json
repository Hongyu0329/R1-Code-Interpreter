    "To find the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with given coordinates, we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The angle between two vectors can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\| \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) are vectors.\n- \\(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\) is the dot product of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\n- \\(\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|\\) are the magnitudes of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\n\nFor angle ABC, we need vectors \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{BC}\\):\n- \\(\\mathbf{AB} = B - A = (9 - (-9), 4 - 8) = (18, -4)\\)\n- \\(\\mathbf{BC} = C - B = (-3 - 9, 10 - 4) = (-12, 6)\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the dot product and magnitudes of these vectors, and then find the angle using the inverse cosine function.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the vectors AB and BC\nAB = (18, -4)\nBC = (-12, 6)\n\n# Calculate the dot product of AB and BC\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Calculate the magnitudes of AB and BC\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Calculate the cosine of the angle\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Calculate the angle in degrees\nangle_ABC = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_theta))\n\n# Round the angle to 3 decimal places\nangle_ABC_rounded = round(angle_ABC, 3)\n\nprint(angle_ABC_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the angle ABC in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the calculated measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC is approximately 165.964 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<165.964°>>>"
