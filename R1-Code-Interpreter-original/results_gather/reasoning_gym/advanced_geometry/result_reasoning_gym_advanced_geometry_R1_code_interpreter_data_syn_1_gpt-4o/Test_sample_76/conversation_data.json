    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or the line containing the opposite side).\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-8, 2)\n- B = (-2, 2)\n- C = (-4, -8)\n\nWe can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides:**\n   - Slope of AB: Since A and B have the same y-coordinate, AB is a horizontal line, and its slope is 0.\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (2 - (-8)) / (-2 - (-4)) = 10 / 2 = 5\\)\n   - Slope of CA: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (2 - (-8)) / (-8 - (-4)) = 10 / -4 = -2.5\\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from C to AB is vertical because AB is horizontal, so its slope is undefined.\n   - The altitude from A to BC is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of 5, which is \\(-1/5\\).\n   - The altitude from B to CA is perpendicular to CA, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of -2.5, which is \\(0.4\\).\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from C to AB is a vertical line through C, so its equation is \\(x = -4\\).\n   - The altitude from A to BC passes through A and has a slope of \\(-1/5\\). Its equation is \\(y - 2 = -1/5(x + 8)\\).\n   - The altitude from B to CA passes through B and has a slope of \\(0.4\\). Its equation is \\(y - 2 = 0.4(x + 2)\\).\n\n4. **Find the intersection of the altitudes:**\n   - We need to solve the system of equations to find the intersection point of these altitudes.\n\nLet's calculate the intersection point using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A to BC\neq1 = Eq(y - 2, -1/5 * (x + 8))\n\n# Equation of the altitude from B to CA\neq2 = Eq(y - 2, 0.4 * (x + 2))\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nintersection = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\n\n# Print the intersection point\nprint(intersection)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the coordinates of the orthocenter. The coordinates are given as \\(x = -4.00000000000000\\) and \\(y = 1.20000000000000\\).\n\nTo adhere to the problem's requirements, we need to round these coordinates to three decimal places. Therefore, the orthocenter of the triangle is:\n\n<<<(-4.000, 1.200)>>>"
