    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-4, 4), B=(6, 5), and C=(6, 1), we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The angle θ between two vectors \\(\\vec{u}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\) can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{\\|\\vec{u}\\| \\|\\vec{v}\\|}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}\\) is the dot product of vectors \\(\\vec{u}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\).\n- \\(\\|\\vec{u}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\) are the magnitudes of vectors \\(\\vec{u}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\).\n\nFirst, we need to find the vectors \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{BC}\\):\n- \\(\\vec{AB} = B - A = (6 - (-4), 5 - 4) = (10, 1)\\)\n- \\(\\vec{BC} = C - B = (6 - 6, 1 - 5) = (0, -4)\\)\n\nNext, we calculate the dot product \\(\\vec{AB} \\cdot \\vec{BC}\\) and the magnitudes \\(\\|\\vec{AB}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{BC}\\|\\).\n\nFinally, we use the arccosine function to find the angle in degrees.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the vectors\nAB = (10, 1)\nBC = (0, -4)\n\n# Calculate the dot product\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Calculate the magnitudes\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Calculate the cosine of the angle\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Calculate the angle in radians\ntheta_radians = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert the angle to degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(theta_radians)\n\n# Round the result to 3 decimal places\ntheta_degrees_rounded = round(theta_degrees, 3)\n\nprint(theta_degrees_rounded)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the angle at B.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the angle at vertex B in the triangle is approximately 95.711 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<95.711°>>>"
