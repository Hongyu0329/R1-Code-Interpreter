    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of triangle ABC:\n- A = (-8, 10)\n- B = (4, -10)\n- C = (-6, -1)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes, which are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides.\n3. Find the equations of the altitudes using the point-slope form of a line equation.\n4. Solve the system of equations formed by the altitudes to find their intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's start by calculating the slopes of the sides:\n\n- Slope of BC: \\((y_C - y_B) / (x_C - x_B)\\)\n- Slope of AC: \\((y_C - y_A) / (x_C - x_A)\\)\n- Slope of AB: \\((y_B - y_A) / (x_B - x_A)\\)\n\nNext, we find the slopes of the altitudes:\n\n- Altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n- Altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC.\n- Altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\nFinally, we solve the system of equations for the altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-8, 10)\nB = (4, -10)\nC = (-6, -1)\n\n# Function to calculate the slope of a line given two points\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    if p2[0] - p1[0] == 0:\n        return None  # Vertical line\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC if slope_BC is not None else None\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC if slope_AC is not None else None\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB if slope_AB is not None else None\n\n# Function to find the intersection of two lines given a point and a slope\ndef intersection(p1, m1, p2, m2):\n    if m1 is None:  # Vertical line through p1\n        x = p1[0]\n        y = m2 * (x - p2[0]) + p2[1]\n    elif m2 is None:  # Vertical line through p2\n        x = p2[0]\n        y = m1 * (x - p1[0]) + p1[1]\n    else:\n        x = (m1 * p1[0] - m2 * p2[0] + p2[1] - p1[1]) / (m1 - m2)\n        y = m1 * (x - p1[0]) + p1[1]\n    return (x, y)\n\n# Find the orthocenter by intersecting two altitudes\n# Using altitudes from A and B\northocenter = intersection(A, slope_altitude_A, B, slope_altitude_B)\n\n# Round the coordinates to 3 decimal places\northocenter = (round(orthocenter[0], 3), round(orthocenter[1], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of two altitudes. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we obtained the coordinates of the orthocenter as (-31.87, -16.522). \n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<(-31.87, -16.522)>>>"
