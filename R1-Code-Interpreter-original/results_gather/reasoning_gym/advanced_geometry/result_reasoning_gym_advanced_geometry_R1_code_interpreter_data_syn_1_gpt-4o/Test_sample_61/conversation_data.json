    "To find the radius of the incircle of triangle ABC, we need to use the formula for the radius \\( r \\) of the incircle of a triangle:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{A}{s} \\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) is the area of the triangle and \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the side lengths of the triangle using the distance formula:\n\n1. \\( AB = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\)\n2. \\( BC = \\sqrt{(x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2} \\)\n3. \\( CA = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_3)^2 + (y_1 - y_3)^2} \\)\n\nNext, we calculate the semi-perimeter \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the area \\( A \\) of the triangle using the formula:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right| \\]\n\nFinally, we can find the radius \\( r \\) using the formula mentioned above.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the radius of the incircle.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the triangle\nA = (8, 1)\nB = (-7, -8)\nC = (1, -6)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate side lengths\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nCA = distance(C, A)\n\n# Calculate semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate area using the determinant method\narea = 0.5 * abs(A[0]*(B[1]-C[1]) + B[0]*(C[1]-A[1]) + C[0]*(A[1]-B[1]))\n\n# Calculate the radius of the incircle\nr = area / s\n\n# Print the radius rounded to 3 decimal places\nprint(round(r, 3))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the radius of the incircle.",
