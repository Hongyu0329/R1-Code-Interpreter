    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or the line containing the opposite side).\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-1, 4)\n- B = (4, -6)\n- C = (0, -7)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n1. Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes (which are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides).\n3. Write the equations of the altitudes.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's start by calculating the slopes of the sides:\n\n- Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\nThen, calculate the slopes of the altitudes:\n- The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC.\n- The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC.\n- The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB.\n\nFinally, solve the system of equations formed by the altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-1, 4)\nB = (4, -6)\nC = (0, -7)\n\n# Function to calculate the slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    if p2[0] - p1[0] == 0:\n        return None  # vertical line\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC if slope_BC is not None else 0\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC if slope_AC is not None else 0\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB if slope_AB is not None else 0\n\n# Equations of the altitudes\n# Altitude from A: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n# Altitude from B: y - y2 = m(x - x2)\n# Altitude from C: y - y3 = m(x - x3)\n\n# Altitude from A\nx1, y1 = A\nif slope_altitude_A is not None:\n    intercept_A = y1 - slope_altitude_A * x1\nelse:\n    intercept_A = x1\n\n# Altitude from B\nx2, y2 = B\nif slope_altitude_B is not None:\n    intercept_B = y2 - slope_altitude_B * x2\nelse:\n    intercept_B = x2\n\n# Altitude from C\nx3, y3 = C\nif slope_altitude_C is not None:\n    intercept_C = y3 - slope_altitude_C * x3\nelse:\n    intercept_C = x3\n\n# Solve the system of equations to find the orthocenter\n# We can solve for the intersection of two altitudes, say from A and B\n\nif slope_altitude_A is not None and slope_altitude_B is not None:\n    # y = slope_altitude_A * x + intercept_A\n    # y = slope_altitude_B * x + intercept_B\n    # Set the equations equal to each other to find x\n    x_orthocenter = (intercept_B - intercept_A) / (slope_altitude_A - slope_altitude_B)\n    y_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + intercept_A\nelif slope_altitude_A is None:\n    # Altitude from A is vertical\n    x_orthocenter = intercept_A\n    y_orthocenter = slope_altitude_B * x_orthocenter + intercept_B\nelif slope_altitude_B is None:\n    # Altitude from B is vertical\n    x_orthocenter = intercept_B\n    y_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + intercept_A\n\n# Round the coordinates to 3 decimal places\nx_orthocenter = round(x_orthocenter, 3)\ny_orthocenter = round(y_orthocenter, 3)\n\nprint((x_orthocenter, y_orthocenter))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the orthocenter of the triangle.",
