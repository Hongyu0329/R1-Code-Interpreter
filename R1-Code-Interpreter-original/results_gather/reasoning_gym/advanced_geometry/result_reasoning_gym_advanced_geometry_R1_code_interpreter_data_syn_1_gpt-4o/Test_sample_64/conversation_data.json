    "To find the radius of the incircle of triangle ABC, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the side lengths of the triangle**: \n   - Use the distance formula to find the lengths of sides AB, BC, and CA.\n   \n2. **Calculate the semi-perimeter (s) of the triangle**: \n   - The semi-perimeter is half the sum of the side lengths.\n\n3. **Calculate the area (A) of the triangle**: \n   - Use the formula for the area of a triangle with given vertices: \n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right|\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the radius (r) of the incircle**: \n   - The radius of the incircle is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{A}{s}\n     \\]\n\nLet's compute these values step by step using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (0, 2)\nB = (-4, -7)\nC = (0, -9)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate side lengths\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nCA = distance(C, A)\n\n# Calculate semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate area using the formula for the area of a triangle with given vertices\narea = 0.5 * abs(A[0]*(B[1]-C[1]) + B[0]*(C[1]-A[1]) + C[0]*(A[1]-B[1]))\n\n# Calculate the radius of the incircle\nr = area / s\n\n# Print the radius rounded to 3 decimal places\nprint(round(r, 3))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the radius of the incircle of triangle ABC. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the radius of the incircle of triangle ABC is calculated to be approximately 1.738. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1.738>>>"
