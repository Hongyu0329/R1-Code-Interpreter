    "To find the incircle radius of triangle ABC, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the side lengths of the triangle**: Use the distance formula to find the lengths of sides AB, BC, and CA.\n\n2. **Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle**: The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) is half the sum of the side lengths.\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the triangle**: Use Heron's formula, which requires the semi-perimeter and the side lengths.\n\n4. **Calculate the incircle radius**: The radius \\( r \\) of the incircle is given by the formula \\( r = \\frac{A}{s} \\), where \\( A \\) is the area of the triangle and \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-7, 6)\nB = (5, 8)\nC = (-5, 4)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the side lengths\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nCA = distance(C, A)\n\n# Calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate the area using Heron's formula\narea = math.sqrt(s * (s - AB) * (s - BC) * (s - CA))\n\n# Calculate the incircle radius\nincircle_radius = area / s\n\n# Print the incircle radius rounded to 3 decimal places\nprint(round(incircle_radius, 3))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the incircle radius.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the incircle radius of triangle ABC whose vertices are A=(-7, 6), B=(5, 8), and C=(-5, 4).
