    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle given its vertices, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process to find the orthocenter:\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - The slope of line BC (m_BC) can be calculated using the formula: \n     \\[\n     m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n     \\]\n   - Similarly, calculate the slopes of lines AC and AB.\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - The slope of the altitude from A to BC is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - Similarly, find the slopes of the altitudes from B to AC and from C to AB.\n\n3. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to find the equations of the altitudes. The point-slope form is:\n     \\[\n     y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n     \\]\n   - Use the coordinates of the vertices and the slopes of the altitudes to find these equations.\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by any two of the altitude equations to find their intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (3, 1)\nB = (-9, 8)\nC = (-10, 7)\n\n# Function to calculate the slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nm_BC = slope(B, C)\nm_CA = slope(C, A)\nm_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nm_altitude_A = -1 / m_BC\nm_altitude_B = -1 / m_CA\nm_altitude_C = -1 / m_AB\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\n# Altitude from A: y - 1 = m_altitude_A * (x - 3)\n# Altitude from B: y - 8 = m_altitude_B * (x + 9)\n\n# Solving the system of equations to find the intersection\n# y = m_altitude_A * (x - 3) + 1\n# y = m_altitude_B * (x + 9) + 8\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\neq1 = Eq(y, m_altitude_A * (x - 3) + 1)\neq2 = Eq(y, m_altitude_B * (x + 9) + 8)\n\n# Solve the equations\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of two altitudes. Let's execute the code to find the orthocenter.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we have found the orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A=(3, 1), B=(-9, 8), and C=(-10, 7). The orthocenter is the point where the altitudes intersect.\n\nThe calculated coordinates of the orthocenter are:\n\n<<<(-7.421, 11.421)>>>"
