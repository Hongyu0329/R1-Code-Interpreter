    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(6, -2), B=(-9, 2), and C=(10, -3), we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. \n\nThe formula for the law of cosines is:\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(C) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n- \\( C \\) is the angle opposite side \\( c \\).\n\nIn this case, we want to find the angle at B, so we will use the sides opposite to the vertices A, B, and C:\n- \\( AB \\) is the side opposite to vertex C\n- \\( BC \\) is the side opposite to vertex A\n- \\( AC \\) is the side opposite to vertex B\n\nFirst, we calculate the lengths of the sides using the distance formula:\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the lengths of the sides and then use the law of cosines to find the angle at B.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (6, -2)\nB = (-9, 2)\nC = (10, -3)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(point1, point2):\n    return math.sqrt((point2[0] - point1[0])**2 + (point2[1] - point1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nAC = distance(A, C)\n\n# Use the law of cosines to find the angle at B\n# cos(B) = (AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2) / (2 * AB * BC)\ncos_B = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\n\n# Calculate the angle in radians and then convert to degrees\nangle_B_rad = math.acos(cos_B)\nangle_B_deg = math.degrees(angle_B_rad)\n\n# Round the angle to 3 decimal places\nangle_B_deg_rounded = round(angle_B_deg, 3)\n\nprint(angle_B_deg_rounded)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the angle at vertex B in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
