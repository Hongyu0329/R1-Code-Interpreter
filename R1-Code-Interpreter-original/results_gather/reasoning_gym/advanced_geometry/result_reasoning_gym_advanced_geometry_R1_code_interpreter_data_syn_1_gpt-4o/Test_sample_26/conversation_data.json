    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(4, 2), B=(1, -1), and C=(-2, 4), we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines states that for any triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and opposite angles \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) respectively, the following holds:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(C) \\]\n\nIn this case, we need to find the angle at B, which we'll denote as \\(\\angle ABC\\). We first need to calculate the lengths of the sides \\(AB\\), \\(BC\\), and \\(AC\\).\n\n1. Calculate the length of \\(AB\\):\n   \\[ AB = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n   where \\(A = (4, 2)\\) and \\(B = (1, -1)\\).\n\n2. Calculate the length of \\(BC\\):\n   \\[ BC = \\sqrt{(x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2} \\]\n   where \\(B = (1, -1)\\) and \\(C = (-2, 4)\\).\n\n3. Calculate the length of \\(AC\\):\n   \\[ AC = \\sqrt{(x_3 - x_1)^2 + (y_3 - y_1)^2} \\]\n   where \\(A = (4, 2)\\) and \\(C = (-2, 4)\\).\n\nOnce we have the lengths of the sides, we can use the law of cosines to find \\(\\angle ABC\\):\n\n\\[ \\cos(\\angle ABC) = \\frac{AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2}{2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BC} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the angle from radians to degrees.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nA = (4, 2)\nB = (1, -1)\nC = (-2, 4)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nAC = distance(A, C)\n\n# Calculate the angle at B using the law of cosines\ncos_angle_B = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\nangle_B_rad = math.acos(cos_angle_B)\n\n# Convert the angle from radians to degrees\nangle_B_deg = math.degrees(angle_B_rad)\n\n# Round the result to 3 decimal places\nangle_B_deg_rounded = round(angle_B_deg, 3)\n\nprint(angle_B_deg_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the angle at vertex B in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the angle at vertex B in the triangle is calculated to be approximately 75.964 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<75.964°>>>"
