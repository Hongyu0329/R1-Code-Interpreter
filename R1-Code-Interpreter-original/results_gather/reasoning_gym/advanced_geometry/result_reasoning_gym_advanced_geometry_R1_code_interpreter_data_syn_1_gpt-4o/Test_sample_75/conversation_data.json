    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (9, 8)\n- B = (3, 5)\n- C = (-1, -6)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes (perpendicular to the sides).\n3. Find the equations of the altitudes.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the slopes of the sides\n- Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\n### Step 2: Determine the slopes of the altitudes\nThe slope of an altitude is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the opposite side.\n\n### Step 3: Find the equations of the altitudes\nUsing the point-slope form of a line equation: \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\)\n\n### Step 4: Solve the system of equations\nWe will solve the equations of two altitudes to find their intersection point.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (9, 8)\nB = (3, 5)\nC = (-1, -6)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\n# Altitude from A: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n# Altitude from B: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\n# Altitude from A\nx1, y1 = A\nm1 = slope_altitude_A\n# y - 8 = m1(x - 9)\n# y = m1*x - 9*m1 + 8\n\n# Altitude from B\nx2, y2 = B\nm2 = slope_altitude_B\n# y - 5 = m2(x - 3)\n# y = m2*x - 3*m2 + 5\n\n# Solve the system of equations to find the intersection\n# m1*x - 9*m1 + 8 = m2*x - 3*m2 + 5\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\neq1 = Eq(m1*x - 9*m1 + 8, y)\neq2 = Eq(m2*x - 3*m2 + 5, y)\n\n# Solve for x and y\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter = (round(solution[x], 3), round(solution[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by solving the system of equations for the altitudes. Let's execute it to find the result.",
