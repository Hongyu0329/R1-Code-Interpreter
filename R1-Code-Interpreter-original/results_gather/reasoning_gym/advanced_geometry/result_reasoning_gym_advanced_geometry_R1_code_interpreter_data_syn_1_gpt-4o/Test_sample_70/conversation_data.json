    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- \\( A = (9, 1) \\)\n- \\( B = (-5, 7) \\)\n- \\( C = (9, -5) \\)\n\nLet's calculate the slopes of the sides and then the slopes of the altitudes:\n\n1. **Slope of BC**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{-5 - 7}{9 + 5} = \\frac{-12}{14} = -\\frac{6}{7}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Slope of AC**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{-5 - 1}{9 - 9} = \\text{undefined (vertical line)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Slope of AB**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{7 - 1}{-5 - 9} = \\frac{6}{-14} = -\\frac{3}{7}\n   \\]\n\nNow, calculate the slopes of the altitudes:\n\n- **Altitude from A**: Perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{6}{7}\\), which is \\(\\frac{7}{6}\\).\n\n- **Altitude from B**: Perpendicular to AC, which is a vertical line, so the altitude from B is a horizontal line with slope 0.\n\n- **Altitude from C**: Perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{3}{7}\\), which is \\(\\frac{7}{3}\\).\n\nNext, we find the equations of these altitudes:\n\n1. **Equation of altitude from A**:\n   \\[\n   y - 1 = \\frac{7}{6}(x - 9)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Equation of altitude from B**:\n   \\[\n   y = 7\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equation of altitude from C**:\n   \\[\n   y + 5 = \\frac{7}{3}(x - 9)\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's solve these equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nWe'll solve the system of equations for the altitudes from A and B:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of altitude from A\neq1 = Eq(y - 1, (7/6)*(x - 9))\n\n# Equation of altitude from B\neq2 = Eq(y, 7)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThe code will solve the system of equations to find the intersection point of the altitudes from A and B. Let's execute it to find the orthocenter.",
    "The code output provides the coordinates of the orthocenter as \\( x \\approx 14.143 \\) and \\( y = 7.000 \\). \n\nSince the altitude from B is a horizontal line at \\( y = 7 \\), the intersection with the altitude from A gives us the x-coordinate directly. The y-coordinate is already determined by the horizontal line.\n\nThus, the orthocenter of the triangle is at the point:\n\n<<<(14.143, 7.000)>>>"
