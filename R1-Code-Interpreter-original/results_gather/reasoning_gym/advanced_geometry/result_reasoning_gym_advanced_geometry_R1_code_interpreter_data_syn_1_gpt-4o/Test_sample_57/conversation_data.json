    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (9, -2)\n- B = (-6, 1)\n- C = (-8, -6)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n1. Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes (perpendicular to the sides).\n3. Find the equations of the altitudes.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\n### Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides\n- Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\n### Step 2: Determine the slopes of the altitudes\nThe slope of an altitude is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the opposite side.\n\n### Step 3: Find the equations of the altitudes\nUsing the point-slope form of a line equation, \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is a point on the line.\n\n### Step 4: Solve the system of equations\nWe will solve the equations of two altitudes to find their intersection point.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\n# Define the points\nA = (9, -2)\nB = (-6, 1)\nC = (-8, -6)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_CA = slope(C, A)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_CA\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\n# Altitude from A\n# y - y1 = m(x - x1) => y = m(x - x1) + y1\ndef altitude_equation(point, slope):\n    x1, y1 = point\n    return lambda x: slope * (x - x1) + y1\n\naltitude_A = altitude_equation(A, slope_altitude_A)\naltitude_B = altitude_equation(B, slope_altitude_B)\n\n# Solve for intersection of altitude_A and altitude_B\n# altitude_A(x) = altitude_B(x)\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')\nequation = Eq(altitude_A(x), altitude_B(x))\nx_orthocenter = solve(equation)[0]\ny_orthocenter = altitude_A(x_orthocenter)\n\n# Round the coordinates to 3 decimal places\nx_orthocenter = round(x_orthocenter, 3)\ny_orthocenter = round(y_orthocenter, 3)\n\nprint((x_orthocenter, y_orthocenter))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of two altitudes. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the coordinates of the orthocenter of the triangle. Based on the calculations, the orthocenter is located at the point \\((-6.324, 2.378)\\).\n\n<<<(-6.324, 2.378)>>>"
