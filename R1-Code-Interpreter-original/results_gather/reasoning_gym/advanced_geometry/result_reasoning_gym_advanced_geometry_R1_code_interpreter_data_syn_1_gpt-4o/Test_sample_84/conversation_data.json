    "To find the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with given coordinates, we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Find vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Vector AB = B - A = (-1 - 9, -10 - 7) = (-10, -17)\n   - Vector BC = C - B = (10 - (-1), -7 - (-10)) = (11, 3)\n\n2. **Calculate the dot product of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Dot product = AB_x * BC_x + AB_y * BC_y\n\n3. **Calculate the magnitudes of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Magnitude of AB = sqrt(AB_x^2 + AB_y^2)\n   - Magnitude of BC = sqrt(BC_x^2 + BC_y^2)\n\n4. **Use the dot product to find the cosine of angle ABC**:\n   - cos(ABC) = (Dot product of AB and BC) / (Magnitude of AB * Magnitude of BC)\n\n5. **Find the angle ABC in degrees**:\n   - Angle ABC = arccos(cos(ABC)) in degrees\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the angle.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of points A, B, and C\nA = (9, 7)\nB = (-1, -10)\nC = (10, -7)\n\n# Vectors AB and BC\nAB = (B[0] - A[0], B[1] - A[1])\nBC = (C[0] - B[0], C[1] - B[1])\n\n# Dot product of AB and BC\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Magnitudes of AB and BC\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Cosine of angle ABC\ncos_ABC = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Angle ABC in degrees\nangle_ABC = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_ABC))\n\n# Round the angle to 3 decimal places\nangle_ABC_rounded = round(angle_ABC, 3)\n\nprint(angle_ABC_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the measure of angle ABC in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
