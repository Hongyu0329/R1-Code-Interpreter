    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or its extension). \n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (1, 8)\n- B = (9, -10)\n- C = (-3, 6)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes (which are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides).\n3. Find the equations of the altitudes.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the slopes of the sides\n- Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\n### Step 2: Determine the slopes of the altitudes\n- Altitude from A is perpendicular to BC\n- Altitude from B is perpendicular to AC\n- Altitude from C is perpendicular to AB\n\n### Step 3: Find the equations of the altitudes\n- Use the point-slope form of the line equation: \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\)\n\n### Step 4: Solve the system of equations\n- Solve the equations of two altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (1, 8)\nB = (9, -10)\nC = (-3, 6)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\n# Altitude from A: y - 8 = slope_altitude_A * (x - 1)\n# Altitude from B: y + 10 = slope_altitude_B * (x - 9)\n\n# Solving the system of equations for the intersection\n# y = slope_altitude_A * (x - 1) + 8\n# y = slope_altitude_B * (x - 9) - 10\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\neq1 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_A * (x - 1) + 8)\neq2 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_B * (x - 9) - 10)\n\n# Solve the equations\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by solving the system of equations for the altitudes. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the coordinates of the orthocenter of the triangle. The orthocenter is the intersection point of the altitudes of the triangle.\n\nThe calculated orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A = (1, 8), B = (9, -10), and C = (-3, 6) is approximately:\n\n<<<(0.273, 7.455)>>>"
