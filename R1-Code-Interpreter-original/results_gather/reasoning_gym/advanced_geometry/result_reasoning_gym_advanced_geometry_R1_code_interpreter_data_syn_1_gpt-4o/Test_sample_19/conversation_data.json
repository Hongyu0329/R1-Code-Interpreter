    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- \\( A = (6, 7) \\)\n- \\( B = (-5, -3) \\)\n- \\( C = (-3, 7) \\)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n1. Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes (which are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides).\n3. Write the equations of the altitudes.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\n### Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides\n- Slope of \\( BC \\): \\(\\frac{7 - (-3)}{-3 - (-5)} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\\)\n- Slope of \\( AC \\): \\(\\frac{7 - 7}{-3 - 6} = 0\\)\n- Slope of \\( AB \\): \\(\\frac{7 - (-3)}{6 - (-5)} = \\frac{10}{11}\\)\n\n### Step 2: Determine the slopes of the altitudes\n- Altitude from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\): Slope = \\(-\\frac{1}{5}\\)\n- Altitude from \\( B \\) to \\( AC \\): Slope = Undefined (vertical line)\n- Altitude from \\( C \\) to \\( AB \\): Slope = \\(-\\frac{11}{10}\\)\n\n### Step 3: Write the equations of the altitudes\n- Equation of altitude from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\): \\( y - 7 = -\\frac{1}{5}(x - 6) \\)\n- Equation of altitude from \\( B \\) to \\( AC \\): \\( x = -5 \\)\n- Equation of altitude from \\( C \\) to \\( AB \\): \\( y - 7 = -\\frac{11}{10}(x + 3) \\)\n\n### Step 4: Solve the system of equations\nWe will solve the equations of the altitudes to find their intersection point.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of altitude from A to BC\neq1 = Eq(y - 7, -1/5 * (x - 6))\n\n# Equation of altitude from B to AC (vertical line)\neq2 = Eq(x, -5)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
    "The code output indicates that the intersection of the altitudes from vertex \\( A \\) to side \\( BC \\) and from vertex \\( B \\) to side \\( AC \\) is at the point \\((-5, 9.2)\\).\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's verify by solving the intersection of the other pair of altitudes, specifically from vertex \\( C \\) to side \\( AB \\) and from vertex \\( B \\) to side \\( AC \\).\n\n### Step 4 (continued): Solve the system of equations for the other pair of altitudes\n- Equation of altitude from \\( C \\) to \\( AB \\): \\( y - 7 = -\\frac{11}{10}(x + 3) \\)\n- Equation of altitude from \\( B \\) to \\( AC \\): \\( x = -5 \\)\n\nLet's solve this system to confirm the orthocenter.\n\n```python\n# Equation of altitude from C to AB\neq3 = Eq(y - 7, -11/10 * (x + 3))\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution2 = solve((eq3, eq2), (x, y))\nprint(solution2)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will confirm the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
    "It seems there was an error in the code execution due to the `Eq` function not being recognized. This is likely because the `sympy` library, which provides the `Eq` function, was not properly imported or recognized in the environment. Let's correct this by ensuring the necessary imports and re-evaluating the system of equations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of altitude from C to AB\neq3 = Eq(y - 7, -11/10 * (x + 3))\n\n# Equation of altitude from B to AC (vertical line)\neq2 = Eq(x, -5)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution2 = solve((eq3, eq2), (x, y))\nprint(solution2)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will confirm the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
    "The code output confirms that the intersection of the altitudes from vertex \\( C \\) to side \\( AB \\) and from vertex \\( B \\) to side \\( AC \\) is also at the point \\((-5, 9.2)\\).\n\nThis consistent result from both pairs of altitudes confirms that the orthocenter of the triangle with vertices \\( A = (6, 7) \\), \\( B = (-5, -3) \\), and \\( C = (-3, 7) \\) is indeed at the point \\((-5, 9.2)\\).\n\nThus, the orthocenter of the triangle is:\n\n<<<(-5, 9.2)>>>"
