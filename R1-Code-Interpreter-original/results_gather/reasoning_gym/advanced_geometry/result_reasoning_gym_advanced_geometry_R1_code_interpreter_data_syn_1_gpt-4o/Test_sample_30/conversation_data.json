    "To find the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with given coordinates, we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Find vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Vector AB = B - A = (-3 - (-5), 4 - (-8)) = (2, 12)\n   - Vector BC = C - B = (-1 - (-3), 1 - 4) = (2, -3)\n\n2. **Calculate the dot product of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Dot product = (AB_x * BC_x) + (AB_y * BC_y)\n\n3. **Calculate the magnitudes of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Magnitude of AB = √((AB_x)^2 + (AB_y)^2)\n   - Magnitude of BC = √((BC_x)^2 + (BC_y)^2)\n\n4. **Use the dot product to find the cosine of angle ABC**:\n   - cos(ABC) = (Dot product of AB and BC) / (Magnitude of AB * Magnitude of BC)\n\n5. **Calculate the angle ABC in degrees**:\n   - Angle ABC = arccos(cos(ABC)) in degrees\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the measure of angle ABC.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of points A, B, and C\nA = (-5, -8)\nB = (-3, 4)\nC = (-1, 1)\n\n# Vectors AB and BC\nAB = (B[0] - A[0], B[1] - A[1])\nBC = (C[0] - B[0], C[1] - B[1])\n\n# Dot product of AB and BC\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Magnitudes of AB and BC\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Cosine of angle ABC\ncos_ABC = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Angle ABC in degrees\nangle_ABC = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_ABC))\n\n# Round the angle to 3 decimal places\nangle_ABC_rounded = round(angle_ABC, 3)\n\nprint(angle_ABC_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the measure of angle ABC in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with the given coordinates. The angle is rounded to three decimal places as required.\n\nThe measure of angle ABC is:\n\n<<<136.848°>>>"
