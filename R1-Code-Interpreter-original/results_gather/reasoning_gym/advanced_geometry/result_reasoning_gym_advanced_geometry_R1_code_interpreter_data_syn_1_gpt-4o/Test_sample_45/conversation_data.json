    "To find the incircle radius of triangle ABC, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the side lengths of the triangle**: Use the distance formula to find the lengths of sides AB, BC, and CA.\n\n2. **Calculate the semi-perimeter (s) of the triangle**: The semi-perimeter is half the sum of the side lengths.\n\n3. **Calculate the area (A) of the triangle**: Use Heron's formula, which requires the semi-perimeter and the side lengths.\n\n4. **Calculate the incircle radius (r)**: The formula for the radius of the incircle is \\( r = \\frac{A}{s} \\).\n\nLet's start by calculating the side lengths using the distance formula:\n\n- \\( AB = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\)\n- \\( BC = \\sqrt{(x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2} \\)\n- \\( CA = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_3)^2 + (y_1 - y_3)^2} \\)\n\nGiven the coordinates:\n- A = (0, -4)\n- B = (-3, -4)\n- C = (-7, -1)\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (0, -4)\nB = (-3, -4)\nC = (-7, -1)\n\n# Calculate the side lengths\nAB = math.sqrt((B[0] - A[0])**2 + (B[1] - A[1])**2)\nBC = math.sqrt((C[0] - B[0])**2 + (C[1] - B[1])**2)\nCA = math.sqrt((A[0] - C[0])**2 + (A[1] - C[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate the area using Heron's formula\narea = math.sqrt(s * (s - AB) * (s - BC) * (s - CA))\n\n# Calculate the incircle radius\nr = area / s\n\n# Print the incircle radius rounded to 3 decimal places\nprint(round(r, 3))\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the incircle radius of the triangle.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the incircle radius of triangle ABC. The radius is approximately 0.576 when rounded to three decimal places.\n\n<<<0.576>>>"
