    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-2, 8), B=(-9, 6), and C=(-2, 10), we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the lengths of the sides of the triangle:\n\n1. **AB**: The distance between points A and B.\n2. **BC**: The distance between points B and C.\n3. **AC**: The distance between points A and C.\n\nThe formula for the distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\nOnce we have the lengths of the sides, we can use the law of cosines to find the angle at B:\n\n\\[ \\cos(B) = \\frac{AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2}{2 \\times AB \\times BC} \\]\n\nFinally, we can use the inverse cosine function to find the angle in degrees.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nA = (-2, 8)\nB = (-9, 6)\nC = (-2, 10)\n\n# Function to calculate distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nAC = distance(A, C)\n\n# Calculate the angle at B using the law of cosines\ncos_B = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\nangle_B_rad = math.acos(cos_B)\n\n# Convert the angle from radians to degrees\nangle_B_deg = math.degrees(angle_B_rad)\n\n# Round the result to 3 decimal places\nangle_B_deg_rounded = round(angle_B_deg, 3)\n\nprint(angle_B_deg_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the angle at vertex B in degrees, rounded to three decimal places. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the angle at vertex B in the triangle is calculated to be approximately 13.799 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<13.799°>>>"
