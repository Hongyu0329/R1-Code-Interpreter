    "To find the incircle radius (also known as the inradius) of a triangle, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{A}{s} \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the inradius, \\( A \\) is the area of the triangle, and \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the side lengths of the triangle using the distance formula:\n\n\\[ AB = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the semi-perimeter \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the area \\( A \\) of the triangle using Heron's formula:\n\n\\[ A = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)} \\]\n\nFinally, we can find the inradius \\( r \\).\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (0, -3)\nB = (-5, 2)\nC = (8, -1)\n\n# Calculate the side lengths\nAB = math.sqrt((B[0] - A[0])**2 + (B[1] - A[1])**2)\nBC = math.sqrt((C[0] - B[0])**2 + (C[1] - B[1])**2)\nCA = math.sqrt((A[0] - C[0])**2 + (A[1] - C[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate the area using Heron's formula\narea = math.sqrt(s * (s - AB) * (s - BC) * (s - CA))\n\n# Calculate the inradius\ninradius = area / s\n\n# Round the inradius to 3 decimal places\ninradius_rounded = round(inradius, 3)\n\nprint(inradius_rounded)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the inradius.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the inradius of the triangle with vertices A=(0, -3), B=(-5, 2), and C=(8, -1) is calculated to be approximately 1.745.\n\n<<<1.745>>>"
