    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- \\( A = (9, 8) \\)\n- \\( B = (8, -7) \\)\n- \\( C = (-10, -10) \\)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n1. Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes (which are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides).\n3. Write the equations of the altitudes.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\n### Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides\n- Slope of \\( BC \\): \\(\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{-10 + 7}{-10 - 8} = \\frac{-3}{-18} = \\frac{1}{6}\\)\n- Slope of \\( AC \\): \\(\\frac{-10 - 8}{-10 - 9} = \\frac{-18}{-19} = \\frac{18}{19}\\)\n- Slope of \\( AB \\): \\(\\frac{-7 - 8}{8 - 9} = \\frac{-15}{-1} = 15\\)\n\n### Step 2: Determine the slopes of the altitudes\n- Altitude from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\): Slope = \\(-6\\) (negative reciprocal of \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\))\n- Altitude from \\( B \\) to \\( AC \\): Slope = \\(-\\frac{19}{18}\\) (negative reciprocal of \\(\\frac{18}{19}\\))\n- Altitude from \\( C \\) to \\( AB \\): Slope = \\(-\\frac{1}{15}\\) (negative reciprocal of \\(15\\))\n\n### Step 3: Write the equations of the altitudes\n- Equation of altitude from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\): \\( y - 8 = -6(x - 9) \\)\n- Equation of altitude from \\( B \\) to \\( AC \\): \\( y + 7 = -\\frac{19}{18}(x - 8) \\)\n\n### Step 4: Solve the system of equations\nWe will solve the equations of the altitudes from \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of altitude from A to BC\neq1 = Eq(y - 8, -6 * (x - 9))\n\n# Equation of altitude from B to AC\neq2 = Eq(y + 7, -19/18 * (x - 8))\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter = (round(solution[x], 3), round(solution[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the orthocenter.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the coordinates of the orthocenter of the triangle. The orthocenter is the point where the altitudes of the triangle intersect.\n\nThe orthocenter of the triangle with vertices \\( A = (9, 8) \\), \\( B = (8, -7) \\), and \\( C = (-10, -10) \\) is:\n\n<<<(12.247, -11.483)>>>"
