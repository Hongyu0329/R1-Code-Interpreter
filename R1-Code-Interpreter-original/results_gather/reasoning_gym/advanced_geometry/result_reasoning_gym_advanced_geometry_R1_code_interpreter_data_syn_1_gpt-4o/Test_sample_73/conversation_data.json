    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A, B, and C, we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. For a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and angle \\(\\theta\\) opposite side \\(c\\), the law of cosines states:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(\\theta) \\]\n\nIn this problem, we need to find the angle at B, which is \\(\\angle ABC\\). We will first calculate the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC using the distance formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\n1. Calculate the length of AB.\n2. Calculate the length of BC.\n3. Calculate the length of AC.\n4. Use the law of cosines to find \\(\\angle ABC\\).\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nA = (1, 8)\nB = (-7, -10)\nC = (-1, 6)\n\n# Function to calculate distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nAC = distance(A, C)\n\n# Use the law of cosines to find angle ABC\ncos_ABC = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\nangle_ABC_rad = math.acos(cos_ABC)\nangle_ABC_deg = math.degrees(angle_ABC_rad)\n\n# Round the angle to 3 decimal places\nangle_ABC_deg_rounded = round(angle_ABC_deg, 3)\n\nprint(angle_ABC_deg_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the angle at B in degrees, rounded to three decimal places. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the angle at vertex B in the triangle is calculated to be approximately 3.406 degrees. \n\n<<<3.406°>>>"
