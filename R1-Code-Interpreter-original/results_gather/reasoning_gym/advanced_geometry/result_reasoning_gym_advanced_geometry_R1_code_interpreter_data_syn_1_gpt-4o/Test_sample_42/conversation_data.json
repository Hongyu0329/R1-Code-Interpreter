    "To find the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with given coordinates, we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The angle between two vectors \\(\\vec{u}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\) can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{\\|\\vec{u}\\| \\|\\vec{v}\\|}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}\\) is the dot product of vectors \\(\\vec{u}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\).\n- \\(\\|\\vec{u}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\) are the magnitudes of vectors \\(\\vec{u}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\).\n\nFor angle ABC, we need vectors \\(\\vec{BA}\\) and \\(\\vec{BC}\\):\n- \\(\\vec{BA} = A - B = (6 - 0, -7 - (-7)) = (6, 0)\\)\n- \\(\\vec{BC} = C - B = (-1 - 0, -5 - (-7)) = (-1, 2)\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the dot product and magnitudes:\n\n1. Dot product \\(\\vec{BA} \\cdot \\vec{BC} = 6 \\times (-1) + 0 \\times 2 = -6\\)\n2. Magnitude of \\(\\vec{BA} = \\sqrt{6^2 + 0^2} = 6\\)\n3. Magnitude of \\(\\vec{BC} = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5}\\)\n\nNow, we can find \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\) and then \\(\\theta\\) in degrees.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Vectors\nBA = (6, 0)\nBC = (-1, 2)\n\n# Dot product\ndot_product = BA[0] * BC[0] + BA[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Magnitudes\nmagnitude_BA = math.sqrt(BA[0]**2 + BA[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Cosine of the angle\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_BA * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Angle in radians\ntheta_radians = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert to degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(theta_radians)\n\n# Round to 3 decimal places\ntheta_degrees_rounded = round(theta_degrees, 3)\n\nprint(theta_degrees_rounded)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the measure of angle ABC.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC is approximately 116.565 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<116.565°>>>"
