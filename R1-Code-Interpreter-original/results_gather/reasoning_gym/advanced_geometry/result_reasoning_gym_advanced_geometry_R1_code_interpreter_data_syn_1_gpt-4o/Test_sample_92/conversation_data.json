    "To find the incircle radius of a triangle given its vertices, we can use the formula for the radius \\( r \\) of the incircle:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{A}{s} \\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) is the area of the triangle and \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the side lengths of the triangle using the distance formula:\n\n1. \\( AB = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\)\n2. \\( BC = \\sqrt{(x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2} \\)\n3. \\( CA = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_3)^2 + (y_1 - y_3)^2} \\)\n\nNext, we calculate the semi-perimeter \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the area \\( A \\) of the triangle using the formula:\n\n\\[ A = \\sqrt{s \\cdot (s - AB) \\cdot (s - BC) \\cdot (s - CA)} \\]\n\nFinally, we can find the radius \\( r \\) using the formula for the incircle radius.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (7, -10)\nB = (-5, -9)\nC = (3, -2)\n\n# Calculate the side lengths\nAB = math.sqrt((B[0] - A[0])**2 + (B[1] - A[1])**2)\nBC = math.sqrt((C[0] - B[0])**2 + (C[1] - B[1])**2)\nCA = math.sqrt((A[0] - C[0])**2 + (A[1] - C[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate the area using Heron's formula\narea = math.sqrt(s * (s - AB) * (s - BC) * (s - CA))\n\n# Calculate the incircle radius\nr = area / s\n\n# Print the incircle radius rounded to 3 decimal places\nprint(round(r, 3))\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the incircle radius of the triangle.",
