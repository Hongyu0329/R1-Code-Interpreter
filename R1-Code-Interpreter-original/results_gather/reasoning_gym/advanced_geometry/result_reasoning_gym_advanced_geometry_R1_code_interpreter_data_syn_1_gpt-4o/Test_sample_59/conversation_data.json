    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- \\( A = (8, -5) \\)\n- \\( B = (-5, 2) \\)\n- \\( C = (4, 4) \\)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle:**\n   - Slope of \\( BC \\)\n   - Slope of \\( AC \\)\n   - Slope of \\( AB \\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from \\( A \\) is perpendicular to \\( BC \\).\n   - The altitude from \\( B \\) is perpendicular to \\( AC \\).\n   - The altitude from \\( C \\) is perpendicular to \\( AB \\).\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation.\n\n4. **Find the intersection of two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate these using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the points\nA = (8, -5)\nB = (-5, 2)\nC = (4, 4)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    if p1[0] == p2[0]:  # vertical line\n        return None\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (perpendicular slopes)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC if slope_BC is not None else None\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC if slope_AC is not None else None\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB if slope_AB is not None else None\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A (using point-slope form)\n# y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n# y = mx - mx1 + y1\n# y = mx + c\nif slope_altitude_A is not None:\n    c_A = A[1] - slope_altitude_A * A[0]\nelse:\n    c_A = A[0]  # x = constant line\n\n# Equation of the altitude from B\nif slope_altitude_B is not None:\n    c_B = B[1] - slope_altitude_B * B[0]\nelse:\n    c_B = B[0]  # x = constant line\n\n# Solve the system of equations to find the intersection of altitudes from A and B\n# y = slope_altitude_A * x + c_A\n# y = slope_altitude_B * x + c_B\n\nif slope_altitude_A is not None and slope_altitude_B is not None:\n    # Set the equations equal to each other to find x\n    x = (c_B - c_A) / (slope_altitude_A - slope_altitude_B)\n    y = slope_altitude_A * x + c_A\nelif slope_altitude_A is None:\n    x = c_A\n    y = slope_altitude_B * x + c_B\nelif slope_altitude_B is None:\n    x = c_B\n    y = slope_altitude_A * x + c_A\n\n# Round the results to 3 decimal places\northocenter = (round(x, 3), round(y, 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of the altitudes from vertices A and B. Let's execute the code to find the orthocenter.",
    "The code execution has provided the orthocenter coordinates as (5.416, 6.629). This is the intersection point of the altitudes from vertices A and B of the triangle. \n\nThe process involved calculating the slopes of the sides of the triangle, determining the perpendicular slopes for the altitudes, and then solving the system of equations to find the intersection point.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to three decimal places, is:\n\n<<<(5.416, 6.629)>>>"
