    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A, B, and C, we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. \n\nThe formula for the law of cosines is:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(C) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n- \\( C \\) is the angle opposite side \\( c \\).\n\nIn this case, we want to find the angle at B, so we will use the vertices A, B, and C to find the lengths of the sides:\n\n1. Calculate the length of side AC (opposite angle B):\n   \\[ AC = \\sqrt{(x_C - x_A)^2 + (y_C - y_A)^2} \\]\n\n2. Calculate the length of side AB:\n   \\[ AB = \\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} \\]\n\n3. Calculate the length of side BC:\n   \\[ BC = \\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2} \\]\n\nOnce we have the lengths of the sides, we can use the law of cosines to find the angle at B:\n\n\\[ \\cos(B) = \\frac{AC^2 + AB^2 - BC^2}{2 \\cdot AC \\cdot AB} \\]\n\nFinally, we can find the angle B in degrees using the arccosine function and convert it to degrees.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (4, -4)\nB = (-8, 9)\nC = (-7, 10)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAC = math.sqrt((C[0] - A[0])**2 + (C[1] - A[1])**2)\nAB = math.sqrt((B[0] - A[0])**2 + (B[1] - A[1])**2)\nBC = math.sqrt((C[0] - B[0])**2 + (C[1] - B[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the cosine of angle B using the law of cosines\ncos_B = (AC**2 + AB**2 - BC**2) / (2 * AC * AB)\n\n# Calculate the angle in degrees\nangle_B = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_B))\n\n# Round the result to 3 decimal places\nangle_B_rounded = round(angle_B, 3)\n\nprint(angle_B_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the angle at vertex B in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the angle at vertex B is approximately 4.552째. \n\nLet's ensure that the calculation is correct by reviewing the steps:\n\n1. We calculated the lengths of the sides AC, AB, and BC using the distance formula.\n2. We applied the law of cosines to find the cosine of angle B.\n3. We used the arccosine function to find the angle in degrees and rounded it to three decimal places.\n\nThe result seems reasonable given the coordinates of the triangle's vertices.\n\n<<<4.552째>>>"
