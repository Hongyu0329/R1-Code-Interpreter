    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(4, 6), B=(-7, 9), and C=(8, -3), we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. \n\nThe formula for the law of cosines is:\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(C) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n- \\( C \\) is the angle opposite side \\( c \\).\n\nIn this case, we want to find the angle at B, so we will use the sides opposite to the vertices A, B, and C.\n\n1. Calculate the lengths of the sides:\n   - \\( AB \\) is the distance between points A and B.\n   - \\( BC \\) is the distance between points B and C.\n   - \\( AC \\) is the distance between points A and C.\n\n2. Use the law of cosines to find the angle at B.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nA = (4, 6)\nB = (-7, 9)\nC = (8, -3)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nAC = distance(A, C)\n\n# Use the law of cosines to find the angle at B\n# cos(B) = (AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2) / (2 * AB * BC)\ncos_B = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\n\n# Calculate the angle in radians and then convert to degrees\nangle_B_rad = math.acos(cos_B)\nangle_B_deg = math.degrees(angle_B_rad)\n\n# Round the angle to 3 decimal places\nangle_B_deg_rounded = round(angle_B_deg, 3)\n\nprint(angle_B_deg_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the angle at vertex B in degrees, rounded to three decimal places. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the angle at vertex B in the triangle is calculated to be approximately 23.405 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<23.405°>>>"
