    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(9, -8), B=(9, 10), and C=(6, -9), we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The angle θ between two vectors \\(\\vec{u}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\) can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{|\\vec{u}| |\\vec{v}|}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\vec{u} = \\overrightarrow{BA} = A - B = (9 - 9, -8 - 10) = (0, -18)\\)\n- \\(\\vec{v} = \\overrightarrow{BC} = C - B = (6 - 9, -9 - 10) = (-3, -19)\\)\n\nThe dot product \\(\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}\\) is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v} = (0)(-3) + (-18)(-19)\n\\]\n\nThe magnitudes of the vectors are:\n\n\\[\n|\\vec{u}| = \\sqrt{(0)^2 + (-18)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n|\\vec{v}| = \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-19)^2}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we can find the angle θ using the inverse cosine function and convert it to degrees.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the vectors\nu = (0, -18)\nv = (-3, -19)\n\n# Calculate the dot product\ndot_product = u[0] * v[0] + u[1] * v[1]\n\n# Calculate the magnitudes of the vectors\nmagnitude_u = math.sqrt(u[0]**2 + u[1]**2)\nmagnitude_v = math.sqrt(v[0]**2 + v[1]**2)\n\n# Calculate the cosine of the angle\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_u * magnitude_v)\n\n# Calculate the angle in radians\ntheta_radians = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert the angle to degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(theta_radians)\n\n# Round the result to 3 decimal places\ntheta_degrees_rounded = round(theta_degrees, 3)\n\nprint(theta_degrees_rounded)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the angle at B.",
    "The code execution has provided the angle at vertex B as 8.973 degrees. This is the angle between the vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{BA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{BC}\\) in the triangle.\n\n<<<8.973°>>>"
