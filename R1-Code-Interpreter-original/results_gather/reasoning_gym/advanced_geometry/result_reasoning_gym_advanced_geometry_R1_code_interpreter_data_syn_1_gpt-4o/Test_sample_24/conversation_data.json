    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-10, 5), B=(10, 6), and C=(-1, 7), we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines states that for any triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and opposite angles \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) respectively, the following equation holds:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(C) \\]\n\nIn this case, we want to find the angle at B, so we will use the coordinates to find the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC, and then apply the law of cosines.\n\n1. Calculate the lengths of the sides:\n   - \\( AB = \\sqrt{(10 - (-10))^2 + (6 - 5)^2} \\)\n   - \\( BC = \\sqrt{(10 - (-1))^2 + (6 - 7)^2} \\)\n   - \\( AC = \\sqrt{(-1 - (-10))^2 + (7 - 5)^2} \\)\n\n2. Use the law of cosines to find angle \\( \\angle ABC \\):\n   - \\( \\cos(\\angle ABC) = \\frac{AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2}{2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BC} \\)\n   - \\( \\angle ABC = \\cos^{-1}(\\cos(\\angle ABC)) \\)\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nA = (-10, 5)\nB = (10, 6)\nC = (-1, 7)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = math.sqrt((B[0] - A[0])**2 + (B[1] - A[1])**2)\nBC = math.sqrt((C[0] - B[0])**2 + (C[1] - B[1])**2)\nAC = math.sqrt((C[0] - A[0])**2 + (C[1] - A[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the cosine of angle ABC using the law of cosines\ncos_ABC = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\n\n# Calculate the angle in degrees\nangle_ABC = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_ABC))\n\n# Round the angle to 3 decimal places\nangle_ABC_rounded = round(angle_ABC, 3)\n\nprint(angle_ABC_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the angle at vertex B in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the angle at vertex B in the triangle is calculated to be approximately 8.057 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8.057°>>>"
