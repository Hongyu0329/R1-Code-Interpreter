    "To find the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with given coordinates, we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The angle between two vectors \\(\\vec{u}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\) can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{\\|\\vec{u}\\| \\|\\vec{v}\\|}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}\\) is the dot product of vectors \\(\\vec{u}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\).\n- \\(\\|\\vec{u}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\) are the magnitudes of vectors \\(\\vec{u}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\).\n\nIn this problem:\n- Vector \\(\\vec{AB} = B - A = (7 - 0, 7 - (-6)) = (7, 13)\\)\n- Vector \\(\\vec{BC} = C - B = (-1 - 7, 6 - 7) = (-8, -1)\\)\n\nThe dot product \\(\\vec{AB} \\cdot \\vec{BC}\\) is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\vec{AB} \\cdot \\vec{BC} = (7)(-8) + (13)(-1)\n\\]\n\nThe magnitudes of \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{BC}\\) are:\n\\[\n\\|\\vec{AB}\\| = \\sqrt{7^2 + 13^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\|\\vec{BC}\\| = \\sqrt{(-8)^2 + (-1)^2}\n\\]\n\nWe can then find \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\) and use the inverse cosine function to find the angle \\(\\theta\\) in degrees.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates\nA = (0, -6)\nB = (7, 7)\nC = (-1, 6)\n\n# Vectors\nAB = (B[0] - A[0], B[1] - A[1])\nBC = (C[0] - B[0], C[1] - B[1])\n\n# Dot product\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Magnitudes\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Cosine of the angle\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Angle in degrees\nangle_ABC = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_theta))\n\n# Round to 3 decimal places\nangle_ABC = round(angle_ABC, 3)\n\nprint(angle_ABC)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the measure of angle ABC.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC is calculated to be approximately 125.426 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<125.426°>>>"
