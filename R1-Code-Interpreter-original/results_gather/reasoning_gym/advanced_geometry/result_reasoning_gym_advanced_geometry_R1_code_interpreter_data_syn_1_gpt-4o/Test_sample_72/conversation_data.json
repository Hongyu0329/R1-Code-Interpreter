    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- \\( A = (-10, -5) \\)\n- \\( B = (-7, -6) \\)\n- \\( C = (-7, -8) \\)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n1. Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes (perpendicular to the sides).\n3. Use the point-slope form to find the equations of the altitudes.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\n### Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides\n- Slope of \\( BC \\): \\(\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{-8 - (-6)}{-7 - (-7)} = \\frac{-2}{0}\\) (vertical line, slope is undefined)\n- Slope of \\( AC \\): \\(\\frac{-8 - (-5)}{-7 - (-10)} = \\frac{-3}{3} = -1\\)\n- Slope of \\( AB \\): \\(\\frac{-6 - (-5)}{-7 - (-10)} = \\frac{-1}{3}\\)\n\n### Step 2: Determine the slopes of the altitudes\n- Altitude from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\) is horizontal (since \\( BC \\) is vertical), so its slope is 0.\n- Altitude from \\( B \\) to \\( AC \\) is perpendicular to \\( AC \\), so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(-1\\), which is 1.\n- Altitude from \\( C \\) to \\( AB \\) is perpendicular to \\( AB \\), so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\), which is 3.\n\n### Step 3: Find the equations of the altitudes\n- Altitude from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\): \\( y = -5 \\)\n- Altitude from \\( B \\) to \\( AC \\): Using point-slope form \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\), we have \\( y + 6 = 1(x + 7) \\)\n- Altitude from \\( C \\) to \\( AB \\): Using point-slope form, we have \\( y + 8 = 3(x + 7) \\)\n\n### Step 4: Solve the system of equations\nWe will solve the equations of the altitudes to find their intersection point.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equations of the altitudes\neq1 = Eq(y, -5)  # Altitude from A to BC\neq2 = Eq(y + 6, x + 7)  # Altitude from B to AC\neq3 = Eq(y + 8, 3 * (x + 7))  # Altitude from C to AB\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the orthocenter.",
    "The code output indicates that the orthocenter of the triangle is at the coordinates \\((-6, -5)\\). This result is derived from solving the system of equations representing the altitudes of the triangle.\n\nThe process involved:\n- Setting up the equations for the altitudes based on the slopes and given points.\n- Solving the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nThe orthocenter is the point where all three altitudes intersect, and in this case, it is at \\((-6, -5)\\).\n\n<<<(-6, -5)>>>"
