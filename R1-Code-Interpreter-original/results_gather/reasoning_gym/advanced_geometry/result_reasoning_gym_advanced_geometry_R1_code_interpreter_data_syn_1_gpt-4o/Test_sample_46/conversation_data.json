    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. The altitudes are the perpendicular lines from each vertex to the opposite side.\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle:**\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_3 - y_2) / (x_3 - x_2)\\)\n   - Slope of CA: \\((y_1 - y_3) / (x_1 - x_3)\\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of CA.\n   - The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation: \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is a point on the line.\n\n4. **Find the intersection of two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by any two altitude equations to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate these steps using Python:\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-7, -1)\nB = (-2, 3)\nC = (-9, 10)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_CA = slope(C, A)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_CA\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\n# Altitude from A: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n# Altitude from B: y - y2 = m(x - x2)\n\n# Altitude from A\nintercept_A = A[1] - slope_altitude_A * A[0]\n\n# Altitude from B\nintercept_B = B[1] - slope_altitude_B * B[0]\n\n# Solve the system of equations to find the intersection (orthocenter)\n# y = slope_altitude_A * x + intercept_A\n# y = slope_altitude_B * x + intercept_B\n\n# Set the equations equal to each other to solve for x\nx_orthocenter = (intercept_B - intercept_A) / (slope_altitude_A - slope_altitude_B)\ny_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + intercept_A\n\n# Round the coordinates to 3 decimal places\nx_orthocenter = round(x_orthocenter, 3)\ny_orthocenter = round(y_orthocenter, 3)\n\nprint((x_orthocenter, y_orthocenter))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the orthocenter of triangle ABC.",
    "The code execution has provided the coordinates of the orthocenter of triangle ABC. The orthocenter is the point where the altitudes of the triangle intersect.\n\nThe coordinates of the orthocenter are:\n\n<<<(-3.222, 2.778)>>>"
