    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-3, -4), B=(10, 8), and C=(4, -8), we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. \n\nThe formula for the law of cosines is:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(C) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n- \\( C \\) is the angle opposite side \\( c \\).\n\nIn this case, we want to find the angle at B, so we will use the sides opposite to the vertices A, B, and C:\n\n1. Calculate the lengths of the sides:\n   - \\( AB \\) is the distance between points A and B.\n   - \\( BC \\) is the distance between points B and C.\n   - \\( AC \\) is the distance between points A and C.\n\n2. Use the law of cosines to find the angle at B.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nA = (-3, -4)\nB = (10, 8)\nC = (4, -8)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nAC = distance(A, C)\n\n# Use the law of cosines to find the angle at B\n# cos(B) = (AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2) / (2 * AB * BC)\ncos_B = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\n\n# Calculate the angle in radians and then convert to degrees\nangle_B_rad = math.acos(cos_B)\nangle_B_deg = math.degrees(angle_B_rad)\n\n# Round the angle to 3 decimal places\nangle_B_deg_rounded = round(angle_B_deg, 3)\n\nprint(angle_B_deg_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the angle at vertex B in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the angle at vertex B. The angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-3, -4), B=(10, 8), and C=(4, -8) is approximately 26.735째.\n\n<<<26.735째>>>"
