    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or the line containing the opposite side).\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (4, 1)\n- B = (9, -5)\n- C = (-3, -3)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle:**\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_C - y_B) / (x_C - x_B)\\)\n   - Slope of AC: \\((y_C - y_A) / (x_C - x_A)\\)\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_B - y_A) / (x_B - x_A)\\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC.\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\) for each altitude.\n\n4. **Find the intersection of any two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by the equations of two altitudes to find their intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate these using Python:\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (4, 1)\nB = (9, -5)\nC = (-3, -3)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\n# Altitude from A: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n# Altitude from B: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n# Altitude from C: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\n# Altitude from A\nintercept_A = A[1] - slope_altitude_A * A[0]\n\n# Altitude from B\nintercept_B = B[1] - slope_altitude_B * B[0]\n\n# Solve for intersection of altitudes from A and B\n# y = slope_altitude_A * x + intercept_A\n# y = slope_altitude_B * x + intercept_B\n\n# Set the equations equal to each other to find x\nx_orthocenter = (intercept_B - intercept_A) / (slope_altitude_A - slope_altitude_B)\ny_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + intercept_A\n\n# Round the results to 3 decimal places\nx_orthocenter = round(x_orthocenter, 3)\ny_orthocenter = round(y_orthocenter, 3)\n\nprint((x_orthocenter, y_orthocenter))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of the altitudes from vertices A and B. Let's execute the code to find the orthocenter.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A, B, and C. The orthocenter is the point where the altitudes intersect.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to three decimal places, is:\n\n<<<(4.355, 3.129)>>>"
