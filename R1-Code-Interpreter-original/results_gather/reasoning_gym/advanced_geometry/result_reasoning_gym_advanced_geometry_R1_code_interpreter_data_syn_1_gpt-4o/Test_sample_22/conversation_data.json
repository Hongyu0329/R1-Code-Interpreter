    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or the line containing the opposite side).\n\nGiven the vertices of triangle ABC:\n- A = (4, 7)\n- B = (-1, 5)\n- C = (5, 2)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes (which are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides).\n3. Find the equations of the altitudes.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's start by calculating the slopes of the sides of the triangle:\n\n- Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\nThen, we find the slopes of the altitudes:\n- Altitude from A is perpendicular to BC.\n- Altitude from B is perpendicular to AC.\n- Altitude from C is perpendicular to AB.\n\nFinally, we solve the system of equations formed by the altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (4, 7)\nB = (-1, 5)\nC = (5, 2)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equations of the altitudes\n# y - y1 = m(x - x1) => y = mx + c\n# Altitude from A\nc_A = A[1] - slope_altitude_A * A[0]\n# Altitude from B\nc_B = B[1] - slope_altitude_B * B[0]\n\n# Solve the system of equations to find the intersection (orthocenter)\n# y = slope_altitude_A * x + c_A\n# y = slope_altitude_B * x + c_B\n\n# Set the equations equal to each other to find x\nx_orthocenter = (c_B - c_A) / (slope_altitude_A - slope_altitude_B)\n# Substitute x back into one of the equations to find y\ny_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + c_A\n\n# Round the coordinates to 3 decimal places\nx_orthocenter = round(x_orthocenter, 3)\ny_orthocenter = round(y_orthocenter, 3)\n\nprint((x_orthocenter, y_orthocenter))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the orthocenter of the triangle.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the coordinates of the orthocenter of triangle ABC. The orthocenter is the point where the altitudes of the triangle intersect.\n\nThe coordinates of the orthocenter, rounded to three decimal places, are:\n\n<<<(3.444, 5.889)>>>"
