    "To find the incircle radius (also known as the inradius) of a triangle, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{A}{s} \\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) is the area of the triangle and \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the side lengths of the triangle using the distance formula:\n\n\\[ AB = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the semi-perimeter \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the area \\( A \\) using Heron's formula:\n\n\\[ A = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)} \\]\n\nFinally, we can find the inradius \\( r \\).\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-5, 7)\nB = (7, 3)\nC = (-7, -8)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the side lengths\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nCA = distance(C, A)\n\n# Calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate the area using Heron's formula\narea = math.sqrt(s * (s - AB) * (s - BC) * (s - CA))\n\n# Calculate the inradius\ninradius = area / s\n\n# Print the inradius rounded to 3 decimal places\nprint(round(inradius, 3))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the inradius.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the inradius of the triangle with vertices A=(-5, 7), B=(7, 3), and C=(-7, -8) is calculated to be approximately 4.124. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4.124>>>"
