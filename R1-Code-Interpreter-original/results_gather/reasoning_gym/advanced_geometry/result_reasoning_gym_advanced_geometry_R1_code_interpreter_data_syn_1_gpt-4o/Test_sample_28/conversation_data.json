    "To find the incircle radius of triangle ABC, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the side lengths of the triangle**: Use the distance formula to find the lengths of sides AB, BC, and CA.\n\n2. **Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle**: The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) is half the sum of the side lengths.\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the triangle**: Use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle.\n\n4. **Calculate the incircle radius**: The radius \\( r \\) of the incircle is given by the formula \\( r = \\frac{A}{s} \\), where \\( A \\) is the area of the triangle and \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter.\n\nLet's perform these calculations step by step using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-1, 8)\nB = (-6, -2)\nC = (-3, 5)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the side lengths\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nCA = distance(C, A)\n\n# Calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate the area using Heron's formula\narea = math.sqrt(s * (s - AB) * (s - BC) * (s - CA))\n\n# Calculate the incircle radius\nincircle_radius = area / s\n\n# Print the incircle radius rounded to 3 decimal places\nprint(round(incircle_radius, 3))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the incircle radius of the triangle with the given vertices. Let's execute it to find the result.",
