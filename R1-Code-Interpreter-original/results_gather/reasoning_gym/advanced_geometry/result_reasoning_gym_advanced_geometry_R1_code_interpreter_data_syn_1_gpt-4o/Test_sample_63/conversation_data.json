    "To find the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with given coordinates, we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The angle between two vectors can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\| \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) are vectors.\n- \\(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\) is the dot product of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\n- \\(\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|\\) are the magnitudes of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), respectively.\n\nFor angle ABC, we need vectors \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{BC}\\):\n- \\(\\mathbf{AB} = B - A = (-6 - 6, 5 - 7) = (-12, -2)\\)\n- \\(\\mathbf{BC} = C - B = (-10 + 6, -6 - 5) = (-4, -11)\\)\n\nNow, we calculate the dot product and magnitudes:\n- \\(\\mathbf{AB} \\cdot \\mathbf{BC} = (-12)(-4) + (-2)(-11)\\)\n- \\(\\|\\mathbf{AB}\\| = \\sqrt{(-12)^2 + (-2)^2}\\)\n- \\(\\|\\mathbf{BC}\\| = \\sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-11)^2}\\)\n\nFinally, we find \\(\\theta\\) using the inverse cosine function and convert it to degrees.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates\nA = (6, 7)\nB = (-6, 5)\nC = (-10, -6)\n\n# Vectors\nAB = (B[0] - A[0], B[1] - A[1])\nBC = (C[0] - B[0], C[1] - B[1])\n\n# Dot product\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Magnitudes\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Cosine of angle\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Angle in radians\ntheta_radians = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert to degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(theta_radians)\n\n# Round to 3 decimal places\ntheta_degrees_rounded = round(theta_degrees, 3)\n\nprint(theta_degrees_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the measure of angle ABC in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
