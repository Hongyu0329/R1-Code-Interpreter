    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-4, 9), B=(-1, -8), and C=(1, -3), we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC using the distance formula:\n\n1. Distance AB = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)\n2. Distance BC = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)\n3. Distance AC = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)\n\nThen, we can apply the law of cosines to find the angle at B:\n\ncos(∠ABC) = (AB² + BC² - AC²) / (2 * AB * BC)\n\nFinally, we use the arccos function to find the angle in radians and convert it to degrees.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nA = (-4, 9)\nB = (-1, -8)\nC = (1, -3)\n\n# Function to calculate distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nAC = distance(A, C)\n\n# Calculate the angle at B using the law of cosines\ncos_angle_B = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\nangle_B_rad = math.acos(cos_angle_B)\n\n# Convert the angle from radians to degrees\nangle_B_deg = math.degrees(angle_B_rad)\n\n# Round the result to 3 decimal places\nangle_B_deg_rounded = round(angle_B_deg, 3)\n\nprint(angle_B_deg_rounded)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the angle at B.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the angle at vertex B in the triangle is approximately 31.809 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<31.809°>>>"
