    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or the line containing the opposite side).\n\nGiven the vertices of triangle ABC:\n- A = (4, 4)\n- B = (-5, 2)\n- C = (1, 3)\n\nWe will find the equations of two altitudes and then find their intersection point.\n\n1. **Find the slope of side BC**:\n   - The slope of BC is given by \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\).\n\n2. **Find the slope of the altitude from A**:\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n\n3. **Find the equation of the altitude from A**:\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation with point A and the slope from step 2.\n\n4. **Find the slope of side AC**:\n   - Similarly, calculate the slope of AC.\n\n5. **Find the slope of the altitude from B**:\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC.\n\n6. **Find the equation of the altitude from B**:\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation with point B and the slope from step 5.\n\n7. **Find the intersection of the two altitudes**:\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by the two altitude equations to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (4, 4)\nB = (-5, 2)\nC = (1, 3)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slope of BC\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\n\n# Slope of altitude from A (perpendicular to BC)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\n\n# Equation of altitude from A: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n# y - 4 = slope_altitude_A * (x - 4)\n# y = slope_altitude_A * x - slope_altitude_A * 4 + 4\n\n# Slope of AC\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\n\n# Slope of altitude from B (perpendicular to AC)\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\n\n# Equation of altitude from B: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n# y - 2 = slope_altitude_B * (x + 5)\n# y = slope_altitude_B * x + slope_altitude_B * 5 + 2\n\n# Solve the system of equations to find the intersection\n# y = slope_altitude_A * x - slope_altitude_A * 4 + 4\n# y = slope_altitude_B * x + slope_altitude_B * 5 + 2\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\neq1 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_A * x - slope_altitude_A * 4 + 4)\neq2 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_B * x + slope_altitude_B * 5 + 2)\n\n# Solve for x and y\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of the altitudes from vertices A and B. Let's execute the code to find the orthocenter.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the coordinates of the orthocenter. The coordinates are already rounded to three decimal places as required.\n\nThe orthocenter of triangle ABC with vertices A=(4, 4), B=(-5, 2), and C=(1, 3) is:\n\n<<<(13.667, -54.000)>>>"
