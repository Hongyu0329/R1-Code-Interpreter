    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (5 - (-2)) / (-10 - 10) = 7 / -20 = -0.35\\)\n   - Slope of BC: \\((1 - 5) / (7 - (-10)) = -4 / 17\\)\n   - Slope of CA: \\((1 - (-2)) / (7 - 10) = 3 / -3 = -1\\)\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB: \\(1 / 0.35 = 20/7\\).\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC: \\(17/4\\).\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to CA, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of CA: \\(1\\).\n\n3. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - **Altitude from C:** Passes through C(7, 1) with slope \\(20/7\\).\n     - Equation: \\(y - 1 = \\frac{20}{7}(x - 7)\\)\n     - Simplifying: \\(y = \\frac{20}{7}x - \\frac{140}{7} + 1\\)\n     - \\(y = \\frac{20}{7}x - 20 + 1\\)\n     - \\(y = \\frac{20}{7}x - 19\\)\n\n   - **Altitude from A:** Passes through A(10, -2) with slope \\(17/4\\).\n     - Equation: \\(y + 2 = \\frac{17}{4}(x - 10)\\)\n     - Simplifying: \\(y = \\frac{17}{4}x - \\frac{170}{4} - 2\\)\n     - \\(y = \\frac{17}{4}x - 42.5 - 2\\)\n     - \\(y = \\frac{17}{4}x - 44.5\\)\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Set the equations of the altitudes from C and A equal to find their intersection:\n     - \\(\\frac{20}{7}x - 19 = \\frac{17}{4}x - 44.5\\)\n     - Clear fractions by multiplying through by 28 (LCM of 7 and 4):\n       - \\(80x - 532 = 119x - 1246\\)\n     - Solve for x:\n       - \\(80x - 119x = -1246 + 532\\)\n       - \\(-39x = -714\\)\n       - \\(x = \\frac{714}{39} = 18.3077\\)\n\n   - Substitute \\(x = 18.3077\\) into one of the altitude equations to find y:\n     - Using \\(y = \\frac{20}{7}x - 19\\):\n     - \\(y = \\frac{20}{7} \\times 18.3077 - 19\\)\n     - \\(y = 52.3077 - 19\\)\n     - \\(y = 33.3077\\)\n\n5. **Round the Coordinates:**\n   - The orthocenter coordinates are approximately \\((18.308, 33.308)\\) when rounded to three decimal places.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<(18.308, 33.308)>>>"
