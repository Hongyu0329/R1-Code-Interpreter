    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side. Here are the steps to find the orthocenter for triangle ABC with vertices A=(-4, 7), B=(-7, -2), and C=(0, 10).\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (-2 - 7) / (-7 + 4) = -9 / -3 = 3\\)\n   - Slope of BC: \\((10 - (-2)) / (0 - (-7)) = 12 / 7\\)\n   - Slope of CA: \\((10 - 7) / (0 + 4) = 3 / 4\\)\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB: \\(-1/3\\).\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC: \\(-7/12\\).\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to CA, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of CA: \\(-4/3\\).\n\n3. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - **Altitude from C:** Passes through C(0, 10) with slope \\(-1/3\\).\n     - Equation: \\(y - 10 = -\\frac{1}{3}(x - 0)\\)\n     - Simplified: \\(y = -\\frac{1}{3}x + 10\\)\n\n   - **Altitude from A:** Passes through A(-4, 7) with slope \\(-7/12\\).\n     - Equation: \\(y - 7 = -\\frac{7}{12}(x + 4)\\)\n     - Simplified: \\(y = -\\frac{7}{12}x - \\frac{28}{12} + 7\\)\n     - Simplified further: \\(y = -\\frac{7}{12}x + \\frac{56}{12}\\)\n     - Simplified further: \\(y = -\\frac{7}{12}x + \\frac{14}{3}\\)\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Set the equations of the altitudes from C and A equal to find their intersection:\n     \\(-\\frac{1}{3}x + 10 = -\\frac{7}{12}x + \\frac{14}{3}\\)\n\n   - Solve for \\(x\\):\n     \\(-\\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{7}{12}x = \\frac{14}{3} - 10\\)\n     \\(\\frac{7}{12}x - \\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{14}{3} - \\frac{30}{3}\\)\n     \\(\\frac{7}{12}x - \\frac{4}{12}x = -\\frac{16}{3}\\)\n     \\(\\frac{3}{12}x = -\\frac{16}{3}\\)\n     \\(\\frac{1}{4}x = -\\frac{16}{3}\\)\n     \\(x = -\\frac{16}{3} \\times 4\\)\n     \\(x = -\\frac{64}{3}\\)\n\n   - Substitute \\(x = -\\frac{64}{3}\\) into the equation of the altitude from C:\n     \\(y = -\\frac{1}{3}(-\\frac{64}{3}) + 10\\)\n     \\(y = \\frac{64}{9} + 10\\)\n     \\(y = \\frac{64}{9} + \\frac{90}{9}\\)\n     \\(y = \\frac{154}{9}\\)\n\n5. **Round the Coordinates:**\n   - \\(x = -\\frac{64}{3} \\approx -21.333\\)\n   - \\(y = \\frac{154}{9} \\approx 17.111\\)\n\nThe orthocenter of the triangle is approximately \\((-21.333, 17.111)\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<(-21.333, 17.111)>>>"
