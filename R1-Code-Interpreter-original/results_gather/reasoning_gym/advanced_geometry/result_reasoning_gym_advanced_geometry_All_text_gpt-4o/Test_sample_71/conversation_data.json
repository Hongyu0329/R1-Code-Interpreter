    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(4, -4), B=(-8, 9), and C=(-7, 10), we can use the concept of vectors and the dot product. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the vectors**: \n   - Vector AB is from B to A: \\( \\text{AB} = (4 - (-8), -4 - 9) = (12, -13) \\).\n   - Vector BC is from B to C: \\( \\text{BC} = (-7 - (-8), 10 - 9) = (1, 1) \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the dot product of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - The dot product \\( \\text{AB} \\cdot \\text{BC} = (12 \\times 1) + (-13 \\times 1) = 12 - 13 = -1 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the magnitudes of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Magnitude of AB: \\( |\\text{AB}| = \\sqrt{12^2 + (-13)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 169} = \\sqrt{313} \\).\n   - Magnitude of BC: \\( |\\text{BC}| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n4. **Use the dot product to find the cosine of the angle θ at B**:\n   - The formula for the cosine of the angle between two vectors is:\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{AB} \\cdot \\text{BC}}{|\\text{AB}| \\times |\\text{BC}|}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the values:\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{313} \\times \\sqrt{2}}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the angle θ in radians**:\n   - Use the inverse cosine function to find θ:\n     \\[\n     \\theta = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{313} \\times \\sqrt{2}}\\right)\n     \\]\n\n6. **Convert the angle from radians to degrees**:\n   - Use the conversion factor \\( \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\) to convert radians to degrees:\n     \\[\n     \\theta_{\\text{degrees}} = \\theta \\times \\frac{180}{\\pi}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Round the angle to 3 decimal places**:\n   - After calculating, round the angle to three decimal places.\n\nBy following these steps, we find that the angle at vertex B is approximately 89.885°.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<89.885°>>>"
