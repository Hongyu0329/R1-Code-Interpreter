    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n**Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.**\n\n- **Slope of AB:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{10 - 8}{2 - (-4)} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n\n- **Slope of BC:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{9 - 10}{-5 - 2} = \\frac{-1}{-7} = \\frac{1}{7}\n  \\]\n\n- **Slope of CA:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } CA = \\frac{9 - 8}{-5 - (-4)} = \\frac{1}{-1} = -1\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Find the equations of the altitudes.**\n\n- **Altitude from A (perpendicular to BC):**\n  The slope of BC is \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\), so the slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal, \\(-7\\).\n\n  Using point A(-4, 8), the equation of the altitude is:\n  \\[\n  y - 8 = -7(x + 4)\n  \\]\n  Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  y = -7x - 28 + 8 \\implies y = -7x - 20\n  \\]\n\n- **Altitude from B (perpendicular to CA):**\n  The slope of CA is \\(-1\\), so the slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal, \\(1\\).\n\n  Using point B(2, 10), the equation of the altitude is:\n  \\[\n  y - 10 = 1(x - 2)\n  \\]\n  Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  y = x + 8\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the intersection of the two altitudes.**\n\nTo find the orthocenter, solve the system of equations:\n1. \\(y = -7x - 20\\)\n2. \\(y = x + 8\\)\n\nSet the equations equal to each other:\n\\[\n-7x - 20 = x + 8\n\\]\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\\[\n-7x - x = 8 + 20 \\implies -8x = 28 \\implies x = -\\frac{28}{8} = -3.5\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(x = -3.5\\) into \\(y = x + 8\\):\n\\[\ny = -3.5 + 8 = 4.5\n\\]\n\nThus, the coordinates of the orthocenter are \\((-3.5, 4.5)\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<(-3.5, 4.5)>>>"
