    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(4, 2), B=(1, -1), and C=(-2, 4), we can use the concept of vectors and the dot product. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the vectors**: \n   - Vector AB is from B to A: \\( \\text{AB} = (4 - 1, 2 - (-1)) = (3, 3) \\).\n   - Vector BC is from B to C: \\( \\text{BC} = (-2 - 1, 4 - (-1)) = (-3, 5) \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the dot product of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - The dot product \\( \\text{AB} \\cdot \\text{BC} = (3)(-3) + (3)(5) = -9 + 15 = 6 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the magnitudes of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Magnitude of AB: \\( |\\text{AB}| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2} \\).\n   - Magnitude of BC: \\( |\\text{BC}| = \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 25} = \\sqrt{34} \\).\n\n4. **Use the dot product to find the cosine of the angle at B**:\n   - The formula for the cosine of the angle \\( \\theta \\) between two vectors is:\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{AB} \\cdot \\text{BC}}{|\\text{AB}| \\cdot |\\text{BC}|}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the values:\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{6}{(3\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{34})} = \\frac{6}{3\\sqrt{68}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{68}}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify further:\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{68}} = \\frac{2}{2\\sqrt{17}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{17}}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the angle \\( \\theta \\) in degrees**:\n   - Use the inverse cosine function to find \\( \\theta \\):\n     \\[\n     \\theta = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{17}}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( \\theta \\) in degrees using a calculator:\n     \\[\n     \\theta \\approx 75.96375653\\ldots\n     \\]\n   - Round to three decimal places:\n     \\[\n     \\theta \\approx 75.964^\\circ\n     \\]\n\nThe angle at vertex B is approximately 75.964째.\n\nFinal answer: <<<75.964째>>>"
