    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle with vertices A=(1, 8), B=(9, -10), and C=(-3, 6), we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (-10 - 8) / (9 - 1) = -18 / 8 = -2.25\\)\n   - Slope of BC: \\((6 - (-10)) / (-3 - 9) = 16 / -12 = -4/3\\)\n   - Slope of CA: \\((6 - 8) / (-3 - 1) = -2 / -4 = 0.5\\)\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC. The slope of BC is \\(-4/3\\), so the slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal, \\(3/4\\).\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to CA. The slope of CA is \\(0.5\\), so the slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal, \\(-2\\).\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB. The slope of AB is \\(-2.25\\), so the slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal, \\(4/9\\).\n\n3. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - **Altitude from A:** Passes through A(1, 8) with slope \\(3/4\\).\n     - Equation: \\(y - 8 = \\frac{3}{4}(x - 1)\\)\n     - Simplifying: \\(y = \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{29}{4}\\)\n\n   - **Altitude from B:** Passes through B(9, -10) with slope \\(-2\\).\n     - Equation: \\(y + 10 = -2(x - 9)\\)\n     - Simplifying: \\(y = -2x + 8\\)\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations:\n     1. \\(y = \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{29}{4}\\)\n     2. \\(y = -2x + 8\\)\n\n   - Set the equations equal to each other:\n     \\(\\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{29}{4} = -2x + 8\\)\n\n   - Clear fractions by multiplying through by 4:\n     \\(3x + 29 = -8x + 32\\)\n\n   - Combine like terms:\n     \\(3x + 8x = 32 - 29\\)\n     \\(11x = 3\\)\n\n   - Solve for \\(x\\):\n     \\(x = \\frac{3}{11}\\)\n\n   - Substitute \\(x = \\frac{3}{11}\\) back into one of the equations to find \\(y\\):\n     \\(y = -2\\left(\\frac{3}{11}\\right) + 8\\)\n     \\(y = -\\frac{6}{11} + 8\\)\n     \\(y = \\frac{88}{11} - \\frac{6}{11}\\)\n     \\(y = \\frac{82}{11}\\)\n\n5. **Round the Coordinates:**\n   - \\(x = \\frac{3}{11} \\approx 0.273\\)\n   - \\(y = \\frac{82}{11} \\approx 7.455\\)\n\nThe orthocenter of the triangle is approximately \\((0.273, 7.455)\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<(0.273, 7.455)>>>"
