    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n**Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.**\n\n- **Slope of AB:**  \n  The formula for the slope between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\).  \n  For AB, the slope is \\((2 - 5) / (-4 - 0) = -3 / -4 = 3/4\\).\n\n- **Slope of BC:**  \n  For BC, the slope is \\((9 - 2) / (3 - (-4)) = 7 / 7 = 1\\).\n\n- **Slope of CA:**  \n  For CA, the slope is \\((9 - 5) / (3 - 0) = 4 / 3\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the slopes of the altitudes.**\n\nThe slope of an altitude is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the side it is perpendicular to.\n\n- **Altitude from A (perpendicular to BC):**  \n  The slope of BC is 1, so the slope of the altitude from A is \\(-1\\).\n\n- **Altitude from B (perpendicular to CA):**  \n  The slope of CA is \\(4/3\\), so the slope of the altitude from B is \\(-3/4\\).\n\n- **Altitude from C (perpendicular to AB):**  \n  The slope of AB is \\(3/4\\), so the slope of the altitude from C is \\(-4/3\\).\n\n**Step 3: Find the equations of the altitudes.**\n\n- **Equation of the altitude from A:**  \n  The point A is (0, 5) and the slope is \\(-1\\).  \n  Using the point-slope form \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), the equation is:  \n  \\(y - 5 = -1(x - 0)\\)  \n  \\(y = -x + 5\\).\n\n- **Equation of the altitude from B:**  \n  The point B is (-4, 2) and the slope is \\(-3/4\\).  \n  \\(y - 2 = -\\frac{3}{4}(x + 4)\\)  \n  \\(y - 2 = -\\frac{3}{4}x - 3\\)  \n  \\(y = -\\frac{3}{4}x - 1\\).\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersection of the altitudes.**\n\nTo find the orthocenter, solve the system of equations for the altitudes from A and B:\n\n1. \\(y = -x + 5\\)\n2. \\(y = -\\frac{3}{4}x - 1\\)\n\nSet the equations equal to each other to find the x-coordinate:\n\n\\(-x + 5 = -\\frac{3}{4}x - 1\\)\n\nMultiply through by 4 to clear the fraction:\n\n\\(-4x + 20 = -3x - 4\\)\n\nRearrange and solve for x:\n\n\\(-4x + 3x = -4 - 20\\)  \n\\(-x = -24\\)  \n\\(x = 24\\)\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 24\\) back into one of the equations to find y:\n\n\\(y = -24 + 5 = -19\\)\n\nThus, the orthocenter of triangle ABC is at the coordinates (24, -19).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<(24, -19)>>>"
