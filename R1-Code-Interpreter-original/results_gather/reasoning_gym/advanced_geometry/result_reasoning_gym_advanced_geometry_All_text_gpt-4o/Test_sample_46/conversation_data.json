    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC with vertices A=(-7, -1), B=(-2, 3), and C=(-9, 10), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (3 - (-1)) / (-2 - (-7)) = 4 / 5\\)\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_3 - y_2) / (x_3 - x_2) = (10 - 3) / (-9 - (-2)) = 7 / -7 = -1\\)\n   - Slope of CA: \\((y_3 - y_1) / (x_3 - x_1) = (10 - (-1)) / (-9 - (-7)) = 11 / -2 = -5.5\\)\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC. The slope of BC is -1, so the slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal, which is 1.\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to CA. The slope of CA is -5.5, so the slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal, which is \\(1/5.5\\).\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB. The slope of AB is 4/5, so the slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal, which is \\(-5/4\\).\n\n3. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - Equation of the altitude from A: Using point A=(-7, -1) and slope 1, the equation is \\(y + 1 = 1(x + 7)\\) or \\(y = x + 6\\).\n   - Equation of the altitude from B: Using point B=(-2, 3) and slope \\(1/5.5\\), the equation is \\(y - 3 = (1/5.5)(x + 2)\\) or \\(y = (1/5.5)x + 3 + 2/5.5\\).\n   - Equation of the altitude from C: Using point C=(-9, 10) and slope \\(-5/4\\), the equation is \\(y - 10 = (-5/4)(x + 9)\\) or \\(y = (-5/4)x + 10 + 45/4\\).\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Solve the equations of the altitudes from A and B to find their intersection point.\n   - Set \\(y = x + 6\\) equal to \\(y = (1/5.5)x + 3 + 2/5.5\\).\n   - Solve for x: \\(x + 6 = (1/5.5)x + 3 + 2/5.5\\).\n   - Simplify and solve for x: \\(x - (1/5.5)x = 3 + 2/5.5 - 6\\).\n   - \\(x(1 - 1/5.5) = -3 + 2/5.5\\).\n   - \\(x(4.5/5.5) = -3 + 2/5.5\\).\n   - \\(x = (-3 + 2/5.5) * (5.5/4.5)\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the y-coordinate:**\n   - Substitute the x value back into one of the altitude equations, e.g., \\(y = x + 6\\).\n\n6. **Verify with the Third Altitude:**\n   - Check if the intersection point satisfies the equation of the third altitude to ensure accuracy.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the orthocenter of triangle ABC is found to be:\n\n<<<(-5.5, 0.5)>>>"
