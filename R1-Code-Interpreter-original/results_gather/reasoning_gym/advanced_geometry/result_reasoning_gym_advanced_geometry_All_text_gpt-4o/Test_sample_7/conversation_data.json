    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC with given vertices A=(-2, 2), B=(-10, -4), and C=(-3, 2), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Orthocenter**: The orthocenter of a triangle is the point where the three altitudes intersect. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Sides**:\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (-4 - 2) / (-10 + 2) = -6 / -8 = 3/4\\)\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (2 + 4) / (-3 + 10) = 6 / 7\\)\n   - Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (2 - 2) / (-3 + 2) = 0\\)\n\n3. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes**:\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC. The slope of BC is 6/7, so the slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal: \\(-7/6\\).\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC. The slope of AC is 0, so the slope of the altitude from B is undefined (vertical line).\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB. The slope of AB is 3/4, so the slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal: \\(-4/3\\).\n\n4. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes**:\n   - **Altitude from A**: Passes through A(-2, 2) with slope \\(-7/6\\).\n     - Equation: \\(y - 2 = -\\frac{7}{6}(x + 2)\\)\n     - Simplifying: \\(y = -\\frac{7}{6}x - \\frac{14}{6} + 2\\)\n     - \\(y = -\\frac{7}{6}x + \\frac{10}{6}\\)\n     - \\(y = -\\frac{7}{6}x + \\frac{5}{3}\\)\n\n   - **Altitude from B**: Vertical line through B(-10, -4).\n     - Equation: \\(x = -10\\)\n\n   - **Altitude from C**: Passes through C(-3, 2) with slope \\(-4/3\\).\n     - Equation: \\(y - 2 = -\\frac{4}{3}(x + 3)\\)\n     - Simplifying: \\(y = -\\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{12}{3} + 2\\)\n     - \\(y = -\\frac{4}{3}x - 4 + 2\\)\n     - \\(y = -\\frac{4}{3}x - 2\\)\n\n5. **Find the Intersection of the Altitudes**:\n   - **Intersection of Altitude from A and Altitude from B**:\n     - Altitude from A: \\(y = -\\frac{7}{6}x + \\frac{5}{3}\\)\n     - Altitude from B: \\(x = -10\\)\n     - Substitute \\(x = -10\\) into the equation of the altitude from A:\n       - \\(y = -\\frac{7}{6}(-10) + \\frac{5}{3}\\)\n       - \\(y = \\frac{70}{6} + \\frac{5}{3}\\)\n       - \\(y = \\frac{35}{3} + \\frac{5}{3}\\)\n       - \\(y = \\frac{40}{3}\\)\n\nThe orthocenter of triangle ABC is at the intersection of these altitudes, which is at the point \\((-10, \\frac{40}{3})\\).\n\n6. **Round the Coordinates**:\n   - The y-coordinate \\(\\frac{40}{3}\\) is approximately 13.333 when rounded to three decimal places.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the orthocenter are \\((-10, 13.333)\\).\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<(-10, 13.333)>>>"
