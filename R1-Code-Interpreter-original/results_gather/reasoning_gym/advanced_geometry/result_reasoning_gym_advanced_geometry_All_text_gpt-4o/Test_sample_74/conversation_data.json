    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(5, -10), B=(7, 6), and C=(5, -9), we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the vectors**: \n   - Vector AB: B - A = (7 - 5, 6 - (-10)) = (2, 16)\n   - Vector BC: C - B = (5 - 7, -9 - 6) = (-2, -15)\n\n2. **Calculate the dot product of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Dot product AB · BC = (2)(-2) + (16)(-15) = -4 - 240 = -244\n\n3. **Calculate the magnitudes of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Magnitude of AB = √((2)^2 + (16)^2) = √(4 + 256) = √260\n   - Magnitude of BC = √((-2)^2 + (-15)^2) = √(4 + 225) = √229\n\n4. **Use the dot product to find the cosine of the angle θ at B**:\n   - cos(θ) = (AB · BC) / (|AB| * |BC|)\n   - cos(θ) = -244 / (√260 * √229)\n\n5. **Calculate the angle θ in radians**:\n   - θ = cos⁻¹(-244 / (√260 * √229))\n\n6. **Convert the angle from radians to degrees**:\n   - θ (in degrees) = θ (in radians) * (180/π)\n\n7. **Round the angle to 3 decimal places** and include the degree symbol.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the angle at vertex B is approximately 172.874°.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<172.874°>>>"
