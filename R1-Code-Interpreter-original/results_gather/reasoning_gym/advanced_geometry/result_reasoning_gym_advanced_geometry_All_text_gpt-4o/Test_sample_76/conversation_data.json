    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-8, 2)\n- B = (-2, 2)\n- C = (-4, -8)\n\n**Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.**\n\n1. **Slope of AB:**\n   - A = (-8, 2), B = (-2, 2)\n   - Since both y-coordinates are the same, AB is a horizontal line.\n   - Slope of AB = 0\n\n2. **Slope of BC:**\n   - B = (-2, 2), C = (-4, -8)\n   - Slope of BC = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (-8 - 2) / (-4 + 2) = -10 / -2 = 5\n\n3. **Slope of AC:**\n   - A = (-8, 2), C = (-4, -8)\n   - Slope of AC = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (-8 - 2) / (-4 + 8) = -10 / 4 = -2.5\n\n**Step 2: Find the equations of the altitudes.**\n\n1. **Altitude from C to AB:**\n   - Since AB is horizontal, the altitude from C is a vertical line through C.\n   - Equation: x = -4\n\n2. **Altitude from A to BC:**\n   - Slope of BC = 5, so the perpendicular slope is -1/5.\n   - Equation of the line through A with slope -1/5:\n     - y - 2 = -1/5(x + 8)\n     - y = -1/5x - 8/5 + 10/5\n     - y = -1/5x + 2/5\n\n3. **Altitude from B to AC:**\n   - Slope of AC = -2.5, so the perpendicular slope is 0.4.\n   - Equation of the line through B with slope 0.4:\n     - y - 2 = 0.4(x + 2)\n     - y = 0.4x + 0.8 + 2\n     - y = 0.4x + 2.8\n\n**Step 3: Find the intersection of the altitudes.**\n\n1. **Intersection of x = -4 and y = -1/5x + 2/5:**\n   - Substitute x = -4 into y = -1/5x + 2/5:\n   - y = -1/5(-4) + 2/5 = 4/5 + 2/5 = 6/5\n\n2. **Verify with the third altitude:**\n   - Substitute x = -4 into y = 0.4x + 2.8:\n   - y = 0.4(-4) + 2.8 = -1.6 + 2.8 = 1.2\n   - Since 1.2 is not equal to 6/5, re-evaluate the calculations.\n\nUpon re-evaluation, the correct intersection point of the altitudes is at x = -4 and y = 1.2.\n\nTherefore, the orthocenter of the triangle is at the point (-4, 1.2).\n\nFinal answer: <<<(-4, 1.2)>>>"
