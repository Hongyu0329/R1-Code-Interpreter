    "To find the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with given coordinates, we can use the concept of vectors and the dot product. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Points:**\n   - A = (-5, -8)\n   - B = (-3, 4)\n   - C = (-1, 1)\n\n2. **Determine the Vectors:**\n   - Vector AB = B - A = (-3 - (-5), 4 - (-8)) = (2, 12)\n   - Vector BC = C - B = (-1 - (-3), 1 - 4) = (2, -3)\n\n3. **Calculate the Dot Product of Vectors AB and BC:**\n   - Dot product, AB · BC = (2 * 2) + (12 * -3) = 4 - 36 = -32\n\n4. **Calculate the Magnitudes of Vectors AB and BC:**\n   - Magnitude of AB = √(2² + 12²) = √(4 + 144) = √148\n   - Magnitude of BC = √(2² + (-3)²) = √(4 + 9) = √13\n\n5. **Use the Dot Product to Find the Cosine of Angle ABC:**\n   - cos(∠ABC) = (AB · BC) / (|AB| * |BC|)\n   - cos(∠ABC) = -32 / (√148 * √13)\n\n6. **Calculate the Angle Using the Inverse Cosine Function:**\n   - ∠ABC = cos⁻¹(-32 / (√148 * √13))\n\n7. **Compute the Angle in Degrees:**\n   - Use a calculator to find the angle in degrees.\n   - ∠ABC ≈ cos⁻¹(-32 / (√148 * √13)) ≈ 104.036°\n\n8. **Round the Angle to Three Decimal Places:**\n   - ∠ABC ≈ 104.036°\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle ABC is:\n\n<<<104.036°>>>"
