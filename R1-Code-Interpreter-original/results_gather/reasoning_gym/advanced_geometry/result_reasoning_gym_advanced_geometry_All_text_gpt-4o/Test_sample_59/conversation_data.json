    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or its extension). Here are the steps to find the orthocenter for triangle ABC with vertices A=(8, -5), B=(-5, 2), and C=(4, 4).\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of BC: \n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{4 - 2}{4 - (-5)} = \\frac{2}{9}\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{4 - (-5)}{4 - 8} = \\frac{9}{-4} = -\\frac{9}{4}\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AB:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{2 - (-5)}{-5 - 8} = \\frac{7}{-13} = -\\frac{7}{13}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from A} = -\\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{9}} = -\\frac{9}{2}\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from B} = -\\frac{1}{-\\frac{9}{4}} = \\frac{4}{9}\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from C} = -\\frac{1}{-\\frac{7}{13}} = \\frac{13}{7}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - Equation of the altitude from A (point A is (8, -5)):\n     \\[\n     y + 5 = -\\frac{9}{2}(x - 8)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{9}{2}x + 36 - 5 = -\\frac{9}{2}x + 31\n     \\]\n\n   - Equation of the altitude from B (point B is (-5, 2)):\n     \\[\n     y - 2 = \\frac{4}{9}(x + 5)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{4}{9}x + \\frac{20}{9} + 2 = \\frac{4}{9}x + \\frac{38}{9}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations:\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{9}{2}x + 31\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{4}{9}x + \\frac{38}{9}\n     \\]\n\n   Set the equations equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{9}{2}x + 31 = \\frac{4}{9}x + \\frac{38}{9}\n   \\]\n\n   Multiply through by 18 to clear fractions:\n   \\[\n   -81x + 558 = 8x + 76\n   \\]\n\n   Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   -81x - 8x = 76 - 558\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -89x = -482\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{482}{89} \\approx 5.416\n   \\]\n\n   Substitute \\(x = 5.416\\) back into one of the altitude equations to find \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   y = -\\frac{9}{2}(5.416) + 31\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y \\approx -24.372 + 31 = 6.628\n   \\]\n\nThus, the orthocenter of the triangle is approximately \\((5.416, 6.628)\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<< (5.416, 6.628) >>>"
