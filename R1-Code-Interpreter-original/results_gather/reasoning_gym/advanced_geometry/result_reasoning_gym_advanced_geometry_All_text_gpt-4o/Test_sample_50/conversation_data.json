    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC with vertices A=(5, 6), B=(-1, -5), and C=(-5, -2), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Orthocenter**: The orthocenter of a triangle is the point where the three altitudes intersect. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Sides**:\n   - Slope of BC: \n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{-2 - (-5)}{-5 - (-1)} = \\frac{3}{-4} = -\\frac{3}{4}\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{-2 - 6}{-5 - 5} = \\frac{-8}{-10} = \\frac{4}{5}\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AB:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{-5 - 6}{-1 - 5} = \\frac{-11}{-6}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes**:\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from A} = \\frac{4}{3}\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from B} = -\\frac{5}{4}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes**:\n   - Equation of the altitude from A (using point A(5, 6)):\n     \\[\n     y - 6 = \\frac{4}{3}(x - 5)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{20}{3} + 6 = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{-20 + 18}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{2}{3}\n     \\]\n\n   - Equation of the altitude from B (using point B(-1, -5)):\n     \\[\n     y + 5 = -\\frac{5}{4}(x + 1)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{5}{4}x - \\frac{5}{4} - 5 = -\\frac{5}{4}x - \\frac{5}{4} - \\frac{20}{4} = -\\frac{5}{4}x - \\frac{25}{4}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Find the Intersection of the Altitudes**:\n   - Set the equations equal to find the intersection point:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{2}{3} = -\\frac{5}{4}x - \\frac{25}{4}\n     \\]\n   - Clear fractions by multiplying through by 12:\n     \\[\n     16x - 8 = -15x - 75\n     \\]\n   - Solve for x:\n     \\[\n     16x + 15x = -75 + 8\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     31x = -67\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = -\\frac{67}{31} \\approx -2.161\n     \\]\n\n   - Substitute x back into one of the altitude equations to find y:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{4}{3}(-2.161) - \\frac{2}{3}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = -2.881 - 0.667 = -3.548\n     \\]\n\n6. **Round the Coordinates**:\n   - The orthocenter is approximately at:\n     \\[\n     (-2.161, -3.548)\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the orthocenter of triangle ABC are:\n\n<<<(-2.161, -3.548)>>>"
