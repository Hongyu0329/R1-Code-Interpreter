    "To find the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with given coordinates, we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the vectors:**\n   - Vector AB: From A to B, the vector is \\( \\text{AB} = (x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1) = (-2 - (-7), -3 - (-10)) = (5, 7) \\).\n   - Vector BC: From B to C, the vector is \\( \\text{BC} = (x_3 - x_2, y_3 - y_2) = (-3 - (-2), -6 - (-3)) = (-1, -3) \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the dot product of vectors AB and BC:**\n   - The dot product \\( \\text{AB} \\cdot \\text{BC} = (5)(-1) + (7)(-3) = -5 - 21 = -26 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the magnitudes of vectors AB and BC:**\n   - Magnitude of AB: \\( |\\text{AB}| = \\sqrt{(5)^2 + (7)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 49} = \\sqrt{74} \\).\n   - Magnitude of BC: \\( |\\text{BC}| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + (-3)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 9} = \\sqrt{10} \\).\n\n4. **Use the dot product formula to find the cosine of angle ABC:**\n   - The formula is \\( \\cos(\\angle ABC) = \\frac{\\text{AB} \\cdot \\text{BC}}{|\\text{AB}| \\cdot |\\text{BC}|} \\).\n   - Substitute the values: \\( \\cos(\\angle ABC) = \\frac{-26}{\\sqrt{74} \\cdot \\sqrt{10}} \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the angle ABC:**\n   - First, calculate the denominator: \\( \\sqrt{74} \\cdot \\sqrt{10} = \\sqrt{740} \\).\n   - Then, \\( \\cos(\\angle ABC) = \\frac{-26}{\\sqrt{740}} \\).\n   - Calculate the angle: \\( \\angle ABC = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{-26}{\\sqrt{740}}\\right) \\).\n\n6. **Convert the angle from radians to degrees:**\n   - Use a calculator to find the angle in degrees and round to three decimal places.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the measure of angle ABC is approximately:\n\n<<<163.300°>>>"
