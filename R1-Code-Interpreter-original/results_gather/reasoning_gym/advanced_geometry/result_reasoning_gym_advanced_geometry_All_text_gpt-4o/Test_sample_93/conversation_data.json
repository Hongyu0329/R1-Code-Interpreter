    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n**Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.**\n\n- **Slope of AB**:  \n  The formula for the slope between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\).  \n  For AB, the slope is \\((8 - 9) / (-1 + 3) = -1/2\\).\n\n- **Slope of BC**:  \n  For BC, the slope is \\((1 - 8) / (-5 + 1) = -7/-4 = 7/4\\).\n\n- **Slope of CA**:  \n  For CA, the slope is \\((1 - 9) / (-5 + 3) = -8/-2 = 4\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the slopes of the altitudes.**\n\nThe slope of an altitude is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the opposite side.\n\n- **Altitude from C to AB**:  \n  The slope of AB is \\(-1/2\\), so the slope of the altitude from C is \\(2\\).\n\n- **Altitude from A to BC**:  \n  The slope of BC is \\(7/4\\), so the slope of the altitude from A is \\(-4/7\\).\n\n- **Altitude from B to CA**:  \n  The slope of CA is \\(4\\), so the slope of the altitude from B is \\(-1/4\\).\n\n**Step 3: Find the equations of the altitudes.**\n\n- **Equation of the altitude from C to AB**:  \n  The point C is \\((-5, 1)\\) and the slope is \\(2\\).  \n  Using the point-slope form \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), the equation is:  \n  \\(y - 1 = 2(x + 5)\\)  \n  Simplifying, \\(y = 2x + 11\\).\n\n- **Equation of the altitude from A to BC**:  \n  The point A is \\((-3, 9)\\) and the slope is \\(-4/7\\).  \n  The equation is:  \n  \\(y - 9 = -\\frac{4}{7}(x + 3)\\)  \n  Simplifying, \\(y = -\\frac{4}{7}x + \\frac{39}{7}\\).\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersection of the altitudes.**\n\nTo find the orthocenter, solve the system of equations for the altitudes from C and A:\n\n1. \\(y = 2x + 11\\)\n2. \\(y = -\\frac{4}{7}x + \\frac{39}{7}\\)\n\nSet the equations equal to each other:\n\n\\[2x + 11 = -\\frac{4}{7}x + \\frac{39}{7}\\]\n\nMultiply through by 7 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[14x + 77 = -4x + 39\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[18x = -38\\]\n\nSolve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[x = -\\frac{38}{18} = -\\frac{19}{9}\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(x = -\\frac{19}{9}\\) back into the equation \\(y = 2x + 11\\):\n\n\\[y = 2\\left(-\\frac{19}{9}\\right) + 11\\]\n\n\\[y = -\\frac{38}{9} + \\frac{99}{9}\\]\n\n\\[y = \\frac{61}{9}\\]\n\nThus, the orthocenter of triangle ABC is \\(\\left(-\\frac{19}{9}, \\frac{61}{9}\\right)\\).\n\n**Step 5: Round the coordinates to 3 decimal places.**\n\n- \\(x = -\\frac{19}{9} \\approx -2.111\\)\n- \\(y = \\frac{61}{9} \\approx 6.778\\)\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the orthocenter are approximately \\((-2.111, 6.778)\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<(-2.111, 6.778)>>>"
