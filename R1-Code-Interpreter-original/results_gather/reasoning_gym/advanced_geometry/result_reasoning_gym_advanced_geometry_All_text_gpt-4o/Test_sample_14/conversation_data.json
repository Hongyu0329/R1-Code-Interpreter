    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n**Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.**\n\n- **Slope of AB**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{8 - (-9)}{8 - 2} = \\frac{17}{6}\n  \\]\n\n- **Slope of BC**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{10 - 8}{-3 - 8} = \\frac{2}{-11} = -\\frac{2}{11}\n  \\]\n\n- **Slope of CA**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } CA = \\frac{10 - (-9)}{-3 - 2} = \\frac{19}{-5} = -\\frac{19}{5}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Find the equations of the altitudes.**\n\n- **Altitude from A (perpendicular to BC)**:\n  - The slope of BC is \\(-\\frac{2}{11}\\), so the slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal, \\(\\frac{11}{2}\\).\n  - Using point A (2, -9), the equation of the altitude is:\n    \\[\n    y + 9 = \\frac{11}{2}(x - 2)\n    \\]\n    Simplifying:\n    \\[\n    y = \\frac{11}{2}x - 11 - 9 = \\frac{11}{2}x - 20\n    \\]\n\n- **Altitude from B (perpendicular to CA)**:\n  - The slope of CA is \\(-\\frac{19}{5}\\), so the slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal, \\(\\frac{5}{19}\\).\n  - Using point B (8, 8), the equation of the altitude is:\n    \\[\n    y - 8 = \\frac{5}{19}(x - 8)\n    \\]\n    Simplifying:\n    \\[\n    y = \\frac{5}{19}x + \\frac{40}{19} + 8 = \\frac{5}{19}x + \\frac{192}{19}\n    \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the intersection of the two altitudes.**\n\nTo find the orthocenter, solve the system of equations given by the two altitudes:\n\n1. \\( y = \\frac{11}{2}x - 20 \\)\n2. \\( y = \\frac{5}{19}x + \\frac{192}{19} \\)\n\nSet the equations equal to each other:\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{2}x - 20 = \\frac{5}{19}x + \\frac{192}{19}\n\\]\n\nClear the fractions by multiplying through by 38 (the least common multiple of 2 and 19):\n\\[\n209x - 760 = 10x + 384\n\\]\n\nRearrange and solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[\n199x = 1144 \\implies x = \\frac{1144}{199} \\approx 5.751\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 5.751\\) back into one of the altitude equations to find \\(y\\):\n\\[\ny = \\frac{11}{2}(5.751) - 20 \\approx 31.6305 - 20 = 11.6305\n\\]\n\nRound to three decimal places:\n\\[\nx \\approx 5.751, \\quad y \\approx 11.631\n\\]\n\nThus, the coordinates of the orthocenter are approximately \\((5.751, 11.631)\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<(5.751, 11.631)>>>"
