    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-7, 3)\n- B = (4, 3)\n- C = (-2, 9)\n\n**Step 1: Determine the slopes of the sides of the triangle.**\n\n1. **Slope of AB:**\n   - Since A and B have the same y-coordinate, the line AB is horizontal.\n   - Slope of AB = 0\n\n2. **Slope of BC:**\n   - Slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (9 - 3) / (-2 - 4) = 6 / -6 = -1\n\n3. **Slope of AC:**\n   - Slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (9 - 3) / (-2 + 7) = 6 / 5\n\n**Step 2: Determine the slopes of the altitudes.**\n\n1. **Altitude from C to AB:**\n   - Since AB is horizontal, the altitude from C is vertical.\n   - The x-coordinate of this altitude is the x-coordinate of C, which is -2.\n\n2. **Altitude from A to BC:**\n   - The slope of BC is -1, so the slope of the altitude from A to BC is the negative reciprocal, which is 1.\n   - Using point A (-7, 3), the equation of the line is:\n     - y - 3 = 1(x + 7)\n     - y = x + 10\n\n3. **Altitude from B to AC:**\n   - The slope of AC is 6/5, so the slope of the altitude from B to AC is the negative reciprocal, which is -5/6.\n   - Using point B (4, 3), the equation of the line is:\n     - y - 3 = -5/6(x - 4)\n     - y = -5/6x + 20/6 + 18/6\n     - y = -5/6x + 38/6\n     - y = -5/6x + 19/3\n\n**Step 3: Find the intersection of the altitudes.**\n\n1. **Intersection of the altitude from C (x = -2) and the altitude from A (y = x + 10):**\n   - Substitute x = -2 into y = x + 10:\n   - y = -2 + 10 = 8\n   - So, the intersection point is (-2, 8).\n\n2. **Verify with the altitude from B (y = -5/6x + 19/3):**\n   - Substitute x = -2 into y = -5/6x + 19/3:\n   - y = -5/6(-2) + 19/3\n   - y = 10/6 + 19/3\n   - y = 5/3 + 19/3\n   - y = 24/3\n   - y = 8\n\nThe intersection point of all altitudes is (-2, 8).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<(-2, 8)>>>"
