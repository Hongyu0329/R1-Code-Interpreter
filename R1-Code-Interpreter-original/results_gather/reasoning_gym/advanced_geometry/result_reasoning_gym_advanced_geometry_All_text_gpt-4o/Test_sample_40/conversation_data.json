    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (9, -5)\n- B = (1, 7)\n- C = (9, 1)\n\n**Step 1: Determine the slopes of the sides of the triangle.**\n\n- Slope of BC:\n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{7 - 1}{1 - 9} = \\frac{6}{-8} = -\\frac{3}{4}\n  \\]\n\n- Slope of AC:\n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{1 - (-5)}{9 - 9} = \\frac{6}{0}\n  \\]\n  Since the slope is undefined, AC is a vertical line.\n\n- Slope of AB:\n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{7 - (-5)}{1 - 9} = \\frac{12}{-8} = -\\frac{3}{2}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the equations of the altitudes.**\n\n- Altitude from A to BC:\n  The slope of BC is \\(-\\frac{3}{4}\\), so the slope of the altitude from A to BC is the negative reciprocal, \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\).\n  Using point A (9, -5), the equation of the altitude is:\n  \\[\n  y + 5 = \\frac{4}{3}(x - 9)\n  \\]\n  Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{4}{3}x - 12 - 5\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{4}{3}x - 17\n  \\]\n\n- Altitude from B to AC:\n  Since AC is a vertical line, the altitude from B to AC is a horizontal line through B (1, 7). Therefore, the equation is:\n  \\[\n  y = 7\n  \\]\n\n- Altitude from C to AB:\n  The slope of AB is \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\), so the slope of the altitude from C to AB is the negative reciprocal, \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n  Using point C (9, 1), the equation of the altitude is:\n  \\[\n  y - 1 = \\frac{2}{3}(x - 9)\n  \\]\n  Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{2}{3}x - 6 + 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{2}{3}x - 5\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the intersection of the altitudes.**\n\n- Intersection of \\(y = \\frac{4}{3}x - 17\\) and \\(y = 7\\):\n  \\[\n  7 = \\frac{4}{3}x - 17\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  24 = 4x - 51\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  4x = 75\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{75}{4} = 18.75\n  \\]\n\n  So, the intersection point is \\((18.75, 7)\\).\n\n- Verify with the third altitude \\(y = \\frac{2}{3}x - 5\\):\n  \\[\n  7 = \\frac{2}{3}(18.75) - 5\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  7 = 12.5 - 5\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  7 = 7\n  \\]\n\nThe intersection point satisfies all equations, confirming it is the orthocenter.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe orthocenter of the triangle is \\((18.75, 7)\\).\n\n<<<(18.75, 7)>>>"
