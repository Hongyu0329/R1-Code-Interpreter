    "To find the radius of the incircle of triangle ABC with vertices A(6, 8), B(7, 7), and C(8, -2), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the side lengths of the triangle:**\n   - Use the distance formula to find the lengths of sides AB, BC, and CA.\n   - \\( AB = \\sqrt{(7 - 6)^2 + (7 - 8)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n   - \\( BC = \\sqrt{(8 - 7)^2 + (-2 - 7)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 81} = \\sqrt{82} \\)\n   - \\( CA = \\sqrt{(8 - 6)^2 + (-2 - 8)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 100} = \\sqrt{104} \\)\n\n2. **Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle:**\n   - The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) is given by \\( s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} \\).\n   - \\( s = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{82} + \\sqrt{104}}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the triangle:**\n   - Use the coordinates to apply the formula for the area of a triangle:\n   - Area \\( K = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 6(7 + 2) + 7(-2 - 8) + 8(8 - 7) \\right| \\)\n   - \\( K = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 6 \\times 9 + 7 \\times (-10) + 8 \\times 1 \\right| \\)\n   - \\( K = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 54 - 70 + 8 \\right| \\)\n   - \\( K = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| -8 \\right| = 4 \\)\n\n4. **Calculate the radius of the incircle:**\n   - The radius \\( r \\) of the incircle is given by \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\).\n   - Substitute the values of \\( K \\) and \\( s \\) to find \\( r \\).\n\n5. **Compute the final value:**\n   - Calculate \\( s = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{82} + \\sqrt{104}}{2} \\).\n   - Calculate \\( r = \\frac{4}{s} \\).\n\n6. **Round the result to three decimal places:**\n   - Perform the calculations and round the result to three decimal places.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the radius of the incircle is found to be approximately 0.554.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.554>>>"
