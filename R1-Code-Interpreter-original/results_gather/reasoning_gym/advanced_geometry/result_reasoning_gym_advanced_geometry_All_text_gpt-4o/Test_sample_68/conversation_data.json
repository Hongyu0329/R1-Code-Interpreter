    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n**Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.**\n\n- **Slope of AB**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{2 - 4}{-5 - 4} = \\frac{-2}{-9} = \\frac{2}{9}\n  \\]\n\n- **Slope of BC**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{3 - 2}{1 - (-5)} = \\frac{1}{6}\n  \\]\n\n- **Slope of CA**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } CA = \\frac{3 - 4}{1 - 4} = \\frac{-1}{-3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Find the slopes of the altitudes.**\n\nThe slope of an altitude is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the opposite side.\n\n- **Altitude from A (perpendicular to BC)**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of altitude from A} = -\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{6}} = -6\n  \\]\n\n- **Altitude from B (perpendicular to CA)**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of altitude from B} = -\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{3}} = -3\n  \\]\n\n- **Altitude from C (perpendicular to AB)**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of altitude from C} = -\\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{9}} = -\\frac{9}{2}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the equations of the altitudes.**\n\n- **Equation of altitude from A**:\n  Using point A (4, 4) and slope -6:\n  \\[\n  y - 4 = -6(x - 4) \\implies y = -6x + 24 + 4 \\implies y = -6x + 28\n  \\]\n\n- **Equation of altitude from B**:\n  Using point B (-5, 2) and slope -3:\n  \\[\n  y - 2 = -3(x + 5) \\implies y = -3x - 15 + 2 \\implies y = -3x - 13\n  \\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersection of the altitudes.**\n\nSolve the system of equations for the altitudes from A and B:\n\n1. \\( y = -6x + 28 \\)\n2. \\( y = -3x - 13 \\)\n\nSet the equations equal to each other:\n\\[\n-6x + 28 = -3x - 13\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n28 + 13 = 6x - 3x \\implies 41 = 3x \\implies x = \\frac{41}{3} \\approx 13.667\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( x = \\frac{41}{3} \\) into one of the equations to find \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny = -6\\left(\\frac{41}{3}\\right) + 28 = -82 + 28 = -54\n\\]\n\nThus, the coordinates of the orthocenter are approximately \\((13.667, -54)\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<(13.667, -54)>>>"
