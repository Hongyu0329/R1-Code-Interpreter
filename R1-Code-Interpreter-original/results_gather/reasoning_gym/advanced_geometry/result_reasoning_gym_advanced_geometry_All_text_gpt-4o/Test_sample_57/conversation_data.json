    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle with vertices A=(9, -2), B=(-6, 1), and C=(-8, -6), we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of BC: \n     \\[\n     m_{BC} = \\frac{y_C - y_B}{x_C - x_B} = \\frac{-6 - 1}{-8 + 6} = \\frac{-7}{-2} = \\frac{7}{2}\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     m_{AC} = \\frac{y_C - y_A}{x_C - x_A} = \\frac{-6 + 2}{-8 - 9} = \\frac{-4}{-17} = \\frac{4}{17}\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AB:\n     \\[\n     m_{AB} = \\frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A} = \\frac{1 + 2}{-6 - 9} = \\frac{3}{-15} = -\\frac{1}{5}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(m_{BC}\\):\n     \\[\n     m_{altitude\\ from\\ A} = -\\frac{2}{7}\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(m_{AC}\\):\n     \\[\n     m_{altitude\\ from\\ B} = -\\frac{17}{4}\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(m_{AB}\\):\n     \\[\n     m_{altitude\\ from\\ C} = 5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - Equation of the altitude from A:\n     \\[\n     y + 2 = -\\frac{2}{7}(x - 9)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{2}{7}x + \\frac{18}{7} - 2 = -\\frac{2}{7}x + \\frac{4}{7}\n     \\]\n\n   - Equation of the altitude from B:\n     \\[\n     y - 1 = -\\frac{17}{4}(x + 6)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{17}{4}x - \\frac{102}{4} + 1 = -\\frac{17}{4}x - \\frac{98}{4}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Set the equations of the altitudes from A and B equal to find their intersection:\n     \\[\n     -\\frac{2}{7}x + \\frac{4}{7} = -\\frac{17}{4}x - \\frac{98}{4}\n     \\]\n   - Clear fractions by multiplying through by 28:\n     \\[\n     -8x + 16 = -119x - 686\n     \\]\n   - Solve for x:\n     \\[\n     111x = -702 \\implies x = -\\frac{702}{111} = -6.324\n     \\]\n\n   - Substitute x back into the equation of the altitude from A to find y:\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{2}{7}(-6.324) + \\frac{4}{7}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{12.648}{7} + \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{16.648}{7} = 2.378\n     \\]\n\nThus, the orthocenter of the triangle is at the coordinates:\n\n<<<(-6.324, 2.378)>>>"
