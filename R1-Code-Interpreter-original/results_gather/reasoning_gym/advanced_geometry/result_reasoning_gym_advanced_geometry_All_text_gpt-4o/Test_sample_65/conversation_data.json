    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC with vertices A=(3, 1), B=(-9, 8), and C=(-10, 7), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Orthocenter**: The orthocenter of a triangle is the point where the three altitudes intersect. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Sides**:\n   - Slope of BC: \n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{7 - 8}{-10 + 9} = \\frac{-1}{-1} = 1\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{7 - 1}{-10 - 3} = \\frac{6}{-13} = -\\frac{6}{13}\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AB:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{8 - 1}{-9 - 3} = \\frac{7}{-12} = -\\frac{7}{12}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes**:\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from A} = -1\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from B} = \\frac{13}{6}\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from C} = \\frac{12}{7}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes**:\n   - Equation of the altitude from A (point A is (3, 1)):\n     \\[\n     y - 1 = -1(x - 3) \\implies y = -x + 4\n     \\]\n   - Equation of the altitude from B (point B is (-9, 8)):\n     \\[\n     y - 8 = \\frac{13}{6}(x + 9) \\implies y = \\frac{13}{6}x + \\frac{13}{6} \\times 9 + 8\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{13}{6}x + \\frac{117}{6} + \\frac{48}{6} \\implies y = \\frac{13}{6}x + \\frac{165}{6} \\implies y = \\frac{13}{6}x + 27.5\n     \\]\n\n5. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes**:\n   - Solve the system of equations:\n     \\[\n     y = -x + 4\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{13}{6}x + 27.5\n     \\]\n   - Set the equations equal to each other:\n     \\[\n     -x + 4 = \\frac{13}{6}x + 27.5\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     4 - 27.5 = \\frac{13}{6}x + x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -23.5 = \\frac{19}{6}x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{-23.5 \\times 6}{19} = \\frac{-141}{19} = -7.421\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\(x = -7.421\\) back into \\(y = -x + 4\\):\n     \\[\n     y = -(-7.421) + 4 = 7.421 + 4 = 11.421\n     \\]\n\nThe orthocenter of triangle ABC is approximately \\((-7.421, 11.421)\\).\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<(-7.421, 11.421)>>>"
