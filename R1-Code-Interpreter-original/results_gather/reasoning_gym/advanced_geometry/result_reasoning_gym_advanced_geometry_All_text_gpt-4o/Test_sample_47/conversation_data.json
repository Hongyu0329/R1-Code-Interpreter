    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or the line containing the opposite side). Here are the steps to find the orthocenter for triangle ABC with vertices A=(4, 1), B=(9, -5), and C=(-3, -3).\n\n**Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.**\n\n- Slope of AB: \n  \\[\n  m_{AB} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{-5 - 1}{9 - 4} = \\frac{-6}{5}\n  \\]\n\n- Slope of BC: \n  \\[\n  m_{BC} = \\frac{-3 - (-5)}{-3 - 9} = \\frac{2}{-12} = -\\frac{1}{6}\n  \\]\n\n- Slope of CA: \n  \\[\n  m_{CA} = \\frac{1 - (-3)}{4 - (-3)} = \\frac{4}{7}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Find the slopes of the altitudes.**\n\nThe slope of an altitude is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the opposite side.\n\n- Altitude from A to BC:\n  \\[\n  m_{altitude\\ from\\ A} = -\\frac{1}{m_{BC}} = 6\n  \\]\n\n- Altitude from B to CA:\n  \\[\n  m_{altitude\\ from\\ B} = -\\frac{1}{m_{CA}} = -\\frac{7}{4}\n  \\]\n\n- Altitude from C to AB:\n  \\[\n  m_{altitude\\ from\\ C} = -\\frac{1}{m_{AB}} = \\frac{5}{6}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the equations of the altitudes.**\n\n- Equation of the altitude from A to BC:\n  Using point A (4, 1) and slope 6:\n  \\[\n  y - 1 = 6(x - 4) \\implies y = 6x - 24 + 1 \\implies y = 6x - 23\n  \\]\n\n- Equation of the altitude from B to CA:\n  Using point B (9, -5) and slope \\(-\\frac{7}{4}\\):\n  \\[\n  y + 5 = -\\frac{7}{4}(x - 9) \\implies y = -\\frac{7}{4}x + \\frac{63}{4} - 5\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{7}{4}x + \\frac{63}{4} - \\frac{20}{4} \\implies y = -\\frac{7}{4}x + \\frac{43}{4}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersection of the two altitudes.**\n\nSolve the system of equations:\n1. \\( y = 6x - 23 \\)\n2. \\( y = -\\frac{7}{4}x + \\frac{43}{4} \\)\n\nSet the equations equal to each other:\n\\[\n6x - 23 = -\\frac{7}{4}x + \\frac{43}{4}\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by 4 to clear the fraction:\n\\[\n24x - 92 = -7x + 43\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n24x + 7x = 43 + 92\n\\]\n\\[\n31x = 135\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{135}{31} \\approx 4.355\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 4.355\\) back into one of the altitude equations to find \\(y\\):\n\\[\ny = 6(4.355) - 23 \\approx 26.13 - 23 = 3.13\n\\]\n\nThus, the orthocenter of the triangle is approximately \\((4.355, 3.13)\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<(4.355, 3.130)>>>"
