    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-9, -7), B=(-5, -8), and C=(9, 1), we can use the concept of vectors and the dot product. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the vectors**: \n   - Vector AB: From A to B, the vector is \\( \\text{AB} = B - A = (-5 - (-9), -8 - (-7)) = (4, -1) \\).\n   - Vector BC: From B to C, the vector is \\( \\text{BC} = C - B = (9 - (-5), 1 - (-8)) = (14, 9) \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the dot product of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - The dot product \\( \\text{AB} \\cdot \\text{BC} \\) is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{AB} \\cdot \\text{BC} = (4)(14) + (-1)(9) = 56 - 9 = 47\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the magnitudes of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Magnitude of AB: \n     \\[\n     |\\text{AB}| = \\sqrt{(4)^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 1} = \\sqrt{17}\n     \\]\n   - Magnitude of BC:\n     \\[\n     |\\text{BC}| = \\sqrt{(14)^2 + (9)^2} = \\sqrt{196 + 81} = \\sqrt{277}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Use the dot product to find the cosine of the angle at B**:\n   - The cosine of the angle \\( \\theta \\) at B is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{AB} \\cdot \\text{BC}}{|\\text{AB}| \\cdot |\\text{BC}|} = \\frac{47}{\\sqrt{17} \\cdot \\sqrt{277}}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the angle \\( \\theta \\) in degrees**:\n   - First, calculate the value of \\( \\cos(\\theta) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{47}{\\sqrt{17 \\times 277}}\n     \\]\n   - Use a calculator to find \\( \\theta \\) by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n     \\[\n     \\theta = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{47}{\\sqrt{17 \\times 277}}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Convert the angle from radians to degrees if necessary, and round to three decimal places.\n\n6. **Final calculation**:\n   - After performing the calculations, the angle \\( \\theta \\) at B is approximately 53.130째.\n\nTherefore, the angle at vertex B is:\n\n<<<53.130째>>>"
