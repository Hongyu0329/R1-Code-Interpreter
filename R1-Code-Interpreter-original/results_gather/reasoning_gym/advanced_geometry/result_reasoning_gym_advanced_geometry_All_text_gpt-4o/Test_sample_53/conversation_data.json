    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side. Here are the steps to find the orthocenter for triangle ABC with vertices A = (9, -7), B = (0, -4), and C = (-3, 4).\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of BC: \n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{4 - (-4)}{-3 - 0} = \\frac{8}{-3} = -\\frac{8}{3}\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{4 - (-7)}{-3 - 9} = \\frac{11}{-12} = -\\frac{11}{12}\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AB:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{-4 - (-7)}{0 - 9} = \\frac{3}{-9} = -\\frac{1}{3}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from A} = \\frac{3}{8}\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from B} = \\frac{12}{11}\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from C} = 3\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - Equation of the altitude from A (using point A = (9, -7)):\n     \\[\n     y + 7 = \\frac{3}{8}(x - 9)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{3}{8}x - \\frac{27}{8} - 7 = \\frac{3}{8}x - \\frac{83}{8}\n     \\]\n\n   - Equation of the altitude from B (using point B = (0, -4)):\n     \\[\n     y + 4 = \\frac{12}{11}(x - 0)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{12}{11}x - 4\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{3}{8}x - \\frac{83}{8}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{12}{11}x - 4\n     \\]\n\n   Set the equations equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{8}x - \\frac{83}{8} = \\frac{12}{11}x - 4\n   \\]\n\n   Clear the fractions by multiplying through by 88 (LCM of 8 and 11):\n   \\[\n   33x - 913 = 96x - 352\n   \\]\n\n   Rearrange and solve for x:\n   \\[\n   33x - 96x = 913 - 352\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -63x = 561\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = -\\frac{561}{63} = -9\n   \\]\n\n   Substitute x = -9 into one of the altitude equations to find y:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{12}{11}(-9) - 4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = -\\frac{108}{11} - 4 = -\\frac{108}{11} - \\frac{44}{11} = -\\frac{152}{11} = -13.818\n   \\]\n\nThus, the orthocenter of the triangle is at the point \\((-9, -13.818)\\).\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<(-9, -13.818)>>>"
