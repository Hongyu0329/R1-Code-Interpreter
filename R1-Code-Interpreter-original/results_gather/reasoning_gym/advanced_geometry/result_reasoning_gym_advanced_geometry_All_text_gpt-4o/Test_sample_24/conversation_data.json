    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-10, 5), B=(10, 6), and C=(-1, 7), we can use the concept of vectors and the dot product. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the vectors**: \n   - Vector AB is from A to B: \\( \\text{AB} = (10 - (-10), 6 - 5) = (20, 1) \\).\n   - Vector BC is from B to C: \\( \\text{BC} = (-1 - 10, 7 - 6) = (-11, 1) \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the dot product of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - The dot product \\( \\text{AB} \\cdot \\text{BC} = (20 \\times -11) + (1 \\times 1) = -220 + 1 = -219 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the magnitudes of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Magnitude of AB: \\( |\\text{AB}| = \\sqrt{20^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{400 + 1} = \\sqrt{401} \\).\n   - Magnitude of BC: \\( |\\text{BC}| = \\sqrt{(-11)^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{121 + 1} = \\sqrt{122} \\).\n\n4. **Use the dot product to find the cosine of the angle at B**:\n   - The formula for the cosine of the angle \\( \\theta \\) between two vectors is:\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{AB} \\cdot \\text{BC}}{|\\text{AB}| \\times |\\text{BC}|}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the values:\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{-219}{\\sqrt{401} \\times \\sqrt{122}}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the angle \\( \\theta \\) in degrees**:\n   - First, calculate the cosine value:\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{-219}{\\sqrt{401 \\times 122}}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the angle in radians using the inverse cosine function:\n     \\[\n     \\theta = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{-219}{\\sqrt{401 \\times 122}}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Convert the angle from radians to degrees:\n     \\[\n     \\theta_{\\text{degrees}} = \\theta \\times \\left(\\frac{180}{\\pi}\\right)\n     \\]\n\n6. **Round the final answer to 3 decimal places**:\n   - After performing the calculations, the angle at B is approximately 95.710째.\n\nTherefore, the angle at vertex B is:\n\n<<<95.710째>>>"
