    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or its extension).\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (9, 1)\n- B = (-5, 7)\n- C = (9, -5)\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of BC: Since B = (-5, 7) and C = (9, -5), the slope \\( m_{BC} \\) is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     m_{BC} = \\frac{-5 - 7}{9 + 5} = \\frac{-12}{14} = -\\frac{6}{7}\n     \\]\n\n   - Slope of AC: Since A = (9, 1) and C = (9, -5), the slope \\( m_{AC} \\) is:\n     \\[\n     m_{AC} = \\frac{-5 - 1}{9 - 9} = \\text{undefined (vertical line)}\n     \\]\n\n   - Slope of AB: Since A = (9, 1) and B = (-5, 7), the slope \\( m_{AB} \\) is:\n     \\[\n     m_{AB} = \\frac{7 - 1}{-5 - 9} = \\frac{6}{-14} = -\\frac{3}{7}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - **Altitude from A to BC:**\n     - The slope of the altitude from A to BC is the negative reciprocal of \\( m_{BC} \\), which is \\( \\frac{7}{6} \\).\n     - Using point A (9, 1), the equation of the altitude is:\n       \\[\n       y - 1 = \\frac{7}{6}(x - 9)\n       \\]\n       Simplifying:\n       \\[\n       y = \\frac{7}{6}x - \\frac{63}{6} + 1 = \\frac{7}{6}x - \\frac{57}{6}\n       \\]\n\n   - **Altitude from B to AC:**\n     - Since AC is a vertical line, the altitude from B to AC is a horizontal line through B.\n     - The equation is simply:\n       \\[\n       y = 7\n       \\]\n\n   - **Altitude from C to AB:**\n     - The slope of the altitude from C to AB is the negative reciprocal of \\( m_{AB} \\), which is \\( \\frac{7}{3} \\).\n     - Using point C (9, -5), the equation of the altitude is:\n       \\[\n       y + 5 = \\frac{7}{3}(x - 9)\n       \\]\n       Simplifying:\n       \\[\n       y = \\frac{7}{3}x - 21 - 5 = \\frac{7}{3}x - 26\n       \\]\n\n3. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations for the altitudes from A to BC and B to AC:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{7}{6}x - \\frac{57}{6}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = 7\n     \\]\n   - Set the equations equal to find x:\n     \\[\n     7 = \\frac{7}{6}x - \\frac{57}{6}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     7 + \\frac{57}{6} = \\frac{7}{6}x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{42}{6} + \\frac{57}{6} = \\frac{7}{6}x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{99}{6} = \\frac{7}{6}x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{99}{7} = 14.142857\n     \\]\n     Rounding to three decimal places, \\( x = 14.143 \\).\n\n4. **Verify with the Third Altitude:**\n   - Check if this point satisfies the third altitude equation:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{7}{3}x - 26\n     \\]\n     Substitute \\( x = 14.143 \\):\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{7}{3}(14.143) - 26\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = 33.333 - 26 = 7.333\n     \\]\n     Rounding to three decimal places, \\( y = 7.333 \\).\n\nThe orthocenter is the intersection of the altitudes, which is approximately at the point (14.143, 7.333).\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<(14.143, 7.333)>>>"
