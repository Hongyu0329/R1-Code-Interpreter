    "To find the radius of the incircle of triangle ABC with vertices A=(4, -1), B=(-2, 5), and C=(-8, 2), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the side lengths of the triangle:**\n   - Use the distance formula to find the lengths of sides AB, BC, and CA.\n   - \\( AB = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = \\sqrt{(-2 - 4)^2 + (5 + 1)^2} = \\sqrt{(-6)^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2} \\)\n   - \\( BC = \\sqrt{(-8 + 2)^2 + (2 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{(-6)^2 + (-3)^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 9} = \\sqrt{45} = 3\\sqrt{5} \\)\n   - \\( CA = \\sqrt{(4 + 8)^2 + (-1 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{12^2 + (-3)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 9} = \\sqrt{153} \\)\n\n2. **Calculate the semi-perimeter (s) of the triangle:**\n   - The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) is given by \\( s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} \\).\n   - \\( s = \\frac{6\\sqrt{2} + 3\\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{153}}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the area (K) of the triangle:**\n   - Use Heron's formula: \\( K = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)} \\).\n   - First, calculate \\( s - AB \\), \\( s - BC \\), and \\( s - CA \\).\n   - Then, substitute these values into Heron's formula to find the area.\n\n4. **Calculate the radius (r) of the incircle:**\n   - The radius \\( r \\) of the incircle is given by \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\).\n\n5. **Round the radius to three decimal places:**\n   - After calculating the radius, round it to three decimal places as required.\n\nBy following these steps, we can find the radius of the incircle of triangle ABC.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the radius of the incircle is approximately 1.803.\n\n<<<1.803>>>"
