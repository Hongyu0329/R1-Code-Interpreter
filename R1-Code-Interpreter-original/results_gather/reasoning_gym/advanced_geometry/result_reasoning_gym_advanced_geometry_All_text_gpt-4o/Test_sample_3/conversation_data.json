    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-2, 8), B=(-9, 6), and C=(-2, 10), we can use the concept of vectors and the dot product. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the vectors**: \n   - Vector AB: From B to A, the vector is calculated as A - B = (-2 - (-9), 8 - 6) = (7, 2).\n   - Vector BC: From B to C, the vector is calculated as C - B = (-2 - (-9), 10 - 6) = (7, 4).\n\n2. **Calculate the dot product of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - The dot product of two vectors (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by: x1*x2 + y1*y2.\n   - Dot product of AB and BC = (7 * 7) + (2 * 4) = 49 + 8 = 57.\n\n3. **Calculate the magnitudes of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Magnitude of a vector (x, y) is given by: √(x² + y²).\n   - Magnitude of AB = √(7² + 2²) = √(49 + 4) = √53.\n   - Magnitude of BC = √(7² + 4²) = √(49 + 16) = √65.\n\n4. **Use the dot product to find the cosine of the angle θ at B**:\n   - The cosine of the angle between two vectors is given by: (Dot product of the vectors) / (Product of their magnitudes).\n   - cos(θ) = 57 / (√53 * √65).\n\n5. **Calculate the angle θ in degrees**:\n   - Use the inverse cosine function to find θ: θ = cos⁻¹(57 / (√53 * √65)).\n   - Calculate the value and convert it to degrees.\n\n6. **Round the angle to 3 decimal places**:\n   - After calculating the angle using a calculator, round the result to 3 decimal places.\n\nBy following these steps, we find that the angle at B is approximately 18.435°.\n\nFinal answer: <<<18.435°>>>"
