    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or the line containing the opposite side).\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-8, 5)\n- B = (8, 8)\n- C = (-1, 10)\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (8 - 5) / (8 + 8) = 3/16\\)\n   - Slope of BC: \\((10 - 8) / (-1 - 8) = 2 / -9 = -2/9\\)\n   - Slope of CA: \\((10 - 5) / (-1 + 8) = 5 / 7\\)\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB. The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB: \\(-16/3\\).\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC. The slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC: \\(9/2\\).\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to CA. The slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of CA: \\(-7/5\\).\n\n3. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - **Altitude from C:** Passes through C(-1, 10) with slope \\(-16/3\\).\n     - Equation: \\(y - 10 = -\\frac{16}{3}(x + 1)\\)\n     - Simplifying: \\(y = -\\frac{16}{3}x - \\frac{16}{3} + 10\\)\n     - \\(y = -\\frac{16}{3}x + \\frac{14}{3}\\)\n\n   - **Altitude from A:** Passes through A(-8, 5) with slope \\(9/2\\).\n     - Equation: \\(y - 5 = \\frac{9}{2}(x + 8)\\)\n     - Simplifying: \\(y = \\frac{9}{2}x + 36 + 5\\)\n     - \\(y = \\frac{9}{2}x + 41\\)\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Set the equations of the altitudes from C and A equal to find their intersection:\n     \\(-\\frac{16}{3}x + \\frac{14}{3} = \\frac{9}{2}x + 41\\)\n\n   - Clear fractions by multiplying through by 6:\n     \\(-32x + 28 = 27x + 246\\)\n\n   - Solve for x:\n     \\(-32x - 27x = 246 - 28\\)\n     \\(-59x = 218\\)\n     \\(x = -\\frac{218}{59} \\approx -3.695\\)\n\n   - Substitute x back into one of the altitude equations to find y:\n     \\(y = \\frac{9}{2}(-3.695) + 41\\)\n     \\(y \\approx -16.6275 + 41\\)\n     \\(y \\approx 24.3725\\)\n\n5. **Round the Coordinates:**\n   - The orthocenter is approximately \\((-3.695, 24.373)\\).\n\nThus, the orthocenter of the triangle is:\n\n<<<(-3.695, 24.373)>>>"
