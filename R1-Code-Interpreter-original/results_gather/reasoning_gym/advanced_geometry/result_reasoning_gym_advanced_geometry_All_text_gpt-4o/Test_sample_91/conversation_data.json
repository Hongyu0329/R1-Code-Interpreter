    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle with vertices A=(-2, -8), B=(3, -2), and C=(-7, -9), we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (-2 - (-8)) / (3 - (-2)) = 6 / 5\\)\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_3 - y_2) / (x_3 - x_2) = (-9 - (-2)) / (-7 - 3) = -7 / -10 = 7 / 10\\)\n   - Slope of CA: \\((y_3 - y_1) / (x_3 - x_1) = (-9 - (-8)) / (-7 - (-2)) = -1 / -5 = 1 / 5\\)\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC: \\(-10 / 7\\).\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to CA, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of CA: \\(-5 / 1 = -5\\).\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB: \\(-5 / 6\\).\n\n3. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - **Altitude from A:** \n     - Slope: \\(-10 / 7\\)\n     - Point: A(-2, -8)\n     - Equation: \\(y + 8 = (-10/7)(x + 2)\\)\n     - Simplifying: \\(y = (-10/7)x - 20/7 - 56/7 = (-10/7)x - 76/7\\)\n\n   - **Altitude from B:**\n     - Slope: \\(-5\\)\n     - Point: B(3, -2)\n     - Equation: \\(y + 2 = -5(x - 3)\\)\n     - Simplifying: \\(y = -5x + 15 - 2 = -5x + 13\\)\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations:\n     - \\(y = (-10/7)x - 76/7\\)\n     - \\(y = -5x + 13\\)\n\n   - Set the equations equal to each other:\n     \\((-10/7)x - 76/7 = -5x + 13\\)\n\n   - Clear fractions by multiplying through by 7:\n     \\(-10x - 76 = -35x + 91\\)\n\n   - Rearrange and solve for x:\n     \\(-10x + 35x = 91 + 76\\)\n     \\(25x = 167\\)\n     \\(x = 167 / 25 = 6.68\\)\n\n   - Substitute x back into one of the altitude equations to find y:\n     \\(y = -5(6.68) + 13\\)\n     \\(y = -33.4 + 13 = -20.4\\)\n\n5. **Round the Coordinates:**\n   - The orthocenter is approximately at (6.68, -20.4).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<(6.680, -20.400)>>>"
