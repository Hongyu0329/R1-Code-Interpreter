    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or its extension). Here are the steps to find the orthocenter for triangle ABC with vertices A = (7, 0), B = (-10, -8), and C = (6, 10).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (-8 - 0) / (-10 - 7) = -8 / -17 = 8/17\\)\n   - Slope of BC: \\((10 - (-8)) / (6 - (-10)) = 18 / 16 = 9/8\\)\n   - Slope of CA: \\((10 - 0) / (6 - 7) = 10 / -1 = -10\\)\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC. The slope of BC is 9/8, so the slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal: \\(-8/9\\).\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to CA. The slope of CA is -10, so the slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal: \\(1/10\\).\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB. The slope of AB is 8/17, so the slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal: \\(-17/8\\).\n\n3. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - **Altitude from A:** Passes through A (7, 0) with slope \\(-8/9\\).\n     - Equation: \\(y - 0 = -\\frac{8}{9}(x - 7)\\)\n     - Simplified: \\(y = -\\frac{8}{9}x + \\frac{56}{9}\\)\n\n   - **Altitude from B:** Passes through B (-10, -8) with slope \\(1/10\\).\n     - Equation: \\(y + 8 = \\frac{1}{10}(x + 10)\\)\n     - Simplified: \\(y = \\frac{1}{10}x - 7\\)\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations:\n     - \\(y = -\\frac{8}{9}x + \\frac{56}{9}\\)\n     - \\(y = \\frac{1}{10}x - 7\\)\n\n   - Set the equations equal to find x:\n     \\(-\\frac{8}{9}x + \\frac{56}{9} = \\frac{1}{10}x - 7\\)\n\n   - Clear fractions by multiplying through by 90:\n     \\(-80x + 560 = 9x - 630\\)\n\n   - Combine like terms:\n     \\(-80x - 9x = -630 - 560\\)\n     \\(-89x = -1190\\)\n\n   - Solve for x:\n     \\(x = \\frac{1190}{89} \\approx 13.371\\)\n\n   - Substitute x back into one of the equations to find y:\n     \\(y = \\frac{1}{10}(13.371) - 7\\)\n     \\(y \\approx 1.337 - 7 = -5.663\\)\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The orthocenter of the triangle is approximately at the point (13.371, -5.663).\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<(13.371, -5.663)>>>"
