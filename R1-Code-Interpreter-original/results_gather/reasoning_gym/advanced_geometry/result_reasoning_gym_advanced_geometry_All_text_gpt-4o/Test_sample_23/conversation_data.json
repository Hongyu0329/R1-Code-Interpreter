    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - **Slope of AB:** \n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{-8 - (-6)}{-1 - (-4)} = \\frac{-2}{3}\n     \\]\n   - **Slope of BC:** \n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{-1 - (-8)}{-5 - (-1)} = \\frac{7}{-4} = -\\frac{7}{4}\n     \\]\n   - **Slope of CA:** \n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } CA = \\frac{-6 - (-1)}{-4 - (-5)} = \\frac{-5}{1} = -5\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from A} = \\frac{4}{7}\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to CA, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of CA:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from B} = \\frac{1}{5}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - **Equation of the altitude from A:**\n     - Point A is (-4, -6) and the slope is \\(\\frac{4}{7}\\).\n     - Using point-slope form: \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\)\n     \\[\n     y + 6 = \\frac{4}{7}(x + 4)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{4}{7}x + \\frac{16}{7} - 6\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{4}{7}x - \\frac{26}{7}\n     \\]\n\n   - **Equation of the altitude from B:**\n     - Point B is (-1, -8) and the slope is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n     - Using point-slope form:\n     \\[\n     y + 8 = \\frac{1}{5}(x + 1)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{1}{5} - 8\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{1}{5}x - \\frac{39}{5}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of the Altitudes:**\n   - Set the equations of the altitudes equal to find the intersection point:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4}{7}x - \\frac{26}{7} = \\frac{1}{5}x - \\frac{39}{5}\n     \\]\n   - Clear fractions by multiplying through by 35 (LCM of 7 and 5):\n     \\[\n     20x - 130 = 7x - 273\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     13x = -143\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = -\\frac{143}{13} = -11\n     \\]\n\n   - Substitute \\(x = -11\\) back into one of the altitude equations to find \\(y\\):\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{1}{5}(-11) - \\frac{39}{5}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{39}{5} = -\\frac{50}{5} = -10\n     \\]\n\nThus, the coordinates of the orthocenter are \\((-11, -10)\\).\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<(-11, -10)>>>"
