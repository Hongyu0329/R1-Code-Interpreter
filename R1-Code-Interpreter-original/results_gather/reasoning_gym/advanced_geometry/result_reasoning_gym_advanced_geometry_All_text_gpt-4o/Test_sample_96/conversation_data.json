    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n**Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.**\n\n- **Slope of AB:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{-6 - 6}{1 - 2} = \\frac{-12}{-1} = 12\n  \\]\n\n- **Slope of BC:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{-10 - (-6)}{5 - 1} = \\frac{-4}{4} = -1\n  \\]\n\n- **Slope of CA:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } CA = \\frac{6 - (-10)}{2 - 5} = \\frac{16}{-3} = -\\frac{16}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Find the equations of the altitudes.**\n\n- **Altitude from A (perpendicular to BC):**\n  The slope of BC is -1, so the slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal, which is 1.\n  Using point A (2, 6), the equation of the altitude is:\n  \\[\n  y - 6 = 1(x - 2) \\implies y = x + 4\n  \\]\n\n- **Altitude from B (perpendicular to CA):**\n  The slope of CA is \\(-\\frac{16}{3}\\), so the slope of the altitude from B is \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\).\n  Using point B (1, -6), the equation of the altitude is:\n  \\[\n  y + 6 = \\frac{3}{16}(x - 1) \\implies y = \\frac{3}{16}x - \\frac{3}{16} - 6\n  \\]\n  Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{3}{16}x - \\frac{99}{16}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the intersection of the two altitudes.**\n\nSet the equations of the altitudes equal to find their intersection:\n\\[\nx + 4 = \\frac{3}{16}x - \\frac{99}{16}\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by 16 to clear the fraction:\n\\[\n16x + 64 = 3x - 99\n\\]\n\nRearrange and solve for x:\n\\[\n16x - 3x = -99 - 64 \\implies 13x = -163 \\implies x = -\\frac{163}{13} \\approx -12.538\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(x = -\\frac{163}{13}\\) into \\(y = x + 4\\):\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{163}{13} + 4 = -\\frac{163}{13} + \\frac{52}{13} = -\\frac{111}{13} \\approx -8.538\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe coordinates of the orthocenter of triangle ABC are approximately \\((-12.538, -8.538)\\).\n\n<<<(-12.538, -8.538)>>>"
