    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n**Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.**\n\n- **Slope of AB:**  \n  The formula for the slope between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\).  \n  For AB, the slope is \\((0 - 3) / (-7 - 1) = -3 / -8 = 3/8\\).\n\n- **Slope of BC:**  \n  For BC, the slope is \\((6 - 0) / (7 - (-7)) = 6 / 14 = 3/7\\).\n\n- **Slope of CA:**  \n  For CA, the slope is \\((6 - 3) / (7 - 1) = 3 / 6 = 1/2\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the equations of the altitudes.**\n\n- **Altitude from A (perpendicular to BC):**  \n  The slope of BC is \\(3/7\\), so the slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal, \\(-7/3\\).  \n  Using point A \\((1, 3)\\) and the slope \\(-7/3\\), the equation of the line is:  \n  \\(y - 3 = -\\frac{7}{3}(x - 1)\\).  \n  Simplifying, we get:  \n  \\(y = -\\frac{7}{3}x + \\frac{7}{3} + 3\\).  \n  \\(y = -\\frac{7}{3}x + \\frac{16}{3}\\).\n\n- **Altitude from B (perpendicular to CA):**  \n  The slope of CA is \\(1/2\\), so the slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal, \\(-2\\).  \n  Using point B \\((-7, 0)\\) and the slope \\(-2\\), the equation of the line is:  \n  \\(y - 0 = -2(x + 7)\\).  \n  Simplifying, we get:  \n  \\(y = -2x - 14\\).\n\n**Step 3: Find the intersection of the two altitudes.**\n\nTo find the orthocenter, solve the system of equations given by the two altitudes:\n\n1. \\(y = -\\frac{7}{3}x + \\frac{16}{3}\\)\n2. \\(y = -2x - 14\\)\n\nSet the equations equal to each other to find the x-coordinate:\n\n\\(-\\frac{7}{3}x + \\frac{16}{3} = -2x - 14\\)\n\nMultiply through by 3 to clear the fractions:\n\n\\(-7x + 16 = -6x - 42\\)\n\nRearrange to solve for x:\n\n\\(-7x + 6x = -42 - 16\\)\n\n\\(-x = -58\\)\n\n\\(x = 58\\)\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 58\\) back into one of the altitude equations to find y:\n\n\\(y = -2(58) - 14\\)\n\n\\(y = -116 - 14\\)\n\n\\(y = -130\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe coordinates of the orthocenter of triangle ABC are \\((58, -130)\\).\n\n<<<(58, -130)>>>"
