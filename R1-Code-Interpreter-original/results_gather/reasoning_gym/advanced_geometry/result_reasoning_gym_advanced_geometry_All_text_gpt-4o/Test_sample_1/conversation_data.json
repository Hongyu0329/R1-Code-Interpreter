    "To find the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with given coordinates, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Points:**\n   - A = (-5, 10)\n   - B = (-3, -2)\n   - C = (5, 10)\n\n2. **Calculate the Vectors:**\n   - Vector AB = B - A = (-3 - (-5), -2 - 10) = (2, -12)\n   - Vector BC = C - B = (5 - (-3), 10 - (-2)) = (8, 12)\n\n3. **Use the Dot Product to Find the Angle:**\n   - The dot product of vectors AB and BC is given by:\n     \\[\n     AB \\cdot BC = (2)(8) + (-12)(12) = 16 - 144 = -128\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Magnitudes of the Vectors:**\n   - Magnitude of AB = \\(\\sqrt{(2)^2 + (-12)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 144} = \\sqrt{148}\\)\n   - Magnitude of BC = \\(\\sqrt{(8)^2 + (12)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 144} = \\sqrt{208}\\)\n\n5. **Calculate the Cosine of the Angle:**\n   - Using the dot product formula:\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\angle ABC) = \\frac{AB \\cdot BC}{|AB| \\cdot |BC|} = \\frac{-128}{\\sqrt{148} \\cdot \\sqrt{208}}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the Angle:**\n   - First, calculate the product of the magnitudes:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{148} \\cdot \\sqrt{208} = \\sqrt{148 \\times 208}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the cosine:\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\angle ABC) = \\frac{-128}{\\sqrt{148 \\times 208}}\n     \\]\n   - Use a calculator to find the angle:\n     \\[\n     \\angle ABC = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{-128}{\\sqrt{148 \\times 208}}\\right)\n     \\]\n\n7. **Convert the Angle to Degrees:**\n   - Use a calculator to convert the angle from radians to degrees and round to three decimal places.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the measure of angle ABC is approximately:\n\n<<<118.610°>>>"
