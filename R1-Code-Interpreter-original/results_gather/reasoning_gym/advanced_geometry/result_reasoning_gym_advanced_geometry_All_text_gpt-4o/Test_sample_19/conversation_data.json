    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle with vertices A=(6, 7), B=(-5, -3), and C=(-3, 7), we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of BC: \n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{7 - (-3)}{-3 - (-5)} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{7 - 7}{-3 - 6} = \\frac{0}{-9} = 0\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AB:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{7 - (-3)}{6 - (-5)} = \\frac{10}{11}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from A} = -\\frac{1}{5}\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from B} = \\text{undefined (vertical line)}\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from C} = -\\frac{11}{10}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - Equation of the altitude from A (using point A(6, 7)):\n     \\[\n     y - 7 = -\\frac{1}{5}(x - 6)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{6}{5} + 7 = -\\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{41}{5}\n     \\]\n\n   - Equation of the altitude from B (vertical line through B(-5, -3)):\n     \\[\n     x = -5\n     \\]\n\n   - Equation of the altitude from C (using point C(-3, 7)):\n     \\[\n     y - 7 = -\\frac{11}{10}(x + 3)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{11}{10}x - \\frac{33}{10} + 7 = -\\frac{11}{10}x + \\frac{37}{10}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations for the altitudes from A and B:\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{41}{5}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = -5\n     \\]\n     Substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the equation for the altitude from A:\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{1}{5}(-5) + \\frac{41}{5} = 1 + \\frac{41}{5} = \\frac{46}{5} = 9.2\n     \\]\n\nThus, the orthocenter of the triangle is at the point \\((-5, 9.2)\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<(-5, 9.2)>>>"
