    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-10, -5)\n- B = (-7, -6)\n- C = (-7, -8)\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of BC: Since B and C have the same x-coordinate, BC is a vertical line. Therefore, the slope is undefined.\n   - Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (-8 - (-5)) / (-7 - (-10)) = (-3) / (3) = -1\\)\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (-6 - (-5)) / (-7 - (-10)) = (-1) / (3) = -1/3\\)\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - Altitude from A to BC: Since BC is vertical, the altitude from A to BC is horizontal. Therefore, the slope is 0.\n   - Altitude from B to AC: The slope of AC is -1, so the perpendicular slope (altitude from B) is the negative reciprocal, which is 1.\n   - Altitude from C to AB: The slope of AB is -1/3, so the perpendicular slope (altitude from C) is the negative reciprocal, which is 3.\n\n3. **Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - Altitude from A to BC: This is a horizontal line through A, so the equation is \\(y = -5\\).\n   - Altitude from B to AC: Using point B (-7, -6) and slope 1, the equation is \\(y + 6 = 1(x + 7)\\) or \\(y = x + 1\\).\n   - Altitude from C to AB: Using point C (-7, -8) and slope 3, the equation is \\(y + 8 = 3(x + 7)\\) or \\(y = 3x + 13\\).\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Intersection of \\(y = -5\\) and \\(y = x + 1\\):\n     - Set \\(y = -5\\) in \\(y = x + 1\\): \\(-5 = x + 1\\) gives \\(x = -6\\).\n     - So, the intersection point is \\((-6, -5)\\).\n\n5. **Verify with the Third Altitude:**\n   - Check if \\((-6, -5)\\) satisfies \\(y = 3x + 13\\):\n     - Substitute \\(x = -6\\) into \\(y = 3x + 13\\): \\(y = 3(-6) + 13 = -18 + 13 = -5\\).\n     - The point \\((-6, -5)\\) satisfies this equation.\n\nThus, the orthocenter of the triangle is \\((-6, -5)\\).\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<(-6, -5)>>>"
