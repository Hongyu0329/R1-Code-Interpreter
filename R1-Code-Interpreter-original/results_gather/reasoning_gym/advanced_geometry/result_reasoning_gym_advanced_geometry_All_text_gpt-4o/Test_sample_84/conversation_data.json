    "To find the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with given coordinates, we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the vectors**: \n   - Vector AB: From B to A, the vector is \\( \\text{AB} = (9 - (-1), 7 - (-10)) = (10, 17) \\).\n   - Vector BC: From B to C, the vector is \\( \\text{BC} = (10 - (-1), -7 - (-10)) = (11, 3) \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the dot product of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - The dot product \\( \\text{AB} \\cdot \\text{BC} = (10 \\times 11) + (17 \\times 3) = 110 + 51 = 161 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the magnitudes of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Magnitude of AB: \\( |\\text{AB}| = \\sqrt{10^2 + 17^2} = \\sqrt{100 + 289} = \\sqrt{389} \\).\n   - Magnitude of BC: \\( |\\text{BC}| = \\sqrt{11^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{121 + 9} = \\sqrt{130} \\).\n\n4. **Use the dot product to find the cosine of angle ABC**:\n   - The formula for the cosine of the angle between two vectors is:\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\angle ABC) = \\frac{\\text{AB} \\cdot \\text{BC}}{|\\text{AB}| \\times |\\text{BC}|}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the values:\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\angle ABC) = \\frac{161}{\\sqrt{389} \\times \\sqrt{130}}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the angle ABC**:\n   - First, calculate the product of the magnitudes:\n     \\[\n     |\\text{AB}| \\times |\\text{BC}| = \\sqrt{389} \\times \\sqrt{130} = \\sqrt{389 \\times 130}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the cosine value:\n     \\[\n     \\cos(\\angle ABC) = \\frac{161}{\\sqrt{50570}}\n     \\]\n   - Use a calculator to find the angle:\n     \\[\n     \\angle ABC = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{161}{\\sqrt{50570}}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the angle in degrees and round to three decimal places.\n\n6. **Final calculation**:\n   - Using a calculator, find the angle:\n     \\[\n     \\angle ABC \\approx 73.739^\\circ\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle ABC is:\n\n<<<73.739°>>>"
