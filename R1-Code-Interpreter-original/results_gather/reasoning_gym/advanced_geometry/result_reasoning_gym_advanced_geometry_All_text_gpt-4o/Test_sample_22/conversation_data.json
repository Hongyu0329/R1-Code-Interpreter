    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n**Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.**\n\n- **Slope of AB**:  \n  The slope of a line through two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\).  \n  For AB, the slope is \\((5 - 7) / (-1 - 4) = -2 / -5 = 2/5\\).\n\n- **Slope of BC**:  \n  For BC, the slope is \\((2 - 5) / (5 - (-1)) = -3 / 6 = -1/2\\).\n\n- **Slope of CA**:  \n  For CA, the slope is \\((2 - 7) / (5 - 4) = -5 / 1 = -5\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the slopes of the altitudes.**\n\nThe slope of an altitude is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the side it is perpendicular to.\n\n- **Altitude from C to AB**:  \n  The slope of AB is \\(2/5\\), so the slope of the altitude from C is \\(-5/2\\).\n\n- **Altitude from A to BC**:  \n  The slope of BC is \\(-1/2\\), so the slope of the altitude from A is \\(2\\).\n\n- **Altitude from B to CA**:  \n  The slope of CA is \\(-5\\), so the slope of the altitude from B is \\(1/5\\).\n\n**Step 3: Find the equations of the altitudes.**\n\n- **Equation of the altitude from C to AB**:  \n  The point C is \\((5, 2)\\) and the slope is \\(-5/2\\).  \n  Using the point-slope form \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), we have:  \n  \\(y - 2 = -\\frac{5}{2}(x - 5)\\).  \n  Simplifying, \\(y = -\\frac{5}{2}x + \\frac{25}{2} + 2\\).  \n  \\(y = -\\frac{5}{2}x + \\frac{29}{2}\\).\n\n- **Equation of the altitude from A to BC**:  \n  The point A is \\((4, 7)\\) and the slope is \\(2\\).  \n  \\(y - 7 = 2(x - 4)\\).  \n  Simplifying, \\(y = 2x - 8 + 7\\).  \n  \\(y = 2x - 1\\).\n\n- **Equation of the altitude from B to CA**:  \n  The point B is \\((-1, 5)\\) and the slope is \\(1/5\\).  \n  \\(y - 5 = \\frac{1}{5}(x + 1)\\).  \n  Simplifying, \\(y = \\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{1}{5} + 5\\).  \n  \\(y = \\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{26}{5}\\).\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersection of two altitudes.**\n\nWe can find the orthocenter by solving the system of equations for any two altitudes. Let's use the altitudes from C and A.\n\n- **Equations**:  \n  \\(y = -\\frac{5}{2}x + \\frac{29}{2}\\)  \n  \\(y = 2x - 1\\)\n\nSet the equations equal to each other:  \n\\(-\\frac{5}{2}x + \\frac{29}{2} = 2x - 1\\).\n\nSolve for \\(x\\):  \n\\(-\\frac{5}{2}x - 2x = -1 - \\frac{29}{2}\\)  \n\\(-\\frac{9}{2}x = -\\frac{31}{2}\\)  \n\\(x = \\frac{31}{9}\\).\n\nSubstitute \\(x = \\frac{31}{9}\\) into \\(y = 2x - 1\\):  \n\\(y = 2(\\frac{31}{9}) - 1\\)  \n\\(y = \\frac{62}{9} - \\frac{9}{9}\\)  \n\\(y = \\frac{53}{9}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe orthocenter of triangle ABC is \\((\\frac{31}{9}, \\frac{53}{9})\\).\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the coordinates are approximately \\((3.444, 5.889)\\).\n\n<<<(3.444, 5.889)>>>"
