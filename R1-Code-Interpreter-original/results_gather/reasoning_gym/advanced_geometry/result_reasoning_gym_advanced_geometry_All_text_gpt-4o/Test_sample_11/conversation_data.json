    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or its extension).\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-1, -6)\n- B = (4, 1)\n- C = (-7, 4)\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of BC: \n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{4 - 1}{-7 - 4} = \\frac{3}{-11} = -\\frac{3}{11}\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{4 - (-6)}{-7 - (-1)} = \\frac{10}{-6} = -\\frac{5}{3}\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AB:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{1 - (-6)}{4 - (-1)} = \\frac{7}{5}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from A} = \\frac{11}{3}\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from B} = \\frac{3}{5}\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from C} = -\\frac{5}{7}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - Equation of the altitude from A:\n     \\[\n     y + 6 = \\frac{11}{3}(x + 1)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{11}{3}x + \\frac{11}{3} - 6 = \\frac{11}{3}x - \\frac{7}{3}\n     \\]\n\n   - Equation of the altitude from B:\n     \\[\n     y - 1 = \\frac{3}{5}(x - 4)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{12}{5} + 1 = \\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{7}{5}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Set the equations of the altitudes from A and B equal to find their intersection:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{11}{3}x - \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{7}{5}\n     \\]\n     Clear the fractions by multiplying through by 15:\n     \\[\n     55x - 35 = 9x - 21\n     \\]\n     Solving for x:\n     \\[\n     46x = 14 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{14}{46} = \\frac{7}{23}\n     \\]\n\n   - Substitute \\(x = \\frac{7}{23}\\) back into one of the altitude equations to find y:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{11}{3} \\times \\frac{7}{23} - \\frac{7}{3}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{77}{69} - \\frac{161}{69} = -\\frac{84}{69} = -\\frac{28}{23}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   The orthocenter of the triangle is at the point \\(\\left(\\frac{7}{23}, -\\frac{28}{23}\\right)\\).\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the orthocenter is:\n\\[\n\\left(0.304, -1.217\\right)\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(0.304, -1.217)>>>"
