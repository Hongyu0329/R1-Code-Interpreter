    "To find the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with given coordinates, we can use the concept of vectors and the dot product. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Points:**\n   - A = (4, 0)\n   - B = (7, 7)\n   - C = (2, 5)\n\n2. **Determine Vectors:**\n   - Vector AB = B - A = (7 - 4, 7 - 0) = (3, 7)\n   - Vector BC = C - B = (2 - 7, 5 - 7) = (-5, -2)\n\n3. **Calculate the Dot Product of Vectors AB and BC:**\n   - Dot product, AB · BC = (3)(-5) + (7)(-2) = -15 - 14 = -29\n\n4. **Calculate the Magnitudes of Vectors AB and BC:**\n   - Magnitude of AB = √((3)^2 + (7)^2) = √(9 + 49) = √58\n   - Magnitude of BC = √((-5)^2 + (-2)^2) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n\n5. **Use the Dot Product to Find the Cosine of Angle ABC:**\n   - cos(∠ABC) = (AB · BC) / (|AB| * |BC|)\n   - cos(∠ABC) = -29 / (√58 * √29)\n\n6. **Calculate the Angle Using the Inverse Cosine Function:**\n   - ∠ABC = cos⁻¹(-29 / (√58 * √29))\n\n7. **Convert the Angle from Radians to Degrees:**\n   - Use a calculator to find the angle in degrees.\n   - ∠ABC ≈ 118.072°\n\n8. **Round the Angle to Three Decimal Places:**\n   - ∠ABC = 118.072°\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle ABC is:\n\n<<<118.072°>>>"
