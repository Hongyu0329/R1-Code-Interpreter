    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle with vertices A=(9, 8), B=(8, -7), and C=(-10, -10), we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of BC: \n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{-10 - (-7)}{-10 - 8} = \\frac{-3}{-18} = \\frac{1}{6}\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{-10 - 8}{-10 - 9} = \\frac{-18}{-19} = \\frac{18}{19}\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AB:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{-7 - 8}{8 - 9} = \\frac{-15}{-1} = 15\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the Slopes of the Altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from A} = -6\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from B} = -\\frac{19}{18}\n     \\]\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of altitude from C} = -\\frac{1}{15}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - Equation of the altitude from A:\n     \\[\n     y - 8 = -6(x - 9) \\implies y = -6x + 54 + 8 \\implies y = -6x + 62\n     \\]\n   - Equation of the altitude from B:\n     \\[\n     y + 7 = -\\frac{19}{18}(x - 8) \\implies y = -\\frac{19}{18}x + \\frac{152}{18} - 7 \\implies y = -\\frac{19}{18}x + \\frac{26}{18}\n     \\]\n   - Equation of the altitude from C:\n     \\[\n     y + 10 = -\\frac{1}{15}(x + 10) \\implies y = -\\frac{1}{15}x - \\frac{10}{15} - 10 \\implies y = -\\frac{1}{15}x - \\frac{160}{15}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the Intersection of Two Altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations for the altitudes from A and B:\n     \\[\n     y = -6x + 62\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{19}{18}x + \\frac{26}{18}\n     \\]\n   - Set the equations equal to each other:\n     \\[\n     -6x + 62 = -\\frac{19}{18}x + \\frac{26}{18}\n     \\]\n   - Solve for x:\n     \\[\n     -6x + \\frac{19}{18}x = \\frac{26}{18} - 62\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -\\frac{108}{18}x + \\frac{19}{18}x = \\frac{26}{18} - \\frac{1116}{18}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -\\frac{89}{18}x = -\\frac{1090}{18}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{1090}{89} \\approx 12.247\n     \\]\n   - Substitute x back into one of the altitude equations to find y:\n     \\[\n     y = -6(12.247) + 62 \\approx -73.482 + 62 \\approx -11.482\n     \\]\n\nThus, the orthocenter of the triangle is approximately at the coordinates (12.247, -11.482).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<(12.247, -11.482)>>>"
