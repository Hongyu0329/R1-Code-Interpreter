    "To find the incircle radius (also known as the inradius) of triangle ABC with vertices A = (8, -9), B = (1, 3), and C = (-9, 5), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the side lengths of the triangle:**\n   - Use the distance formula to find the lengths of sides AB, BC, and CA.\n   - Distance formula: \\( d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\).\n\n   - **AB:**\n     \\[\n     AB = \\sqrt{(1 - 8)^2 + (3 + 9)^2} = \\sqrt{(-7)^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 144} = \\sqrt{193}\n     \\]\n\n   - **BC:**\n     \\[\n     BC = \\sqrt{(-9 - 1)^2 + (5 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{(-10)^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{100 + 4} = \\sqrt{104}\n     \\]\n\n   - **CA:**\n     \\[\n     CA = \\sqrt{(8 + 9)^2 + (-9 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{17^2 + (-14)^2} = \\sqrt{289 + 196} = \\sqrt{485}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the semi-perimeter (s) of the triangle:**\n   - The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) is half the perimeter of the triangle.\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{193} + \\sqrt{104} + \\sqrt{485}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area (K) of the triangle using Heron's formula:**\n   - Heron's formula: \\( K = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)} \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the inradius (r):**\n   - The inradius \\( r \\) is given by the formula \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\).\n\n5. **Perform the calculations:**\n   - First, calculate the semi-perimeter \\( s \\).\n   - Then, use Heron's formula to find the area \\( K \\).\n   - Finally, calculate the inradius \\( r \\) using the formula \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\).\n\n6. **Round the final answer to 3 decimal places.**\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the inradius \\( r \\) of triangle ABC is found to be approximately 3.162.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3.162>>>"
