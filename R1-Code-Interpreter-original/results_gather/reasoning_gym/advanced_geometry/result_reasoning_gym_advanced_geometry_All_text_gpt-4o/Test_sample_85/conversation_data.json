    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-5, -5)\n- B = (-4, 2)\n- C = (-5, 7)\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Find the Slopes of the Sides:**\n   - Slope of BC: \n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{7 - 2}{-5 - (-4)} = \\frac{5}{-1} = -5\n     \\]\n   - Slope of AC:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{7 - (-5)}{-5 - (-5)} = \\frac{12}{0} \n     \\]\n     Since the denominator is zero, AC is a vertical line, and its slope is undefined.\n   - Slope of AB:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{2 - (-5)}{-4 - (-5)} = \\frac{7}{1} = 7\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the Equations of the Altitudes:**\n   - **Altitude from A to BC:**\n     - The slope of BC is -5, so the slope of the altitude from A (perpendicular to BC) is the negative reciprocal, which is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n     - Using point A (-5, -5) and the slope \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\), the equation of the altitude is:\n       \\[\n       y + 5 = \\frac{1}{5}(x + 5)\n       \\]\n       Simplifying:\n       \\[\n       y = \\frac{1}{5}x + 1 - 5\n       \\]\n       \\[\n       y = \\frac{1}{5}x - 4\n       \\]\n\n   - **Altitude from B to AC:**\n     - AC is a vertical line, so the altitude from B to AC is a horizontal line through B.\n     - The equation of the horizontal line through B (-4, 2) is:\n       \\[\n       y = 2\n       \\]\n\n   - **Altitude from C to AB:**\n     - The slope of AB is 7, so the slope of the altitude from C (perpendicular to AB) is the negative reciprocal, which is \\(-\\frac{1}{7}\\).\n     - Using point C (-5, 7) and the slope \\(-\\frac{1}{7}\\), the equation of the altitude is:\n       \\[\n       y - 7 = -\\frac{1}{7}(x + 5)\n       \\]\n       Simplifying:\n       \\[\n       y = -\\frac{1}{7}x - \\frac{5}{7} + 7\n       \\]\n       \\[\n       y = -\\frac{1}{7}x + \\frac{49}{7} - \\frac{5}{7}\n       \\]\n       \\[\n       y = -\\frac{1}{7}x + \\frac{44}{7}\n       \\]\n\n3. **Find the Intersection of the Altitudes:**\n   - **Intersection of Altitude from A and Altitude from B:**\n     - Set the equations \\(y = \\frac{1}{5}x - 4\\) and \\(y = 2\\) equal:\n       \\[\n       2 = \\frac{1}{5}x - 4\n       \\]\n       \\[\n       6 = \\frac{1}{5}x\n       \\]\n       \\[\n       x = 30\n       \\]\n     - So, the intersection point is (30, 2).\n\n4. **Verify with the Third Altitude:**\n   - Check if (30, 2) satisfies the equation of the altitude from C:\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{1}{7}x + \\frac{44}{7}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2 = -\\frac{1}{7}(30) + \\frac{44}{7}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2 = -\\frac{30}{7} + \\frac{44}{7}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2 = \\frac{14}{7} = 2\n     \\]\n   - The point (30, 2) satisfies the equation, confirming it is the orthocenter.\n\nThe orthocenter of the triangle is at the point (30, 2).\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<(30, 2)>>>"
