    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n**Step 1: Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.**\n\n- **Slope of AB:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{4 - 3}{-3 + 1} = \\frac{1}{-2} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Slope of BC:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{-2 - 4}{-1 + 3} = \\frac{-6}{2} = -3\n  \\]\n\n- **Slope of CA:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{slope of } CA = \\frac{-2 - 3}{-1 + 1} = \\frac{-5}{0}\n  \\]\n  The slope of CA is undefined, indicating that CA is a vertical line.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equations of the altitudes.**\n\n- **Altitude from A (perpendicular to BC):**\n  The slope of BC is -3, so the slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal, \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n  Using point A(-1, 3), the equation of the altitude is:\n  \\[\n  y - 3 = \\frac{1}{3}(x + 1)\n  \\]\n  Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{1}{3} + 3 = \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{10}{3}\n  \\]\n\n- **Altitude from B (perpendicular to CA):**\n  Since CA is vertical, the altitude from B is horizontal, having a slope of 0.\n  The equation of the altitude is:\n  \\[\n  y = 4\n  \\]\n\n- **Altitude from C (perpendicular to AB):**\n  The slope of AB is \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\), so the slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal, 2.\n  Using point C(-1, -2), the equation of the altitude is:\n  \\[\n  y + 2 = 2(x + 1)\n  \\]\n  Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  y = 2x + 2 - 2 = 2x\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the intersection of the altitudes.**\n\n- **Intersection of the altitudes from A and B:**\n  Solve the system of equations:\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{10}{3}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = 4\n  \\]\n  Set the equations equal to each other:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{10}{3} = 4\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{3}x = 4 - \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{12}{3} - \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x = 2\n  \\]\n  So, the intersection point is (2, 4).\n\n- **Verify with the altitude from C:**\n  Substitute x = 2 into the equation of the altitude from C:\n  \\[\n  y = 2(2) = 4\n  \\]\n  The point (2, 4) satisfies the equation, confirming it is the orthocenter.\n\nThe coordinates of the orthocenter of triangle ABC are (2, 4).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<(2, 4)>>>"
