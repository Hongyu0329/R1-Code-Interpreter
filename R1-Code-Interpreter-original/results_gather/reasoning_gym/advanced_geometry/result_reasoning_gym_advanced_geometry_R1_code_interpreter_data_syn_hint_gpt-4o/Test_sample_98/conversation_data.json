    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(3, -2), B=(4, 10), and C=(4, -10), we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The angle θ between two vectors u and v can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{u \\cdot v}{\\|u\\| \\|v\\|} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( u \\cdot v \\) is the dot product of vectors u and v.\n- \\( \\|u\\| \\) and \\( \\|v\\| \\) are the magnitudes of vectors u and v, respectively.\n\nFirst, we need to find the vectors AB and BC:\n- Vector AB = B - A = (4 - 3, 10 - (-2)) = (1, 12)\n- Vector BC = C - B = (4 - 4, -10 - 10) = (0, -20)\n\nNext, we calculate the dot product of AB and BC:\n\\[ AB \\cdot BC = (1 \\cdot 0) + (12 \\cdot -20) = 0 - 240 = -240 \\]\n\nNow, we find the magnitudes of AB and BC:\n- \\( \\|AB\\| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 144} = \\sqrt{145} \\)\n- \\( \\|BC\\| = \\sqrt{0^2 + (-20)^2} = \\sqrt{400} = 20 \\)\n\nUsing the dot product and magnitudes, we can find the cosine of the angle:\n\\[ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{-240}{\\sqrt{145} \\times 20} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the angle θ in degrees using the arccosine function and convert it to degrees.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Vectors AB and BC\nAB = (1, 12)\nBC = (0, -20)\n\n# Dot product of AB and BC\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Magnitudes of AB and BC\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Cosine of the angle\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Angle in radians\ntheta_radians = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert to degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(theta_radians)\n\n# Round to 3 decimal places\ntheta_degrees_rounded = round(theta_degrees, 3)\n\nprint(theta_degrees_rounded)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the angle at vertex B in degrees.",
    "The angle at vertex B seems to be incorrect based on the code execution result. Let's re-evaluate the process and ensure the calculations are correct.\n\nThe vectors and their calculations were correct, but let's verify the steps and ensure the correct use of the arccosine function and conversion to degrees.\n\n1. **Vectors Calculation:**\n   - Vector AB = (1, 12)\n   - Vector BC = (0, -20)\n\n2. **Dot Product:**\n   - \\( AB \\cdot BC = 1 \\times 0 + 12 \\times (-20) = -240 \\)\n\n3. **Magnitudes:**\n   - \\( \\|AB\\| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{145} \\)\n   - \\( \\|BC\\| = \\sqrt{0^2 + (-20)^2} = 20 \\)\n\n4. **Cosine of the Angle:**\n   - \\( \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{-240}{\\sqrt{145} \\times 20} \\)\n\n5. **Angle Calculation:**\n   - Use the arccosine function to find the angle in radians.\n   - Convert the angle from radians to degrees.\n\nLet's ensure the calculations are correct by re-evaluating the code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Vectors AB and BC\nAB = (1, 12)\nBC = (0, -20)\n\n# Dot product of AB and BC\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Magnitudes of AB and BC\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Cosine of the angle\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Angle in radians\ntheta_radians = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert to degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(theta_radians)\n\n# Round to 3 decimal places\ntheta_degrees_rounded = round(theta_degrees, 3)\n\nprint(theta_degrees_rounded)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the correct angle at vertex B.",
    "The angle at vertex B seems to be incorrect, and the result is not as expected. Let's re-evaluate the approach and calculations.\n\nGiven the vertices A=(3, -2), B=(4, 10), and C=(4, -10), we need to find the angle at B. The vectors AB and BC are calculated correctly, but the result seems off.

The result of 175.236° seems to be correct, as it is within this range. However, let's verify the calculations again to ensure accuracy.\n\nThe angle at B is indeed correct based on the calculations. The angle is obtuse, which is consistent with the geometry of the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the angle at vertex B is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>> 175.236°"
