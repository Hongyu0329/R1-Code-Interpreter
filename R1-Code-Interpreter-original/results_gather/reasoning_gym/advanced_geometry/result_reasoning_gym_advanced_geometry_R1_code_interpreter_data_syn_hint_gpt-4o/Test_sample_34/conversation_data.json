    "To find the orthocenter of triangle ABC, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. The altitudes are the perpendicular lines from each vertex to the opposite side.\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides:**\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (4 - 3) / (-3 + 1) = 1 / -2 = -0.5\\)\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (-2 - 4) / (-1 + 3) = -6 / 2 = -3\\)\n   - Slope of CA: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (-2 - 3) / (-1 + 1) = -5 / 0\\), which is undefined (vertical line).\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from C to AB is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of -0.5, which is 2.\n   - The altitude from A to BC is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of -3, which is 1/3.\n   - The altitude from B to CA is perpendicular to CA, which is a vertical line, so the altitude is a horizontal line with slope 0.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - **Altitude from C to AB:** Passes through C(-1, -2) with slope 2.\n     Equation: \\(y + 2 = 2(x + 1)\\) or \\(y = 2x\\)\n   - **Altitude from A to BC:** Passes through A(-1, 3) with slope 1/3.\n     Equation: \\(y - 3 = \\frac{1}{3}(x + 1)\\) or \\(y = \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{10}{3}\\)\n   - **Altitude from B to CA:** Passes through B(-3, 4) with slope 0.\n     Equation: \\(y = 4\\)\n\n4. **Find the intersection of the altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations for the altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's solve these equations using Python to find the intersection point.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equations of the altitudes\neq1 = Eq(y, 2*x)  # Altitude from C to AB\neq2 = Eq(y, (1/3)*x + 10/3)  # Altitude from A to BC\neq3 = Eq(y, 4)  # Altitude from B to CA\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nintersection1 = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\nintersection2 = solve((eq1, eq3), (x, y))\nintersection3 = solve((eq2, eq3), (x, y))\n\n# Print the intersection points\nprint(intersection1)\nprint(intersection2)\nprint(intersection3)\n```\n\nThe code will find the intersection points of the altitudes, and the common intersection point will be the orthocenter of the triangle.",
    "The code execution results indicate that the intersection point of the altitudes is consistently at the coordinates (2, 4). This suggests that the orthocenter of the triangle ABC is at this point. \n\nThe errors mentioned do not affect the correctness of the result, as the intersection points are consistent across different pairs of altitude equations. Therefore, the orthocenter of the triangle is indeed at (2, 4).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n(2, 4)\n<<<answer>>>"
