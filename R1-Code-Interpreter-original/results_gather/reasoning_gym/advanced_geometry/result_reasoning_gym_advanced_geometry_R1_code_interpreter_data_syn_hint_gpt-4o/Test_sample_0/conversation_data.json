    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle given its vertices, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of triangle ABC:\n- A = (-4, -6)\n- B = (-1, -3)\n- C = (5, -10)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes, which are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides.\n3. Find the equations of the altitudes.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's start by calculating the slopes of the sides:\n\n- Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\nThen, we find the slopes of the altitudes:\n\n- Altitude from A is perpendicular to BC.\n- Altitude from B is perpendicular to AC.\n- Altitude from C is perpendicular to AB.\n\nFinally, we solve the system of equations formed by the altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-4, -6)\nB = (-1, -3)\nC = (5, -10)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equations of the altitudes\n# Altitude from A: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n# Altitude from B: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n# Altitude from C: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\n# Altitude from A\nintercept_A = A[1] - slope_altitude_A * A[0]\n\n# Altitude from B\nintercept_B = B[1] - slope_altitude_B * B[0]\n\n# Solve the system of equations for the intersection of two altitudes\n# y = slope_altitude_A * x + intercept_A\n# y = slope_altitude_B * x + intercept_B\n\n# Solving for x\nx_orthocenter = (intercept_B - intercept_A) / (slope_altitude_A - slope_altitude_B)\ny_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + intercept_A\n\n# Round the coordinates to 3 decimal places\nx_orthocenter = round(x_orthocenter, 3)\ny_orthocenter = round(y_orthocenter, 3)\n\nprint((x_orthocenter, y_orthocenter))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of two altitudes.
