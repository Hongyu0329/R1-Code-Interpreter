    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side. \n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-8, 5)\n- B = (8, 8)\n- C = (-1, 10)\n\nWe will find the equations of two altitudes and then solve for their intersection point.\n\n1. **Find the slope of line BC**:\n   - The slope \\( m_{BC} \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     m_{BC} = \\frac{y_C - y_B}{x_C - x_B} = \\frac{10 - 8}{-1 - 8} = \\frac{2}{-9} = -\\frac{2}{9}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the slope of the altitude from A**:\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope \\( m_{A} \\) is the negative reciprocal of \\( m_{BC} \\):\n     \\[\n     m_{A} = \\frac{9}{2}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Equation of the altitude from A**:\n   - Using point-slope form \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\) with point A(-8, 5):\n     \\[\n     y - 5 = \\frac{9}{2}(x + 8)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the slope of line AC**:\n   - The slope \\( m_{AC} \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     m_{AC} = \\frac{y_C - y_A}{x_C - x_A} = \\frac{10 - 5}{-1 + 8} = \\frac{5}{7}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Find the slope of the altitude from B**:\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope \\( m_{B} \\) is the negative reciprocal of \\( m_{AC} \\):\n     \\[\n     m_{B} = -\\frac{7}{5}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Equation of the altitude from B**:\n   - Using point-slope form with point B(8, 8):\n     \\[\n     y - 8 = -\\frac{7}{5}(x - 8)\n     \\]\n\nNow, we will solve these two equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A\neq1 = Eq(y - 5, (9/2)*(x + 8))\n\n# Equation of the altitude from B\neq2 = Eq(y - 8, (-7/5)*(x - 8))\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter = (round(solution[x], 3), round(solution[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
    "The code execution result provides the coordinates of the orthocenter as (-3.695, 24.373). This result is obtained by solving the system of equations representing the altitudes from vertices A and B.\n\nThe process involved:\n1. Calculating the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determining the slopes of the altitudes, which are perpendicular to the sides.\n3. Formulating the equations of the altitudes using the point-slope form.\n4. Solving the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nThe calculated orthocenter coordinates are rounded to three decimal places as required.\n\nTherefore, the orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A=(-8, 5), B=(8, 8), and C=(-1, 10) is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n(-3.695, 24.373)\n<<<answer>>>"
