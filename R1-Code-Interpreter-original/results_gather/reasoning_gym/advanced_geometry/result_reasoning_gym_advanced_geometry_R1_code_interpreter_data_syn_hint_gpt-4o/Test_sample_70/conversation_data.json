    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or its extension).\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (9, 1)\n- B = (-5, 7)\n- C = (9, -5)\n\nLet's determine the equations of the altitudes:\n\n1. **Altitude from A to BC:**\n   - The line BC is vertical (since B and C have the same x-coordinate), so the altitude from A to BC is horizontal.\n   - The y-coordinate of A is 1, so the equation of the altitude from A is y = 1.\n\n2. **Altitude from B to AC:**\n   - The slope of line AC is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of AC} = \\frac{-5 - 1}{9 - 9} = \\text{undefined (vertical line)}\n     \\]\n   - Since AC is vertical, the altitude from B to AC is horizontal, passing through B.\n   - The y-coordinate of B is 7, so the equation of the altitude from B is y = 7.\n\n3. **Altitude from C to AB:**\n   - The slope of line AB is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{slope of AB} = \\frac{7 - 1}{-5 - 9} = \\frac{6}{-14} = -\\frac{3}{7}\n     \\]\n   - The perpendicular slope (altitude from C) is the negative reciprocal, which is \\(\\frac{7}{3}\\).\n   - Using point C (9, -5) and the slope \\(\\frac{7}{3}\\), the equation of the altitude is:\n     \\[\n     y + 5 = \\frac{7}{3}(x - 9)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{7}{3}x - 21 - 5 = \\frac{7}{3}x - 26\n     \\]\n\nNow, we find the intersection of the altitudes:\n- Intersection of y = 1 and y = 7 is not possible since they are parallel.\n- Intersection of y = 1 and \\(y = \\frac{7}{3}x - 26\\).\n\nLet's solve for the intersection point using these equations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from C\naltitude_C = Eq(y, (7/3)*x - 26)\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A\naltitude_A = Eq(y, 1)\n\n# Solve for the intersection\nintersection = solve((altitude_C, altitude_A), (x, y))\nprint(intersection)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter of the triangle.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the intersection point of the altitudes is approximately \\(x = 11.571\\) and \\(y = 1.000\\). This point is the orthocenter of the triangle.\n\nThe process involved:\n1. Calculating the equations of the altitudes from each vertex.\n2. Solving for the intersection of these altitudes.\n\nThe orthocenter is the point where these altitudes intersect. Given the calculations and the code execution, the orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A = (9, 1), B = (-5, 7), and C = (9, -5) is approximately:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n(11.571, 1.000)\n<<<answer>>>"
