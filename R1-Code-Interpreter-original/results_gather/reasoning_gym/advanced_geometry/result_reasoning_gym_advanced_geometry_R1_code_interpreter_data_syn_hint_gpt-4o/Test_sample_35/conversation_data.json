    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-7, 3)\n- B = (4, 3)\n- C = (-2, 9)\n\nLet's calculate the slopes of the sides and then the slopes of the altitudes:\n\n1. **Slope of AB**: Since A and B have the same y-coordinate, AB is a horizontal line, and its slope is 0.\n\n2. **Slope of BC**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of BC} = \\frac{9 - 3}{-2 - 4} = \\frac{6}{-6} = -1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Slope of CA**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of CA} = \\frac{9 - 3}{-2 + 7} = \\frac{6}{5}\n   \\]\n\nNow, the slopes of the altitudes are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides:\n\n1. **Altitude from C to AB**: Since AB is horizontal, the altitude from C is vertical, so its slope is undefined. The line is x = -2.\n\n2. **Altitude from A to BC**: The slope of BC is -1, so the slope of the altitude is 1. Using point A (-7, 3), the equation of the altitude is:\n   \\[\n   y - 3 = 1(x + 7)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Altitude from B to CA**: The slope of CA is \\( \\frac{6}{5} \\), so the slope of the altitude is \\( -\\frac{5}{6} \\). Using point B (4, 3), the equation of the altitude is:\n   \\[\n   y - 3 = -\\frac{5}{6}(x - 4)\n   \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of these altitudes. The intersection of the vertical line x = -2 and the other two altitudes will give us the orthocenter.\n\nLet's solve the equations to find the orthocenter:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A to BC\neq1 = Eq(y - 3, 1 * (x + 7))\n\n# Equation of the altitude from B to CA\neq2 = Eq(y - 3, -5/6 * (x - 4))\n\n# Solve for the intersection of the altitudes\nintersection = solve((eq1, Eq(x, -2)), (x, y))\nprint(intersection)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will find the coordinates of the orthocenter. Let's proceed with the calculation.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the orthocenter is at the point where the vertical line \\( x = -2 \\) intersects the altitude from A to BC. The result \\( y = 8 \\) is consistent with the calculation of the altitude from A to BC.\n\nLet's verify the calculations and ensure the accuracy of the orthocenter determination:\n\n1. **Equation of the altitude from A to BC**:\n   \\[\n   y - 3 = 1(x + 7) \\implies y = x + 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Equation of the altitude from B to CA**:\n   \\[\n   y - 3 = -\\frac{5}{6}(x - 4) \\implies y = -\\frac{5}{6}x + \\frac{20}{6} + 3 = -\\frac{5}{6}x + \\frac{38}{6}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Intersection of the altitudes**:\n   - The vertical line \\( x = -2 \\) intersects the altitude from A to BC at:\n     \\[\n     y = -2 + 10 = 8\n     \\]\n\nThus, the orthocenter is at the point (-2, 8).\n\nThe calculations confirm that the orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A = (-7, 3), B = (4, 3), and C = (-2, 9) is indeed at the point (-2, 8).\n\n<<<answer>>>(-2, 8)<<<answer>>>"
