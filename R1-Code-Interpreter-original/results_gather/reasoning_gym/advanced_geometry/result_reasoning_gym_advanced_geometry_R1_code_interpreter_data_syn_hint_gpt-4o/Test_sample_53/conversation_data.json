    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (9, -7)\n- B = (0, -4)\n- C = (-3, 4)\n\nWe will find the equations of two altitudes and then solve for their intersection point.\n\n1. **Find the slope of side BC**:\n   - The slope of BC is given by \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\).\n   - For B(0, -4) and C(-3, 4), the slope \\(m_{BC}\\) is \\((4 - (-4)) / (-3 - 0) = 8 / -3 = -8/3\\).\n\n2. **Find the equation of the altitude from A**:\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(m_{BC}\\), which is \\(3/8\\).\n   - Using point-slope form \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\) with A(9, -7), the equation is:\n     \\[ y + 7 = \\frac{3}{8}(x - 9) \\]\n\n3. **Find the slope of side AC**:\n   - The slope of AC is \\((4 - (-7)) / (-3 - 9) = 11 / -12 = -11/12\\).\n\n4. **Find the equation of the altitude from B**:\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(m_{AC}\\), which is \\(12/11\\).\n   - Using point-slope form with B(0, -4), the equation is:\n     \\[ y + 4 = \\frac{12}{11}x \\]\n\n5. **Solve the system of equations to find the intersection of the altitudes**:\n   - We have two equations:\n     1. \\( y + 7 = \\frac{3}{8}(x - 9) \\)\n     2. \\( y + 4 = \\frac{12}{11}x \\)\n\nLet's solve these equations using Python to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A\neq1 = Eq(y + 7, (3/8)*(x - 9))\n\n# Equation of the altitude from B\neq2 = Eq(y + 4, (12/11)*x)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
    "The code execution result provided the coordinates of the orthocenter as \\(x = -8.905\\) and \\(y = -13.714\\) when rounded to three decimal places. This result is consistent with the process of finding the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle and the calculations performed, the orthocenter is the point where the altitudes intersect. The code correctly solved the system of equations representing the altitudes from vertices A and B.\n\nTherefore, the orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A = (9, -7), B = (0, -4), and C = (-3, 4) is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (-8.905, -13.714)"
