    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-3, -4), B=(10, 8), and C=(4, -8), we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines states:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(C) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are the lengths of the sides opposite to vertices A, B, and C respectively.\n- \\( C \\) is the angle at vertex B.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC using the distance formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the lengths of the sides:\n\n1. **AB**: Between points A(-3, -4) and B(10, 8)\n2. **BC**: Between points B(10, 8) and C(4, -8)\n3. **AC**: Between points A(-3, -4) and C(4, -8)\n\nAfter calculating the side lengths, we can use the law of cosines to find the angle at B.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nA = (-3, -4)\nB = (10, 8)\nC = (4, -8)\n\n# Function to calculate distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate side lengths\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nAC = distance(A, C)\n\n# Use the law of cosines to find angle at B\n# cos(B) = (AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2) / (2 * AB * BC)\ncos_B = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\n\n# Calculate angle B in degrees\nangle_B = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_B))\n\n# Round the angle to 3 decimal places\nangle_B_rounded = round(angle_B, 3)\n\nprint(angle_B_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the angle at vertex B using the law of cosines and return the result rounded to three decimal places.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the angle at vertex B is approximately 26.735 degrees. This result was obtained by calculating the side lengths of the triangle using the distance formula and then applying the law of cosines to find the angle at B.\n\nThe process involved:\n1. Calculating the distances between the points to determine the side lengths of the triangle.\n2. Using the law of cosines to find the cosine of the angle at B.\n3. Converting the cosine value to an angle in degrees and rounding it to three decimal places.\n\nThe final result is the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-3, -4), B=(10, 8), and C=(4, -8).\n\n<<<'26.735°'>>>"
