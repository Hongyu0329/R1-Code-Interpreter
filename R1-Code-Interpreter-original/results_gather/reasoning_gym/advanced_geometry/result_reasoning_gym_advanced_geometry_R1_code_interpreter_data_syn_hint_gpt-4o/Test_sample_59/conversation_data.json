    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or its extension).\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- \\( A = (8, -5) \\)\n- \\( B = (-5, 2) \\)\n- \\( C = (4, 4) \\)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides:**\n   - Slope of \\( BC \\): \\(\\frac{4 - 2}{4 + 5} = \\frac{2}{9}\\)\n   - Slope of \\( AC \\): \\(\\frac{4 + 5}{4 - 8} = -\\frac{9}{4}\\)\n   - Slope of \\( AB \\): \\(\\frac{2 + 5}{-5 - 8} = -\\frac{7}{13}\\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from \\( A \\) is perpendicular to \\( BC \\), so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(\\frac{2}{9}\\), which is \\(-\\frac{9}{2}\\).\n   - The altitude from \\( B \\) is perpendicular to \\( AC \\), so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{9}{4}\\), which is \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\).\n   - The altitude from \\( C \\) is perpendicular to \\( AB \\), so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{7}{13}\\), which is \\(\\frac{13}{7}\\).\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Equation of the altitude from \\( A \\) (using point-slope form): \\( y + 5 = -\\frac{9}{2}(x - 8) \\)\n   - Equation of the altitude from \\( B \\): \\( y - 2 = \\frac{4}{9}(x + 5) \\)\n\n4. **Find the intersection of two altitudes (e.g., from \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)):**\n\nLet's solve these equations to find the intersection point, which will be the orthocenter.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A\neq1 = Eq(y + 5, -9/2 * (x - 8))\n\n# Equation of the altitude from B\neq2 = Eq(y - 2, 4/9 * (x + 5))\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter = (round(solution[x], 3), round(solution[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
