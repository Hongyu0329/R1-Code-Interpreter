    "To find the incircle radius (also known as the inradius) of a triangle, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{A}{s} \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the inradius, \\( A \\) is the area of the triangle, and \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the lengths of the sides of the triangle using the distance formula:\n\n\\[ AB = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) of the triangle:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the area \\( A \\) of the triangle using the coordinates of the vertices with the formula:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right| \\]\n\nFinally, we can find the inradius \\( r \\) using the formula mentioned above.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-1, 8)\nB = (-6, -2)\nC = (-3, 5)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nCA = distance(C, A)\n\n# Calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate the area using the coordinates\narea = 0.5 * abs(A[0]*(B[1]-C[1]) + B[0]*(C[1]-A[1]) + C[0]*(A[1]-B[1]))\n\n# Calculate the inradius\ninradius = area / s\n\n# Print the inradius rounded to 3 decimal places\nprint(round(inradius, 3))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the inradius.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the inradius of the triangle is approximately 0.223. This value is derived from the calculations based on the given vertices of the triangle. The process involved calculating the side lengths, semi-perimeter, and area of the triangle, and then using these to find the inradius.\n\nGiven that the code executed without errors and produced a result, we can conclude that the inradius of the triangle ABC with vertices A=(-1, 8), B=(-6, -2), and C=(-3, 5) is:\n\n<<<answer>>> 0.223"
