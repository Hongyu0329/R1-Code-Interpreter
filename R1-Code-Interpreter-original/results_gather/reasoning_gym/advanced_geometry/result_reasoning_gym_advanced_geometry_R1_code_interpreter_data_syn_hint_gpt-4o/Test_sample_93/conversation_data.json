    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or the line containing the opposite side).\n\nGiven the vertices of triangle ABC:\n- A = (-3, 9)\n- B = (-1, 8)\n- C = (-5, 1)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle:**\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n   - Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation: \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\)\n\n4. **Find the intersection of any two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by the equations of two altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate these using Python:\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-3, 9)\nB = (-1, 8)\nC = (-5, 1)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\n# Altitude from A: y - 9 = slope_altitude_A * (x + 3)\n# Altitude from B: y - 8 = slope_altitude_B * (x + 1)\n\n# Solving the system of equations to find the intersection\n# y = slope_altitude_A * (x + 3) + 9\n# y = slope_altitude_B * (x + 1) + 8\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\neq1 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_A * (x + 3) + 9)\neq2 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_B * (x + 1) + 8)\n\n# Solve the equations\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\nprint(orthocenter)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of two altitudes. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code execution result provides the coordinates of the orthocenter as approximately \\((-1.444, 8.111)\\). However, to ensure accuracy and adherence to the problem's requirements, let's verify and round the coordinates to three decimal places.\n\nThe orthocenter is calculated by finding the intersection of the altitudes from two vertices. The code correctly computes the slopes of the sides and the altitudes, and then solves the system of equations to find the intersection point.\n\nThe final coordinates of the orthocenter, rounded to three decimal places, are:\n\n\\((-1.444, 8.111)\\)\n\nThus, the orthocenter of triangle ABC is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (-1.444, 8.111) <<<answer>>>"
