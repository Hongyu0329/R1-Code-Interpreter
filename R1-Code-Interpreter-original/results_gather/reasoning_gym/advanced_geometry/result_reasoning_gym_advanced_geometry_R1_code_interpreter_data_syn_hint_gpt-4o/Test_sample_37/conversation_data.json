    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-9, -7), B=(-5, -8), and C=(9, 1), we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c opposite to angles A, B, and C respectively:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(C) \\]\n\nIn this case, we want to find the angle at B, so we will use the coordinates to find the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC.\n\n1. Calculate the length of AB:\n   \\[ AB = \\sqrt{(-5 - (-9))^2 + (-8 - (-7))^2} \\]\n\n2. Calculate the length of BC:\n   \\[ BC = \\sqrt{(9 - (-5))^2 + (1 - (-8))^2} \\]\n\n3. Calculate the length of AC:\n   \\[ AC = \\sqrt{(9 - (-9))^2 + (1 - (-7))^2} \\]\n\n4. Use the law of cosines to find angle B:\n   \\[ \\cos(B) = \\frac{AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2}{2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BC} \\]\n   \\[ B = \\cos^{-1}(\\cos(B)) \\]\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nA = (-9, -7)\nB = (-5, -8)\nC = (9, 1)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = math.sqrt((B[0] - A[0])**2 + (B[1] - A[1])**2)\nBC = math.sqrt((C[0] - B[0])**2 + (C[1] - B[1])**2)\nAC = math.sqrt((C[0] - A[0])**2 + (C[1] - A[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the angle at B using the law of cosines\ncos_B = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\nangle_B_rad = math.acos(cos_B)\nangle_B_deg = math.degrees(angle_B_rad)\n\n# Round the result to 3 decimal places\nangle_B_deg_rounded = round(angle_B_deg, 3)\n\nprint(angle_B_deg_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the angle at vertex B in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the angle at vertex B is approximately 133.229 degrees. This result is obtained by using the law of cosines to calculate the angle based on the side lengths of the triangle formed by the given vertices.\n\nThe process involved:\n1. Calculating the distances between the points to determine the side lengths of the triangle.\n2. Applying the law of cosines to find the cosine of the angle at vertex B.\n3. Converting the angle from radians to degrees and rounding it to three decimal places.\n\nThe calculated angle at vertex B is 133.229 degrees, which is consistent with the expected result for the given triangle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'133.229°'>>>"
