    "To find the incircle radius of triangle ABC, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the side lengths of the triangle**: \n   - Use the distance formula to find the lengths of sides AB, BC, and CA.\n   - The distance formula between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle**:\n   - The semi-perimeter \\(s\\) is half of the perimeter of the triangle:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the triangle**:\n   - Use Heron's formula to find the area \\(A\\) of the triangle:\n     \\[\n     A = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the incircle radius**:\n   - The radius \\(r\\) of the incircle is given by:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{A}{s}\n     \\]\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (8, 3)\nB = (4, -9)\nC = (6, 5)\n\n# Function to calculate distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate side lengths\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nCA = distance(C, A)\n\n# Calculate semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate area using Heron's formula\narea = math.sqrt(s * (s - AB) * (s - BC) * (s - CA))\n\n# Calculate incircle radius\nr = area / s\n\n# Print the incircle radius rounded to 3 decimal places\nprint(round(r, 3))\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the incircle radius of the triangle.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the incircle radius of the triangle is 1.08. This result is obtained by following the steps of calculating the side lengths, semi-perimeter, area using Heron's formula, and finally the incircle radius.\n\nThe process and calculations are correct, and the result is rounded to three decimal places as required. Therefore, the final answer for the incircle radius of triangle ABC is:\n\n<<<answer>>> 1.08"
