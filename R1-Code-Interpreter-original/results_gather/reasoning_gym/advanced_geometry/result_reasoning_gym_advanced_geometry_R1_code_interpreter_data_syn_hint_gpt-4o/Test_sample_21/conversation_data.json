    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-4, 4), B=(6, 5), and C=(6, 1), we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The angle θ between two vectors u and v can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{u \\cdot v}{\\|u\\| \\|v\\|}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( u \\cdot v \\) is the dot product of vectors u and v.\n- \\( \\|u\\| \\) and \\( \\|v\\| \\) are the magnitudes of vectors u and v, respectively.\n\nFirst, we need to find the vectors AB and BC:\n- Vector AB = B - A = (6 - (-4), 5 - 4) = (10, 1)\n- Vector BC = C - B = (6 - 6, 1 - 5) = (0, -4)\n\nNext, we calculate the dot product of AB and BC:\n- \\( AB \\cdot BC = (10 \\times 0) + (1 \\times -4) = 0 - 4 = -4 \\)\n\nThen, we find the magnitudes of AB and BC:\n- \\( \\|AB\\| = \\sqrt{10^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{100 + 1} = \\sqrt{101} \\)\n- \\( \\|BC\\| = \\sqrt{0^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{16} = 4 \\)\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle at B:\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{-4}{\\sqrt{101} \\times 4}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the angle θ in degrees using the arccosine function and convert it to degrees.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nA = (-4, 4)\nB = (6, 5)\nC = (6, 1)\n\n# Vectors AB and BC\nAB = (B[0] - A[0], B[1] - A[1])\nBC = (C[0] - B[0], C[1] - B[1])\n\n# Dot product of AB and BC\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Magnitudes of AB and BC\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Cosine of the angle at B\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Angle in radians\ntheta_radians = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert angle to degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(theta_radians)\n\n# Round to 3 decimal places\ntheta_degrees_rounded = round(theta_degrees, 3)\n\nprint(theta_degrees_rounded)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the angle at B in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the angle at vertex B is approximately 95.711 degrees. This result is consistent with the expected outcome for a triangle with the given vertices. The calculation involves using vector operations to determine the angle, which is a standard approach in geometry.\n\nThe process involved:\n1. Calculating vectors AB and BC from the given points.\n2. Computing the dot product of these vectors.\n3. Determining the magnitudes of the vectors.\n4. Using the dot product and magnitudes to find the cosine of the angle.\n5. Converting the angle from radians to degrees.\n\nThe result is rounded to three decimal places as required.\n\nTherefore, the angle at vertex B in the triangle is:\n\n<<<'95.711°'>>>"
