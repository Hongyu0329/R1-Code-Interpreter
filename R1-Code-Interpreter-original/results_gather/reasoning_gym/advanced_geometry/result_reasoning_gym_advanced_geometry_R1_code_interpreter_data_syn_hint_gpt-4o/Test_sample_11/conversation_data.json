    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-1, -6)\n- B = (4, 1)\n- C = (-7, 4)\n\nWe will find the equations of two altitudes and then solve for their intersection point.\n\n1. **Find the slope of side BC**:\n   - The slope of BC is given by \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\).\n   - B = (4, 1) and C = (-7, 4), so the slope of BC is \\((4 - 1) / (-7 - 4) = 3 / -11 = -3/11\\).\n\n2. **Find the equation of the altitude from A**:\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC, which is \\(11/3\\).\n   - Using point-slope form \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\) with point A = (-1, -6), the equation of the altitude is:\n     \\[\n     y + 6 = \\frac{11}{3}(x + 1)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the slope of side AC**:\n   - The slope of AC is \\((4 - (-6)) / (-7 - (-1)) = 10 / -6 = -5/3\\).\n\n4. **Find the equation of the altitude from B**:\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC, which is \\(3/5\\).\n   - Using point-slope form with point B = (4, 1), the equation of the altitude is:\n     \\[\n     y - 1 = \\frac{3}{5}(x - 4)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve the system of equations to find the intersection of the altitudes**:\n   - We have two equations:\n     \\[\n     y + 6 = \\frac{11}{3}(x + 1)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y - 1 = \\frac{3}{5}(x - 4)\n     \\]\n\nLet's solve these equations using Python to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A\neq1 = Eq(y + 6, (11/3)*(x + 1))\n\n# Equation of the altitude from B\neq2 = Eq(y - 1, (3/5)*(x - 4))\n\n# Solve the system of equations\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\nprint(orthocenter)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
    "The code execution result provided the coordinates of the orthocenter as approximately (0.304, -1.217). However, to ensure accuracy and adherence to the problem's requirements, let's round these values to three decimal places.\n\nThe orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A = (-1, -6), B = (4, 1), and C = (-7, 4) is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (0.304, -1.217) <<<answer>>>"
