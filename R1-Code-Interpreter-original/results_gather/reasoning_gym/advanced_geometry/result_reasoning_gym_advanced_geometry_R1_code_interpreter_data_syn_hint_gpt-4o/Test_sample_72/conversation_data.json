    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side. \n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-10, -5)\n- B = (-7, -6)\n- C = (-7, -8)\n\nWe can find the equations of the altitudes and then solve for their intersection.\n\n1. **Find the slope of each side:**\n   - Slope of BC: Since B and C have the same x-coordinate, BC is a vertical line, and its slope is undefined.\n   - Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (-8 - (-5)) / (-7 - (-10)) = -3 / 3 = -1\\)\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) = (-6 - (-5)) / (-7 - (-10)) = -1 / 3\\)\n\n2. **Find the perpendicular slopes (slopes of altitudes):**\n   - Perpendicular to BC: Since BC is vertical, the altitude from A is horizontal, so its slope is 0.\n   - Perpendicular to AC: The slope of AC is -1, so the perpendicular slope is 1.\n   - Perpendicular to AB: The slope of AB is -1/3, so the perpendicular slope is 3.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Altitude from A (horizontal line through A): \\(y = -5\\)\n   - Altitude from B (perpendicular to AC): Using point B and slope 1, the equation is \\(y + 6 = 1(x + 7)\\) or \\(y = x - 1\\)\n   - Altitude from C (perpendicular to AB): Using point C and slope 3, the equation is \\(y + 8 = 3(x + 7)\\) or \\(y = 3x + 13\\)\n\n4. **Find the intersection of two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations for the altitudes from A and B:\n     - \\(y = -5\\)\n     - \\(y = x - 1\\)\n\nLet's solve these equations to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equations of the altitudes\neq1 = Eq(y, -5)  # Altitude from A\neq2 = Eq(y, x - 1)  # Altitude from B\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter of the triangle.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the orthocenter of the triangle is at the point (-4, -5). This result is consistent with the intersection of the altitudes we calculated. The altitude from A is a horizontal line at \\(y = -5\\), and the altitude from B is a line with the equation \\(y = x - 1\\). Solving these equations gives us the intersection point (-4, -5).\n\nTherefore, the orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A=(-10, -5), B=(-7, -6), and C=(-7, -8) is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n(-4, -5)\n<<<answer>>>"
