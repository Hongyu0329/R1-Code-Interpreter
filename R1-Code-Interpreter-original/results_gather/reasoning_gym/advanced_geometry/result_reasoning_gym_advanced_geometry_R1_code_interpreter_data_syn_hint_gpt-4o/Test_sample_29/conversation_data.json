    "To find the radius of the incircle of triangle ABC, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the side lengths of the triangle**: \n   - Use the distance formula to find the lengths of sides AB, BC, and CA.\n   \n2. **Calculate the semi-perimeter (s) of the triangle**: \n   - The semi-perimeter is half the sum of the side lengths.\n\n3. **Calculate the area (A) of the triangle**: \n   - Use the formula for the area of a triangle with given vertices: \n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right|\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the radius (r) of the incircle**: \n   - The radius of the incircle is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{A}{s}\n     \\]\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-5, 7)\nB = (-4, 0)\nC = (-1, 0)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the side lengths\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nCA = distance(C, A)\n\n# Calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate the area using the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices\narea = 0.5 * abs(A[0]*(B[1]-C[1]) + B[0]*(C[1]-A[1]) + C[0]*(A[1]-B[1]))\n\n# Calculate the radius of the incircle\nr = area / s\n\n# Print the radius rounded to 3 decimal places\nprint(round(r, 3))\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the radius of the incircle rounded to three decimal places.",
    "The code execution result provided the radius of the incircle as 1.158, which seems correct based on the calculations. However, let's verify the steps and ensure that the calculations are accurate:\n\n1. **Side Lengths Calculation**:\n   - \\( AB = \\sqrt{(-4 - (-5))^2 + (0 - 7)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 49} = \\sqrt{50} \\)\n   - \\( BC = \\sqrt{(-1 - (-4))^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\)\n   - \\( CA = \\sqrt{(-1 - (-5))^2 + (0 - 7)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 49} = \\sqrt{65} \\)\n\n2. **Semi-perimeter Calculation**:\n   - \\( s = \\frac{\\sqrt{50} + 3 + \\sqrt{65}}{2} \\)\n\n3. **Area Calculation**:\n   - Using the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| -5(0-0) + (-4)(0-7) + (-1)(7-0) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 + 28 - 7 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 21 = 10.5\n     \\]\n\n4. **Radius of the Incircle**:\n   - \\( r = \\frac{A}{s} = \\frac{10.5}{s} \\)\n\nThe calculations seem consistent with the code output. The radius of the incircle is indeed 1.158 when rounded to three decimal places. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'1.158'>>>"
