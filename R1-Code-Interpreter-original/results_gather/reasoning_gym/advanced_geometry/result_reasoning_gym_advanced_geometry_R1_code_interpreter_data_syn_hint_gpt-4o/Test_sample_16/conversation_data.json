    "To find the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with given coordinates, we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The angle between two vectors can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\| \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) are vectors.\n- \\(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\) is the dot product of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\n- \\(\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|\\) are the magnitudes of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\n\nIn this case, we need to find vectors \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{BC}\\):\n- \\(\\mathbf{AB} = B - A = (7 - 0, 7 - (-6)) = (7, 13)\\)\n- \\(\\mathbf{BC} = C - B = (-1 - 7, 6 - 7) = (-8, -1)\\)\n\nNow, we calculate the dot product and magnitudes:\n- \\(\\mathbf{AB} \\cdot \\mathbf{BC} = 7 \\times (-8) + 13 \\times (-1)\\)\n- \\(\\|\\mathbf{AB}\\| = \\sqrt{7^2 + 13^2}\\)\n- \\(\\|\\mathbf{BC}\\| = \\sqrt{(-8)^2 + (-1)^2}\\)\n\nFinally, we can find the angle \\(\\theta\\) using the inverse cosine function and convert it to degrees.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the vectors\nAB = (7, 13)\nBC = (-8, -1)\n\n# Calculate the dot product\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Calculate the magnitudes\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Calculate the cosine of the angle\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Calculate the angle in radians\ntheta_radians = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert the angle to degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(theta_radians)\n\n# Round the result to 3 decimal places\ntheta_degrees_rounded = round(theta_degrees, 3)\n\nprint(theta_degrees_rounded)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the measure of angle ABC in degrees.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the measure of angle ABC is approximately 125.426 degrees. This result is obtained by calculating the angle between vectors \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{BC}\\) using the dot product and magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nThe process involves:\n1. Calculating the vectors \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{BC}\\) from the given coordinates.\n2. Computing the dot product of these vectors.\n3. Determining the magnitudes of the vectors.\n4. Using the dot product and magnitudes to find the cosine of the angle.\n5. Converting the angle from radians to degrees.\n\nThe final result is rounded to three decimal places as required.\n\n<<<125.426°>>>"
