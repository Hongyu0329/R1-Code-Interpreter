    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(9, -8), B=(9, 10), and C=(6, -9), we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The angle θ between two vectors u and v can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{u \\cdot v}{\\|u\\| \\|v\\|}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( u \\cdot v \\) is the dot product of vectors u and v.\n- \\( \\|u\\| \\) and \\( \\|v\\| \\) are the magnitudes of vectors u and v, respectively.\n\nFirst, we need to find the vectors AB and BC:\n- Vector AB = B - A = (9 - 9, 10 - (-8)) = (0, 18)\n- Vector BC = C - B = (6 - 9, -9 - 10) = (-3, -19)\n\nNext, we calculate the dot product of AB and BC:\n- \\( AB \\cdot BC = (0) \\cdot (-3) + (18) \\cdot (-19) = 0 - 342 = -342 \\)\n\nNow, we calculate the magnitudes of AB and BC:\n- \\( \\|AB\\| = \\sqrt{0^2 + 18^2} = \\sqrt{324} = 18 \\)\n- \\( \\|BC\\| = \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-19)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 361} = \\sqrt{370} \\)\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle θ:\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{-342}{18 \\times \\sqrt{370}}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the angle θ in degrees using the arccosine function and convert it to degrees.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Vectors AB and BC\nAB = (0, 18)\nBC = (-3, -19)\n\n# Dot product of AB and BC\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Magnitudes of AB and BC\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Cosine of the angle\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Angle in radians\ntheta_radians = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert to degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(theta_radians)\n\n# Round to 3 decimal places\ntheta_degrees_rounded = round(theta_degrees, 3)\n\nprint(theta_degrees_rounded)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the angle at vertex B in degrees.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the angle at vertex B is approximately 171.027 degrees. This result seems reasonable given the coordinates of the triangle vertices. The angle is obtuse, which aligns with the geometric configuration of the points.\n\nThe process involved calculating the vectors AB and BC, finding their dot product, and using the magnitudes of these vectors to determine the cosine of the angle at B. Finally, the angle was converted from radians to degrees and rounded to three decimal places.\n\nGiven the correct execution and the logical reasoning behind the calculations, the final answer for the angle at vertex B is:\n\n<<<'171.027°'>>>"
