    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-1, 4)\n- B = (4, -6)\n- C = (0, -7)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes, which are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides.\n3. Write the equations of the altitudes using the point-slope form of a line equation.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate the slopes of the sides first:\n\n- Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\nThen, calculate the slopes of the altitudes:\n\n- Altitude from A: Perpendicular to BC\n- Altitude from B: Perpendicular to AC\n- Altitude from C: Perpendicular to AB\n\nFinally, solve the system of equations for the altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-1, 4)\nB = (4, -6)\nC = (0, -7)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A (y - y1 = m(x - x1))\n# y - 4 = slope_altitude_A * (x + 1)\n# Equation of the altitude from B (y + 6 = slope_altitude_B * (x - 4))\n# Solve these two equations to find the orthocenter\n\n# Solving the system of equations\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\neq1 = Eq(y - 4, slope_altitude_A * (x + 1))\neq2 = Eq(y + 6, slope_altitude_B * (x - 4))\n\n# Solve for x and y\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter_rounded)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the orthocenter.",
    "The code execution result provided the coordinates of the orthocenter as (1.556, -6.222). This result is derived from solving the system of equations representing the altitudes of the triangle. The process involved calculating the slopes of the sides of the triangle, determining the slopes of the altitudes (as negative reciprocals), and then solving the equations of the altitudes to find their intersection point.\n\nGiven the execution result, the orthocenter of triangle ABC is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n(1.556, -6.222)\n<<<answer>>>"
