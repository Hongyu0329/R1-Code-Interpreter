    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (6, 7)\n- B = (-5, -3)\n- C = (-3, 7)\n\nWe will find the equations of two altitudes and then solve for their intersection point.\n\n1. **Find the slope of side BC:**\n   - B = (-5, -3)\n   - C = (-3, 7)\n   - Slope of BC = (7 - (-3)) / (-3 - (-5)) = 10 / 2 = 5\n\n2. **Find the slope of the altitude from A:**\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - Slope of altitude from A = -1/5\n\n3. **Equation of the altitude from A:**\n   - Using point A (6, 7) and the slope -1/5, the equation is:\n   - y - 7 = -1/5 * (x - 6)\n\n4. **Find the slope of side AC:**\n   - A = (6, 7)\n   - C = (-3, 7)\n   - Slope of AC = (7 - 7) / (-3 - 6) = 0\n\n5. **Find the slope of the altitude from B:**\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is undefined (vertical line).\n\n6. **Equation of the altitude from B:**\n   - Since the slope is undefined, the altitude from B is a vertical line passing through B (-5, -3).\n   - x = -5\n\nNow, we solve the system of equations to find the intersection of these two altitudes.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A\neq1 = Eq(y - 7, -1/5 * (x - 6))\n\n# Equation of the altitude from B (vertical line)\neq2 = Eq(x, -5)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the orthocenter is at the point (-5, 9.2). However, let's verify the calculation and ensure the accuracy of the result.\n\n1. **Equation of the altitude from A:**\n   - We derived the equation as \\( y - 7 = -\\frac{1}{5}(x - 6) \\).\n   - Simplifying, we get: \\( y = -\\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{6}{5} + 7 \\).\n   - Further simplification gives: \\( y = -\\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{41}{5} \\).\n\n2. **Equation of the altitude from B:**\n   - The altitude from B is a vertical line at \\( x = -5 \\).\n\n3. **Intersection of the two altitudes:**\n   - Substitute \\( x = -5 \\) into the equation of the altitude from A:\n   - \\( y = -\\frac{1}{5}(-5) + \\frac{41}{5} \\).\n   - \\( y = 1 + \\frac{41}{5} \\).\n   - \\( y = \\frac{5}{5} + \\frac{41}{5} = \\frac{46}{5} = 9.2 \\).\n\nThe calculations confirm that the orthocenter is indeed at the point (-5, 9.2).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (-5, 9.2) <<<answer>>>"
