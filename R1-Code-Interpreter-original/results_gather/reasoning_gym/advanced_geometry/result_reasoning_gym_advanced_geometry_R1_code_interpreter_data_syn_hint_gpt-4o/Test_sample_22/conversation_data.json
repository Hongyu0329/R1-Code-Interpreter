    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or the line containing the opposite side).\n\nGiven the vertices of triangle ABC:\n- A = (4, 7)\n- B = (-1, 5)\n- C = (5, 2)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle:**\n   - Slope of BC\n   - Slope of AC\n   - Slope of AB\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation with the slopes found in step 2 and the corresponding vertices.\n\n4. **Find the intersection of any two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by the equations of two altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (4, 7)\nB = (-1, 5)\nC = (5, 2)\n\n# Function to calculate the slope of a line given two points\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    if p2[0] == p1[0]:  # vertical line\n        return None\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC if slope_BC is not None else None\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC if slope_AC is not None else None\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB if slope_AB is not None else None\n\n# Function to find the equation of a line given a point and a slope\ndef line_equation(point, slope):\n    if slope is None:  # vertical line\n        return (1, 0, -point[0])  # x = point[0]\n    else:\n        # y = mx + c => c = y - mx\n        c = point[1] - slope * point[0]\n        return (-slope, 1, -c)  # -mx + y = c\n\n# Equations of the altitudes\naltitude_A = line_equation(A, slope_altitude_A)\naltitude_B = line_equation(B, slope_altitude_B)\n\n# Function to find the intersection of two lines given in the form ax + by + c = 0\ndef intersection(line1, line2):\n    a1, b1, c1 = line1\n    a2, b2, c2 = line2\n    determinant = a1 * b2 - a2 * b1\n    if determinant == 0:\n        return None  # Lines are parallel\n    x = (b1 * c2 - b2 * c1) / determinant\n    y = (a2 * c1 - a1 * c2) / determinant\n    return (x, y)\n\n# Find the orthocenter by intersecting two altitudes\northocenter = intersection(altitude_A, altitude_B)\n\n# Round the coordinates to 3 decimal places\northocenter = (round(orthocenter[0], 3), round(orthocenter[1], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle ABC by finding the intersection of two altitudes. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result provided the coordinates of the orthocenter as (3.444, 5.889). This result is derived from the intersection of two altitudes of the triangle. The process involved calculating the slopes of the sides of the triangle, determining the slopes of the altitudes (as negative reciprocals), and then finding the equations of the altitudes. Finally, the intersection of two altitudes was computed to find the orthocenter.\n\nGiven the successful execution and the correct application of geometric principles, the coordinates of the orthocenter are:\n\n<<<(3.444, 5.889)>>>"
