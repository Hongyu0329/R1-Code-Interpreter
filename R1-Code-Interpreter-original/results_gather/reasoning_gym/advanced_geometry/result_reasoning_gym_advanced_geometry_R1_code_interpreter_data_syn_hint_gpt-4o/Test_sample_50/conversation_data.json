    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle given its vertices, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. The altitudes are the perpendicular lines drawn from each vertex to the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of triangle ABC:\n- A = (5, 6)\n- B = (-1, -5)\n- C = (-5, -2)\n\nWe can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle:**\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_C - y_B) / (x_C - x_B)\\)\n   - Slope of AC: \\((y_C - y_A) / (x_C - x_A)\\)\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_B - y_A) / (x_B - x_A)\\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC.\n   - The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\) for each altitude, where \\(m\\) is the slope of the altitude and \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is the vertex from which the altitude is drawn.\n\n4. **Find the intersection of any two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by any two altitude equations to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate these using Python:\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (5, 6)\nB = (-1, -5)\nC = (-5, -2)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\n# Altitude from A: y - 6 = slope_altitude_A * (x - 5)\n# Altitude from B: y + 5 = slope_altitude_B * (x + 1)\n\n# Solving the system of equations to find the intersection (orthocenter)\n# y = slope_altitude_A * (x - 5) + 6\n# y = slope_altitude_B * (x + 1) - 5\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\neq1 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_A * (x - 5) + 6)\neq2 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_B * (x + 1) - 5)\n\n# Solve the equations\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter_rounded)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
    "The code execution result provides the coordinates of the orthocenter as (-2.161, -3.548). This result is obtained by solving the system of equations representing the altitudes of the triangle. The altitudes are derived from the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides of the triangle, ensuring they are perpendicular to the respective sides.\n\nThe process involved:\n1. Calculating the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determining the slopes of the altitudes as the negative reciprocals of these slopes.\n3. Formulating the equations of the altitudes using the point-slope form.\n4. Solving the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nThe coordinates of the orthocenter are rounded to three decimal places as required.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(-2.161, -3.548)>>>"
