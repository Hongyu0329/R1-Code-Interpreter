    "To find the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with given coordinates, we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Find vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Vector AB = B - A = (-3, 4) - (-5, -8) = (2, 12)\n   - Vector BC = C - B = (-1, 1) - (-3, 4) = (2, -3)\n\n2. **Calculate the dot product of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Dot product AB · BC = (2 * 2) + (12 * -3) = 4 - 36 = -32\n\n3. **Calculate the magnitudes of vectors AB and BC**:\n   - Magnitude of AB = √(2² + 12²) = √(4 + 144) = √148\n   - Magnitude of BC = √(2² + (-3)²) = √(4 + 9) = √13\n\n4. **Use the dot product to find the cosine of angle ABC**:\n   - cos(∠ABC) = (AB · BC) / (|AB| * |BC|) = -32 / (√148 * √13)\n\n5. **Calculate the angle in degrees**:\n   - ∠ABC = arccos(cos(∠ABC))\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates\nA = (-5, -8)\nB = (-3, 4)\nC = (-1, 1)\n\n# Vectors AB and BC\nAB = (B[0] - A[0], B[1] - A[1])\nBC = (C[0] - B[0], C[1] - B[1])\n\n# Dot product of AB and BC\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Magnitudes of AB and BC\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Cosine of angle ABC\ncos_ABC = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Angle ABC in degrees\nangle_ABC = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_ABC))\n\n# Round the angle to 3 decimal places\nangle_ABC_rounded = round(angle_ABC, 3)\n\nprint(angle_ABC_rounded)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the measure of angle ABC in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the measure of angle ABC is approximately 136.848 degrees. This result is consistent with the calculations performed using the dot product and magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nThe process involved:\n- Calculating vectors AB and BC from the given coordinates.\n- Using the dot product formula to find the cosine of the angle.\n- Converting the cosine value to an angle in degrees using the arccosine function.\n- Rounding the result to three decimal places.\n\nThe result is accurate and follows the steps outlined in the reasoning process. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'136.848°'>>>"
