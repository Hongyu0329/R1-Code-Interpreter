    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-4, 7)\n- B = (-7, -2)\n- C = (0, 10)\n\nWe will find the equations of two altitudes and then determine their intersection point.\n\n1. **Find the slope of side BC**:\n   - B = (-7, -2)\n   - C = (0, 10)\n   - Slope of BC = (10 - (-2)) / (0 - (-7)) = 12 / 7\n\n2. **Find the slope of the altitude from A**:\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC.\n   - Slope of the altitude from A = -1 / (Slope of BC) = -7 / 12\n\n3. **Equation of the altitude from A**:\n   - Point A = (-4, 7)\n   - Using point-slope form: y - 7 = (-7/12)(x + 4)\n\n4. **Find the slope of side AC**:\n   - A = (-4, 7)\n   - C = (0, 10)\n   - Slope of AC = (10 - 7) / (0 - (-4)) = 3 / 4\n\n5. **Find the slope of the altitude from B**:\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC.\n   - Slope of the altitude from B = -1 / (Slope of AC) = -4 / 3\n\n6. **Equation of the altitude from B**:\n   - Point B = (-7, -2)\n   - Using point-slope form: y + 2 = (-4/3)(x + 7)\n\nNow, we will solve these two equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A: y - 7 = (-7/12)(x + 4)\neq1 = Eq(y - 7, (-7/12)*(x + 4))\n\n# Equation of the altitude from B: y + 2 = (-4/3)(x + 7)\neq2 = Eq(y + 2, (-4/3)*(x + 7))\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
    "The code execution result provides the coordinates of the orthocenter as approximately (-21.333, 17.111). However, let's ensure the accuracy of these results by verifying the calculations and rounding the coordinates to three decimal places as required.\n\nThe process involves:\n1. Calculating the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determining the slopes of the altitudes, which are perpendicular to the sides.\n3. Formulating the equations of the altitudes using the point-slope form.\n4. Solving the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nThe code execution has already provided the solution, and the coordinates are:\n- x ≈ -21.333\n- y ≈ 17.111\n\nThese coordinates are rounded to three decimal places as required.\n\nTherefore, the orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A=(-4, 7), B=(-7, -2), and C=(0, 10) is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (-21.333, 17.111)"
