    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle with vertices A, B, and C, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle:**\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_3 - y_2) / (x_3 - x_2)\\)\n   - Slope of CA: \\((y_1 - y_3) / (x_1 - x_3)\\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of CA.\n   - The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the equation of a line: \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is a point on the line.\n\n4. **Find the intersection of two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by any two of the altitude equations to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (9, 8)\nB = (8, -7)\nC = (-10, -10)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_CA = slope(C, A)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_CA\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\n# Altitude from A: y - 8 = slope_altitude_A * (x - 9)\n# Altitude from B: y + 7 = slope_altitude_B * (x - 8)\n\n# Solving the system of equations to find the intersection (orthocenter)\n# y = slope_altitude_A * (x - 9) + 8\n# y = slope_altitude_B * (x - 8) - 7\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\neq1 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_A * (x - 9) + 8)\neq2 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_B * (x - 8) - 7)\n\n# Solve the equations\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter_rounded)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of two altitudes. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result provides the coordinates of the orthocenter as (12.247, -11.483). This result is obtained by solving the system of equations representing the altitudes of the triangle. The process involves calculating the slopes of the sides of the triangle, determining the slopes of the altitudes (which are the negative reciprocals of the side slopes), and then solving the equations of two altitudes to find their intersection point.\n\nThe orthocenter is the point where all three altitudes intersect, and in this case, the calculated intersection of two altitudes gives us the orthocenter.\n\nGiven the result from the code execution, the orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A=(9, 8), B=(8, -7), and C=(-10, -10) is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (12.247, -11.483)"
