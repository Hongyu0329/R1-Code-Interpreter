    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or the line containing the opposite side).\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (2, 6)\n- B = (1, -6)\n- C = (5, -10)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes (which are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides).\n3. Find the equations of the altitudes.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's start by calculating the slopes of the sides:\n\n- Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\nThen, calculate the slopes of the altitudes:\n- The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC.\n- The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC.\n- The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB.\n\nFinally, solve the system of equations for the altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (2, 6)\nB = (1, -6)\nC = (5, -10)\n\n# Function to calculate the slope of a line given two points\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Function to find the y-intercept of a line given a point and a slope\ndef y_intercept(point, slope):\n    return point[1] - slope * point[0]\n\n# Equations of the altitudes\n# y = slope * x + intercept\nintercept_A = y_intercept(A, slope_altitude_A)\nintercept_B = y_intercept(B, slope_altitude_B)\n\n# Solve the system of equations for the altitudes from A and B\n# slope_altitude_A * x + intercept_A = slope_altitude_B * x + intercept_B\n# (slope_altitude_A - slope_altitude_B) * x = intercept_B - intercept_A\nx_orthocenter = (intercept_B - intercept_A) / (slope_altitude_A - slope_altitude_B)\ny_orthocenter = slope_altitude_A * x_orthocenter + intercept_A\n\n# Round the coordinates to 3 decimal places\nx_orthocenter = round(x_orthocenter, 3)\ny_orthocenter = round(y_orthocenter, 3)\n\nprint((x_orthocenter, y_orthocenter))\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
