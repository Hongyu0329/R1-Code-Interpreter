    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-2, 8), B=(-9, 6), and C=(-2, 10), we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c opposite to angles A, B, and C respectively:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(C) \\]\n\nIn this case, we need to find the angle at B, so we will use the coordinates to find the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC.\n\n1. Calculate the length of AB:\n   \\[ AB = \\sqrt{(-9 - (-2))^2 + (6 - 8)^2} = \\sqrt{(-7)^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 4} = \\sqrt{53} \\]\n\n2. Calculate the length of BC:\n   \\[ BC = \\sqrt{(-2 - (-9))^2 + (10 - 6)^2} = \\sqrt{(7)^2 + (4)^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 16} = \\sqrt{65} \\]\n\n3. Calculate the length of AC:\n   \\[ AC = \\sqrt{(-2 - (-2))^2 + (10 - 8)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 4} = \\sqrt{4} = 2 \\]\n\nNow, we can use the law of cosines to find the angle at B:\n\n\\[ \\cos(B) = \\frac{AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2}{2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BC} \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to find the angle in degrees.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Lengths of the sides\nAB = math.sqrt(53)\nBC = math.sqrt(65)\nAC = 2\n\n# Calculate the cosine of angle B\ncos_B = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\n\n# Calculate the angle in radians\nangle_B_rad = math.acos(cos_B)\n\n# Convert the angle to degrees\nangle_B_deg = math.degrees(angle_B_rad)\n\n# Round the result to 3 decimal places\nangle_B_deg_rounded = round(angle_B_deg, 3)\n\nprint(angle_B_deg_rounded)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the angle at B in degrees.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the angle at vertex B is approximately 13.799 degrees. This result is obtained by using the law of cosines to calculate the angle based on the side lengths of the triangle.\n\nThe process involved:\n1. Calculating the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC using the distance formula.\n2. Applying the law of cosines to find the cosine of the angle at B.\n3. Converting the angle from radians to degrees and rounding it to three decimal places.\n\nThe final answer for the angle at vertex B is:\n\n<<<13.799°>>>"
