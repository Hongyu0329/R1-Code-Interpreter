    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-2, -8)\n- B = (3, -2)\n- C = (-7, -9)\n\nWe will find the equations of two altitudes and then solve for their intersection point.\n\n1. **Find the slope of side BC**:\n   - The slope of BC is given by \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\).\n   - For B(3, -2) and C(-7, -9), the slope \\(m_{BC}\\) is \\((-9 - (-2)) / (-7 - 3) = -7 / -10 = 0.7\\).\n\n2. **Find the equation of the altitude from A**:\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(m_{BC}\\), which is \\(-1/0.7 = -10/7\\).\n   - Using point A(-2, -8) and the slope \\(-10/7\\), the equation of the altitude is:\n     \\[ y + 8 = -\\frac{10}{7}(x + 2) \\]\n\n3. **Find the slope of side AC**:\n   - The slope of AC is \\((-9 - (-8)) / (-7 - (-2)) = -1 / -5 = 0.2\\).\n\n4. **Find the equation of the altitude from B**:\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(m_{AC}\\), which is \\(-1/0.2 = -5\\).\n   - Using point B(3, -2) and the slope \\(-5\\), the equation of the altitude is:\n     \\[ y + 2 = -5(x - 3) \\]\n\n5. **Solve the system of equations to find the intersection of the altitudes**:\n   - We have two equations:\n     1. \\( y + 8 = -\\frac{10}{7}(x + 2) \\)\n     2. \\( y + 2 = -5(x - 3) \\)\n\nLet's solve these equations to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A\neq1 = Eq(y + 8, -10/7 * (x + 2))\n\n# Equation of the altitude from B\neq2 = Eq(y + 2, -5 * (x - 3))\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the orthocenter coordinates were calculated, but the result needs to be rounded to three decimal places as per the problem's requirements. Let's address this by rounding the coordinates to three decimal places.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A\neq1 = Eq(y + 8, -10/7 * (x + 2))\n\n# Equation of the altitude from B\neq2 = Eq(y + 2, -5 * (x - 3))\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\n\n# Round the solution to three decimal places\northocenter = {key: round(value, 3) for key, value in solution.items()}\n\n# Print the rounded solution\nprint(orthocenter)\n```\n\nThis code will provide the orthocenter coordinates rounded to three decimal places. Let's execute it to get the final answer.",
    "The code execution result provides the orthocenter coordinates as (6.680, -20.400), which are already rounded to three decimal places. This matches the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the final answer is ready to be presented.\n\n<<<(6.680, -20.400)>>>"
