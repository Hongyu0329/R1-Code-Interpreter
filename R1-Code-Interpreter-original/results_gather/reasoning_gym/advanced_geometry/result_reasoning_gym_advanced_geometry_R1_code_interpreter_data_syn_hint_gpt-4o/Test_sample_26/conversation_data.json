    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(4, 2), B=(1, -1), and C=(-2, 4), we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The angle θ between two vectors u and v can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{u \\cdot v}{\\|u\\| \\|v\\|}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( u \\cdot v \\) is the dot product of vectors u and v.\n- \\(\\|u\\|\\) and \\(\\|v\\|\\) are the magnitudes of vectors u and v, respectively.\n\nFirst, we need to find the vectors AB and BC:\n- Vector AB = B - A = (1 - 4, -1 - 2) = (-3, -3)\n- Vector BC = C - B = (-2 - 1, 4 - (-1)) = (-3, 5)\n\nNext, we calculate the dot product of AB and BC:\n- \\( AB \\cdot BC = (-3) \\times (-3) + (-3) \\times 5 = 9 - 15 = -6 \\)\n\nThen, we find the magnitudes of AB and BC:\n- \\(\\|AB\\| = \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-3)^2} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\)\n- \\(\\|BC\\| = \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{34}\\)\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle at B:\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{-6}{3\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{34}}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the angle θ in degrees using the arccosine function and convert it to degrees.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Vectors AB and BC\nAB = (-3, -3)\nBC = (-3, 5)\n\n# Dot product of AB and BC\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Magnitudes of AB and BC\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Cosine of the angle at B\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Angle in radians\ntheta_radians = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert to degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(theta_radians)\n\n# Round to 3 decimal places\ntheta_degrees_rounded = round(theta_degrees, 3)\n\nprint(theta_degrees_rounded)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the angle at vertex B in degrees.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the angle at vertex B is approximately 104.036 degrees. This result is consistent with the calculations performed using the dot product and magnitudes of the vectors AB and BC.\n\nThe process involved:\n1. Calculating the vectors AB and BC from the given coordinates.\n2. Computing the dot product of these vectors.\n3. Determining the magnitudes of the vectors.\n4. Using the dot product and magnitudes to find the cosine of the angle.\n5. Converting the angle from radians to degrees.\n\nThe final result is the angle at vertex B, rounded to three decimal places.\n\n<<<104.036°>>>"
