    "To find the incircle radius of triangle ABC, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the side lengths of the triangle**: \n   - Use the distance formula to find the lengths of sides AB, BC, and CA.\n\n2. **Calculate the semi-perimeter (s) of the triangle**: \n   - The semi-perimeter is given by \\( s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the area (A) of the triangle**: \n   - Use the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at coordinates: \n     \\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right| \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the incircle radius (r)**: \n   - The radius of the incircle is given by \\( r = \\frac{A}{s} \\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-4, -7)\nB = (7, -7)\nC = (0, 7)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the side lengths\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nCA = distance(C, A)\n\n# Calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate the area using the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices\narea = 0.5 * abs(A[0]*(B[1]-C[1]) + B[0]*(C[1]-A[1]) + C[0]*(A[1]-B[1]))\n\n# Calculate the incircle radius\nr = area / s\n\n# Print the incircle radius rounded to 3 decimal places\nprint(round(r, 3))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the incircle radius.",
    "The code execution result provided the incircle radius as 3.737, which is the correct calculation based on the given vertices of the triangle. The process involved calculating the side lengths, semi-perimeter, and area of the triangle, and then using these to find the incircle radius.\n\nThe steps and calculations were straightforward and did not require symbolic computing or complex algorithms, as the problem was a standard geometry problem involving basic arithmetic and geometric formulas.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the incircle radius of triangle ABC is:\n\n<<<'3.737'>>>"
