    "To find the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC with given coordinates, we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The angle between two vectors can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\| \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) are vectors.\n- \\(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\) is the dot product of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\n- \\(\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|\\) are the magnitudes of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\n\nFor angle ABC, we need vectors \\(\\mathbf{BA}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{BC}\\):\n- \\(\\mathbf{BA} = A - B = (-1 - 5, -9 + 10) = (-6, 1)\\)\n- \\(\\mathbf{BC} = C - B = (6 - 5, 0 + 10) = (1, 10)\\)\n\nNow, we calculate the dot product and magnitudes:\n- \\(\\mathbf{BA} \\cdot \\mathbf{BC} = (-6) \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 10 = -6 + 10 = 4\\)\n- \\(\\|\\mathbf{BA}\\| = \\sqrt{(-6)^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 1} = \\sqrt{37}\\)\n- \\(\\|\\mathbf{BC}\\| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 10^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 100} = \\sqrt{101}\\)\n\nNow, we can find \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\) and then \\(\\theta\\):\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{37} \\cdot \\sqrt{101}}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the angle \\(\\theta\\) in degrees using the arccosine function.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Vectors BA and BC\nBA = (-6, 1)\nBC = (1, 10)\n\n# Dot product of BA and BC\ndot_product = BA[0] * BC[0] + BA[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Magnitudes of BA and BC\nmagnitude_BA = math.sqrt(BA[0]**2 + BA[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Cosine of the angle\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_BA * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Angle in radians\ntheta_radians = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert to degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(theta_radians)\n\n# Round to 3 decimal places\ntheta_degrees_rounded = round(theta_degrees, 3)\n\nprint(theta_degrees_rounded)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the measure of angle ABC in degrees.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the measure of angle ABC is approximately 86.248 degrees. This result is consistent with the calculations performed using the dot product and magnitudes of vectors BA and BC.\n\nGiven the coordinates of the points A, B, and C, the vectors were correctly calculated, and the dot product and magnitudes were used to find the cosine of the angle. The arccosine function then provided the angle in radians, which was converted to degrees and rounded to three decimal places.\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle ABC in triangle ABC is:\n\n<<<'86.248°'>>>"
