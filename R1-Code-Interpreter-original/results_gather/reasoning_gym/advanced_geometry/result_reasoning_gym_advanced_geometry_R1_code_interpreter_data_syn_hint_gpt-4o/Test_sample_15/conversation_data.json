    "To find the incircle radius (also known as the inradius) of a triangle, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{A}{s} \\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) is the area of the triangle and \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the side lengths of the triangle using the distance formula:\n\n\\[ AB = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the semi-perimeter \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} \\]\n\nThen, we find the area \\( A \\) of the triangle using the coordinates of the vertices with the formula:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right| \\]\n\nFinally, we can calculate the inradius \\( r \\).\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-8, 3)\nB = (7, 4)\nC = (8, 0)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the side lengths\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nCA = distance(C, A)\n\n# Calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate the area using the determinant method\narea = 0.5 * abs(A[0]*(B[1]-C[1]) + B[0]*(C[1]-A[1]) + C[0]*(A[1]-B[1]))\n\n# Calculate the inradius\ninradius = area / s\n\n# Print the inradius rounded to 3 decimal places\nprint(round(inradius, 3))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the inradius of the triangle.",
    "The code execution result provided the inradius of the triangle as 1.721, which is the correct calculation based on the given vertices of the triangle. The process involved calculating the side lengths, semi-perimeter, and area of the triangle, and then using these to find the inradius.\n\nThe steps were as follows:\n1. Calculate the side lengths using the distance formula.\n2. Compute the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n3. Determine the area using the determinant method for the coordinates.\n4. Use the formula for the inradius \\( r = \\frac{A}{s} \\).\n\nThe result is already rounded to three decimal places as required.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the inradius of the triangle is:\n\n<<<'1.721'>>>"
