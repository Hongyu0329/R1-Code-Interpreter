    "To find the incircle radius (also known as the inradius) of a triangle given its vertices, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{A}{s} \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the inradius, \\( A \\) is the area of the triangle, and \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the lengths of the sides of the triangle using the distance formula:\n\n\\[ AB = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\\[ BC = \\sqrt{(x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2} \\]\n\\[ CA = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_3)^2 + (y_1 - y_3)^2} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the semi-perimeter \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the area \\( A \\) of the triangle using Heron's formula:\n\n\\[ A = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)} \\]\n\nFinally, we can find the inradius \\( r \\) using the formula mentioned above.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (8, 9)\nB = (-1, 4)\nC = (3, -5)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = math.sqrt((B[0] - A[0])**2 + (B[1] - A[1])**2)\nBC = math.sqrt((C[0] - B[0])**2 + (C[1] - B[1])**2)\nCA = math.sqrt((A[0] - C[0])**2 + (A[1] - C[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the semi-perimeter\ns = (AB + BC + CA) / 2\n\n# Calculate the area using Heron's formula\narea = math.sqrt(s * (s - AB) * (s - BC) * (s - CA))\n\n# Calculate the inradius\ninradius = area / s\n\n# Print the inradius rounded to 3 decimal places\nprint(round(inradius, 3))\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the inradius.",
    "The code execution result provided the inradius of the triangle as 2.885, which is the correct calculation based on the given vertices of the triangle. The process involved calculating the side lengths, semi-perimeter, and area using Heron's formula, and then using these to find the inradius.\n\nThe steps and calculations were as follows:\n1. Calculate the side lengths using the distance formula.\n2. Compute the semi-perimeter.\n3. Use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle.\n4. Calculate the inradius using the formula \\( r = \\frac{A}{s} \\).\n\nThe result is already rounded to three decimal places as required.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the inradius of the triangle is:\n\n<<<answer>>> 2.885"
