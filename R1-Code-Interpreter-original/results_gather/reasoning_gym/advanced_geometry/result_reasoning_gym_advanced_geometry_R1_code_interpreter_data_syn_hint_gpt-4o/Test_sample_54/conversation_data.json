    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or the line containing the opposite side).\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (7, 0)\n- B = (-10, -8)\n- C = (6, 10)\n\nWe will find the equations of two altitudes and then solve for their intersection point.\n\n1. **Find the slope of side BC**:\n   - The slope of BC is given by the formula: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\).\n   - For B = (-10, -8) and C = (6, 10), the slope of BC is \\((10 - (-8)) / (6 - (-10)) = 18 / 16 = 9/8\\).\n\n2. **Find the equation of the altitude from A**:\n   - The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of 9/8, which is -8/9.\n   - Using the point-slope form of a line equation \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is the point A (7, 0), the equation of the altitude from A is:\n     \\[\n     y - 0 = -\\frac{8}{9}(x - 7)\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{8}{9}x + \\frac{56}{9}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the slope of side AC**:\n   - The slope of AC is \\((10 - 0) / (6 - 7) = 10 / -1 = -10\\).\n\n4. **Find the equation of the altitude from B**:\n   - The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of -10, which is 1/10.\n   - Using the point-slope form with point B (-10, -8), the equation of the altitude from B is:\n     \\[\n     y - (-8) = \\frac{1}{10}(x - (-10))\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     y + 8 = \\frac{1}{10}(x + 10)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{1}{10}x + 1 - 8\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{1}{10}x - 7\n     \\]\n\n5. **Find the intersection of the two altitudes**:\n   - We solve the system of equations:\n     \\[\n     y = -\\frac{8}{9}x + \\frac{56}{9}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{1}{10}x - 7\n     \\]\n\nLet's solve these equations using Python to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Define the equations of the altitudes\neq1 = Eq(y, -8/9 * x + 56/9)\neq2 = Eq(y, 1/10 * x - 7)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\n\n# Print the solution rounded to 3 decimal places\northocenter = (round(solution[x], 3), round(solution[y], 3))\nprint(orthocenter)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
    "The code execution result provides the coordinates of the orthocenter as (13.371, -5.663). This result is obtained by solving the system of equations representing the altitudes of the triangle.\n\nThe process involved:\n1. Calculating the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determining the slopes of the altitudes as the negative reciprocals of the side slopes.\n3. Formulating the equations of the altitudes using the point-slope form.\n4. Solving the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nThe orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A = (7, 0), B = (-10, -8), and C = (6, 10) is (13.371, -5.663).\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
