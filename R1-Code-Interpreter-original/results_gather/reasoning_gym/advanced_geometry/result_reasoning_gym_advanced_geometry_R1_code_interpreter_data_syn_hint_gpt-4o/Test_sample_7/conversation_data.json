    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of triangle ABC:\n- A = (-2, 2)\n- B = (-10, -4)\n- C = (-3, 2)\n\nLet's calculate the slopes of the sides and then the slopes of the altitudes:\n\n1. **Slope of BC**:  \n   The slope of a line through two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of BC} = \\frac{2 - (-4)}{-3 - (-10)} = \\frac{6}{7}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Slope of AC**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of AC} = \\frac{2 - 2}{-3 - (-2)} = \\frac{0}{-1} = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Slope of AB**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of AB} = \\frac{2 - (-4)}{-2 - (-10)} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}\n   \\]\n\nNow, the slopes of the altitudes are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides:\n\n1. **Altitude from A (perpendicular to BC)**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of altitude from A} = -\\frac{1}{\\frac{6}{7}} = -\\frac{7}{6}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Altitude from B (perpendicular to AC)**:  \n   Since AC is horizontal, the altitude from B is vertical, so its slope is undefined, and it is a vertical line \\(x = -10\\).\n\n3. **Altitude from C (perpendicular to AB)**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of altitude from C} = -\\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{4}} = -\\frac{4}{3}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we find the equations of these altitudes:\n\n1. **Equation of altitude from A**:  \n   Using point A \\((-2, 2)\\) and slope \\(-\\frac{7}{6}\\), the equation is:\n   \\[\n   y - 2 = -\\frac{7}{6}(x + 2)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Equation of altitude from B**:  \n   Since it's a vertical line, the equation is:\n   \\[\n   x = -10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equation of altitude from C**:  \n   Using point C \\((-3, 2)\\) and slope \\(-\\frac{4}{3}\\), the equation is:\n   \\[\n   y - 2 = -\\frac{4}{3}(x + 3)\n   \\]\n\nNow, we solve these equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's solve the equations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of altitude from A\neq1 = Eq(y - 2, -7/6 * (x + 2))\n\n# Equation of altitude from B (vertical line)\neq2 = Eq(x, -10)\n\n# Solve for intersection of eq1 and eq2\nintersection1 = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\n\n# Equation of altitude from C\neq3 = Eq(y - 2, -4/3 * (x + 3))\n\n# Solve for intersection of eq1 and eq3\nintersection2 = solve((eq1, eq3), (x, y))\n\n# Print the results\nprint(intersection1)\nprint(intersection2)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will determine the orthocenter based on the intersection of the altitudes.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the intersection of the altitudes from A and B is at the point \\((-10, 11.333)\\). However, this result seems incorrect because the orthocenter should be the intersection of all three altitudes, and the vertical line \\(x = -10\\) should not intersect with the altitude from A at this point.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the situation and solve the equations correctly. We need to find the intersection of the altitudes from A and C, as well as the intersection of the altitudes from B and C, to ensure we have the correct orthocenter.\n\n1. **Equation of altitude from A**:  \n   \\[\n   y - 2 = -\\frac{7}{6}(x + 2)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Equation of altitude from C**:  \n   \\[\n   y - 2 = -\\frac{4}{3}(x + 3)\n   \\]\n\nWe will solve these equations to find the correct intersection point.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of altitude from A\neq1 = Eq(y - 2, -7/6 * (x + 2))\n\n# Equation of altitude from C\neq3 = Eq(y - 2, -4/3 * (x + 3))\n\n# Solve for intersection of eq1 and eq3\nintersection = solve((eq1, eq3), (x, y))\n\n# Print the result\nprint(intersection)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct orthocenter.",
