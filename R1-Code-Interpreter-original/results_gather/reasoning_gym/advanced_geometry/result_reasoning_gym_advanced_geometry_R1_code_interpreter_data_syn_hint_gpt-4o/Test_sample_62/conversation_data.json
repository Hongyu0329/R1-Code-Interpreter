    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-5, -7), B=(-2, -1), and C=(3, -10), we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC:\n\n1. **Length of AB**:  \n   \\[\n   AB = \\sqrt{((-2) - (-5))^2 + ((-1) - (-7))^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 36} = \\sqrt{45}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Length of BC**:  \n   \\[\n   BC = \\sqrt{((3) - (-2))^2 + ((-10) - (-1))^2} = \\sqrt{5^2 + (-9)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 81} = \\sqrt{106}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Length of AC**:  \n   \\[\n   AC = \\sqrt{((3) - (-5))^2 + ((-10) - (-7))^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 + (-3)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 9} = \\sqrt{73}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we apply the law of cosines to find the angle at B, denoted as ∠ABC:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\angle ABC) = \\frac{AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2}{2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BC}\n\\]\n\nWe will calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy and then convert the result from radians to degrees.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nA = (-5, -7)\nB = (-2, -1)\nC = (3, -10)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = math.sqrt((B[0] - A[0])**2 + (B[1] - A[1])**2)\nBC = math.sqrt((C[0] - B[0])**2 + (C[1] - B[1])**2)\nAC = math.sqrt((C[0] - A[0])**2 + (C[1] - A[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the cosine of the angle at B using the law of cosines\ncos_ABC = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\n\n# Calculate the angle in radians and then convert to degrees\nangle_ABC_rad = math.acos(cos_ABC)\nangle_ABC_deg = math.degrees(angle_ABC_rad)\n\n# Round the result to 3 decimal places\nangle_ABC_deg_rounded = round(angle_ABC_deg, 3)\n\nprint(angle_ABC_deg_rounded)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the angle at B in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the angle at B is approximately 55.62 degrees. However, the task requires the angle to be rounded to three decimal places. Let's ensure that the final answer is formatted correctly and meets all the requirements.\n\nThe angle at B, calculated using the law of cosines, is approximately 55.620 degrees when rounded to three decimal places.\n\n<<<answer>>>55.620°<<<answer>>>"
