    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle given its vertices, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. The altitudes are the perpendiculars dropped from each vertex to the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices A(10, -2), B(-10, 5), and C(7, 1), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides:**\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n   - Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation: \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\)\n\n4. **Find the intersection of any two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by the equations of two altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate these using Python:\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (10, -2)\nB = (-10, 5)\nC = (7, 1)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\n# Altitude from A: y - A[1] = slope_altitude_A * (x - A[0])\n# Altitude from B: y - B[1] = slope_altitude_B * (x - B[0])\n\n# Solving the system of equations to find the intersection (orthocenter)\n# y = slope_altitude_A * (x - A[0]) + A[1]\n# y = slope_altitude_B * (x - B[0]) + B[1]\n\n# Let's solve these equations\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\neq1 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_A * (x - A[0]) + A[1])\neq2 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_B * (x - B[0]) + B[1])\n\n# Solve for x and y\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of two altitudes.
