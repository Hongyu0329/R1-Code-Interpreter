    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle given its vertices, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices A(8, -7), B(0, -3), and C(10, 9), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle:**\n   - Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n   - Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n   - Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\) for each altitude.\n\n4. **Find the intersection of any two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by the equations of two altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate these steps using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (8, -7)\nB = (0, -3)\nC = (10, 9)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\n# Altitude from A: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n# Altitude from B: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n# We will find the intersection of altitudes from A and B\n\n# Altitude from A: y + 7 = slope_altitude_A * (x - 8)\n# Altitude from B: y + 3 = slope_altitude_B * (x - 0)\n\n# Solving the system of equations\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\neq1 = Eq(y + 7, slope_altitude_A * (x - 8))\neq2 = Eq(y + 3, slope_altitude_B * (x - 0))\n\n# Solve for x and y\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of two altitudes. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code execution result provided the coordinates of the orthocenter as (3.765, -3.471). This result is derived from solving the system of equations representing the altitudes of the triangle. The process involved calculating the slopes of the sides of the triangle, determining the slopes of the altitudes (as negative reciprocals), and then solving the equations of two altitudes to find their intersection point.\n\nGiven the successful execution and the result obtained, I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<answer>>>The coordinates of the orthocenter are (3.765, -3.471).<<<answer>>>"
