    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(5, -10), B=(7, 6), and C=(5, -9), we can use the dot product formula for vectors. The angle θ between two vectors u and v can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{u \\cdot v}{\\|u\\| \\|v\\|}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( u \\cdot v \\) is the dot product of vectors u and v.\n- \\( \\|u\\| \\) and \\( \\|v\\| \\) are the magnitudes of vectors u and v, respectively.\n\nFirst, we need to find the vectors AB and BC:\n- Vector AB = B - A = (7 - 5, 6 - (-10)) = (2, 16)\n- Vector BC = C - B = (5 - 7, -9 - 6) = (-2, -15)\n\nNext, we calculate the dot product of AB and BC:\n- \\( AB \\cdot BC = (2)(-2) + (16)(-15) = -4 - 240 = -244 \\)\n\nThen, we find the magnitudes of AB and BC:\n- \\( \\|AB\\| = \\sqrt{2^2 + 16^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 256} = \\sqrt{260} \\)\n- \\( \\|BC\\| = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-15)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 225} = \\sqrt{229} \\)\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle at B:\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{-244}{\\sqrt{260} \\times \\sqrt{229}}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the angle θ in degrees using the arccosine function and convert it to degrees.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Vectors AB and BC\nAB = (2, 16)\nBC = (-2, -15)\n\n# Dot product of AB and BC\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Magnitudes of AB and BC\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Cosine of the angle at B\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Angle in radians\ntheta_radians = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert angle to degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(theta_radians)\n\n# Round to 3 decimal places\ntheta_degrees_rounded = round(theta_degrees, 3)\n\nprint(theta_degrees_rounded)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the angle at vertex B in degrees.",
    "The angle at vertex B should be calculated correctly, and the result should be between 0° and 180°. The previous result of 179.53° seems incorrect due to a possible error in the calculation or rounding process. Let's re-evaluate the calculation step-by-step to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Vectors Calculation:**\n   - Vector AB = B - A = (7 - 5, 6 - (-10)) = (2, 16)\n   - Vector BC = C - B = (5 - 7, -9 - 6) = (-2, -15)\n\n2. **Dot Product:**\n   - \\( AB \\cdot BC = (2)(-2) + (16)(-15) = -4 - 240 = -244 \\)\n\n3. **Magnitudes:**\n   - \\( \\|AB\\| = \\sqrt{2^2 + 16^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 256} = \\sqrt{260} \\)\n   - \\( \\|BC\\| = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-15)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 225} = \\sqrt{229} \\)\n\n4. **Cosine of the Angle:**\n   \\[\n   \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{-244}{\\sqrt{260} \\times \\sqrt{229}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Angle Calculation:**\n   - Use the arccosine function to find the angle in radians.\n   - Convert the angle from radians to degrees.\n\nLet's recompute this using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Vectors AB and BC\nAB = (2, 16)\nBC = (-2, -15)\n\n# Dot product of AB and BC\ndot_product = AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1]\n\n# Magnitudes of AB and BC\nmagnitude_AB = math.sqrt(AB[0]**2 + AB[1]**2)\nmagnitude_BC = math.sqrt(BC[0]**2 + BC[1]**2)\n\n# Cosine of the angle at B\ncos_theta = dot_product / (magnitude_AB * magnitude_BC)\n\n# Angle in radians\ntheta_radians = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert angle to degrees\ntheta_degrees = math.degrees(theta_radians)\n\n# Round to 3 decimal places\ntheta_degrees_rounded = round(theta_degrees, 3)\n\nprint(theta_degrees_rounded)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the correct angle at vertex B.",
    "The previous calculation seems to have resulted in an angle that is very close to 180°, which suggests that the vectors AB and BC are almost collinear but in opposite directions. This is consistent with the geometry of the triangle given the coordinates. However, let's ensure that the calculation is correct by re-evaluating the steps and considering the geometry of the triangle.\n\nGiven the coordinates:\n- A = (5, -10)\n- B = (7, 6)\n- C = (5, -9)\n\nThe vectors are:\n- AB = (2, 16)\n- BC = (-2, -15)\n\nThe dot product and magnitudes were calculated correctly, and the cosine of the angle was derived from these values. The angle at B is indeed very close to 180°, which is consistent with the vectors being nearly collinear in opposite directions.\n\nThe calculation seems correct, and the angle at B is approximately 179.53°, which is a valid result given the geometry of the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<179.53°>>>"
