    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A, B, and C, we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines states that for any triangle with sides of lengths \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the angle \\(\\gamma\\) opposite side \\(c\\), the following equation holds:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(\\gamma) \\]\n\nIn this problem, we need to find the angle at B, which we'll denote as \\(\\angle ABC\\). To do this, we first need to calculate the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC using the distance formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the lengths of the sides:\n\n- \\( AB \\) is the distance between points A and B.\n- \\( BC \\) is the distance between points B and C.\n- \\( AC \\) is the distance between points A and C.\n\nOnce we have the lengths, we can apply the law of cosines to find \\(\\angle ABC\\).\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nA = (4, -4)\nB = (-8, 9)\nC = (-7, 10)\n\n# Function to calculate distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nAC = distance(A, C)\n\n# Use the law of cosines to find the angle at B\ncos_angle_B = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\nangle_B_rad = math.acos(cos_angle_B)\nangle_B_deg = math.degrees(angle_B_rad)\n\n# Round the angle to 3 decimal places\nangle_B_deg_rounded = round(angle_B_deg, 3)\n\nprint(angle_B_deg_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the angle at B in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the angle at vertex B is approximately 92.291 degrees. This result is obtained by calculating the distances between the points A, B, and C, and then applying the law of cosines to find the angle at B.\n\nThe process involved:\n1. Calculating the distances AB, BC, and AC using the distance formula.\n2. Applying the law of cosines to find the cosine of the angle at B.\n3. Converting the angle from radians to degrees.\n4. Rounding the result to three decimal places.\n\nThe result is consistent with the expected outcome for a triangle with the given vertices.\n\nTherefore, the angle at vertex B is:\n\n<<<'92.291°'>>>"
