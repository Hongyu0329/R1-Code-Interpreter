    "To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A=(-4, 9), B=(-1, -8), and C=(1, -3), we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines states that for any triangle with sides of lengths a, b, and c, and an angle θ opposite side c, the following equation holds:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(\\theta) \\]\n\nIn this case, we need to find the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC, and then use the law of cosines to find the angle at B.\n\n1. Calculate the lengths of the sides:\n   - AB: distance between A and B\n   - BC: distance between B and C\n   - AC: distance between A and C\n\n2. Use the law of cosines to find the angle at B.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nA = (-4, 9)\nB = (-1, -8)\nC = (1, -3)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(p1, p2):\n    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nAC = distance(A, C)\n\n# Use the law of cosines to find the angle at B\n# cos(B) = (AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2) / (2 * AB * BC)\ncos_B = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\nangle_B_rad = math.acos(cos_B)\n\n# Convert the angle from radians to degrees\nangle_B_deg = math.degrees(angle_B_rad)\n\n# Round the result to 3 decimal places\nangle_B_deg_rounded = round(angle_B_deg, 3)\n\nprint(angle_B_deg_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the angle at vertex B in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the angle at vertex B is approximately 31.809 degrees. This result is obtained by calculating the distances between the points and applying the law of cosines to find the angle at B.\n\nThe process involved:\n1. Calculating the distances between the points A, B, and C.\n2. Using the law of cosines to find the cosine of the angle at B.\n3. Converting the angle from radians to degrees and rounding it to three decimal places.\n\nThe calculation seems correct, and the result is consistent with the expected outcome for the given triangle.\n\nTherefore, the angle at vertex B is:\n\n<<<31.809°>>>"
