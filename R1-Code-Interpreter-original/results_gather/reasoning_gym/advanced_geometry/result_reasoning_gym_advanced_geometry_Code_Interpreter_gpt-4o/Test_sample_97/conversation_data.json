    "\nassistant > To find the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A, B, and C, we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines states:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(C)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the angle opposite side \\(c\\), and \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the angle at B, so we will use the coordinates to find the lengths of the sides:\n\n- \\(AB\\) is the side opposite angle C\n- \\(BC\\) is the side opposite angle A\n- \\(CA\\) is the side opposite angle B\n\nThe length of a side between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by the distance formula:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the lengths of the sides \\(AB\\), \\(BC\\), and \\(CA\\), and then use the law of cosines to find the angle at B.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (6, -2)\nB = (-9, 2)\nC = (10, -3)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(point1, point2):\n    return math.sqrt((point2[0] - point1[0])**2 + (point2[1] - point1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nCA = distance(C, A)\n\n# Use the law of cosines to find the angle at B\n# cos(B) = (AB^2 + BC^2 - CA^2) / (2 * AB * BC)\ncos_B = (AB**2 + BC**2 - CA**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\n\n# Calculate the angle in degrees\nangle_B = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_B))\nangle_B_rounded = round(angle_B, 3)\n\nangle_B_rounded\nassistant > The angle at vertex B is approximately \\(0.188^\\circ\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0.188°>>>"
