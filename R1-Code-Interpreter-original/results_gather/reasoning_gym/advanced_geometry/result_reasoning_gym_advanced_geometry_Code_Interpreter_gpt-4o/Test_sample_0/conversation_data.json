    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\), we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. The altitudes are the perpendicular lines from each vertex to the opposite side.\n\nLet's calculate the slopes of the sides of the triangle and then find the equations of the altitudes.\n\n1. **Slope of side BC:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{-10 - (-3)}{5 - (-1)} = \\frac{-7}{6}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Slope of side AC:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{-10 - (-6)}{5 - (-4)} = \\frac{-4}{9}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Slope of side AB:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{-3 - (-6)}{-1 - (-4)} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1\n   \\]\n\nThe altitudes are perpendicular to these sides, so their slopes are the negative reciprocals:\n\n- **Altitude from A (perpendicular to BC):** Slope = \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\)\n- **Altitude from B (perpendicular to AC):** Slope = \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\)\n- **Altitude from C (perpendicular to AB):** Slope = \\(-1\\)\n\nNow, let's find the equations of two altitudes and solve for their intersection.\n\n**Equation of altitude from A:**\n- Slope = \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\)\n- Passes through A(-4, -6)\n\nEquation: \\( y + 6 = \\frac{6}{7}(x + 4) \\)\n\n**Equation of altitude from B:**\n- Slope = \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\)\n- Passes through B(-1, -3)\n\nEquation: \\( y + 3 = \\frac{9}{4}(x + 1) \\)\n\nLet's solve these two equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational\r\n\r\n# Define the variables\r\nx, y = symbols('x y')\r\n\r\n# Equation of altitude from A: y + 6 = (6/7)(x + 4)\r\neq1 = Eq(y + 6, Rational(6, 7) * (x + 4))\r\n\r\n# Equation of altitude from B: y + 3 = (9/4)(x + 1)\r\neq2 = Eq(y + 3, Rational(9, 4) * (x + 1))\r\n\r\n# Solve the system of equations\r\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\r\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\r\northocenter_rounded\nassistant > The coordinates of the orthocenter of triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) are \\((-1.308, -3.692)\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<(-1.308, -3.692)>>>"
