    "\nassistant > To find the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A, B, and C, we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines states:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(C)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the lengths of the sides opposite to vertices A, B, and C, respectively.\n- \\(C\\) is the angle at vertex B.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC using the distance formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the lengths of the sides and then use the law of cosines to find the angle at B.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (3, 3)\nB = (-7, -8)\nC = (1, 4)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(point1, point2):\n    return math.sqrt((point2[0] - point1[0])**2 + (point2[1] - point1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nAC = distance(A, C)\n\n# Use the law of cosines to find the angle at B\n# cos(B) = (AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2) / (2 * AB * BC)\ncos_B = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\n\n# Calculate the angle in radians and then convert to degrees\nangle_B_rad = math.acos(cos_B)\nangle_B_deg = math.degrees(angle_B_rad)\n\n# Round the angle to 3 decimal places\nangle_B_deg_rounded = round(angle_B_deg, 3)\nangle_B_deg_rounded\nassistant > The angle at vertex B is <<<8.584°>>>."
