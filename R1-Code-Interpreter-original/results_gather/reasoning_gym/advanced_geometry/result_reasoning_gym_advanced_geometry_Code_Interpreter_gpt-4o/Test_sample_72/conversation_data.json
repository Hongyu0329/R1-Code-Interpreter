    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- \\( A = (-10, -5) \\)\n- \\( B = (-7, -6) \\)\n- \\( C = (-7, -8) \\)\n\nLet's calculate the slopes of the sides and then the slopes of the altitudes:\n\n1. **Slope of side BC**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{y_C - y_B}{x_C - x_B} = \\frac{-8 - (-6)}{-7 - (-7)} = \\text{undefined (vertical line)}\n   \\]\n   Since BC is a vertical line, the altitude from A to BC is a horizontal line through A, so its equation is \\( y = -5 \\).\n\n2. **Slope of side AC**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{y_C - y_A}{x_C - x_A} = \\frac{-8 - (-5)}{-7 - (-10)} = \\frac{-3}{3} = -1\n   \\]\n   The altitude from B to AC is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(-1\\), which is \\(1\\). The equation of the altitude from B is:\n   \\[\n   y - y_B = 1(x - x_B) \\implies y + 6 = x + 7 \\implies y = x + 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Slope of side AB**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A} = \\frac{-6 - (-5)}{-7 - (-10)} = \\frac{-1}{3}\n   \\]\n   The altitude from C to AB is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\), which is \\(3\\). The equation of the altitude from C is:\n   \\[\n   y - y_C = 3(x - x_C) \\implies y + 8 = 3(x + 7) \\implies y = 3x + 21 - 8 \\implies y = 3x + 13\n   \\]\n\nNow, we find the intersection of the altitudes \\( y = -5 \\) and \\( y = 3x + 13 \\).\n\nLet's solve for the intersection point.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equations of the altitudes\neq1 = Eq(y, -5)  # Altitude from A\neq2 = Eq(y, 3*x + 13)  # Altitude from C\n\n# Solve for the intersection point\nintersection = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\nintersection\nassistant > The orthocenter of the triangle with vertices \\( A = (-10, -5) \\), \\( B = (-7, -6) \\), and \\( C = (-7, -8) \\) is at the coordinates \\((-6, -5)\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<(-6, -5)>>>}\n\\]"
