    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nLet's calculate the orthocenter step by step:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides:**\n   - Slope of \\( AB \\)\n   - Slope of \\( BC \\)\n   - Slope of \\( CA \\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from \\( C \\) is perpendicular to \\( AB \\).\n   - The altitude from \\( A \\) is perpendicular to \\( BC \\).\n   - The altitude from \\( B \\) is perpendicular to \\( CA \\).\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation for each altitude.\n\n4. **Find the intersection of two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by any two altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the points\nA = (-1, -6)\nB = (4, 1)\nC = (-7, 4)\n\n# Calculate slopes of the sides\nslope_AB = (B[1] - A[1]) / (B[0] - A[0])\nslope_BC = (C[1] - B[1]) / (C[0] - B[0])\nslope_CA = (A[1] - C[1]) / (A[0] - C[0])\n\n# Calculate slopes of the altitudes (perpendicular slopes)\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_CA\n\n# Define the equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Altitude from C to AB\neq1 = Eq(y - C[1], slope_altitude_C * (x - C[0]))\n\n# Altitude from A to BC\neq2 = Eq(y - A[1], slope_altitude_A * (x - A[0]))\n\n# Solve the system of equations to find the orthocenter\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\northocenter_rounded\nassistant > The orthocenter of the triangle with vertices \\( A = (-1, -6) \\), \\( B = (4, 1) \\), and \\( C = (-7, 4) \\) is \\((0.304, -1.217)\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<0.304, -1.217>>>"
