    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\), we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nLet's find the equations of the altitudes:\n\n1. **Altitude from A to BC:**\n   - The slope of line BC is given by:\n     \\[\n     m_{BC} = \\frac{y_C - y_B}{x_C - x_B} = \\frac{9 - 2}{3 - (-4)} = \\frac{7}{7} = 1\n     \\]\n   - The slope of the altitude from A to BC is the negative reciprocal of \\( m_{BC} \\), which is \\(-1\\).\n   - The equation of the altitude from A is:\n     \\[\n     y - y_A = m(x - x_A) \\implies y - 5 = -1(x - 0) \\implies y = -x + 5\n     \\]\n\n2. **Altitude from B to AC:**\n   - The slope of line AC is given by:\n     \\[\n     m_{AC} = \\frac{y_C - y_A}{x_C - x_A} = \\frac{9 - 5}{3 - 0} = \\frac{4}{3}\n     \\]\n   - The slope of the altitude from B to AC is the negative reciprocal of \\( m_{AC} \\), which is \\(-\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n   - The equation of the altitude from B is:\n     \\[\n     y - y_B = m(x - x_B) \\implies y - 2 = -\\frac{3}{4}(x + 4)\n     \\]\n\nLet's solve these two equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A to BC: y = -x + 5\neq1 = Eq(y, -x + 5)\n\n# Equation of the altitude from B to AC: y - 2 = -3/4 * (x + 4)\neq2 = Eq(y - 2, -3/4 * (x + 4))\n\n# Solve the system of equations\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\northocenter_rounded\nassistant > The coordinates of the orthocenter of triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) are \\((24, -19)\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(24, -19)>>>"
