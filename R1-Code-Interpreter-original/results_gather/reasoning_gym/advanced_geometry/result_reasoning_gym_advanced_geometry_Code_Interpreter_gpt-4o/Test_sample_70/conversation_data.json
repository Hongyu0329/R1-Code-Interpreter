    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- \\( A = (9, 1) \\)\n- \\( B = (-5, 7) \\)\n- \\( C = (9, -5) \\)\n\nLet's calculate the slopes of the sides and then the slopes of the altitudes:\n\n1. **Slope of side BC**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{y_C - y_B}{x_C - x_B} = \\frac{-5 - 7}{9 - (-5)} = \\frac{-12}{14} = -\\frac{6}{7}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Slope of the altitude from A** (perpendicular to BC):\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of altitude from A} = \\frac{7}{6}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equation of the altitude from A**:\n   Using point-slope form \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) is point A:\n   \\[\n   y - 1 = \\frac{7}{6}(x - 9)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Slope of side AC**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{y_C - y_A}{x_C - x_A} = \\frac{-5 - 1}{9 - 9} = \\text{undefined (vertical line)}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Slope of the altitude from B** (perpendicular to AC):\n   Since AC is vertical, the altitude from B is horizontal, so its slope is 0.\n\n6. **Equation of the altitude from B**:\n   \\[\n   y = 7\n   \\]\n\n7. **Slope of side AB**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A} = \\frac{7 - 1}{-5 - 9} = \\frac{6}{-14} = -\\frac{3}{7}\n   \\]\n\n8. **Slope of the altitude from C** (perpendicular to AB):\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of altitude from C} = \\frac{7}{3}\n   \\]\n\n9. **Equation of the altitude from C**:\n   Using point-slope form with point C:\n   \\[\n   y + 5 = \\frac{7}{3}(x - 9)\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's solve the system of equations formed by the altitudes to find their intersection point, which is the orthocenter. We'll solve the equations of the altitudes from A and B.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational\r\n\r\n# Define the variables\r\nx, y = symbols('x y')\r\n\r\n# Equation of the altitude from A: y - 1 = (7/6)(x - 9)\r\naltitude_A = Eq(y - 1, Rational(7, 6) * (x - 9))\r\n\r\n# Equation of the altitude from B: y = 7\r\naltitude_B = Eq(y, 7)\r\n\r\n# Solve the system of equations to find the orthocenter\r\northocenter = solve((altitude_A, altitude_B), (x, y))\r\northocenter\nassistant > The orthocenter of the triangle with vertices \\( A = (9, 1) \\), \\( B = (-5, 7) \\), and \\( C = (9, -5) \\) is at the coordinates \\(\\left(\\frac{99}{7}, 7\\right)\\).\n\nLet's convert \\(\\frac{99}{7}\\) to a decimal rounded to three decimal places.# Convert 99/7 to a decimal and round to 3 decimal places\r\nx_coord = round(99/7, 3)\r\nx_coord\nassistant > The orthocenter of the triangle is at the coordinates \\((14.143, 7)\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<}(14.143, 7)\\text{>>>}\n\\]"
