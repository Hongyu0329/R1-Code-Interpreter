    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nLet's calculate the orthocenter step by step:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides:**\n   - Slope of \\( AB \\)\n   - Slope of \\( BC \\)\n   - Slope of \\( CA \\)\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from a vertex is perpendicular to the opposite side, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of that side.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the equation of a line.\n\n4. **Find the intersection of two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Vertices of the triangle\nA = (-4, 7)\nB = (-7, -2)\nC = (0, 10)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_CA = slope(C, A)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\nx, y = symbols('x y')\naltitude_C = Eq(y - C[1], slope_altitude_C * (x - C[0]))\naltitude_A = Eq(y - A[1], slope_altitude_A * (x - A[0]))\n\n# Solve the system of equations to find the orthocenter\northocenter = solve((altitude_C, altitude_A), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\northocenter_rounded\nassistant > The orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A = (-4, 7), B = (-7, -2), and C = (0, 10) is \\((-21.333, 17.111)\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<(-21.333, 17.111)>>>"
