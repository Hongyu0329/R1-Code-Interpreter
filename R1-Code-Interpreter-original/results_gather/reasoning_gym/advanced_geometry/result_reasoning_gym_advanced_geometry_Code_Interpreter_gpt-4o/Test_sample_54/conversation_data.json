    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nLet's calculate the orthocenter step by step:\n\n1. Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes (perpendicular to the sides).\n3. Find the equations of the altitudes.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's start by calculating the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (7, 0)\nB = (-10, -8)\nC = (6, 10)\n\n# Function to calculate the slope between two points\ndef slope(point1, point2):\n    x1, y1 = point1\n    x2, y2 = point2\n    if x2 - x1 == 0:\n        return None  # Vertical line\n    return (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_CA = slope(C, A)\n\nslope_AB, slope_BC, slope_CA\nassistant > The slopes of the sides of the triangle are as follows:\n- Slope of \\( AB \\): \\( 0.471 \\)\n- Slope of \\( BC \\): \\( 1.125 \\)\n- Slope of \\( CA \\): \\( -10.0 \\)\n\nNext, we calculate the slopes of the altitudes, which are perpendicular to these sides. The slope of a line perpendicular to another line with slope \\( m \\) is \\( -\\frac{1}{m} \\).\n\nLet's calculate the slopes of the altitudes.# Function to calculate the perpendicular slope\ndef perpendicular_slope(slope):\n    if slope is None:\n        return 0  # Perpendicular to a vertical line is a horizontal line\n    elif slope == 0:\n        return None  # Perpendicular to a horizontal line is a vertical line\n    return -1 / slope\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes\nslope_altitude_A = perpendicular_slope(slope_BC)\nslope_altitude_B = perpendicular_slope(slope_CA)\nslope_altitude_C = perpendicular_slope(slope_AB)\n\nslope_altitude_A, slope_altitude_B, slope_altitude_C\nassistant > The slopes of the altitudes are as follows:\n- Slope of the altitude from \\( A \\): \\( -0.889 \\)\n- Slope of the altitude from \\( B \\): \\( 0.1 \\)\n- Slope of the altitude from \\( C \\): \\( -2.125 \\)\n\nNow, let's find the equations of these altitudes using the point-slope form of a line equation, \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) is a point on the line.\n\nWe'll then solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables for the coordinates of the orthocenter\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equations of the altitudes\n# Altitude from A\neq1 = Eq(y - A[1], slope_altitude_A * (x - A[0]))\n\n# Altitude from B\neq2 = Eq(y - B[1], slope_altitude_B * (x - B[0]))\n\n# Solve the system of equations to find the orthocenter\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\northocenter_rounded\nassistant > The orthocenter of the triangle with vertices \\( A = (7, 0) \\), \\( B = (-10, -8) \\), and \\( C = (6, 10) \\) is located at the coordinates \\((13.371, -5.663)\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<(13.371, -5.663)>>>}\n\\]"
