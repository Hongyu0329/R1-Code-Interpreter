    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\), we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nLet's calculate the slopes of the sides of the triangle and then find the equations of the altitudes.\n\n1. **Slope of side BC:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{y_C - y_B}{x_C - x_B} = \\frac{-10 - (-6)}{5 - 1} = \\frac{-4}{4} = -1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Slope of side AC:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{y_C - y_A}{x_C - x_A} = \\frac{-10 - 6}{5 - 2} = \\frac{-16}{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Slope of side AB:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A} = \\frac{-6 - 6}{1 - 2} = \\frac{-12}{-1} = 12\n   \\]\n\nThe altitudes are perpendicular to the sides, so their slopes are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides.\n\n- **Altitude from A (perpendicular to BC):** Slope = 1\n- **Altitude from B (perpendicular to AC):** Slope = \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\)\n- **Altitude from C (perpendicular to AB):** Slope = \\(-\\frac{1}{12}\\)\n\nLet's find the equations of two altitudes and solve for their intersection.\n\n1. **Equation of altitude from A:**\n   - Slope = 1\n   - Passes through A(2, 6)\n   \\[\n   y - 6 = 1(x - 2) \\implies y = x + 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Equation of altitude from B:**\n   - Slope = \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\)\n   - Passes through B(1, -6)\n   \\[\n   y + 6 = \\frac{3}{16}(x - 1) \\implies y = \\frac{3}{16}x - \\frac{3}{16} - 6\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's solve these two equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational\r\n\r\n# Define the variables\r\nx, y = symbols('x y')\r\n\r\n# Equation of altitude from A: y = x + 4\r\neq1 = Eq(y, x + 4)\r\n\r\n# Equation of altitude from B: y = (3/16)x - (3/16) - 6\r\neq2 = Eq(y, Rational(3, 16) * x - Rational(3, 16) - 6)\r\n\r\n# Solve the system of equations\r\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\r\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\r\northocenter_rounded\nassistant > The coordinates of the orthocenter of triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) are \\((-12.538, -8.538)\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<(-12.538, -8.538)>>>"
