    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of triangle \\(ABC\\), we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nLet's calculate the slopes of the sides of the triangle and then find the equations of the altitudes.\n\n1. **Slope of side \\(BC\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{1 - 5}{7 - (-10)} = \\frac{-4}{17}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Slope of side \\(AC\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{1 - (-2)}{7 - 10} = \\frac{3}{-3} = -1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Slope of side \\(AB\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{5 - (-2)}{-10 - 10} = \\frac{7}{-20} = -\\frac{7}{20}\n   \\]\n\nThe altitudes are perpendicular to the sides, so their slopes are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides.\n\n1. **Equation of the altitude from \\(A\\) (perpendicular to \\(BC\\)):**\n   - Slope of altitude from \\(A\\) = \\(-\\frac{1}{\\text{slope of } BC} = \\frac{17}{4}\\)\n   - Equation: \\(y - (-2) = \\frac{17}{4}(x - 10)\\)\n\n2. **Equation of the altitude from \\(B\\) (perpendicular to \\(AC\\)):**\n   - Slope of altitude from \\(B\\) = \\(-\\frac{1}{\\text{slope of } AC} = 1\\)\n   - Equation: \\(y - 5 = 1(x + 10)\\)\n\n3. **Equation of the altitude from \\(C\\) (perpendicular to \\(AB\\)):**\n   - Slope of altitude from \\(C\\) = \\(-\\frac{1}{\\text{slope of } AB} = \\frac{20}{7}\\)\n   - Equation: \\(y - 1 = \\frac{20}{7}(x - 7)\\)\n\nNow, let's solve the system of equations to find the intersection point of these altitudes, which will give us the orthocenter. We'll use the first two altitudes for this calculation.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A (perpendicular to BC)\neq1 = Eq(y + 2, Rational(17, 4) * (x - 10))\n\n# Equation of the altitude from B (perpendicular to AC)\neq2 = Eq(y - 5, 1 * (x + 10))\n\n# Solve the system of equations\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\northocenter_rounded\nassistant > The coordinates of the orthocenter of triangle \\(ABC\\) are \\((18.308, 33.308)\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<(18.308, 33.308)>>>"
