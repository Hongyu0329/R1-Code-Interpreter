    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nLet's denote the vertices of the triangle as follows:\n- \\( A = (1, 8) \\)\n- \\( B = (9, -10) \\)\n- \\( C = (-3, 6) \\)\n\nThe steps to find the orthocenter are as follows:\n\n1. Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle.\n2. Determine the slopes of the altitudes (which are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides).\n3. Write the equations of the altitudes.\n4. Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Vertices of the triangle\nA = (1, 8)\nB = (9, -10)\nC = (-3, 6)\n\n# Function to calculate the slope of a line given two points\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides of the triangle\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_CA = slope(C, A)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_CA\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equations of the altitudes\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Altitude from A to BC\naltitude_A = Eq(y - A[1], slope_altitude_A * (x - A[0]))\n\n# Altitude from B to CA\naltitude_B = Eq(y - B[1], slope_altitude_B * (x - B[0]))\n\n# Solve the system of equations to find the orthocenter\northocenter = solve((altitude_A, altitude_B), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\northocenter_rounded\nassistant > The orthocenter of the triangle with vertices \\( A = (1, 8) \\), \\( B = (9, -10) \\), and \\( C = (-3, 6) \\) is at the coordinates \\((0.273, 7.455)\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<(0.273, 7.455)>>>"
