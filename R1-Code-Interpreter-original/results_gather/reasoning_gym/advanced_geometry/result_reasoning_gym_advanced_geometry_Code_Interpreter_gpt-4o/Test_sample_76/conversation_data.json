    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nLet's calculate the orthocenter for the triangle with vertices \\( A = (-8, 2) \\), \\( B = (-2, 2) \\), and \\( C = (-4, -8) \\).\n\n1. **Find the slope of each side:**\n   - Slope of \\( AB \\): Since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) have the same y-coordinate, the line \\( AB \\) is horizontal, and its slope is 0.\n   - Slope of \\( BC \\): \\(\\frac{-8 - 2}{-4 + 2} = \\frac{-10}{-2} = 5\\)\n   - Slope of \\( CA \\): \\(\\frac{-8 - 2}{-4 + 8} = \\frac{-10}{4} = -2.5\\)\n\n2. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - The altitude from \\( C \\) to \\( AB \\) is a vertical line through \\( C \\) since \\( AB \\) is horizontal. Therefore, the equation is \\( x = -4 \\).\n   - The altitude from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\) is perpendicular to \\( BC \\). The slope of \\( BC \\) is 5, so the perpendicular slope is \\(-\\frac{1}{5}\\). Using point \\( A(-8, 2) \\), the equation is \\( y - 2 = -\\frac{1}{5}(x + 8) \\).\n   - The altitude from \\( B \\) to \\( CA \\) is perpendicular to \\( CA \\). The slope of \\( CA \\) is \\(-2.5\\), so the perpendicular slope is \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\). Using point \\( B(-2, 2) \\), the equation is \\( y - 2 = \\frac{2}{5}(x + 2) \\).\n\n3. **Find the intersection of two altitudes:**\n   - We can use the equations of the altitudes from \\( C \\) and \\( A \\) to find their intersection.\n\nLet's calculate the intersection point.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of the altitude from C to AB (vertical line)\neq1 = Eq(x, -4)\n\n# Equation of the altitude from A to BC\neq2 = Eq(y - 2, -1/5 * (x + 8))\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nintersection = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\nintersection\nassistant > The intersection of the altitudes from \\( C \\) and \\( A \\) is at the point \\((-4, 1.2)\\).\n\nTherefore, the orthocenter of the triangle is \\((-4, 1.2)\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<(-4, 1.200)>>>}\n\\]"
