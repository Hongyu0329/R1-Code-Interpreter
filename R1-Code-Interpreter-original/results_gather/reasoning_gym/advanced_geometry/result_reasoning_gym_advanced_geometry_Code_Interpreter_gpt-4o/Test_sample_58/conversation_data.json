    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nLet's calculate the orthocenter step by step:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides:**\n   - Slope of AB\n   - Slope of BC\n   - Slope of CA\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n   - The slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the equation of a line for the altitudes from C and A.\n\n4. **Find the intersection of the altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\n\nLet's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Vertices of the triangle\nA = (-8, 5)\nB = (8, 8)\nC = (-1, 10)\n\n# Calculate slopes of the sides\nslope_AB = (B[1] - A[1]) / (B[0] - A[0])\nslope_BC = (C[1] - B[1]) / (C[0] - B[0])\nslope_CA = (A[1] - C[1]) / (A[0] - C[0])\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Altitude from C\nequation_altitude_C = Eq(y - C[1], slope_altitude_C * (x - C[0]))\n\n# Altitude from A\nequation_altitude_A = Eq(y - A[1], slope_altitude_A * (x - A[0]))\n\n# Solve the system of equations to find the orthocenter\northocenter = solve((equation_altitude_C, equation_altitude_A), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\northocenter_rounded\nassistant > The orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A=(-8, 5), B=(8, 8), and C=(-1, 10) is at the coordinates \\((-3.695, 24.373)\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<(-3.695, 24.373)>>>"
