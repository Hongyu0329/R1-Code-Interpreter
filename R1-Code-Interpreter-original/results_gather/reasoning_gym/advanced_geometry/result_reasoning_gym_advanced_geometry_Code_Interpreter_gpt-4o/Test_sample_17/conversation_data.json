    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of triangle \\( ABC \\), we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. The altitudes are the perpendicular lines drawn from each vertex to the opposite side.\n\nLet's calculate the slopes of the sides of the triangle and then find the equations of the altitudes.\n\n1. **Slope of side \\( BC \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{6 - 0}{7 - (-7)} = \\frac{6}{14} = \\frac{3}{7}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Slope of side \\( AC \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{6 - 3}{7 - 1} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Slope of side \\( AB \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{0 - 3}{-7 - 1} = \\frac{-3}{-8} = \\frac{3}{8}\n   \\]\n\nThe altitudes are perpendicular to these sides, so their slopes are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides.\n\n- **Altitude from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\):** Perpendicular to \\( BC \\), slope = \\(-\\frac{7}{3}\\)\n- **Altitude from \\( B \\) to \\( AC \\):** Perpendicular to \\( AC \\), slope = \\(-2\\)\n- **Altitude from \\( C \\) to \\( AB \\):** Perpendicular to \\( AB \\), slope = \\(-\\frac{8}{3}\\)\n\nLet's find the equations of these altitudes and their intersection point, which is the orthocenter. We'll start with the altitudes from \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n1. **Equation of altitude from \\( A \\):**\n   \\[\n   y - 3 = -\\frac{7}{3}(x - 1)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Equation of altitude from \\( B \\):**\n   \\[\n   y - 0 = -2(x + 7)\n   \\]\n\nLet's solve these equations to find the intersection point.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of altitude from A\neq1 = Eq(y - 3, -Rational(7, 3) * (x - 1))\n\n# Equation of altitude from B\neq2 = Eq(y, -2 * (x + 7))\n\n# Solve the system of equations\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter\nassistant > The coordinates of the orthocenter of triangle \\( ABC \\) are \\((58, -130)\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<(58, -130)>>>}\n\\]"
