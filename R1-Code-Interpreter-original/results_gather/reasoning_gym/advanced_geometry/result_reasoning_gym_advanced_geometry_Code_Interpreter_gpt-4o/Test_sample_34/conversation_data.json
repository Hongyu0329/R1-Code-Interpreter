    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\), we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. The altitudes are the perpendicular lines drawn from each vertex to the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices:\n- \\( A = (-1, 3) \\)\n- \\( B = (-3, 4) \\)\n- \\( C = (-1, -2) \\)\n\nLet's calculate the slopes of the sides and then the slopes of the altitudes:\n\n1. **Slope of side BC**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{4 - (-2)}{-3 - (-1)} = \\frac{6}{-2} = -3\n   \\]\n   The slope of the altitude from A (perpendicular to BC) is the negative reciprocal of -3, which is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Slope of side AC**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{-2 - 3}{-1 - (-1)} = \\text{undefined (vertical line)}\n   \\]\n   The altitude from B (perpendicular to AC) is a horizontal line, so its slope is 0.\n\n3. **Slope of side AB**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{4 - 3}{-3 - (-1)} = \\frac{1}{-2} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   The slope of the altitude from C (perpendicular to AB) is the negative reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\), which is 2.\n\nNow, let's find the equations of the altitudes:\n\n- **Altitude from A**: Passes through A \\((-1, 3)\\) with slope \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n  \\[\n  y - 3 = \\frac{1}{3}(x + 1)\n  \\]\n\n- **Altitude from B**: Passes through B \\((-3, 4)\\) with slope 0.\n  \\[\n  y = 4\n  \\]\n\n- **Altitude from C**: Passes through C \\((-1, -2)\\) with slope 2.\n  \\[\n  y + 2 = 2(x + 1)\n  \\]\n\nLet's solve these equations to find the intersection point, which is the orthocenter.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equations of the altitudes\naltitude_A = Eq(y - 3, (1/3)*(x + 1))\naltitude_B = Eq(y, 4)\naltitude_C = Eq(y + 2, 2*(x + 1))\n\n# Solve for the intersection of altitude_A and altitude_B\nintersection_AB = solve((altitude_A, altitude_B), (x, y))\n\n# Solve for the intersection of altitude_B and altitude_C\nintersection_BC = solve((altitude_B, altitude_C), (x, y))\n\n# Solve for the intersection of altitude_A and altitude_C\nintersection_AC = solve((altitude_A, altitude_C), (x, y))\n\nintersection_AB, intersection_BC, intersection_AC\nassistant > The intersection of the altitudes, which is the orthocenter of triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\), is at the coordinates \\((2, 4)\\).\n\nThus, the orthocenter is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<(2, 4)>>>}\n\\]"
