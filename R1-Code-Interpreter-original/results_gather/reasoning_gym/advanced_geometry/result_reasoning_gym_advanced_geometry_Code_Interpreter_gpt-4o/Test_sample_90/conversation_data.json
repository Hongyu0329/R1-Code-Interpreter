    "\nassistant > To determine the angle at vertex B in the triangle with vertices A, B, and C, we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines states that for any triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and opposite angles \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) respectively, the following is true:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(C)\n\\]\n\nIn this case, we want to find the angle at vertex B, so we will use the coordinates of the points to find the lengths of the sides:\n\n- \\(AB\\) is the distance between points A and B.\n- \\(BC\\) is the distance between points B and C.\n- \\(AC\\) is the distance between points A and C.\n\nThe distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the lengths of the sides and then use the law of cosines to find the angle at B.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (-4, 9)\nB = (-1, -8)\nC = (1, -3)\n\n# Function to calculate the distance between two points\ndef distance(point1, point2):\n    return math.sqrt((point2[0] - point1[0])**2 + (point2[1] - point1[1])**2)\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nAB = distance(A, B)\nBC = distance(B, C)\nAC = distance(A, C)\n\n# Use the law of cosines to find the angle at B\n# cos(B) = (AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2) / (2 * AB * BC)\ncos_B = (AB**2 + BC**2 - AC**2) / (2 * AB * BC)\n\n# Calculate the angle in degrees\nangle_B = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_B))\nangle_B_rounded = round(angle_B, 3)\n\nangle_B_rounded\nassistant > The angle at vertex B is <<<31.809°>>>."
