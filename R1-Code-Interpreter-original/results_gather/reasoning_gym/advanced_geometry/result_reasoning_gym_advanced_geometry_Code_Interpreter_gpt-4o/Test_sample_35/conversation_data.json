    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- \\( A = (-7, 3) \\)\n- \\( B = (4, 3) \\)\n- \\( C = (-2, 9) \\)\n\nLet's calculate the slopes of the sides and then find the equations of the altitudes.\n\n1. **Slope of side BC:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{9 - 3}{-2 - 4} = \\frac{6}{-6} = -1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Slope of side AC:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{9 - 3}{-2 + 7} = \\frac{6}{5}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Slope of side AB:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{3 - 3}{4 + 7} = 0\n   \\]\n\nNow, we find the slopes of the altitudes, which are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the opposite sides:\n\n- **Altitude from A (perpendicular to BC):** Slope = 1\n- **Altitude from B (perpendicular to AC):** Slope = \\(-\\frac{5}{6}\\)\n- **Altitude from C (perpendicular to AB):** Slope = undefined (vertical line)\n\nNext, we find the equations of these altitudes:\n\n1. **Equation of altitude from A:**\n   \\[\n   y - 3 = 1(x + 7) \\implies y = x + 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Equation of altitude from B:**\n   \\[\n   y - 3 = -\\frac{5}{6}(x - 4) \\implies y = -\\frac{5}{6}x + \\frac{20}{6} + 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = -\\frac{5}{6}x + \\frac{38}{6}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equation of altitude from C:**\n   Since the slope is undefined, the line is vertical at \\( x = -2 \\).\n\nNow, we find the intersection of these altitudes to determine the orthocenter.\n\nLet's solve the system of equations for the altitudes from A and B:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= x + 10 \\\\\ny &= -\\frac{5}{6}x + \\frac{38}{6}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe will solve these equations to find the orthocenter.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equations of the altitudes\neq1 = Eq(y, x + 10)\neq2 = Eq(y, -Rational(5, 6)*x + Rational(38, 6))\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nintersection = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\nintersection\nassistant > The intersection of the altitudes from vertices A and B is at the point \\((-2, 8)\\). Since the altitude from vertex C is a vertical line at \\(x = -2\\), it also passes through this point.\n\nThus, the orthocenter of the triangle is \\((-2, 8)\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<(-2, 8)>>>}\n\\]"
