    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of triangle \\(ABC\\), we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or the line containing the opposite side).\n\nLet's calculate the slopes of the sides of the triangle and then find the equations of the altitudes.\n\n1. **Slope of side \\(BC\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } BC = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{9 - (-3)}{10 - 0} = \\frac{12}{10} = 1.2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Slope of side \\(AC\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AC = \\frac{9 - (-7)}{10 - 8} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Slope of side \\(AB\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{-3 - (-7)}{0 - 8} = \\frac{4}{-8} = -0.5\n   \\]\n\nThe altitudes are perpendicular to the sides, so their slopes are the negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides.\n\n- **Altitude from \\(A\\) to \\(BC\\):** Slope = \\(-\\frac{1}{1.2} = -\\frac{5}{6}\\)\n- **Altitude from \\(B\\) to \\(AC\\):** Slope = \\(-\\frac{1}{8}\\)\n- **Altitude from \\(C\\) to \\(AB\\):** Slope = \\(2\\)\n\nLet's find the equations of two altitudes and solve for their intersection.\n\n1. **Equation of altitude from \\(A\\) to \\(BC\\):**\n   \\[\n   y + 7 = -\\frac{5}{6}(x - 8)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Equation of altitude from \\(B\\) to \\(AC\\):**\n   \\[\n   y + 3 = -\\frac{1}{8}(x - 0)\n   \\]\n\nLet's solve these two equations to find the orthocenter.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation of altitude from A to BC\neq1 = Eq(y + 7, -Rational(5, 6) * (x - 8))\n\n# Equation of altitude from B to AC\neq2 = Eq(y + 3, -Rational(1, 8) * x)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\northocenter_rounded\nassistant > The coordinates of the orthocenter of triangle \\(ABC\\) are \\((3.765, -3.471)\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<3.765, -3.471>>>"
