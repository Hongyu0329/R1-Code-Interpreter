    "\nassistant > To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- \\( A = (-5, -5) \\)\n- \\( B = (-4, 2) \\)\n- \\( C = (-5, 7) \\)\n\nLet's calculate the slopes of the sides and then find the equations of the altitudes.\n\n1. **Slope of BC**: The slope of line BC is given by:\n   \\[\n   m_{BC} = \\frac{y_C - y_B}{x_C - x_B} = \\frac{7 - 2}{-5 - (-4)} = \\frac{5}{-1} = -5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Equation of the altitude from A**: The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\( m_{BC} \\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\). The equation of the line passing through A with this slope is:\n   \\[\n   y + 5 = \\frac{1}{5}(x + 5)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Slope of AC**: The slope of line AC is given by:\n   \\[\n   m_{AC} = \\frac{y_C - y_A}{x_C - x_A} = \\frac{7 - (-5)}{-5 - (-5)} = \\text{undefined (vertical line)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Equation of the altitude from B**: Since AC is vertical, the altitude from B is horizontal, passing through B. Thus, the equation is:\n   \\[\n   y = 2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Slope of AB**: The slope of line AB is given by:\n   \\[\n   m_{AB} = \\frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A} = \\frac{2 - (-5)}{-4 - (-5)} = \\frac{7}{1} = 7\n   \\]\n\n6. **Equation of the altitude from C**: The altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of \\( m_{AB} \\), which is \\(-\\frac{1}{7}\\). The equation of the line passing through C with this slope is:\n   \\[\n   y - 7 = -\\frac{1}{7}(x + 5)\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's solve the system of equations formed by the altitudes to find their intersection point, which is the orthocenter. We'll solve the equations of the altitudes from A and C.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational\r\n\r\n# Define the variables\r\nx, y = symbols('x y')\r\n\r\n# Equation of the altitude from A: y + 5 = (1/5)(x + 5)\r\neq1 = Eq(y + 5, Rational(1, 5) * (x + 5))\r\n\r\n# Equation of the altitude from C: y - 7 = -(1/7)(x + 5)\r\neq2 = Eq(y - 7, -Rational(1, 7) * (x + 5))\r\n\r\n# Solve the system of equations\r\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\r\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\r\northocenter_rounded\nassistant > The orthocenter of the triangle with vertices A=(-5, -5), B=(-4, 2), and C=(-5, 7) is at the coordinates \\((30, 2)\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<30, 2>>>"
