    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 5 litres of water using the available moves: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A (7 litres), B (10 litres), and C (10 litres). The goal is to achieve exactly 5 litres in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 10, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - State: A = 7, B = 3, C = 0\n\n3. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 3, C = 0\n\n4. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n5. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 3, B = 10, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - State: A = 7, B = 6, C = 0\n\n7. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 6, C = 0\n\n8. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 6, B = 0, C = 0\n\n9. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 6, B = 10, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - State: A = 7, B = 9, C = 0\n\n11. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 0\n\n12. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 7, B = 2, C = 0\n\n13. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 2, C = 0\n\n14. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 2, B = 0, C = 0\n\n15. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n    - State: A = 2, B = 10, C = 0\n\n16. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - State: A = 7, B = 5, C = 0\n\nNow, Jug B has exactly 5 litres of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\"]>>>"
