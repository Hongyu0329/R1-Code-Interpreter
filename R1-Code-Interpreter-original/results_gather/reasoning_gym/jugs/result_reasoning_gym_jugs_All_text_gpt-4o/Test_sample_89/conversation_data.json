    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and operations to get exactly 3 litres of water in one of the jugs. We have three jugs with capacities of 12 litres (Jug A), 6 litres (Jug B), and 13 litres (Jug C). The operations we can perform are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's break down the steps to achieve the target:\n\n1. **Fill Jug C**: Start by filling Jug C to its full capacity of 13 litres.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 13\n\n2. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty. Jug A can hold 12 litres, so after pouring, Jug A will be full, and Jug C will have 1 litre left.\n   - State: A = 12, B = 0, C = 1\n\n3. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug C.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 1\n\n4. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the remaining 1 litre from Jug C into Jug A.\n   - State: A = 1, B = 0, C = 0\n\n5. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 13 litres.\n   - State: A = 1, B = 0, C = 13\n\n6. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty. Jug A currently has 1 litre, so it can take 11 more litres. After pouring, Jug A will be full with 12 litres, and Jug C will have 2 litres left.\n   - State: A = 12, B = 0, C = 2\n\n7. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug C.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 2\n\n8. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the 2 litres from Jug C into Jug A.\n   - State: A = 2, B = 0, C = 0\n\n9. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 13 litres.\n   - State: A = 2, B = 0, C = 13\n\n10. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty. Jug A currently has 2 litres, so it can take 10 more litres. After pouring, Jug A will be full with 12 litres, and Jug C will have 3 litres left.\n    - State: A = 12, B = 0, C = 3\n\nNow, Jug C has exactly 3 litres, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>"
