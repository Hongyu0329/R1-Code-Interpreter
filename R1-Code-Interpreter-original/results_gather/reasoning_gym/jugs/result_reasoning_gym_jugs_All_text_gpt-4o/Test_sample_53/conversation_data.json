    "To solve this problem, we need to use the three jugs with capacities of 11 liters, 11 liters, and 12 liters to measure exactly 6 liters in any one of the jugs. We can achieve this by using the allowed operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n2. **Fill Jug C**: Fill the largest jug first to maximize the amount of water available for pouring.\n   - Action: 'fill C'\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 12\n\n3. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty.\n   - Action: 'pour C->A'\n   - Result: A = 11, B = 0, C = 1\n\n4. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug C.\n   - Action: 'empty A'\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 1\n\n5. **Pour from C to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - Action: 'pour C->A'\n   - Result: A = 1, B = 0, C = 0\n\n6. **Fill Jug C again**: Refill Jug C to continue the process.\n   - Action: 'fill C'\n   - Result: A = 1, B = 0, C = 12\n\n7. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Action: 'pour C->A'\n   - Result: A = 11, B = 0, C = 2\n\n8. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug C.\n   - Action: 'empty A'\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 2\n\n9. **Pour from C to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - Action: 'pour C->A'\n   - Result: A = 2, B = 0, C = 0\n\n10. **Fill Jug C again**: Refill Jug C to continue the process.\n    - Action: 'fill C'\n    - Result: A = 2, B = 0, C = 12\n\n11. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: 'pour C->A'\n    - Result: A = 11, B = 0, C = 3\n\n12. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug C.\n    - Action: 'empty A'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 3\n\n13. **Pour from C to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - Action: 'pour C->A'\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n14. **Fill Jug C again**: Refill Jug C to continue the process.\n    - Action: 'fill C'\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 12\n\n15. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: 'pour C->A'\n    - Result: A = 11, B = 0, C = 4\n\n16. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug C.\n    - Action: 'empty A'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 4\n\n17. **Pour from C to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - Action: 'pour C->A'\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 0\n\n18. **Fill Jug C again**: Refill Jug C to continue the process.\n    - Action: 'fill C'\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 12\n\n19. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: 'pour C->A'\n    - Result: A = 11, B = 0, C = 5\n\n20. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug C.\n    - Action: 'empty A'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 5\n\n21. **Pour from C to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - Action: 'pour C->A'\n    - Result: A = 5, B = 0, C = 0\n\n22. **Fill Jug C again**: Refill Jug C to continue the process.\n    - Action: 'fill C'\n    - Result: A = 5, B = 0, C = 12\n\n23. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: 'pour C->A'\n    - Result: A = 11, B = 0, C = 6\n\nAt this point, Jug C contains exactly 6 liters of water, which is the target amount. Therefore, the bomb is defused.\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>"
