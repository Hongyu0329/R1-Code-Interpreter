    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 11 liters of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 13 liters, B = 13 liters, and C = 7 liters. The goal is to have exactly 11 liters in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug A**: Start by filling Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - A = 13, B = 0, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour from A to C**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full.\n   - A = 6, B = 0, C = 7\n\n3. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C.\n   - A = 6, B = 0, C = 0\n\n4. **Pour from A to C**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug C again.\n   - A = 0, B = 0, C = 6\n\n5. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 13, B = 0, C = 6\n\n6. **Pour from A to C**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full.\n   - A = 12, B = 0, C = 7\n\n7. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C.\n   - A = 12, B = 0, C = 0\n\n8. **Pour from A to C**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug C again.\n   - A = 5, B = 0, C = 7\n\n9. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 13, B = 0, C = 7\n\n10. **Pour from A to C**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full.\n    - A = 11, B = 0, C = 7\n\nNow, Jug A has exactly 11 liters of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"empty C\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"empty C\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->C\"\n]\n```\n\nThus, the JSON-parsable list of moves is:\n\n<<<[\"fill A\", \"pour A->C\", \"empty C\", \"pour A->C\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->C\", \"empty C\", \"pour A->C\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->C\"]>>>"
