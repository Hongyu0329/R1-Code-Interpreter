    "To solve this problem, we need to use the three jugs with capacities of 13 liters for Jug A, 13 liters for Jug B, and 12 liters for Jug C to measure exactly 4 liters of water in any of the jugs. We can use the operations 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour' to achieve this.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug C**: Start by filling Jug C to its full capacity of 12 liters.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 12\n\n2. **Pour C into A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty.\n   - State: A = 12, B = 0, C = 0\n\n3. **Fill Jug C again**: Refill Jug C to its full capacity of 12 liters.\n   - State: A = 12, B = 0, C = 12\n\n4. **Pour C into A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A. Jug A can only take 1 more liter to be full (13 liters), so 1 liter is poured from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 13, B = 0, C = 11\n\n5. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 11\n\n6. **Pour C into A**: Pour the remaining 11 liters from Jug C into Jug A.\n   - State: A = 11, B = 0, C = 0\n\n7. **Fill Jug C again**: Refill Jug C to its full capacity of 12 liters.\n   - State: A = 11, B = 0, C = 12\n\n8. **Pour C into A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A. Jug A can only take 2 more liters to be full (13 liters), so 2 liters are poured from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 13, B = 0, C = 10\n\n9. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 10\n\n10. **Pour C into A**: Pour the remaining 10 liters from Jug C into Jug A.\n    - State: A = 10, B = 0, C = 0\n\n11. **Fill Jug C again**: Refill Jug C to its full capacity of 12 liters.\n    - State: A = 10, B = 0, C = 12\n\n12. **Pour C into A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A. Jug A can only take 3 more liters to be full (13 liters), so 3 liters are poured from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 13, B = 0, C = 9\n\n13. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 9\n\n14. **Pour C into A**: Pour the remaining 9 liters from Jug C into Jug A.\n    - State: A = 9, B = 0, C = 0\n\n15. **Fill Jug C again**: Refill Jug C to its full capacity of 12 liters.\n    - State: A = 9, B = 0, C = 12\n\n16. **Pour C into A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A. Jug A can only take 4 more liters to be full (13 liters), so 4 liters are poured from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 13, B = 0, C = 8\n\n17. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 8\n\n18. **Pour C into A**: Pour the remaining 8 liters from Jug C into Jug A.\n    - State: A = 8, B = 0, C = 0\n\n19. **Fill Jug C again**: Refill Jug C to its full capacity of 12 liters.\n    - State: A = 8, B = 0, C = 12\n\n20. **Pour C into A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A. Jug A can only take 5 more liters to be full (13 liters), so 5 liters are poured from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 13, B = 0, C = 7\n\n21. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 7\n\n22. **Pour C into A**: Pour the remaining 7 liters from Jug C into Jug A.\n    - State: A = 7, B = 0, C = 0\n\n23. **Fill Jug C again**: Refill Jug C to its full capacity of 12 liters.\n    - State: A = 7, B = 0, C = 12\n\n24. **Pour C into A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A. Jug A can only take 6 more liters to be full (13 liters), so 6 liters are poured from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 13, B = 0, C = 6\n\n25. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 6\n\n26. **Pour C into A**: Pour the remaining 6 liters from Jug C into Jug A.\n    - State: A = 6, B = 0, C = 0\n\n27. **Fill Jug C again**: Refill Jug C to its full capacity of 12 liters.\n    - State: A = 6, B = 0, C = 12\n\n28. **Pour C into A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A. Jug A can only take 7 more liters to be full (13 liters), so 7 liters are poured from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 13, B = 0, C = 5\n\n29. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 5\n\n30. **Pour C into A**: Pour the remaining 5 liters from Jug C into Jug A.\n    - State: A = 5, B = 0, C = 0\n\n31. **Fill Jug C again**: Refill Jug C to its full capacity of 12 liters.\n    - State: A = 5, B = 0, C = 12\n\n32. **Pour C into A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A. Jug A can only take 8 more liters to be full (13 liters), so 8 liters are poured from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 13, B = 0, C = 4\n\nNow, Jug C has exactly 4 liters of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>"
