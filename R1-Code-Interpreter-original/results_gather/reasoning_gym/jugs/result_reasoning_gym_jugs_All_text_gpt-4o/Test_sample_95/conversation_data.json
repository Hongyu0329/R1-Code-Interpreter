    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 8 litres of water using the available moves: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 5 litres, B = 11 litres, and C = 11 litres. The target is to have exactly 8 litres in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - B = 11 litres\n\n2. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - A = 5 litres, B = 6 litres\n\n3. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - A = 0 litres, B = 6 litres\n\n4. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - A = 5 litres, B = 1 litre\n\n5. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - A = 5 litres, B = 11 litres\n\n6. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - A = 5 litres, B = 11 - (5 - 5) = 7 litres\n\n7. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - A = 0 litres, B = 7 litres\n\n8. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - A = 5 litres, B = 2 litres\n\n9. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - A = 5 litres, B = 11 litres\n\n10. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - A = 5 litres, B = 11 - (5 - 5) = 8 litres\n\nNow, Jug B has exactly 8 litres of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n- Fill B\n- Pour B->A\n- Empty A\n- Pour B->A\n- Fill B\n- Pour B->A\n- Empty A\n- Pour B->A\n- Fill B\n- Pour B->A\n\nThe JSON-parsable list of moves is:\n\n<<<[\"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\"]>>>"
