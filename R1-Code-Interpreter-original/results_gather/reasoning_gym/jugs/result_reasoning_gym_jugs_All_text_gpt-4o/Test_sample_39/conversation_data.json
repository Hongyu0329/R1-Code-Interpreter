    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and operations to reach exactly 3 litres in one of the jugs. We have three jugs with capacities of 13 litres (Jug A), 12 litres (Jug B), and 6 litres (Jug C). The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's break down the steps to achieve the target:\n\n1. **Fill Jug C**: Start by filling Jug C to its full capacity of 6 litres.\n   - State: A: 0, B: 0, C: 6\n\n2. **Pour C into B**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug B. Jug B can hold 12 litres, so it will take all 6 litres from Jug C.\n   - State: A: 0, B: 6, C: 0\n\n3. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 6 litres.\n   - State: A: 0, B: 6, C: 6\n\n4. **Pour C into B again**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug B. Jug B already has 6 litres, and it can hold 12 litres, so it will take another 6 litres from Jug C, filling it completely.\n   - State: A: 0, B: 12, C: 0\n\n5. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A. Jug A can hold 13 litres, so it will take all 12 litres from Jug B.\n   - State: A: 12, B: 0, C: 0\n\n6. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 6 litres.\n   - State: A: 12, B: 0, C: 6\n\n7. **Pour C into A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A already has 12 litres, and it can hold 13 litres, so it will take 1 litre from Jug C, leaving 5 litres in Jug C.\n   - State: A: 13, B: 0, C: 5\n\n8. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A: 0, B: 0, C: 5\n\n9. **Pour C into A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A can hold 13 litres, so it will take all 5 litres from Jug C.\n   - State: A: 5, B: 0, C: 0\n\n10. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 6 litres.\n    - State: A: 5, B: 0, C: 6\n\n11. **Pour C into A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A already has 5 litres, and it can hold 13 litres, so it will take 3 litres from Jug C, leaving exactly 3 litres in Jug C.\n    - State: A: 8, B: 0, C: 3\n\nNow, Jug C has exactly 3 litres, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->B\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->B\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>"
