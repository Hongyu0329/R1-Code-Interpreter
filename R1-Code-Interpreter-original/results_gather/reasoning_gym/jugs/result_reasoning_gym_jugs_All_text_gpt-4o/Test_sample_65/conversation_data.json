    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 3 litres of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 9 litres, B = 9 litres, and C = 8 litres. All jugs start empty.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug C**: Start by filling Jug C to its full capacity.\n   - C = 8 litres\n\n2. **Pour C into A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A.\n   - A = 8 litres, C = 0 litres\n\n3. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n   - C = 8 litres\n\n4. **Pour C into A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Since Jug A can hold 9 litres and already has 8 litres, it will take only 1 litre from Jug C.\n   - A = 9 litres, C = 7 litres\n\n5. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - A = 0 litres\n\n6. **Pour C into A**: Pour the remaining 7 litres from Jug C into Jug A.\n   - A = 7 litres, C = 0 litres\n\n7. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n   - C = 8 litres\n\n8. **Pour C into A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A can hold 9 litres and currently has 7 litres, so it will take 2 litres from Jug C.\n   - A = 9 litres, C = 6 litres\n\n9. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - A = 0 litres\n\n10. **Pour C into A**: Pour the remaining 6 litres from Jug C into Jug A.\n    - A = 6 litres, C = 0 litres\n\n11. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n    - C = 8 litres\n\n12. **Pour C into A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A can hold 9 litres and currently has 6 litres, so it will take 3 litres from Jug C.\n    - A = 9 litres, C = 5 litres\n\n13. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - A = 0 litres\n\n14. **Pour C into A**: Pour the remaining 5 litres from Jug C into Jug A.\n    - A = 5 litres, C = 0 litres\n\n15. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n    - C = 8 litres\n\n16. **Pour C into A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A can hold 9 litres and currently has 5 litres, so it will take 4 litres from Jug C.\n    - A = 9 litres, C = 4 litres\n\n17. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - A = 0 litres\n\n18. **Pour C into A**: Pour the remaining 4 litres from Jug C into Jug A.\n    - A = 4 litres, C = 0 litres\n\n19. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n    - C = 8 litres\n\n20. **Pour C into A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A can hold 9 litres and currently has 4 litres, so it will take 5 litres from Jug C.\n    - A = 9 litres, C = 3 litres\n\nNow, Jug C has exactly 3 litres, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>"
