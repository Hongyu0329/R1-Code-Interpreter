    "To solve this problem, we need to use the three available jugs (A, B, and C) to measure exactly 6 litres of water in any one of them. We can use the operations 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour' to achieve this. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty.\n   - A = 0, B = 0, C = 0\n\n2. **Fill Jug C**: Since Jug C can hold 11 litres, we fill it completely.\n   - A = 0, B = 0, C = 11\n\n3. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty. Jug A can hold 10 litres.\n   - A = 10, B = 0, C = 1\n\n4. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - A = 0, B = 0, C = 1\n\n5. **Pour from C to A**: Pour the remaining 1 litre from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - A = 1, B = 0, C = 0\n\n6. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C completely.\n   - A = 1, B = 0, C = 11\n\n7. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty. Jug A can hold 10 litres, and it already has 1 litre.\n   - A = 10, B = 0, C = 2\n\n8. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - A = 0, B = 0, C = 2\n\n9. **Pour from C to A**: Pour the remaining 2 litres from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - A = 2, B = 0, C = 0\n\n10. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C completely.\n    - A = 2, B = 0, C = 11\n\n11. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty. Jug A can hold 10 litres, and it already has 2 litres.\n    - A = 10, B = 0, C = 3\n\n12. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - A = 0, B = 0, C = 3\n\n13. **Pour from C to A**: Pour the remaining 3 litres from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n14. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C completely.\n    - A = 3, B = 0, C = 11\n\n15. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty. Jug A can hold 10 litres, and it already has 3 litres.\n    - A = 10, B = 0, C = 4\n\n16. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - A = 0, B = 0, C = 4\n\n17. **Pour from C to A**: Pour the remaining 4 litres from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - A = 4, B = 0, C = 0\n\n18. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C completely.\n    - A = 4, B = 0, C = 11\n\n19. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty. Jug A can hold 10 litres, and it already has 4 litres.\n    - A = 10, B = 0, C = 5\n\n20. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - A = 0, B = 0, C = 5\n\n21. **Pour from C to A**: Pour the remaining 5 litres from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - A = 5, B = 0, C = 0\n\n22. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C completely.\n    - A = 5, B = 0, C = 11\n\n23. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty. Jug A can hold 10 litres, and it already has 5 litres.\n    - A = 10, B = 0, C = 6\n\n24. **Target Achieved**: Jug C now has exactly 6 litres of water.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>"
