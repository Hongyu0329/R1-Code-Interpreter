    "To solve this problem, we need to use the three jugs with capacities of 3 liters, 3 liters, and 11 liters to measure exactly 7 liters of water in one of the jugs. We can achieve this by using the allowed operations: fill, empty, and pour. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n2. **Step 1**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n   - Action: `fill C`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 11\n\n3. **Step 2**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Action: `pour C->A`\n   - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 8\n\n4. **Step 3**: Empty Jug A.\n   - Action: `empty A`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 8\n\n5. **Step 4**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full again.\n   - Action: `pour C->A`\n   - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 5\n\n6. **Step 5**: Empty Jug A again.\n   - Action: `empty A`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 5\n\n7. **Step 6**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Action: `pour C->A`\n   - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 2\n\n8. **Step 7**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n   - Action: `pour A->B`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 3, C = 2\n\n9. **Step 8**: Fill Jug C again.\n   - Action: `fill C`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 3, C = 11\n\n10. **Step 9**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 8\n\n11. **Step 10**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 8\n\n12. **Step 11**: Empty Jug B.\n    - Action: `empty B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 8\n\n13. **Step 12**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 3, C = 8\n\n14. **Step 13**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 5\n\n15. **Step 14**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 5\n\n16. **Step 15**: Empty Jug B.\n    - Action: `empty B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 5\n\n17. **Step 16**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 3, C = 5\n\n18. **Step 17**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 2\n\n19. **Step 18**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 2\n\n20. **Step 19**: Empty Jug B.\n    - Action: `empty B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 2\n\n21. **Step 20**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 3, C = 2\n\n22. **Step 21**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 0\n\n23. **Step 22**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 0\n\n24. **Step 23**: Empty Jug B.\n    - Action: `empty B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n25. **Step 24**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 3, C = 0\n\n26. **Step 25**: Fill Jug C again.\n    - Action: `fill C`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 3, C = 11\n\n27. **Step 26**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 8\n\n28. **Step 27**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 8\n\n29. **Step 28**: Empty Jug B.\n    - Action: `empty B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 8\n\n30. **Step 29**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 3, C = 8\n\n31. **Step 30**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 5\n\n32. **Step 31**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 5\n\n33. **Step 32**: Empty Jug B.\n    - Action: `empty B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 5\n\n34. **Step 33**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 3, C = 5\n\n35. **Step 34**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 2\n\n36. **Step 35**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 2\n\n37. **Step 36**: Empty Jug B.\n    - Action: `empty B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 2\n\n38. **Step 37**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 3, C = 2\n\n39. **Step 38**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 0\n\n40. **Step 39**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 3, C = 0\n\n41. **Step 40**: Empty Jug B.\n    - Action: `empty B`\n    - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n42. **Step 41**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 3, C = 0\n\n43. **"
