    "To solve this problem, we need to use the three jugs with capacities of 13 liters, 13 liters, and 5 liters to measure exactly 9 liters in one of the jugs. We can achieve this by using the operations 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n2. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill A'\n   - Result: A = 13, B = 0, C = 0\n\n3. **Pour from A to C**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full.\n   - Action: 'pour A->C'\n   - Result: A = 8, B = 0, C = 5\n\n4. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C.\n   - Action: 'empty C'\n   - Result: A = 8, B = 0, C = 0\n\n5. **Pour from A to C**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full.\n   - Action: 'pour A->C'\n   - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 5\n\n6. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill A'\n   - Result: A = 13, B = 0, C = 5\n\n7. **Pour from A to C**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full.\n   - Action: 'pour A->C'\n   - Result: A = 11, B = 0, C = 5\n\n8. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C.\n   - Action: 'empty C'\n   - Result: A = 11, B = 0, C = 0\n\n9. **Pour from A to C**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full.\n   - Action: 'pour A->C'\n   - Result: A = 6, B = 0, C = 5\n\n10. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill A'\n    - Result: A = 13, B = 0, C = 5\n\n11. **Pour from A to C**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full.\n    - Action: 'pour A->C'\n    - Result: A = 13, B = 0, C = 5\n\n12. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: 'pour A->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 13, C = 5\n\n13. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B.\n    - Action: 'empty B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 5\n\n14. **Pour from C to B**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug B.\n    - Action: 'pour C->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 5, C = 0\n\n15. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill C'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 5, C = 5\n\n16. **Pour from C to B**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: 'pour C->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 10, C = 0\n\n17. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill C'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 10, C = 5\n\n18. **Pour from C to B**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: 'pour C->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 13, C = 2\n\n19. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B.\n    - Action: 'empty B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 2\n\n20. **Pour from C to B**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug B.\n    - Action: 'pour C->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 2, C = 0\n\n21. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill C'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 2, C = 5\n\n22. **Pour from C to B**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: 'pour C->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 7, C = 0\n\n23. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill C'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 7, C = 5\n\n24. **Pour from C to B**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: 'pour C->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 12, C = 0\n\n25. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill C'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 12, C = 5\n\n26. **Pour from C to B**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: 'pour C->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 13, C = 4\n\n27. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B.\n    - Action: 'empty B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 4\n\n28. **Pour from C to B**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug B.\n    - Action: 'pour C->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 4, C = 0\n\n29. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill C'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 4, C = 5\n\n30. **Pour from C to B**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: 'pour C->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 9, C = 0\n\nNow, Jug B contains exactly 9 liters of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"empty C\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"empty C\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->B\"\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill A\", \"pour A->C\", \"empty C\", \"pour A->C\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->C\", \"empty C\", \"pour A->C\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->C\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour C->B\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->B\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour C->B\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->B\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour C->B\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->B\"]>>>"
