    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and operations to reach exactly 10 liters in one of the jugs. We have three jugs: A, B, and C, with capacities of 13, 6, and 13 liters respectively. The target is to have exactly 10 liters in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n2. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill A'\n   - Result: A = 13, B = 0, C = 0\n\n3. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 7, B = 6, C = 0 (since B can hold only 6 liters)\n\n4. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B to make room for more water from Jug A.\n   - Action: 'empty B'\n   - Result: A = 7, B = 0, C = 0\n\n5. **Pour from A to B again**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B again.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 1, B = 6, C = 0\n\n6. **Fill Jug A again**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill A'\n   - Result: A = 13, B = 6, C = 0\n\n7. **Pour from A to B again**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 7, B = 6, C = 0\n\n8. **Empty Jug B again**: Empty Jug B to make room for more water from Jug A.\n   - Action: 'empty B'\n   - Result: A = 7, B = 0, C = 0\n\n9. **Pour from A to B again**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B again.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 1, B = 6, C = 0\n\n10. **Fill Jug A again**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill A'\n    - Result: A = 13, B = 6, C = 0\n\n11. **Pour from A to C**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - Action: 'pour A->C'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 6, C = 13\n\n12. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty.\n    - Action: 'pour C->A'\n    - Result: A = 13, B = 6, C = 0\n\n13. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - Action: 'pour A->B'\n    - Result: A = 7, B = 6, C = 0\n\n14. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B to make room for more water from Jug A.\n    -
