    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 6 liters of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities of 12 liters (Jug A), 13 liters (Jug B), and 11 liters (Jug C). All jugs start empty.\n\nLet's analyze the steps to achieve the target:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill B'\n   - State: A: 0, B: 13, C: 0\n\n2. **Pour from Jug B to Jug C**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - Action: 'pour B->C'\n   - State: A: 0, B: 2, C: 11\n\n3. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C to make room for more water from Jug B.\n   - Action: 'empty C'\n   - State: A: 0, B: 2, C: 0\n\n4. **Pour remaining from Jug B to Jug C**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug C.\n   - Action: 'pour B->C'\n   - State: A: 0, B: 0, C: 2\n\n5. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n   - Action: 'fill B'\n   - State: A: 0, B: 13, C: 2\n\n6. **Pour from Jug B to Jug C**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - Action: 'pour B->C'\n   - State: A: 0, B: 4, C: 11\n\n7. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C again to make room for more water from Jug B.\n   - Action: 'empty C'\n   - State: A: 0, B: 4, C: 0\n\n8. **Pour remaining from Jug B to Jug C**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug C.\n   - Action: 'pour B->C'\n   - State: A: 0, B: 0, C: 4\n\n9. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n   - Action: 'fill B'\n   - State: A: 0, B: 13, C: 4\n\n10. **Pour from Jug B to Jug C**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - Action: 'pour B->C'\n    - State: A: 0, B: 6, C: 11\n\nAt this point, Jug B contains exactly 6 liters of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->C\",\n    \"empty C\",\n    \"pour B->C\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->C\",\n    \"empty C\",\n    \"pour B->C\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->C\"\n]\n```\n\nTherefore, the JSON-parsable list of moves is:\n\n<<<[\"fill B\", \"pour B->C\", \"empty C\", \"pour B->C\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->C\", \"empty C\", \"pour B->C\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->C\"]>>>"
