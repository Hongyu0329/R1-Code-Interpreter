    "To solve this problem, we need to use the three jugs with capacities of 11, 9, and 9 liters to measure exactly 3 liters in one of the jugs. We can achieve this by using the operations 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n2. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - A = 11, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n3. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - A = 2, B = 9, C = 0.\n\n4. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n   - A = 2, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n5. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n   - A = 0, B = 2, C = 0.\n\n6. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 11, B = 2, C = 0.\n\n7. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - A = 4, B = 9, C = 0.\n\n8. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n   - A = 4, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n9. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n   - A = 0, B = 4, C = 0.\n\n10. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 11, B = 4, C = 0.\n\n11. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - A = 6, B = 9, C = 0.\n\n12. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - A = 6, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n13. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - A = 0, B = 6, C = 0.\n\n14. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 11, B = 6, C = 0.\n\n15. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - A = 8, B = 9, C = 0.\n\n16. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - A = 8, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n17. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - A = 0, B = 8, C = 0.\n\n18. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 11, B = 8, C = 0.\n\n19. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - A = 10, B = 9, C = 0.\n\n20. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - A = 10, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n21. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - A = 1, B = 9, C = 0.\n\n22. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - A = 1, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n23. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - A = 0, B = 1, C = 0.\n\n24. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 11, B = 1, C = 0.\n\n25. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - A = 3, B = 9, C = 0.\n\nNow, Jug A has exactly 3 liters of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n<<<[\"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\"]>>>"
