    "To solve this puzzle, we need to use the three available jugs (A, B, and C) to measure exactly 2 litres of water in any of the jugs. We can achieve this by using the operations 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty.\n   - A = 0, B = 0, C = 0\n\n2. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n   - A = 0, B = 0, C = 9\n\n3. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - A = 5, B = 0, C = 4\n\n4. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - A = 0, B = 0, C = 4\n\n5. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A again.\n   - A = 4, B = 0, C = 0\n\n6. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 4, B = 0, C = 9\n\n7. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - A = 5, B = 0, C = 8\n\n8. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - A = 0, B = 0, C = 8\n\n9. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - A = 5, B = 0, C = 3\n\n10. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - A = 0, B = 0, C = 3\n\n11. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n12. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 3, B = 0, C = 9\n\n13. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - A = 5, B = 0, C = 7\n\n14. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - A = 0, B = 0, C = 7\n\n15. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - A = 5, B = 0, C = 2\n\nNow, Jug C has exactly 2 litres of water, which is our target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>"
