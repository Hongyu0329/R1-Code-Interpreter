    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and the allowed operations to get exactly 2 litres of water in one of the jugs. We have three jugs with capacities of 4 litres (Jug A), 9 litres (Jug B), and 13 litres (Jug C). The operations we can perform are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's break down the steps to achieve the target of 2 litres:\n\n1. **Fill Jug C**: Start by filling Jug C to its full capacity of 13 litres.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 13\n\n2. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Jug A can hold 4 litres, so after pouring, Jug C will have 13 - 4 = 9 litres left.\n   - State: A = 4, B = 0, C = 9\n\n3. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 9\n\n4. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A again**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Jug A can hold 4 litres, so after pouring, Jug C will have 9 - 4 = 5 litres left.\n   - State: A = 4, B = 0, C = 5\n\n5. **Empty Jug A again**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 5\n\n6. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A once more**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Jug A can hold 4 litres, so after pouring, Jug C will have 5 - 4 = 1 litre left.\n   - State: A = 4, B = 0, C = 1\n\n7. **Pour from Jug A to Jug B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B.\n   - Jug B can hold 9 litres, so after pouring, Jug A will have 0 litres, and Jug B will have 4 litres.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 4, C = 1\n\n8. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the remaining 1 litre from Jug C into Jug A.\n   - State: A = 1, B = 4, C = 0\n\n9. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 13 litres.\n   - State: A = 1, B = 4, C = 13\n\n10. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Jug A can hold 4 litres, so after pouring, Jug C will have 13 - 3 = 10 litres left.\n    - State: A = 4, B = 4, C = 10\n\n11. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 4, C = 10\n\n12. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Jug A can hold 4 litres, so after pouring, Jug C will have 10 - 4 = 6 litres left.\n    - State: A = 4, B = 4, C = 6\n\n13. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 4, C = 6\n\n14. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Jug A can hold 4 litres, so after pouring, Jug C will have 6 - 4 = 2 litres left.\n    - State: A = 4, B = 4, C = 2\n\nNow, Jug C has exactly 2 litres, which is our target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"pour A->B\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>"
