    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 6 litres of water using the available moves: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 7 litres, B = 9 litres, and C = 9 litres. The target is to have exactly 6 litres in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 9\n\n3. **Fill Jug B again**: Refill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 9\n\n4. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C. Since Jug C is already full, it can only take 0 litres, leaving Jug B with 9 litres.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 9\n\n5. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty. Jug C can take 9 litres, leaving Jug B with 0 litres.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 9\n\n7. **Fill Jug B again**: Refill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 9\n\n8. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C. Jug C can take 0 litres, leaving Jug B with 9 litres.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 9\n\n9. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty. Jug C can take 9 litres, leaving Jug B with 0 litres.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 9\n\n11. **Fill Jug B again**: Refill Jug B to its full capacity.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 9\n\n12. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C. Jug C can take 0 litres, leaving Jug B with 9 litres.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 9\n\n13. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 0\n\n14. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty. Jug C can take 9 litres, leaving Jug B with 0 litres.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 9\n\n15. **Fill Jug B again**: Refill Jug B to its full capacity.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 9\n\n16. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C.

Jug C can take 9 litres, leaving Jug B with 0 litres.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 9\n\n19. **Fill Jug B again**: Refill Jug B to its full capacity.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 9\n\n20. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C.
