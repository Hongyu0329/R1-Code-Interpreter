    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and operations to reach exactly 7 liters in one of the jugs. We have three jugs with capacities of 8 liters (Jug A), 13 liters (Jug B), and 13 liters (Jug C). The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's break down the steps to achieve the target:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n2. **Fill Jug B**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill B'\n   - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 0\n\n3. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 8, B = 5, C = 0\n\n4. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - Action: 'empty A'\n   - State: A = 0, B = 5, C = 0\n\n5. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 5, B = 0, C = 0\n\n6. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill B'\n   - State: A = 5, B = 13, C = 0\n\n7. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 8, B = 10, C = 0\n\n8. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - Action: 'empty A'\n   - State: A = 0, B = 10, C = 0\n\n9. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 8, B = 2, C = 0\n\n10. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill B'\n    - State: A = 8, B = 13, C = 0\n\n11. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - Action: 'pour B->A'\n    - State: A = 8, B = 13 - (8 - 0) = 7, C = 0\n\nAt this point, Jug B contains exactly 7 liters of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this is as follows:\n\n<<<[\"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\"]>>>"
