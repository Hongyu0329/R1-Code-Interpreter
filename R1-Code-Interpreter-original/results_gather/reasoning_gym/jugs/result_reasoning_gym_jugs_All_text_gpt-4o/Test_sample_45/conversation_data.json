    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and operations to reach exactly 5 liters in one of the jugs. We have three jugs with capacities of 4 liters (Jug A), 4 liters (Jug B), and 11 liters (Jug C). The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's break down the steps to achieve the target:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n2. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n   - Action: `fill C`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 11\n\n3. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Action: `pour C->A`\n   - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 7\n\n4. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - Action: `empty A`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 7\n\n5. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full again.\n   - Action: `pour C->A`\n   - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 3\n\n6. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely again.\n   - Action: `empty A`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 3\n\n7. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - Action: `pour C->A`\n   - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n8. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity again.\n   - Action: `fill C`\n   - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 11\n\n9. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Action: `pour C->A`\n   - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 10\n\n10. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - Action: `empty A`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 10\n\n11. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 6\n\n12. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - Action: `empty A`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 6\n\n13. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 2\n\n14. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity again.\n    - Action: `fill C`\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 11\n\n15. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 11\n\n16. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - Action: `empty A`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 11\n\n17. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 7\n\n18. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - Action: `empty A`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 7\n\n19. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 3\n\n20. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity again.\n    -
