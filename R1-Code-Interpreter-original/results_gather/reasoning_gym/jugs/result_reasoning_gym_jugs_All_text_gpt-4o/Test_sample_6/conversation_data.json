    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 2 litres of water using the available moves: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A: 4 litres, B: 11 litres, and C: 11 litres. The goal is to have exactly 2 litres in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug A**: Start by filling Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill A'\n   - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour from Jug A to Jug B**: Pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 4, C = 0\n\n3. **Fill Jug A again**: Refill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill A'\n   - Result: A = 4, B = 4, C = 0\n\n4. **Pour from Jug A to Jug B again**: Pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B. Since Jug B can hold 11 litres and currently has 4 litres, it can take all 4 litres from Jug A.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 8, C = 0\n\n5. **Fill Jug A again**: Refill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill A'\n   - Result: A = 4, B = 8, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour from Jug A to Jug B again**: Pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B. Jug B currently has 8 litres and can take 3 more litres to reach its full capacity of 11 litres.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 1, B = 11, C = 0\n\n7. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n   - Action: 'empty B'\n   - Result: A = 1, B = 0, C = 0\n\n8. **Pour from Jug A to Jug B**: Pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n\n9. **Fill Jug A again**: Refill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill A'\n   - Result: A = 4, B = 1, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour from Jug A to Jug B**: Pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B. Jug B currently has 1 litre and can take 10 more litres to reach its full capacity of 11 litres.\n    - Action: 'pour A->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 5, C = 0\n\n11. **Fill Jug A again**: Refill Jug A to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill A'\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 5, C = 0\n\n12. **Pour from Jug A to Jug B**: Pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B. Jug B currently has 5 litres and can take 6 more litres to reach its full capacity of 11 litres.\n    - Action: 'pour A->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 9, C = 0\n\n13. **Fill Jug A again**: Refill Jug A to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill A'\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 9, C = 0\n\n14. **Pour from Jug A to Jug B**: Pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B. Jug B currently has 9 litres and can take 2 more litres to reach its full capacity of 11 litres.\n    - Action: 'pour A->B'\n    - Result: A = 2, B = 11, C = 0\n\nNow, Jug A has exactly 2 litres, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is:\n\n<<<[\"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\"]>>>"
