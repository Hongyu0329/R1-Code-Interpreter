    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 5 litres of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 10 litres, B = 13 litres, and C = 13 litres. All jugs start empty.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - Jug A can hold 10 litres, so pour 10 litres from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 10, B = 3, C = 0\n\n3. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 3, C = 0\n\n4. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining 3 litres from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n5. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 3, B = 13, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - Jug A can hold 7 more litres (10 - 3), so pour 7 litres from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 10, B = 6, C = 0\n\n7. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 6, C = 0\n\n8. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining 6 litres from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 6, B = 0, C = 0\n\n9. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 6, B = 13, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - Jug A can hold 4 more litres (10 - 6), so pour 4 litres from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 10, B = 9, C = 0\n\n11. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 0\n\n12. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining 9 litres from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 9, B = 0, C = 0\n\n13. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n    - State: A = 9, B = 13, C = 0\n\n14. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - Jug A can hold 1 more litre (10 - 9), so pour 1 litre from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 10, B = 12, C = 0\n\n15. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 12, C = 0\n\n16. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining 12 litres from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 10, B = 2, C = 0\n\n17. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n    - State: A = 10, B = 13, C = 0\n\n18. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - Jug A can hold 0 more litres (10 - 10), so pour 0 litres from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 10, B = 13, C = 0\n\n19. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 0\n\n20. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining 13 litres from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 10, B = 3, C = 0\n\n21. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n    - State: A = 10, B = 13, C = 0\n\n22. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - Jug A can hold 0 more litres (10 - 10), so pour 0 litres from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 10, B = 13, C = 0\n\n23. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 0\n\n24. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining 13 litres from Jug B to Jug A.\n    -
