    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and operations to get exactly 5 liters of water in one of the jugs. We have three jugs with capacities of 11 liters (Jug A), 7 liters (Jug B), and 11 liters (Jug C). The operations we can perform are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity of 7 liters.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A. Jug A can hold 11 liters, so it will take all 7 liters from Jug B.\n   - State: A = 7, B = 0, C = 0\n\n3. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity of 7 liters.\n   - State: A = 7, B = 7, C = 0\n\n4. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A. Jug A already has 7 liters and can hold 4 more liters (11 - 7 = 4). So, 4 liters will be poured from Jug B to Jug A, leaving 3 liters in Jug B.\n   - State: A = 11, B = 3, C = 0\n\n5. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 3, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A. Jug A can hold 11 liters, so it will take all 3 liters from Jug B.\n   - State: A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n7. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity of 7 liters.\n   - State: A = 3, B = 7, C = 0\n\n8. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A. Jug A already has 3 liters and can hold 8 more liters (11 - 3 = 8). So, 7 liters will be poured from Jug B to Jug A, leaving 0 liters in Jug B.\n   - State: A = 10, B = 0, C = 0\n\n9. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity of 7 liters.\n   - State: A = 10, B = 7, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A. Jug A already has 10 liters and can hold 1 more liter (11 - 10 = 1). So, 1 liter will be poured from Jug B to Jug A, leaving 6 liters in Jug B.\n    - State: A = 11, B = 6, C = 0\n\n11. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 6, C = 0\n\n12. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A. Jug A can hold 11 liters, so it will take all 6 liters from Jug B.\n    - State: A = 6, B = 0, C = 0\n\n13. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity of 7 liters.\n    - State: A = 6, B = 7, C = 0\n\n14. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A. Jug A already has 6 liters and can hold 5 more liters (11 - 6 = 5). So, 5 liters will be poured from Jug B to Jug A, leaving 2 liters in Jug B.\n    - State: A = 11, B = 2, C = 0\n\n15. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 2, C = 0\n\n16. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A. Jug A can hold 11 liters, so it will take all 2 liters from Jug B.\n    - State: A = 2, B = 0, C = 0\n\n17. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity of 7 liters.\n    - State: A = 2, B = 7, C = 0\n\n18. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A. Jug A already has 2 liters and can hold 9 more liters (11 - 2 = 9). So, 7 liters will be poured from Jug B to Jug A, leaving 0 liters in Jug B.\n    - State: A = 9, B = 0, C = 0\n\n19. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity of 7 liters.\n    - State: A = 9, B = 7, C = 0\n\n20. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A. Jug A already has 9 liters and can hold 2 more liters (11 - 9 = 2). So, 2 liters will be poured from Jug B to Jug A, leaving 5 liters in Jug B.\n    - State: A = 11, B = 5, C = 0\n\nNow, Jug B has exactly 5 liters, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\"]>>>"
