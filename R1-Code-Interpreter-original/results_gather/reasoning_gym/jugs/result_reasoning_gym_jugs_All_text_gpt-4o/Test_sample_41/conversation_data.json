    "To solve this problem, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 8 liters of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 11 liters, B = 11 liters, and C = 6 liters. The goal is to have exactly 8 liters in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug C**: Start by filling Jug C to its full capacity.\n   - C = 6 liters\n\n2. **Pour C into A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A.\n   - A = 6 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n3. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n   - C = 6 liters\n\n4. **Pour C into A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Since Jug A can hold 11 liters, it can take all 6 liters from Jug C.\n   - A = 11 liters, C = 1 liter\n\n5. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - A = 0 liters\n\n6. **Pour C into A**: Pour the remaining 1 liter from Jug C into Jug A.\n   - A = 1 liter, C = 0 liters\n\n7. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n   - C = 6 liters\n\n8. **Pour C into A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A now has 1 liter, and it can take 6 more liters from Jug C.\n   - A = 7 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n9. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n   - C = 6 liters\n\n10. **Pour C into A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A now has 7 liters, and it can take 4 more liters from Jug C, but since C only has 6 liters, it will take all 6 liters.\n    - A = 11 liters, C = 2 liters\n\n11. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - A = 0 liters\n\n12. **Pour C into A**: Pour the remaining 2 liters from Jug C into Jug A.\n    - A = 2 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n13. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n    - C = 6 liters\n\n14. **Pour C into A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A now has 2 liters, and it can take 6 more liters from Jug C.\n    - A = 8 liters, C = 0 liters\n\nNow, Jug A has exactly 8 liters, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>"
