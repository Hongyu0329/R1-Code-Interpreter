    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 8 liters of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 9 liters, B = 7 liters, and C = 9 liters. The goal is to have exactly 8 liters in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug A**: Start by filling Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - A = 9, B = 0, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour A into B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - A = 2, B = 7, C = 0\n\n3. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n   - A = 2, B = 0, C = 0\n\n4. **Pour A into B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A into Jug B.\n   - A = 0, B = 2, C = 0\n\n5. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 9, B = 2, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour A into B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - A = 4, B = 7, C = 0\n\n7. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n   - A = 4, B = 0, C = 0\n\n8. **Pour A into B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A into Jug B.\n   - A = 0, B = 4, C = 0\n\n9. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 9, B = 4, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour A into B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - A = 6, B = 7, C = 0\n\n11. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - A = 6, B = 0, C = 0\n\n12. **Pour A into B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A into Jug B.\n    - A = 0, B = 6, C = 0\n\n13. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 9, B = 6, C = 0\n\n14. **Pour A into B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - A = 8, B = 7, C = 0\n\nNow, Jug A has exactly 8 liters of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\"\n]\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\"]>>>"
