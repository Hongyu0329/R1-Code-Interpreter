    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 3 litres of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A (6 litres), B (7 litres), and C (7 litres). The goal is to achieve exactly 3 litres in any of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 7\n\n3. **Fill Jug B again**: Refill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 7\n\n4. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C. Since Jug C is already full, only 0 litres can be poured, leaving Jug B with 7 litres.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 7\n\n5. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C to make room for more water.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty. This will leave Jug B with 0 litres and Jug C with 7 litres.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 7\n\n7. **Fill Jug B again**: Refill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 7\n\n8. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C. Since Jug C is already full, only 0 litres can be poured, leaving Jug B with 7 litres.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 7\n\n9. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C to make room for more water.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty. This will leave Jug B with 0 litres and Jug C with 7 litres.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 7\n\n11. **Fill Jug B again**: Refill Jug B to its full capacity.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 7\n\n12. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C. Since Jug C is already full, only 0 litres can be poured, leaving Jug B with 7 litres.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 7\n\n13. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C to make room for more water.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 0\n\n14. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty.

This will leave Jug B with 0 litres and Jug C with 7 litres.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 7\n\n19. **Fill Jug B again**: Refill Jug B to its full capacity.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 7\n\n20. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C.
