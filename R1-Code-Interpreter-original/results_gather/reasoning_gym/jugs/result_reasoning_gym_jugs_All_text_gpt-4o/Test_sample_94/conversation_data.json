    "To solve this problem, we need to use the three jugs with capacities of 11 liters (Jug A), 11 liters (Jug B), and 6 liters (Jug C) to measure exactly 3 liters of water in any of the jugs. We can use the operations 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour' to achieve this.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug C**: Start by filling Jug C to its full capacity of 6 liters.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 6\n\n2. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A can hold 11 liters, so it will take all 6 liters from Jug C.\n   - State: A = 6, B = 0, C = 0\n\n3. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 6 liters.\n   - State: A = 6, B = 0, C = 6\n\n4. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A already has 6 liters, and it can hold up to 11 liters, so it will take 5 more liters from Jug C.\n   - State: A = 11, B = 0, C = 1\n\n5. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 1\n\n6. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the remaining 1 liter from Jug C into Jug A.\n   - State: A = 1, B = 0, C = 0\n\n7. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 6 liters.\n   - State: A = 1, B = 0, C = 6\n\n8. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A already has 1 liter, and it can hold up to 11 liters, so it will take 6 more liters from Jug C.\n   - State: A = 7, B = 0, C = 0\n\n9. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 6 liters.\n   - State: A = 7, B = 0, C = 6\n\n10. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A already has 7 liters, and it can hold up to 11 liters, so it will take 4 more liters from Jug C.\n    - State: A = 11, B = 0, C = 2\n\n11. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 2\n\n12. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the remaining 2 liters from Jug C into Jug A.\n    - State: A = 2, B = 0, C = 0\n\n13. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 6 liters.\n    - State: A = 2, B = 0, C = 6\n\n14. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A already has 2 liters, and it can hold up to 11 liters, so it will take 6 more liters from Jug C.\n    - State: A = 8, B = 0, C = 0\n\n15. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 6 liters.\n    - State: A = 8, B = 0, C = 6\n\n16. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the contents of Jug C into Jug A. Jug A already has 8 liters, and it can hold up to 11 liters, so it will take 3 more liters from Jug C.\n    - State: A = 11, B = 0, C = 3\n\nNow, Jug C has exactly 3 liters, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>"
