    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 10 litres of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 13 litres, B = 13 litres, and C = 4 litres. The goal is to have exactly 10 litres in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug A**: Start by filling Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - A = 13, B = 0, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour from A to C**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full.\n   - A = 9, B = 0, C = 4\n\n3. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C to make room for more water from Jug A.\n   - A = 9, B = 0, C = 0\n\n4. **Pour from A to C again**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full.\n   - A = 5, B = 0, C = 4\n\n5. **Empty Jug C again**: Empty Jug C to make room for more water from Jug A.\n   - A = 5, B = 0, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour from A to C again**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full.\n   - A = 1, B = 0, C = 4\n\n7. **Fill Jug A again**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - A = 13, B = 0, C = 4\n\n8. **Pour from A to C**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full. Since Jug C already has 4 litres, it can only take 0 more litres, so we pour 3 litres from A to C.\n   - A = 10, B = 0, C = 4\n\nNow, Jug A has exactly 10 litres of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n1. \"fill A\"\n2. \"pour A->C\"\n3. \"empty C\"\n4. \"pour A->C\"\n5. \"empty C\"\n6. \"pour A->C\"\n7. \"fill A\"\n8. \"pour A->C\"\n\nThus, the JSON-parsable list of moves is:\n\n<<<[\"fill A\", \"pour A->C\", \"empty C\", \"pour A->C\", \"empty C\", \"pour A->C\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->C\"]>>>"
