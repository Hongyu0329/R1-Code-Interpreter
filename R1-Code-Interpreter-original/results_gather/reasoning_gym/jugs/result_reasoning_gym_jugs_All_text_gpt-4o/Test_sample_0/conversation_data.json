    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 7 liters of water using the available moves: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 13 liters, B = 4 liters, and C = 13 liters. The goal is to have exactly 7 liters in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - B = 4 liters\n\n2. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A.\n   - A = 4 liters, B = 0 liters\n\n3. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 4 liters, B = 4 liters\n\n4. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A.\n   - A = 8 liters, B = 0 liters\n\n5. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - A = 0 liters, B = 0 liters\n\n6. **Pour A into C**: Pour the contents of Jug A into Jug C (though A is empty, this is a preparatory step).\n   - A = 0 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n7. **Fill Jug B**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n   - B = 4 liters\n\n8. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A.\n   - A = 4 liters, B = 0 liters\n\n9. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 4 liters, B = 4 liters\n\n10. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A.\n    - A = 8 liters, B = 0 liters\n\n11. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 8 liters, B = 4 liters\n\n12. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A.\n    - A = 12 liters, B = 0 liters\n\n13. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 12 liters, B = 4 liters\n\n14. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A.\n    - A = 13 liters, B = 3 liters\n\n15. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - A = 0 liters, B = 3 liters\n\n16. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A.\n    - A = 3 liters, B = 0 liters\n\n17. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 3 liters, B = 4 liters\n\n18. **Pour B into A**: Pour the contents of Jug B into Jug A.\n    - A = 7 liters, B = 0 liters\n\nNow, Jug A has exactly 7 liters of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n<<<[\"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\"]>>>"
