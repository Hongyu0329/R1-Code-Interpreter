    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and operations to get exactly 3 liters of water in one of the jugs. We have three jugs with capacities of 6 liters (Jug A), 7 liters (Jug B), and 7 liters (Jug C). The operations we can perform are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's break down the steps to achieve the target:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity of 7 liters.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty. Since both have the same capacity, Jug C will be full, and Jug B will be empty.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 7\n\n3. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity of 7 liters.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 7\n\n4. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C. Jug C can only hold 7 liters, and it is already full, so only 0 liters can be poured, leaving Jug B with 7 liters.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 7\n\n5. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C to make room for more water.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C. Jug C can hold 7 liters, so it will take all 7 liters from Jug B.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 7\n\n7. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity of 7 liters.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 7\n\n8. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C. Jug C can only hold 7 liters, and it is already full, so only 0 liters can be poured, leaving Jug B with 7 liters.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 7\n\n9. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C to make room for more water.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C. Jug C can hold 7 liters, so it will take all 7 liters from Jug B.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 7\n\n11. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity of 7 liters.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 7\n\n12. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C. Jug C can only hold 7 liters, and it is already full, so only 0 liters can be poured, leaving Jug B with 7 liters.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 7\n\n13. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C to make room for more water.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 0\n\n14. **Pour B into C**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug C.
