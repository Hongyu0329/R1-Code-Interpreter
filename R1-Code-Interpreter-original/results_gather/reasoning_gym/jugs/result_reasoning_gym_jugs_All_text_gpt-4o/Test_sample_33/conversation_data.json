    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 3 litres of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 11 litres, B = 9 litres, and C = 9 litres. All jugs start empty.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug A**: Start by filling Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - A = 11, B = 0, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - A = 2, B = 9, C = 0\n\n3. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n   - A = 2, B = 0, C = 0\n\n4. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n   - A = 0, B = 2, C = 0\n\n5. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 11, B = 2, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - A = 4, B = 9, C = 0\n\n7. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n   - A = 4, B = 0, C = 0\n\n8. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n   - A = 0, B = 4, C = 0\n\n9. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 11, B = 4, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - A = 6, B = 9, C = 0\n\n11. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - A = 6, B = 0, C = 0\n\n12. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - A = 0, B = 6, C = 0\n\n13. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 11, B = 6, C = 0\n\n14. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - A = 8, B = 9, C = 0\n\n15. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - A = 8, B = 0, C = 0\n\n16. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - A = 0, B = 8, C = 0\n\n17. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 11, B = 8, C = 0\n\n18. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - A = 10, B = 9, C = 0\n\n19. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - A = 10, B = 0, C = 0\n\n20. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - A = 1, B = 9, C = 0\n\n21. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - A = 1, B = 0, C = 0\n\n22. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n\n23. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 11, B = 1, C = 0\n\n24. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - A = 3, B = 9, C = 0\n\nNow, Jug A has exactly 3 litres of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<[\"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\"]>>>"
