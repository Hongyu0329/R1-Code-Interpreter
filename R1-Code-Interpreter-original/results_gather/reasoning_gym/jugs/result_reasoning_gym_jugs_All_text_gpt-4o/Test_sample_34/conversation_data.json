    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 12 liters of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 11 liters, B = 13 liters, and C = 13 liters. The target is to have exactly 12 liters in one of the jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - B = 13 liters\n\n2. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - A = 11 liters, B = 2 liters\n\n3. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug B.\n   - A = 0 liters, B = 2 liters\n\n4. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - A = 2 liters, B = 0 liters\n\n5. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 2 liters, B = 13 liters\n\n6. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - A = 11 liters, B = 4 liters\n\n7. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug B.\n   - A = 0 liters, B = 4 liters\n\n8. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - A = 4 liters, B = 0 liters\n\n9. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 4 liters, B = 13 liters\n\n10. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - A = 11 liters, B = 6 liters\n\n11. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug B.\n    - A = 0 liters, B = 6 liters\n\n12. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - A = 6 liters, B = 0 liters\n\n13. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 6 liters, B = 13 liters\n\n14. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - A = 11 liters, B = 8 liters\n\n15. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug B.\n    - A = 0 liters, B = 8 liters\n\n16. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - A = 8 liters, B = 0 liters\n\n17. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 8 liters, B = 13 liters\n\n18. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - A = 11 liters, B = 10 liters\n\n19. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug B.\n    - A = 0 liters, B = 10 liters\n\n20. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - A = 10 liters, B = 0 liters\n\n21. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 10 liters, B = 13 liters\n\n22. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - A = 11 liters, B = 12 liters\n\nNow, Jug B has exactly 12 liters of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\"]>>>"
