    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 11 liters of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 10 liters, B = 13 liters, and C = 13 liters. The target is to have exactly 11 liters in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour from B to C**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 13\n\n3. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 13\n\n4. **Pour from B to C**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug C. Since Jug C is already full, it can only take 0 liters, so Jug B remains unchanged.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 13\n\n5. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C to make room for more water.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour from B to C**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 13\n\n7. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 13\n\n8. **Pour from B to C**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug C. Jug C can take 0 liters, so Jug B remains unchanged.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 13\n\n9. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C to make room for more water.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour from B to C**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 13\n\n11. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 13\n\n12. **Pour from B to C**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug C. Jug C can take 0 liters, so Jug B remains unchanged.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 13\n\n13. **Empty Jug C**: Empty Jug C to make room for more water.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 0\n\n14. **Pour from B to C**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug C until Jug C is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 13\n\n15. **Fill Jug B again**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 13\n\n16. **Pour from B to C**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug C.
