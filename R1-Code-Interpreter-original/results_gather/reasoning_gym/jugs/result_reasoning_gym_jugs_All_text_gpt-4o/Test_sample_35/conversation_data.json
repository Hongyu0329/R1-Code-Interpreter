    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and operations to reach exactly 4 litres in one of the jugs. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 11 litres, B = 12 litres, and C = 12 litres. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's break down the steps to achieve the target:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 12, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - State: A = 11, B = 1, C = 0\n\n3. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n\n4. **Pour B into A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B into Jug A.\n   - State: A = 1, B = 0, C = 0\n\n5. **Fill Jug B**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n   - State: A = 1, B = 12, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - State: A = 11, B = 2, C = 0\n\n7. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 2, C = 0\n\n8. **Pour B into A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B into Jug A.\n   - State: A = 2, B = 0, C = 0\n\n9. **Fill Jug B**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n   - State: A = 2, B = 12, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - State: A = 11, B = 3, C = 0\n\n11. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 3, C = 0\n\n12. **Pour B into A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B into Jug A.\n    - State: A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n13. **Fill Jug B**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n    - State: A = 3, B = 12, C = 0\n\n14. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - State: A = 11, B = 4, C = 0\n\nAt this point, Jug B contains exactly 4 litres of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\"]>>>"
