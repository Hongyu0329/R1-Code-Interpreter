    "To solve this problem, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 8 liters of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 5 liters, B = 11 liters, and C = 5 liters. The target is to have exactly 8 liters in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill B'\n   - State: A = 0, B = 11, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 5, B = 6, C = 0\n\n3. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - Action: 'empty A'\n   - State: A = 0, B = 6, C = 0\n\n4. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A again until Jug A is full.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 5, B = 1, C = 0\n\n5. **Fill Jug B**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n   - Action: 'fill B'\n   - State: A = 5, B = 11, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 5, B = 6, C = 0\n\n7. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - Action: 'empty A'\n   - State: A = 0, B = 6, C = 0\n\n8. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A again until Jug A is full.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 5, B = 1, C = 0\n\n9. **Fill Jug B**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n   - Action: 'fill B'\n   - State: A = 5, B = 11, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    -
