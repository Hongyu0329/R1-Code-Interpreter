    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 8 litres of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 13 litres, B = 12 litres, and C = 13 litres. All jugs start empty.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill B'\n   - State: A = 0, B = 12, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 12, B = 0, C = 0\n\n3. **Fill Jug B again**: Refill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill B'\n   - State: A = 12, B = 12, C = 0\n\n4. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty. Jug A can only take 1 more litre to be full.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 13, B = 11, C = 0\n\n5. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - Action: 'empty A'\n   - State: A = 0, B = 11, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug A.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 11, B = 0, C = 0\n\n7. **Fill Jug B again**: Refill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill B'\n   - State: A = 11, B = 12, C = 0\n\n8. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty. Jug A can only take 2 more litres to be full.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 13, B = 10, C = 0\n\n9. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - Action: 'empty A'\n   - State: A = 0, B = 10, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug A.\n    - Action: 'pour B->A'\n    - State: A = 10, B = 0, C = 0\n\n11. **Fill Jug B again**: Refill Jug B to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill B'\n    - State: A = 10, B = 12, C = 0\n\n12. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty. Jug A can only take 3 more litres to be full.\n    - Action: 'pour B->A'\n    - State: A = 13, B = 9, C = 0\n\n13. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - Action: 'empty A'\n    - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 0\n\n14. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug A.\n    - Action: 'pour B->A'\n    - State: A = 9, B = 0, C = 0\n\n15. **Fill Jug B again**: Refill Jug B to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill B'\n    - State: A = 9, B = 12, C = 0\n\n16. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B into Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty. Jug A can only take 4 more litres to be full.\n    - Action: 'pour B->A'\n    - State: A = 13, B = 8, C = 0\n\nNow, Jug B has exactly 8 litres of water, which is our target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\"]>>>"
