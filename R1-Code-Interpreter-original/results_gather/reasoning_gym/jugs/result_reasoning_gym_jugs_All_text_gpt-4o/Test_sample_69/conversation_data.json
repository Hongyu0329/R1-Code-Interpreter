    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and operations to reach exactly 1 litre in any of the jugs. We have three jugs with capacities of 11 litres (Jug A), 8 litres (Jug B), and 8 litres (Jug C). The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n2. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - Action: `fill A`\n   - Result: A = 11, B = 0, C = 0\n\n3. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - Action: `pour A->B`\n   - Result: A = 3, B = 8, C = 0 (since B can hold 8 litres)\n\n4. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n   - Action: `empty B`\n   - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n5. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n   - Action: `pour A->B`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 3, C = 0\n\n6. **Fill Jug A again**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - Action: `fill A`\n   - Result: A = 11, B = 3, C = 0\n\n7. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - Action: `pour A->B`\n   - Result: A = 6, B = 8, C = 0\n\n8. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n   - Action: `empty B`\n   - Result: A = 6, B = 0, C = 0\n\n9. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n   - Action: `pour A->B`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 6, C = 0\n\n10. **Fill Jug A again**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n    - Action: `fill A`\n    - Result: A = 11, B = 6, C = 0\n\n11. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 9, B = 8, C = 0\n\n12. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - Action: `empty B`\n    - Result: A = 9, B = 0, C = 0\n\n13. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - Action: `pour A->B`\n    - Result: A = 1, B = 8, C = 0\n\nAt this point, Jug A contains exactly 1 litre of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\"\n]\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\"]>>>"
