    "To solve this problem, we need to use the three jugs with capacities of 13 liters (Jug A), 7 liters (Jug B), and 13 liters (Jug C) to measure exactly 4 liters of water in any of the jugs. We can use the operations 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour' to achieve this.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n2. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - A = 13, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n3. **Pour A into B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - A = 6, B = 7, C = 0.\n\n4. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n   - A = 6, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n5. **Pour A into B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B again.\n   - A = 0, B = 6, C = 0.\n\n6. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 13, B = 6, C = 0.\n\n7. **Pour A into B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B until Jug B is full.\n   - A = 12, B = 7, C = 0.\n\n8. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n   - A = 12, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n9. **Pour A into B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B.\n   - A = 5, B = 7, C = 0.\n\n10. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - A = 5, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n11. **Pour A into B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B.\n    - A = 0, B = 5, C = 0.\n\n12. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 13, B = 5, C = 0.\n\n13. **Pour A into B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - A = 11, B = 7, C = 0.\n\n14. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - A = 11, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n15. **Pour A into B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B.\n    - A = 4, B = 7, C = 0.\n\nNow, Jug A contains exactly 4 liters of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\"\n]\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\"]>>>"
