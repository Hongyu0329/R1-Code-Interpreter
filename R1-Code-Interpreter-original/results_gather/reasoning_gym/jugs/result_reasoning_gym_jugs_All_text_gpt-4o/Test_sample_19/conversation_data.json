    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and operations to get exactly 3 litres of water in one of the jugs. We have three jugs: A (6 litres), B (11 litres), and C (11 litres). The operations we can perform are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 11, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - State: A = 6, B = 5, C = 0\n\n3. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 5, C = 0\n\n4. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 5, B = 0, C = 0\n\n5. **Fill Jug B**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n   - State: A = 5, B = 11, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - State: A = 6, B = 10, C = 0\n\n7. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 10, C = 0\n\n8. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 6, B = 4, C = 0\n\n9. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 4, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 4, B = 0, C = 0\n\n11. **Fill Jug B**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n    - State: A = 4, B = 11, C = 0\n\n12. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - State: A = 6, B = 9, C = 0\n\n13. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 9, C = 0\n\n14. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 6, B = 3, C = 0\n\nNow, Jug B has exactly 3 litres of water, which is our target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\"]>>>"
