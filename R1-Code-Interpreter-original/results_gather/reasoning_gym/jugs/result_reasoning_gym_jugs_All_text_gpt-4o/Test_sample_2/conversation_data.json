    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and operations to reach exactly 1 litre in any of the jugs. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 8 litres, B = 13 litres, and C = 13 litres. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n2. **Fill Jug B**: Fill B to its full capacity.\n   - A = 0, B = 13, C = 0.\n\n3. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from B to A until A is full or B is empty.\n   - A = 8, B = 5, C = 0.\n\n4. **Empty Jug A**: Empty A completely.\n   - A = 0, B = 5, C = 0.\n\n5. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from B to A.\n   - A = 5, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n6. **Fill Jug B**: Fill B to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 5, B = 13, C = 0.\n\n7. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from B to A until A is full or B is empty.\n   - A = 8, B = 10, C = 0.\n\n8. **Empty Jug A**: Empty A completely.\n   - A = 0, B = 10, C = 0.\n\n9. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from B to A.\n   - A = 8, B = 2, C = 0.\n\n10. **Empty Jug A**: Empty A completely.\n    - A = 0, B = 2, C = 0.\n\n11. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from B to A.\n    - A = 2, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n12. **Fill Jug B**: Fill B to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 2, B = 13, C = 0.\n\n13. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from B to A until A is full or B is empty.\n    - A = 8, B = 7, C = 0.\n\n14. **Empty Jug A**: Empty A completely.\n    - A = 0, B = 7, C = 0.\n\n15. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from B to A.\n    - A = 7, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n16. **Fill Jug B**: Fill B to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 7, B = 13, C = 0.\n\n17. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from B to A until A is full or B is empty.\n    - A = 8, B = 12, C = 0.\n\n18. **Empty Jug A**: Empty A completely.\n    - A = 0, B = 12, C = 0.\n\n19. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from B to A.\n    - A = 8, B = 4, C = 0.\n\n20. **Empty Jug A**: Empty A completely.\n    - A = 0, B = 4, C = 0.\n\n21. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from B to A.\n    - A = 4, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n22. **Fill Jug B**: Fill B to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 4, B = 13, C = 0.\n\n23. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from B to A until A is full or B is empty.\n    - A = 8, B = 9, C = 0.\n\n24. **Empty Jug A**: Empty A completely.\n    - A = 0, B = 9, C = 0.\n\n25. **Pour B into A**: Pour water from B to A.\n    - A = 8, B = 1, C = 0.\n\nNow, Jug B has exactly 1 litre of water, which is our target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\"]>>>"
