    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 9 liters of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 7 liters, B = 13 liters, and C = 13 liters. The target is to have exactly 9 liters in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 13, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - Jug A can hold 7 liters, so pour 7 liters from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 7, B = 6, C = 0\n\n3. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug B.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 6, C = 0\n\n4. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining 6 liters from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 6, B = 0, C = 0\n\n5. **Fill Jug B**: Fill Jug B again to its full capacity.\n   - State: A = 6, B = 13, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n   - Jug A can hold 1 more liter (since it already has 6 liters), so pour 1 liter from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 7, B = 12, C = 0\n\n7. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug B.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 12, C = 0\n\n8. **Pour from B to A**: Pour 7 liters from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 7, B = 5, C = 0\n\n9. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A again.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 5, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining 5 liters from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 5, B = 0, C = 0\n\n11. **Fill Jug B**: Fill Jug B again to its full capacity.\n    - State: A = 5, B = 13, C = 0\n\n12. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - Jug A can hold 2 more liters (since it already has 5 liters), so pour 2 liters from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 7, B = 11, C = 0\n\n13. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug B.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 11, C = 0\n\n14. **Pour from B to A**: Pour 7 liters from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 7, B = 4, C = 0\n\n15. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A again.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 4, C = 0\n\n16. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining 4 liters from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 4, B = 0, C = 0\n\n17. **Fill Jug B**: Fill Jug B again to its full capacity.\n    - State: A = 4, B = 13, C = 0\n\n18. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - Jug A can hold 3 more liters (since it already has 4 liters), so pour 3 liters from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 7, B = 10, C = 0\n\n19. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug B.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 10, C = 0\n\n20. **Pour from B to A**: Pour 7 liters from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 7, B = 3, C = 0\n\n21. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A again.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 3, C = 0\n\n22. **Pour from B to A**: Pour the remaining 3 liters from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n23. **Fill Jug B**: Fill Jug B again to its full capacity.\n    - State: A = 3, B = 13, C = 0\n\n24. **Pour from B to A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug B is empty.\n    - Jug A can hold 4 more liters (since it already has 3 liters), so pour 4 liters from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 7, B = 9, C = 0\n\nNow, Jug B has exactly 9 liters, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\"]>>>"
