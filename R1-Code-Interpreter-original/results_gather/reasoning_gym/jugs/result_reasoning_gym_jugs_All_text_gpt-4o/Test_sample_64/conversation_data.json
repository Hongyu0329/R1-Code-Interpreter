    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and operations to reach exactly 7 liters in one of the jugs. We have three jugs with capacities of 8 liters (Jug A), 8 liters (Jug B), and 13 liters (Jug C). The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's break down the steps to achieve the target:\n\n1. **Fill Jug C**: Start by filling Jug C to its full capacity of 13 liters.\n   - State: A: 0, B: 0, C: 13\n\n2. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - State: A: 8, B: 0, C: 5\n\n3. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A: 0, B: 0, C: 5\n\n4. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - State: A: 5, B: 0, C: 0\n\n5. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 13 liters.\n   - State: A: 5, B: 0, C: 13\n\n6. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full. Jug A can hold 3 more liters (since it already has 5 liters).\n   - State: A: 8, B: 0, C: 10\n\n7. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A: 0, B: 0, C: 10\n\n8. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - State: A: 8, B: 0, C: 2\n\n9. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A: 0, B: 0, C: 2\n\n10. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - State: A: 2, B: 0, C: 0\n\n11. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 13 liters.\n    - State: A: 2, B: 0, C: 13\n\n12. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full. Jug A can hold 6 more liters (since it already has 2 liters).\n    - State: A: 8, B: 0, C: 7\n\nNow, Jug C has exactly 7 liters, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>"
