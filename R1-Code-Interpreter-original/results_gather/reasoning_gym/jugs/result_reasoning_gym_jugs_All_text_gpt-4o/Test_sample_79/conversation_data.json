    "To solve this puzzle, we need to use the three available jugs with capacities of 8, 13, and 13 liters to measure exactly 4 liters in one of the jugs. We can achieve this by using the operations 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n2. **Step 1**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill B'\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 13, C = 0\n\n3. **Step 2**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - Result: A = 8, B = 5, C = 0\n\n4. **Step 3**: Empty Jug A.\n   - Action: 'empty A'\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 5, C = 0\n\n5. **Step 4**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - Result: A = 5, B = 0, C = 0\n\n6. **Step 5**: Fill Jug B again.\n   - Action: 'fill B'\n   - Result: A = 5, B = 13, C = 0\n\n7. **Step 6**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - Result: A = 8, B = 10, C = 0\n\n8. **Step 7**: Empty Jug A.\n   - Action: 'empty A'\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 10, C = 0\n\n9. **Step 8**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - Result: A = 8, B = 2, C = 0\n\n10. **Step 9**: Fill Jug B again.\n    - Action: 'fill B'\n    - Result: A = 8, B = 13, C = 0\n\n11. **Step 10**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: 'pour B->A'\n    - Result: A = 8, B = 7, C = 0\n\n12. **Step 11**: Empty Jug A.\n    - Action: 'empty A'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 7, C = 0\n\n13. **Step 12**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - Action: 'pour B->A'\n    - Result: A = 7, B = 0, C = 0\n\n14. **Step 13**: Fill Jug B again.\n    - Action: 'fill B'\n    - Result: A = 7, B = 13, C = 0\n\n15. **Step 14**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: 'pour B->A'\n    - Result: A = 8, B = 12, C = 0\n\n16. **Step 15**: Empty Jug A.\n    - Action: 'empty A'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 12, C = 0\n\n17. **Step 16**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - Action: 'pour B->A'\n    - Result: A = 8, B = 4, C = 0\n\nAt this point, Jug B contains exactly 4 liters of water, which is the target amount. Therefore, the bomb is defused.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is as follows:\n\n<<<[\"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\"]>>>"
