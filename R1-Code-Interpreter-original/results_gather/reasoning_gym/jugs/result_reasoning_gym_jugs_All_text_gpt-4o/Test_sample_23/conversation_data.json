    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 5 litres of water using the available moves: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 13 litres, B = 3 litres, and C = 13 litres. The goal is to have exactly 5 litres in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug A**: Start by filling Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill A'\n   - Result: A = 13, B = 0, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour from Jug A to Jug B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B until Jug B is full.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 10, B = 3, C = 0\n\n3. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B to make room for more water from Jug A.\n   - Action: 'empty B'\n   - Result: A = 10, B = 0, C = 0\n\n4. **Pour from Jug A to Jug B again**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B until Jug B is full.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 7, B = 3, C = 0\n\n5. **Empty Jug B again**: Empty Jug B to make room for more water from Jug A.\n   - Action: 'empty B'\n   - Result: A = 7, B = 0, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour from Jug A to Jug B once more**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B until Jug B is full.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 4, B = 3, C = 0\n\n7. **Fill Jug A again**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill A'\n   - Result: A = 13, B = 3, C = 0\n\n8. **Pour from Jug A to Jug B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B until Jug B is full.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 13 - (3 - 0) = 10, B = 3, C = 0\n\n9. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B to make room for more water from Jug A.\n   - Action: 'empty B'\n   - Result: A = 10, B = 0, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour from Jug A to Jug B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: 'pour A->B'\n    - Result: A = 7, B = 3, C = 0\n\n11. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B to make room for more water from Jug A.\n    - Action: 'empty B'\n    - Result: A = 7, B = 0, C = 0\n\n12. **Pour from Jug A to Jug B**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: 'pour A->B'\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 3, C = 0\n\n13. **Pour from Jug A to Jug C**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug C.\n    - Action: 'pour A->C'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 3, C = 4\n\n14. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill A'\n    - Result: A = 13, B = 3, C = 4\n\n15. **Pour from Jug A to Jug C**: Pour water from Jug A into Jug C until Jug C is full.\n    - Action: 'pour A->C'\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 3, C = 13\n\n16. **Pour from Jug C to Jug B**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: 'pour C->B'\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 3, C = 10\n\n17. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B to make room for more water from Jug C.\n    - Action: 'empty B'\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 10\n\n18. **Pour from Jug C to Jug B**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Action: 'pour C->B'\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 3, C = 7\n\n19. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A.\n    - Action: 'pour C->A'\n    - Result: A = 5, B = 3, C = 5\n\nNow, Jug A has exactly 5 litres of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves to achieve this is:\n\n<<<[\"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"pour A->C\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->C\", \"pour C->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour C->B\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>"
