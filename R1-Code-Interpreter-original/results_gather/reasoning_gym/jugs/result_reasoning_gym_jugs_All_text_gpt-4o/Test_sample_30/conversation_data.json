    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 3 liters of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 5 liters, B = 11 liters, and C = 5 liters. All jugs start empty.\n\nLet's analyze the steps to achieve the target:\n\n1. **Fill Jug B**: Start by filling Jug B to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill B'\n   - State: A = 0, B = 11, C = 0\n\n2. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 5, B = 6, C = 0\n\n3. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - Action: 'empty A'\n   - State: A = 0, B = 6, C = 0\n\n4. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A again.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 5, B = 1, C = 0\n\n5. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely again.\n   - Action: 'empty A'\n   - State: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n\n6. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 1, B = 0, C = 0\n\n7. **Fill Jug B**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n   - Action: 'fill B'\n   - State: A = 1, B = 11, C = 0\n\n8. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Action: 'pour B->A'\n   - State: A = 5, B = 7, C = 0\n\n9. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - Action: 'empty A'\n   - State: A = 0, B = 7, C = 0\n\n10. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - Action: 'pour B->A'\n    - State: A = 5, B = 2, C = 0\n\n11. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - Action: 'empty A'\n    - State: A = 0, B = 2, C = 0\n\n12. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - Action: 'pour B->A'\n    - State: A = 2, B = 0, C = 0\n\n13. **Fill Jug B**: Fill Jug B to its full capacity again.\n    - Action: 'fill B'\n    - State: A = 2, B = 11, C = 0\n\n14. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: 'pour B->A'\n    - State: A = 5, B = 8, C = 0\n\n15. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - Action: 'empty A'\n    - State: A = 0, B = 8, C = 0\n\n16. **Pour from Jug B to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug B to Jug A.\n    - Action: 'pour B->A'\n    - State: A = 5, B = 3, C = 0\n\n17. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - Action: 'empty A'\n    - State: A = 0, B = 3, C = 0\n\nNow, Jug B has exactly 3 liters of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this is:\n\n<<<[\"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"fill B\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour B->A\", \"empty A\"]>>>"
