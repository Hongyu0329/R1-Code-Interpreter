    "To solve this problem, we need to use the three available jugs (A, B, and C) to measure exactly 4 litres of water in any one of them. We can use the operations 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour' to achieve this. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty.\n   - A = 0, B = 0, C = 0\n\n2. **Fill Jug C**: Since Jug C can hold 11 litres, we fill it completely.\n   - Action: 'fill C'\n   - A = 0, B = 0, C = 11\n\n3. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty.\n   - Action: 'pour C->A'\n   - A = 10, B = 0, C = 1\n\n4. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug C.\n   - Action: 'empty A'\n   - A = 0, B = 0, C = 1\n\n5. **Pour from C to A again**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - Action: 'pour C->A'\n   - A = 1, B = 0, C = 0\n\n6. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill C'\n   - A = 1, B = 0, C = 11\n\n7. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Action: 'pour C->A'\n   - A = 10, B = 0, C = 2\n\n8. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug C.\n   - Action: 'empty A'\n   - A = 0, B = 0, C = 2\n\n9. **Pour from C to A again**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - Action: 'pour C->A'\n   - A = 2, B = 0, C = 0\n\n10. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill C'\n    - A = 2, B = 0, C = 11\n\n11. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: 'pour C->A'\n    - A = 10, B = 0, C = 3\n\n12. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug C.\n    - Action: 'empty A'\n    - A = 0, B = 0, C = 3\n\n13. **Pour from C to A again**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - Action: 'pour C->A'\n    - A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n14. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill C'\n    - A = 3, B = 0, C = 11\n\n15. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Action: 'pour C->A'\n    - A = 10, B = 0, C = 4\n\nNow, Jug C has exactly 4 litres of water, which is the target amount. The bomb is defused.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n```json\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>\n```"
