    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and operations to reach exactly 1 litre in any of the jugs. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 8 litres, B = 11 litres, and C = 11 litres. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n2. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill A'\n   - Result: A = 8, B = 0, C = 0\n\n3. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 8, C = 0\n\n4. **Fill Jug A again**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill A'\n   - Result: A = 8, B = 8, C = 0\n\n5. **Pour from A to B again**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 5, B = 11, C = 0\n\n6. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n   - Action: 'empty B'\n   - Result: A = 5, B = 0, C = 0\n\n7. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 5, C = 0\n\n8. **Fill Jug A again**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - Action: 'fill A'\n   - Result: A = 8, B = 5, C = 0\n\n9. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - Action: 'pour A->B'\n   - Result: A = 2, B = 11, C = 0\n\n10. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - Action: 'empty B'\n    - Result: A = 2, B = 0, C = 0\n\n11. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - Action: 'pour A->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 2, C = 0\n\n12. **Fill Jug A again**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill A'\n    - Result: A = 8, B = 2, C = 0\n\n13. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - Action: 'pour A->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 10, C = 0\n\n14. **Fill Jug A again**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill A'\n    - Result: A = 8, B = 10, C = 0\n\n15. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - Action: 'pour A->B'\n    - Result: A = 7, B = 11, C = 0\n\n16. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - Action: 'empty B'\n    - Result: A = 7, B = 0, C = 0\n\n17. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - Action: 'pour A->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 7, C = 0\n\n18. **Fill Jug A again**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill A'\n    - Result: A = 8, B = 7, C = 0\n\n19. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - Action: 'pour A->B'\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 11, C = 0\n\n20. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - Action: 'empty B'\n    - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 0\n\n21. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - Action: 'pour A->B'\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 4, C = 0\n\n22. **Fill Jug A again**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity.\n    - Action: 'fill A'\n    - Result: A = 8, B = 4, C = 0\n\n23. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - Action: 'pour A->B'\n    - Result: A = 1, B = 11, C = 0\n\nAt this point, Jug A has exactly 1 litre of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this is:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\"\n]\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\"]>>>"
