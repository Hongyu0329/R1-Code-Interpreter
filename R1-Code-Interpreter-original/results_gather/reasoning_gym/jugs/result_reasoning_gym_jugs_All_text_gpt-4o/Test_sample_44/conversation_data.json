    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 8 liters of water using the available operations: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 7 liters, B = 7 liters, and C = 10 liters. The target is to have exactly 8 liters in one of the jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug C**: Start by filling Jug C to its full capacity of 10 liters.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 10\n\n2. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Jug A can hold 7 liters, so after pouring, Jug C will have 3 liters left.\n   - State: A = 7, B = 0, C = 3\n\n3. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 3\n\n4. **Pour from C to A**: Pour the remaining 3 liters from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n5. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 10 liters.\n   - State: A = 3, B = 0, C = 10\n\n6. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Jug A can hold 4 more liters (since it already has 3 liters), so after pouring, Jug C will have 6 liters left.\n   - State: A = 7, B = 0, C = 6\n\n7. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 6\n\n8. **Pour from C to A**: Pour the 6 liters from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - State: A = 6, B = 0, C = 0\n\n9. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 10 liters.\n   - State: A = 6, B = 0, C = 10\n\n10. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Jug A can hold 1 more liter (since it already has 6 liters), so after pouring, Jug C will have 9 liters left.\n    - State: A = 7, B = 0, C = 9\n\n11. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 9\n\n12. **Pour from C to A**: Pour 7 liters from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 7, B = 0, C = 2\n\n13. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 2\n\n14. **Pour from C to A**: Pour the 2 liters from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 2, B = 0, C = 0\n\n15. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 10 liters.\n    - State: A = 2, B = 0, C = 10\n\n16. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Jug A can hold 5 more liters (since it already has 2 liters), so after pouring, Jug C will have 5 liters left.\n    - State: A = 7, B = 0, C = 5\n\n17. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 5\n\n18. **Pour from C to A**: Pour the 5 liters from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - State: A = 5, B = 0, C = 0\n\n19. **Fill Jug C again**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity of 10 liters.\n    - State: A = 5, B = 0, C = 10\n\n20. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full.\n    - Jug A can hold 2 more liters (since it already has 5 liters), so after pouring, Jug C will have 8 liters left.\n    - State: A = 7, B = 0, C = 8\n\nNow, Jug C has exactly 8 liters, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>"
