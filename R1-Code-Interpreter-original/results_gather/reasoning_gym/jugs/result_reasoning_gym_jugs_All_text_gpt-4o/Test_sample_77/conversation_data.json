    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and operations to reach exactly 8 liters in one of the jugs. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 10 liters, B = 3 liters, and C = 13 liters. The target is to have exactly 8 liters in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n2. **Step 1**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n   - Action: `fill C`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 13\n\n3. **Step 2**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty.\n   - Action: `pour C->A`\n   - Result: A = 10, B = 0, C = 3 (since Jug A can hold 10 liters and Jug C has 13 liters initially, 10 liters are poured into Jug A)\n\n4. **Step 3**: Empty Jug A.\n   - Action: `empty A`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 3\n\n5. **Step 4**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - Action: `pour C->A`\n   - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n6. **Step 5**: Fill Jug C again.\n   - Action: `fill C`\n   - Result: A = 3, B = 0, C = 13\n\n7. **Step 6**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty.\n   - Action: `pour C->A`\n   - Result: A = 10, B = 0, C = 6 (Jug A is filled to its capacity of 10 liters, leaving 6 liters in Jug C)\n\n8. **Step 7**: Empty Jug A.\n   - Action: `empty A`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 6\n\n9. **Step 8**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - Action: `pour C->A`\n   - Result: A = 6, B = 0, C = 0\n\n10. **Step 9**: Fill Jug C again.\n    - Action: `fill C`\n    - Result: A = 6, B = 0, C = 13\n\n11. **Step 10**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 10, B = 0, C = 9 (Jug A is filled to its capacity of 10 liters, leaving 9 liters in Jug C)\n\n12. **Step 11**: Empty Jug A.\n    - Action: `empty A`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 9\n\n13. **Step 12**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 9, B = 0, C = 0\n\n14. **Step 13**: Fill Jug C again.\n    - Action: `fill C`\n    - Result: A = 9, B = 0, C = 13\n\n15. **Step 14**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 10, B = 0, C = 12 (Jug A is filled to its capacity of 10 liters, leaving 12 liters in Jug C)\n\n16. **Step 15**: Empty Jug A.\n    - Action: `empty A`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 12\n\n17. **Step 16**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 10, B = 0, C = 2\n\n18. **Step 17**: Empty Jug A.\n    - Action: `empty A`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 2\n\n19. **Step 18**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 2, B = 0, C = 0\n\n20. **Step 19**: Fill Jug C again.\n    - Action: `fill C`\n    - Result: A = 2, B = 0, C = 13\n\n21. **Step 20**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 10, B = 0, C = 5 (Jug A is filled to its capacity of 10 liters, leaving 5 liters in Jug C)\n\n22. **Step 21**: Empty Jug A.\n    - Action: `empty A`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 5\n\n23. **Step 22**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 5, B = 0, C = 0\n\n24. **Step 23**: Fill Jug C again.\n    - Action: `fill C`\n    - Result: A = 5, B = 0, C = 13\n\n25. **Step 24**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 10, B = 0, C = 8 (Jug A is filled to its capacity of 10 liters, leaving 8 liters in Jug C)\n\n26. **Step 25**: Empty Jug A.\n    - Action: `empty A`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 8\n\nNow, Jug C has exactly 8 liters, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\"\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\"]>>>"
