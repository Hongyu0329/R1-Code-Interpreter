    "To solve this puzzle, we need to use the available jugs and operations to get exactly 7 liters of water in one of the jugs. We have three jugs with capacities of 4 liters (Jug A), 4 liters (Jug B), and 9 liters (Jug C). The target is to have exactly 7 liters in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug C**: Start by filling Jug C to its full capacity of 9 liters.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 9\n\n2. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Jug A can hold 4 liters, so after pouring, Jug C will have 5 liters left.\n   - State: A = 4, B = 0, C = 5\n\n3. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug C.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 5\n\n4. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the remaining 5 liters from Jug C into Jug A.\n   - Jug A will have 4 liters, and Jug C will have 1 liter left.\n   - State: A = 4, B = 0, C = 1\n\n5. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C again to its full capacity of 9 liters.\n   - State: A = 4, B = 0, C = 9\n\n6. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug A until Jug A is full.\n   - Jug A already has 4 liters, so it can take 0 more liters. Jug C will have 5 liters left.\n   - State: A = 4, B = 0, C = 5\n\n7. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A to make room for more water from Jug C.\n   - State: A = 0, B = 0, C = 5\n\n8. **Pour from Jug C to Jug A**: Pour the remaining 5 liters from Jug C into Jug A.\n   - Jug A will have 4 liters, and Jug C will have 1 liter left.\n   - State: A = 4, B = 0, C = 1\n\n9. **Pour from Jug C to Jug B**: Pour the 1 liter from Jug C into Jug B.\n   - State: A = 4, B = 1, C = 0\n\n10. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C again to its full capacity of 9 liters.\n    - State: A = 4, B = 1, C = 9\n\n11. **Pour from Jug C to Jug B**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Jug B can hold 3 more liters (since it already has 1 liter), so Jug C will have 6 liters left.\n    - State: A = 4, B = 4, C = 6\n\n12. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B to make room for more water from Jug C.\n    - State: A = 4, B = 0, C = 6\n\n13. **Pour from Jug C to Jug B**: Pour 4 liters from Jug C into Jug B.\n    - Jug B will have 4 liters, and Jug C will have 2 liters left.\n    - State: A = 4, B = 4, C = 2\n\n14. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B to make room for more water from Jug C.\n    - State: A = 4, B = 0, C = 2\n\n15. **Pour from Jug C to Jug B**: Pour the remaining 2 liters from Jug C into Jug B.\n    - State: A = 4, B = 2, C = 0\n\n16. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C again to its full capacity of 9 liters.\n    - State: A = 4, B = 2, C = 9\n\n17. **Pour from Jug C to Jug B**: Pour water from Jug C into Jug B until Jug B is full.\n    - Jug B can hold 2 more liters (since it already has 2 liters), so Jug C will have 7 liters left.\n    - State: A = 4, B = 4, C = 7\n\nNow, Jug C has exactly 7 liters, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->B\"\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"pour C->B\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour C->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour C->B\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->B\"]>>>"
