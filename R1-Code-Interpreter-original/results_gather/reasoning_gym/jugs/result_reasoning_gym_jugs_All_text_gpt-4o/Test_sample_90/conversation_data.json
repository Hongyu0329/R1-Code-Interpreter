    "To solve this problem, we need to use the available jugs and operations to reach exactly 3 litres in any of the jugs. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 9 litres, B = 9 litres, and C = 13 litres. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's break down the steps to achieve the target:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n\n2. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity.\n   - Action: `fill C`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 13\n\n3. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty.\n   - Action: `pour C->A`\n   - Result: A = 9, B = 0, C = 4\n\n4. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - Action: `empty A`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 4\n\n5. **Pour from C to A**: Pour the remaining water from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - Action: `pour C->A`\n   - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 0\n\n6. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity again.\n   - Action: `fill C`\n   - Result: A = 4, B = 0, C = 13\n\n7. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty.\n   - Action: `pour C->A`\n   - Result: A = 9, B = 0, C = 8\n\n8. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n   - Action: `empty A`\n   - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 8\n\n9. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A.\n   - Action: `pour C->A`\n   - Result: A = 8, B = 0, C = 0\n\n10. **Fill Jug C**: Fill Jug C to its full capacity again.\n    - Action: `fill C`\n    - Result: A = 8, B = 0, C = 13\n\n11. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full or Jug C is empty.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 9, B = 0, C = 12\n\n12. **Empty Jug A**: Empty Jug A completely.\n    - Action: `empty A`\n    - Result: A = 0, B = 0, C = 12\n\n13. **Pour from C to A**: Pour water from Jug C to Jug A.\n    - Action: `pour C->A`\n    - Result: A = 9, B = 0, C = 3\n\nAt this point, Jug C has exactly 3 litres of water, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>"
