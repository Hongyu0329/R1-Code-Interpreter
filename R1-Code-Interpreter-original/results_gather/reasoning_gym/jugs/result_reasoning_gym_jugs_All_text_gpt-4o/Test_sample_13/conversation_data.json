    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill one of the jugs with exactly 12 liters of water using the available moves: 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour'. We have three jugs with capacities: A = 13 liters, B = 11 liters, and C = 13 liters. The target is to have exactly 12 liters in one of these jugs.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Fill Jug A**: Start by filling Jug A to its full capacity.\n   - A = 13 liters, B = 0 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n2. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - A = 2 liters, B = 11 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n3. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n   - A = 2 liters, B = 0 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n4. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n   - A = 0 liters, B = 2 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n5. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 13 liters, B = 2 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n6. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n   - A = 4 liters, B = 11 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n7. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n   - A = 4 liters, B = 0 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n8. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n   - A = 0 liters, B = 4 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n9. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n   - A = 13 liters, B = 4 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n10. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - A = 6 liters, B = 11 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n11. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - A = 6 liters, B = 0 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n12. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - A = 0 liters, B = 6 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n13. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 13 liters, B = 6 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n14. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - A = 8 liters, B = 11 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n15. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - A = 8 liters, B = 0 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n16. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - A = 0 liters, B = 8 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n17. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 13 liters, B = 8 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n18. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - A = 10 liters, B = 11 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n19. **Empty Jug B**: Empty Jug B completely.\n    - A = 10 liters, B = 0 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n20. **Pour from A to B**: Pour the remaining water from Jug A to Jug B.\n    - A = 0 liters, B = 10 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n21. **Fill Jug A**: Fill Jug A to its full capacity again.\n    - A = 13 liters, B = 10 liters, C = 0 liters\n\n22. **Pour from A to B**: Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full or Jug A is empty.\n    - A = 12 liters, B = 11 liters, C = 0 liters\n\nNow, Jug A has exactly 12 liters, which is the target amount.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<[\"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\", \"empty B\", \"pour A->B\", \"fill A\", \"pour A->B\"]>>>"
