  "question": "You are a police officer. A maniac has planted a bomb next to a public fountain.\n\nTo defuse the bomb, you must solve a puzzle. The puzzle is solved when you fill any of the available jugs with the target amount of water.\n\nYou have three move types: 'fill', 'empty' and 'pour'.\n\nTo fill Jug A, you 'fill A'.\nTo empty Jug B, you 'empty B'.\nTo pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B, you 'pour A->B'.\nAll jugs are empty to begin with.\n\nThe empty jugs hold this many litres of water: A:13, B:13, C:6\nAnd your target is: 4 litres.\n\nHow do you defuse the bomb?\n\nReply as a JSON-parsable list of moves which result in any of the jugs being filled with the target amount, and enclose the JSON-parsable list in triple angle brackets, like <<<JSON-parsable list>>>.\n",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to use the available jugs and operations to reach exactly 4 liters in one of the jugs. Let's work through the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. Fill Jug C (6 liters).\n2. Pour C into A (Jug A now has 6 liters, Jug C is empty).\n3. Fill Jug C again (6 liters).\n4. Pour C into A (Jug A now has 12 liters, Jug C is empty).\n5. Fill Jug C again (6 liters).\n6. Pour C into A (Jug A now has 13 liters, Jug C has 5 liters).\n7. Empty Jug A (Jug A is empty).\n8. Pour C into A (Jug A now has 5 liters, Jug C is empty).\n9. Fill Jug C again (6 liters).\n10. Pour C into A (Jug A now has 11 liters, Jug C is empty).\n11. Fill Jug C again (6 liters).\n12. Pour C into A (Jug A now has 13 liters, Jug C has 4 liters).\n\nNow, Jug C has exactly 4 liters, which is the target amount.\n\nHere's the sequence of moves in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n```\n\nEnclosed in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n>>>"
