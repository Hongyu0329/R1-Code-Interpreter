  "question": "You are a police officer. A maniac has planted a bomb next to a public fountain.\n\nTo defuse the bomb, you must solve a puzzle. The puzzle is solved when you fill any of the available jugs with the target amount of water.\n\nYou have three move types: 'fill', 'empty' and 'pour'.\n\nTo fill Jug A, you 'fill A'.\nTo empty Jug B, you 'empty B'.\nTo pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B, you 'pour A->B'.\nAll jugs are empty to begin with.\n\nThe empty jugs hold this many litres of water: A:5, B:9, C:9\nAnd your target is: 7 litres.\n\nHow do you defuse the bomb?\n\nReply as a JSON-parsable list of moves which result in any of the jugs being filled with the target amount, and enclose the JSON-parsable list in triple angle brackets, like <<<JSON-parsable list>>>.\n",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to use the available moves to fill one of the jugs with exactly 7 liters of water. Let's work through the steps:\n\n1. Fill Jug B (9 liters).\n2. Pour B into A (5 liters), leaving 4 liters in B.\n3. Empty A.\n4. Pour B into A, leaving 0 liters in B and 4 liters in A.\n5. Fill B again (9 liters).\n6. Pour B into A, which already has 4 liters, so A will be full (5 liters), and B will have 8 liters.\n7. Empty A.\n8. Pour B into A, leaving 3 liters in B and 5 liters in A.\n9. Fill B again (9 liters).\n10. Pour B into A, which already has 5 liters, so A will be full (5 liters), and B will have 7 liters.\n\nNow, Jug B has exactly 7 liters. Let's list these steps in a JSON-parsable format:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n```\n\nEnclosing this in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n>>>"
