    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to use the available moves to fill one of the jugs with exactly 11 liters of water. Let's work through the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. Fill Jug A (12 liters).\n2. Pour from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full (7 liters), leaving 5 liters in Jug A.\n3. Empty Jug B.\n4. Pour the remaining 5 liters from Jug A to Jug B.\n5. Fill Jug A again (12 liters).\n6. Pour from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full (7 liters), leaving 10 liters in Jug A.\n7. Empty Jug B.\n8. Pour the remaining 10 liters from Jug A to Jug B.\n9. Fill Jug A again (12 liters).\n10. Pour from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full (7 liters), leaving 11 liters in Jug A.\n\nNow, Jug A has exactly 11 liters of water, which is the target amount.\n\nHere's the sequence of moves in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\"\n]\n```\n\nEnclosed in triple angle brackets, the solution is:\n\n<<<\n[\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\"\n]\n>>>"
