    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to use the three jugs with capacities of 11 liters, 6 liters, and 6 liters to measure exactly 8 liters in one of the jugs. We can achieve this by strategically filling, emptying, and pouring water between the jugs. Let's work through the steps to reach the target amount of 8 liters in one of the jugs.\n\n1. Fill Jug A (11 liters).\n2. Pour from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full (6 liters).\n3. Pour from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full (6 liters).\n4. Empty Jug B.\n5. Pour from Jug C to Jug B (Jug B now has 6 liters, Jug C is empty).\n6. Pour from Jug A to Jug C (Jug C now has 5 liters, Jug A has 0 liters).\n7. Fill Jug A (11 liters).\n8. Pour from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full (6 liters).\n9. Jug A now has exactly 8 liters.\n\nLet's represent these steps as a JSON-parsable list of moves:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->C\"\n]\n```\n\nEnclosing the list in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<\n[\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->C\"\n]\n>>>"
