  "question": "You are a police officer. A maniac has planted a bomb next to a public fountain.\n\nTo defuse the bomb, you must solve a puzzle. The puzzle is solved when you fill any of the available jugs with the target amount of water.\n\nYou have three move types: 'fill', 'empty' and 'pour'.\n\nTo fill Jug A, you 'fill A'.\nTo empty Jug B, you 'empty B'.\nTo pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B, you 'pour A->B'.\nAll jugs are empty to begin with.\n\nThe empty jugs hold this many litres of water: A:4, B:9, C:9\nAnd your target is: 2 litres.\n\nHow do you defuse the bomb?\n\nReply as a JSON-parsable list of moves which result in any of the jugs being filled with the target amount, and enclose the JSON-parsable list in triple angle brackets, like <<<JSON-parsable list>>>.\n",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to use the available jugs and the allowed operations to reach exactly 2 liters in one of the jugs. Let's work through the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. Fill Jug B (9 liters).\n2. Pour from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full (4 liters), leaving 5 liters in Jug B.\n3. Empty Jug A.\n4. Pour from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full (4 liters), leaving 1 liter in Jug B.\n5. Empty Jug A.\n6. Pour the remaining 1 liter from Jug B to Jug A.\n7. Fill Jug B again (9 liters).\n8. Pour from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full (4 liters), leaving 6 liters in Jug B.\n9. Empty Jug A.\n10. Pour from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full (4 liters), leaving 2 liters in Jug B.\n\nNow, Jug B has exactly 2 liters, which is the target amount.\n\nHere's the sequence of moves in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n```\n\nEnclosed in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n>>>"
