  "question": "You are a police officer. A maniac has planted a bomb next to a public fountain.\n\nTo defuse the bomb, you must solve a puzzle. The puzzle is solved when you fill any of the available jugs with the target amount of water.\n\nYou have three move types: 'fill', 'empty' and 'pour'.\n\nTo fill Jug A, you 'fill A'.\nTo empty Jug B, you 'empty B'.\nTo pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B, you 'pour A->B'.\nAll jugs are empty to begin with.\n\nThe empty jugs hold this many litres of water: A:11, B:3, C:3\nAnd your target is: 4 litres.\n\nHow do you defuse the bomb?\n\nReply as a JSON-parsable list of moves which result in any of the jugs being filled with the target amount, and enclose the JSON-parsable list in triple angle brackets, like <<<JSON-parsable list>>>.\n",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to use the available jugs and operations to reach exactly 4 liters in one of the jugs. Let's work through the steps:\n\n1. Fill Jug A (11 liters).\n2. Pour from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full (3 liters), leaving 8 liters in Jug A.\n3. Empty Jug B.\n4. Pour from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full (3 liters), leaving 5 liters in Jug A.\n5. Empty Jug B.\n6. Pour from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full (3 liters), leaving 2 liters in Jug A.\n7. Fill Jug A (11 liters).\n8. Pour from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full (3 liters), leaving 10 liters in Jug A.\n9. Empty Jug C.\n10. Pour from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full (3 liters), leaving 7 liters in Jug A.\n11. Empty Jug C.\n12. Pour from Jug A to Jug C until Jug C is full (3 liters), leaving 4 liters in Jug A.\n\nNow, Jug A has exactly 4 liters, which is the target amount.\n\nHere's the sequence of moves in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"empty C\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"empty C\",\n    \"pour A->C\"\n]\n```\n\nEnclosed in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<\n[\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"empty C\",\n    \"pour A->C\",\n    \"empty C\",\n    \"pour A->C\"\n]\n>>>"
