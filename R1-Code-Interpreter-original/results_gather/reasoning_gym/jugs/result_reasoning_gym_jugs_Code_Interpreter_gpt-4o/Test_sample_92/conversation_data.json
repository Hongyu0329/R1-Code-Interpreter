    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to use the available jugs and the allowed moves to get exactly 4 liters of water in one of the jugs. Let's work through the steps:\n\n1. Fill Jug A (11 liters).\n2. Pour from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full (3 liters), leaving 8 liters in Jug A.\n3. Empty Jug B.\n4. Pour from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full (3 liters), leaving 5 liters in Jug A.\n5. Empty Jug B.\n6. Pour from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full (3 liters), leaving 2 liters in Jug A.\n7. Fill Jug A (11 liters).\n8. Pour from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full (3 liters), leaving 10 liters in Jug A.\n9. Empty Jug B.\n10. Pour from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full (3 liters), leaving 7 liters in Jug A.\n11. Empty Jug B.\n12. Pour from Jug A to Jug B until Jug B is full (3 liters), leaving 4 liters in Jug A.\n\nNow, Jug A has exactly 4 liters of water, which is the target amount. Here is the sequence of moves in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\"\n]\n```\n\nEnclosed in triple angle brackets, the solution is:\n\n<<<\n[\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"fill A\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\",\n    \"empty B\",\n    \"pour A->B\"\n]\n>>>"
