  "question": "You are a police officer. A maniac has planted a bomb next to a public fountain.\n\nTo defuse the bomb, you must solve a puzzle. The puzzle is solved when you fill any of the available jugs with the target amount of water.\n\nYou have three move types: 'fill', 'empty' and 'pour'.\n\nTo fill Jug A, you 'fill A'.\nTo empty Jug B, you 'empty B'.\nTo pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B, you 'pour A->B'.\nAll jugs are empty to begin with.\n\nThe empty jugs hold this many litres of water: A:8, B:13, C:13\nAnd your target is: 7 litres.\n\nHow do you defuse the bomb?\n\nReply as a JSON-parsable list of moves which result in any of the jugs being filled with the target amount, and enclose the JSON-parsable list in triple angle brackets, like <<<JSON-parsable list>>>.\n",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 7 liters of water. We can use the three available operations: fill, empty, and pour, to achieve this.\n\nLet's work through the steps to reach the target:\n\n1. Fill Jug B (13 liters).\n2. Pour B into A until A is full (8 liters), leaving 5 liters in B.\n3. Empty Jug A.\n4. Pour the remaining 5 liters from B into A.\n5. Fill Jug B again (13 liters).\n6. Pour B into A until A is full (8 liters), leaving 10 liters in B.\n7. Empty Jug A.\n8. Pour the remaining 10 liters from B into A.\n9. Fill Jug B again (13 liters).\n10. Pour B into A until A is full (8 liters), leaving 7 liters in B.\n\nNow, Jug B contains exactly 7 liters of water, which is the target amount.\n\nHere's the sequence of moves in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n```\n\nEnclosed in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n>>>"
