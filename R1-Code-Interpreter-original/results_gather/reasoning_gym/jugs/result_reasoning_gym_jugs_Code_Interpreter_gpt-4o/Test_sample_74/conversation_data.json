    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to use the three jugs with capacities of 7, 8, and 8 liters to measure exactly 3 liters in one of the jugs. We can achieve this by strategically filling, emptying, and pouring water between the jugs. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Fill Jug B (8 liters).\n2. Pour from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full (7 liters), leaving 1 liter in Jug B.\n3. Empty Jug A.\n4. Pour the remaining 1 liter from Jug B to Jug A.\n5. Fill Jug B again (8 liters).\n6. Pour from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full (7 liters), leaving 2 liters in Jug B.\n7. Empty Jug A.\n8. Pour the remaining 2 liters from Jug B to Jug A.\n9. Fill Jug B again (8 liters).\n10. Pour from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full (7 liters), leaving 3 liters in Jug B.\n\nNow, Jug B contains exactly 3 liters of water, which is the target amount.\n\nHere's the sequence of moves in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n```\n\nEnclosed in triple angle brackets, the solution is:\n\n<<<\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n>>>"
