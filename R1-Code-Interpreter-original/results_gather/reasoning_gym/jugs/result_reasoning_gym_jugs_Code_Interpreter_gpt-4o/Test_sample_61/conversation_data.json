  "question": "You are a police officer. A maniac has planted a bomb next to a public fountain.\n\nTo defuse the bomb, you must solve a puzzle. The puzzle is solved when you fill any of the available jugs with the target amount of water.\n\nYou have three move types: 'fill', 'empty' and 'pour'.\n\nTo fill Jug A, you 'fill A'.\nTo empty Jug B, you 'empty B'.\nTo pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B, you 'pour A->B'.\nAll jugs are empty to begin with.\n\nThe empty jugs hold this many litres of water: A:3, B:3, C:11\nAnd your target is: 7 litres.\n\nHow do you defuse the bomb?\n\nReply as a JSON-parsable list of moves which result in any of the jugs being filled with the target amount, and enclose the JSON-parsable list in triple angle brackets, like <<<JSON-parsable list>>>.\n",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to use the available jugs and operations to reach exactly 7 liters in one of the jugs. Let's work through the steps:\n\n1. Fill Jug C (11 liters).\n2. Pour from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full (3 liters).\n3. Pour from Jug C to Jug B until Jug B is full (3 liters).\n4. Empty Jug A.\n5. Pour from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full (3 liters).\n6. Pour from Jug C to Jug B until Jug B is full (3 liters).\n7. Empty Jug A.\n8. Pour from Jug C to Jug A until Jug A is full (3 liters).\n9. Now Jug C has exactly 7 liters.\n\nLet's represent these steps in a JSON-parsable list:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n```\n\nEnclosing the list in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"pour C->B\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n>>>"
