    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 8 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 5 liters (Jug A), 12 liters (Jug B), and 5 liters (Jug C). The goal is to use the available moves ('fill', 'empty', 'pour') to achieve this.\n\nLet's work through the steps to find a solution:\n\n1. Fill Jug B to its full capacity (12 liters).\n2. Pour from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full (5 liters), leaving 7 liters in Jug B.\n3. Empty Jug A.\n4. Pour the remaining 7 liters from Jug B to Jug A.\n5. Fill Jug B again to its full capacity (12 liters).\n6. Pour from Jug B to Jug A until Jug A is full (5 liters), leaving 8 liters in Jug B.\n\nNow, Jug B contains exactly 8 liters of water, which is the target amount.\n\nHere's the sequence of moves in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n```\n\nEnclosing the JSON-parsable list in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<\n[\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour B->A\",\n    \"fill B\",\n    \"pour B->A\"\n]\n>>>"
