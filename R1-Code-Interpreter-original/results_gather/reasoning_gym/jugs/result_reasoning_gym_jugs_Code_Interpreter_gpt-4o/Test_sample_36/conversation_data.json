    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to use the three jugs with capacities of 11, 11, and 10 liters to measure exactly 7 liters in one of the jugs. We can achieve this by strategically filling, emptying, and pouring water between the jugs. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Fill Jug C (10 liters).\n2. Pour C into A (Jug A now has 10 liters, Jug C is empty).\n3. Fill Jug C again (10 liters).\n4. Pour C into A (Jug A now has 11 liters, Jug C has 9 liters).\n5. Empty Jug A.\n6. Pour C into A (Jug A now has 9 liters, Jug C is empty).\n7. Fill Jug C again (10 liters).\n8. Pour C into A (Jug A now has 11 liters, Jug C has 8 liters).\n9. Empty Jug A.\n10. Pour C into A (Jug A now has 8 liters, Jug C is empty).\n11. Fill Jug C again (10 liters).\n12. Pour C into A (Jug A now has 11 liters, Jug C has 7 liters).\n\nNow, Jug C has exactly 7 liters, which is the target amount.\n\nHere's the sequence of moves in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n```\n\nEnclosed in triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<\n[\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n>>>"
