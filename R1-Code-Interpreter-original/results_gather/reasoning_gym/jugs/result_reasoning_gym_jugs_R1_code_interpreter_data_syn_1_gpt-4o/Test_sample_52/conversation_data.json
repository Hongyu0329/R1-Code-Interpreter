  "question": "You are a police officer. A maniac has planted a bomb next to a public fountain.\n\nTo defuse the bomb, you must solve a puzzle. The puzzle is solved when you fill any of the available jugs with the target amount of water.\n\nYou have three move types: 'fill', 'empty' and 'pour'.\n\nTo fill Jug A, you 'fill A'.\nTo empty Jug B, you 'empty B'.\nTo pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B, you 'pour A->B'.\nAll jugs are empty to begin with.\n\nThe empty jugs hold this many litres of water: A:10, B:10, C:11\nAnd your target is: 6 litres.\n\nHow do you defuse the bomb?\n\nReply as a JSON-parsable list of moves which result in any of the jugs being filled with the target amount, and enclose the JSON-parsable list in triple angle brackets, like <<<JSON-parsable list>>>.\n",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 6 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 10 liters, 10 liters, and 11 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's consider the possible states of the jugs as a tuple (A, B, C), where A, B, and C represent the amount of water in each jug. We start with the state (0, 0, 0) and aim to reach a state where one of the jugs contains exactly 6 liters.\n\nWe can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the possible states and find a sequence of moves that leads to the target state. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible states level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest sequence of moves.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_target_state(state, target):\n    return target in state\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state, capacities):\n    A, B, C = state\n    capA, capB, capC = capacities\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Fill operations\n    if A < capA:\n        moves.append(('fill A', (capA, B, C)))\n    if B < capB:\n        moves.append(('fill B', (A, capB, C)))\n    if C < capC:\n        moves.append(('fill C', (A, B, capC)))\n    \n    # Empty operations\n    if A > 0:\n        moves.append(('empty A', (0, B, C)))\n    if B > 0:\n        moves.append(('empty B', (A, 0, C)))\n    if C > 0:\n        moves.append(('empty C', (A, B, 0)))\n    \n    # Pour operations\n    if A > 0 and B < capB:\n        pour_amount = min(A, capB - B)\n        moves.append(('pour A->B', (A - pour_amount, B + pour_amount, C)))\n    if A > 0 and C < capC:\n        pour_amount = min(A, capC - C)\n        moves.append(('pour A->C', (A - pour_amount, B, C + pour_amount)))\n    if B > 0 and A < capA:\n        pour_amount = min(B, capA - A)\n        moves.append(('pour B->A', (A + pour_amount, B - pour_amount, C)))\n    if B > 0 and C < capC:\n        pour_amount = min(B, capC - C)\n        moves.append(('pour B->C', (A, B - pour_amount, C + pour_amount)))\n    if C > 0 and A < capA:\n        pour_amount = min(C, capA - A)\n        moves.append(('pour C->A', (A + pour_amount, B, C - pour_amount)))\n    if C > 0 and B < capB:\n        pour_amount = min(C, capB - B)\n        moves.append(('pour C->B', (A, B + pour_amount, C - pour_amount)))\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef find_solution(capacities, target):\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_target_state(current_state, target):\n            return path\n        \n        for move, new_state in get_possible_moves(current_state, capacities):\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n    \n    return None\n\ncapacities = (10, 10, 11)\ntarget = 6\nsolution = find_solution(capacities, target)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 6 liters of water.
