    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 8 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 7 liters, 7 liters, and 10 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another until the first jug is empty or the second jug is full.\n\nLet's use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible states of the jugs until we find a state where one of the jugs contains exactly 8 liters. We'll represent the state of the jugs as a tuple (A, B, C), where A, B, and C are the current amounts of water in jugs A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nWe'll start with the initial state (0, 0, 0) and apply the allowed operations to generate new states. We'll keep track of visited states to avoid processing the same state multiple times.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Initialize a queue with the initial state (0, 0, 0) and an empty list of moves.\n2. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue the front element, which contains the current state and the list of moves to reach that state.\n   - If any jug contains exactly 8 liters, return the list of moves.\n   - Generate all possible new states by applying the allowed operations.\n   - For each new state, if it hasn't been visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve_jug_problem():\n    # Initial state: all jugs are empty\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    target = 8\n    capacities = (7, 7, 10)\n    \n    # Queue for BFS: each element is (state, moves)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (a, b, c), moves = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if any jug has the target amount\n        if a == target or b == target or c == target:\n            return moves\n        \n        # Generate all possible new states\n        new_states = []\n        \n        # Fill operations\n        new_states.append(((capacities[0], b, c), moves + ['fill A']))\n        new_states.append(((a, capacities[1], c), moves + ['fill B']))\n        new_states.append(((a, b, capacities[2]), moves + ['fill C']))\n        \n        # Empty operations\n        new_states.append(((0, b, c), moves + ['empty A']))\n        new_states.append(((a, 0, c), moves + ['empty B']))\n        new_states.append(((a, b, 0), moves + ['empty C']))\n        \n        # Pour operations\n        # Pour A -> B\n        pour = min(a, capacities[1] - b)\n        new_states.append(((a - pour, b + pour, c), moves + ['pour A->B']))\n        \n        # Pour A -> C\n        pour = min(a, capacities[2] - c)\n        new_states.append(((a - pour, b, c + pour), moves + ['pour A->C']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> A\n        pour = min(b, capacities[0] - a)\n        new_states.append(((a + pour, b - pour, c), moves + ['pour B->A']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> C\n        pour = min(b, capacities[2] - c)\n        new_states.append(((a, b - pour, c + pour), moves + ['pour B->C']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> A\n        pour = min(c, capacities[0] - a)\n        new_states.append(((a + pour, b, c - pour), moves + ['pour C->A']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> B\n        pour = min(c, capacities[1] - b)\n        new_states.append(((a, b + pour, c - pour), moves + ['pour C->B']))\n        \n        # Add new states to the queue if not visited\n        for new_state, new_moves in new_states:\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, new_moves))\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nresult = solve_jug_problem()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 8 liters of water. Let's execute it to get the solution.",
