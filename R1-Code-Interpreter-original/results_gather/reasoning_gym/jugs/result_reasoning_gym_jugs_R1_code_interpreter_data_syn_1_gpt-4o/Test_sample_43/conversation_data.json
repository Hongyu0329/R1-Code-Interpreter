  "question": "You are a police officer. A maniac has planted a bomb next to a public fountain.\n\nTo defuse the bomb, you must solve a puzzle. The puzzle is solved when you fill any of the available jugs with the target amount of water.\n\nYou have three move types: 'fill', 'empty' and 'pour'.\n\nTo fill Jug A, you 'fill A'.\nTo empty Jug B, you 'empty B'.\nTo pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B, you 'pour A->B'.\nAll jugs are empty to begin with.\n\nThe empty jugs hold this many litres of water: A:10, B:13, C:13\nAnd your target is: 12 litres.\n\nHow do you defuse the bomb?\n\nReply as a JSON-parsable list of moves which result in any of the jugs being filled with the target amount, and enclose the JSON-parsable list in triple angle brackets, like <<<JSON-parsable list>>>.\n",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 12 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 10, 13, and 13 liters, respectively. The target is to have exactly 12 liters in one of the jugs.\n\nThe operations we can perform are:\n1. Fill a jug to its full capacity.\n2. Empty a jug completely.\n3. Pour water from one jug to another until the first jug is empty or the second jug is full.\n\nWe can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible states of the jugs and find the sequence of moves that leads to the target amount. Each state can be represented as a tuple of the current amounts of water in the three jugs.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve_jug_problem():\n    # Initial state: all jugs are empty\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    # Target amount\n    target = 12\n    # Jug capacities\n    capacities = (10, 13, 13)\n    \n    # Queue for BFS\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    # Set to keep track of visited states\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (a, b, c), path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the target\n        if a == target or b == target or c == target:\n            return path\n        \n        # Generate all possible next states\n        next_states = []\n        \n        # Fill operations\n        next_states.append(((capacities[0], b, c), path + ['fill A']))\n        next_states.append(((a, capacities[1], c), path + ['fill B']))\n        next_states.append(((a, b, capacities[2]), path + ['fill C']))\n        \n        # Empty operations\n        next_states.append(((0, b, c), path + ['empty A']))\n        next_states.append(((a, 0, c), path + ['empty B']))\n        next_states.append(((a, b, 0), path + ['empty C']))\n        \n        # Pour operations\n        # Pour A -> B\n        pour_amount = min(a, capacities[1] - b)\n        next_states.append(((a - pour_amount, b + pour_amount, c), path + ['pour A->B']))\n        \n        # Pour A -> C\n        pour_amount = min(a, capacities[2] - c)\n        next_states.append(((a - pour_amount, b, c + pour_amount), path + ['pour A->C']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> A\n        pour_amount = min(b, capacities[0] - a)\n        next_states.append(((a + pour_amount, b - pour_amount, c), path + ['pour B->A']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> C\n        pour_amount = min(b, capacities[2] - c)\n        next_states.append(((a, b - pour_amount, c + pour_amount), path + ['pour B->C']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> A\n        pour_amount = min(c, capacities[0] - a)\n        next_states.append(((a + pour_amount, b, c - pour_amount), path + ['pour C->A']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> B\n        pour_amount = min(c, capacities[1] - b)\n        next_states.append(((a, b + pour_amount, c - pour_amount), path + ['pour C->B']))\n        \n        # Add valid next states to the queue\n        for state, new_path in next_states:\n            if state not in visited:\n                visited.add(state)\n                queue.append((state, new_path))\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nprint(solve_jug_problem())\n```\n\nThis code will find the sequence of moves to achieve exactly 12 liters in one of the jugs.
