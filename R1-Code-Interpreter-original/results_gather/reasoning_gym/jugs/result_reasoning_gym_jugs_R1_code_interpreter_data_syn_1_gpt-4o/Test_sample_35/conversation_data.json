  "question": "You are a police officer. A maniac has planted a bomb next to a public fountain.\n\nTo defuse the bomb, you must solve a puzzle. The puzzle is solved when you fill any of the available jugs with the target amount of water.\n\nYou have three move types: 'fill', 'empty' and 'pour'.\n\nTo fill Jug A, you 'fill A'.\nTo empty Jug B, you 'empty B'.\nTo pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B, you 'pour A->B'.\nAll jugs are empty to begin with.\n\nThe empty jugs hold this many litres of water: A:11, B:12, C:12\nAnd your target is: 4 litres.\n\nHow do you defuse the bomb?\n\nReply as a JSON-parsable list of moves which result in any of the jugs being filled with the target amount, and enclose the JSON-parsable list in triple angle brackets, like <<<JSON-parsable list>>>.\n",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 4 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 11, 12, and 12 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nThe problem can be approached using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. In this case, the graph nodes represent the states of the jugs, and the edges represent the possible moves.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n1. Start with all jugs empty: (0, 0, 0).\n2. Use BFS to explore all possible states by applying the allowed operations.\n3. Keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.\n4. Stop when a state is reached where one of the jugs contains exactly 4 liters of water.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to find the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_target_reached(state, target):\n    return target in state\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state, capacities):\n    a, b, c = state\n    cap_a, cap_b, cap_c = capacities\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Fill operations\n    if a < cap_a:\n        moves.append(((cap_a, b, c), 'fill A'))\n    if b < cap_b:\n        moves.append(((a, cap_b, c), 'fill B'))\n    if c < cap_c:\n        moves.append(((a, b, cap_c), 'fill C'))\n    \n    # Empty operations\n    if a > 0:\n        moves.append(((0, b, c), 'empty A'))\n    if b > 0:\n        moves.append(((a, 0, c), 'empty B'))\n    if c > 0:\n        moves.append(((a, b, 0), 'empty C'))\n    \n    # Pour operations\n    if a > 0 and b < cap_b:\n        pour_amount = min(a, cap_b - b)\n        moves.append(((a - pour_amount, b + pour_amount, c), 'pour A->B'))\n    if a > 0 and c < cap_c:\n        pour_amount = min(a, cap_c - c)\n        moves.append(((a - pour_amount, b, c + pour_amount), 'pour A->C'))\n    if b > 0 and a < cap_a:\n        pour_amount = min(b, cap_a - a)\n        moves.append(((a + pour_amount, b - pour_amount, c), 'pour B->A'))\n    if b > 0 and c < cap_c:\n        pour_amount = min(b, cap_c - c)\n        moves.append(((a, b - pour_amount, c + pour_amount), 'pour B->C'))\n    if c > 0 and a < cap_a:\n        pour_amount = min(c, cap_a - a)\n        moves.append(((a + pour_amount, b, c - pour_amount), 'pour C->A'))\n    if c > 0 and b < cap_b:\n        pour_amount = min(c, cap_b - b)\n        moves.append(((a, b + pour_amount, c - pour_amount), 'pour C->B'))\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef find_solution(capacities, target):\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_target_reached(current_state, target):\n            return path\n        \n        for next_state, move in get_possible_moves(current_state, capacities):\n            if next_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(next_state)\n                queue.append((next_state, path + [move]))\n    \n    return None\n\ncapacities = (11, 12, 12)\ntarget = 4\nsolution = find_solution(capacities, target)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will find the sequence of moves to achieve the target of 4 liters in one of the jugs.
