    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 7 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 5 liters, 9 liters, and 9 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another until the first is empty or the second is full.\n\nThe goal is to reach a state where one of the jugs contains exactly 7 liters. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible states and find the shortest sequence of moves to reach the target.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_target_reached(state, target):\n    return target in state\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state, capacities):\n    A, B, C = state\n    capA, capB, capC = capacities\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Fill operations\n    if A < capA:\n        moves.append((capA, B, C, 'fill A'))\n    if B < capB:\n        moves.append((A, capB, C, 'fill B'))\n    if C < capC:\n        moves.append((A, B, capC, 'fill C'))\n    \n    # Empty operations\n    if A > 0:\n        moves.append((0, B, C, 'empty A'))\n    if B > 0:\n        moves.append((A, 0, C, 'empty B'))\n    if C > 0:\n        moves.append((A, B, 0, 'empty C'))\n    \n    # Pour operations\n    # Pour A -> B\n    if A > 0 and B < capB:\n        pour_amount = min(A, capB - B)\n        moves.append((A - pour_amount, B + pour_amount, C, 'pour A->B'))\n    # Pour A -> C\n    if A > 0 and C < capC:\n        pour_amount = min(A, capC - C)\n        moves.append((A - pour_amount, B, C + pour_amount, 'pour A->C'))\n    # Pour B -> A\n    if B > 0 and A < capA:\n        pour_amount = min(B, capA - A)\n        moves.append((A + pour_amount, B - pour_amount, C, 'pour B->A'))\n    # Pour B -> C\n    if B > 0 and C < capC:\n        pour_amount = min(B, capC - C)\n        moves.append((A, B - pour_amount, C + pour_amount, 'pour B->C'))\n    # Pour C -> A\n    if C > 0 and A < capA:\n        pour_amount = min(C, capA - A)\n        moves.append((A + pour_amount, B, C - pour_amount, 'pour C->A'))\n    # Pour C -> B\n    if C > 0 and B < capB:\n        pour_amount = min(C, capB - B)\n        moves.append((A, B + pour_amount, C - pour_amount, 'pour C->B'))\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef solve_jug_problem(capacities, target):\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_target_reached(current_state, target):\n            return path\n        \n        for next_state in get_possible_moves(current_state, capacities):\n            state, move = next_state[:3], next_state[3]\n            if state not in visited:\n                visited.add(state)\n                queue.append((state, path + [move]))\n    \n    return []\n\ncapacities = (5, 9, 9)\ntarget = 7\nsolution = solve_jug_problem(capacities, target)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will find the sequence of moves to achieve exactly 7 liters in one of the jugs.
