    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 2 litres of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 9, 13, and 4 litres, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another until the first is empty or the second is full.\n\nWe can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible states of the jugs until we find a state where one of the jugs contains exactly 2 litres. Each state can be represented as a tuple (A, B, C) indicating the current amount of water in jugs A, B, and C.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve_jug_problem():\n    # Initial state: all jugs are empty\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    # Target amount of water\n    target = 2\n    # Jug capacities\n    capacities = (9, 13, 4)\n    \n    # Queue for BFS\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    # Set to keep track of visited states\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (a, b, c), path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the target\n        if a == target or b == target or c == target:\n            return path\n        \n        # Generate all possible next states\n        next_states = []\n        \n        # Fill operations\n        next_states.append(((capacities[0], b, c), path + ['fill A']))\n        next_states.append(((a, capacities[1], c), path + ['fill B']))\n        next_states.append(((a, b, capacities[2]), path + ['fill C']))\n        \n        # Empty operations\n        next_states.append(((0, b, c), path + ['empty A']))\n        next_states.append(((a, 0, c), path + ['empty B']))\n        next_states.append(((a, b, 0), path + ['empty C']))\n        \n        # Pour operations\n        # Pour A -> B\n        pour = min(a, capacities[1] - b)\n        next_states.append(((a - pour, b + pour, c), path + ['pour A->B']))\n        \n        # Pour A -> C\n        pour = min(a, capacities[2] - c)\n        next_states.append(((a - pour, b, c + pour), path + ['pour A->C']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> A\n        pour = min(b, capacities[0] - a)\n        next_states.append(((a + pour, b - pour, c), path + ['pour B->A']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> C\n        pour = min(b, capacities[2] - c)\n        next_states.append(((a, b - pour, c + pour), path + ['pour B->C']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> A\n        pour = min(c, capacities[0] - a)\n        next_states.append(((a + pour, b, c - pour), path + ['pour C->A']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> B\n        pour = min(c, capacities[1] - b)\n        next_states.append(((a, b + pour, c - pour), path + ['pour C->B']))\n        \n        # Add valid next states to the queue\n        for state, new_path in next_states:\n            if state not in visited:\n                visited.add(state)\n                queue.append((state, new_path))\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nprint(solve_jug_problem())\n```\n\nThis code will find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 2 litres of water. Let's execute it to get the solution.",
