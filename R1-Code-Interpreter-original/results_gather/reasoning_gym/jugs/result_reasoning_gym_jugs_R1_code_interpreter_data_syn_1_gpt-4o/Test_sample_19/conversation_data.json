    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 3 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 6, 11, and 11 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nThe goal is to use these operations to reach a state where one of the jugs contains exactly 3 liters. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible states and find the shortest sequence of moves to reach the target.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_target_reached(state, target):\n    return target in state\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state, capacities):\n    A, B, C = state\n    capA, capB, capC = capacities\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Fill operations\n    if A < capA:\n        moves.append(('fill A', (capA, B, C)))\n    if B < capB:\n        moves.append(('fill B', (A, capB, C)))\n    if C < capC:\n        moves.append(('fill C', (A, B, capC)))\n    \n    # Empty operations\n    if A > 0:\n        moves.append(('empty A', (0, B, C)))\n    if B > 0:\n        moves.append(('empty B', (A, 0, C)))\n    if C > 0:\n        moves.append(('empty C', (A, B, 0)))\n    \n    # Pour operations\n    if A > 0 and B < capB:\n        pour_amount = min(A, capB - B)\n        moves.append(('pour A->B', (A - pour_amount, B + pour_amount, C)))\n    if A > 0 and C < capC:\n        pour_amount = min(A, capC - C)\n        moves.append(('pour A->C', (A - pour_amount, B, C + pour_amount)))\n    if B > 0 and A < capA:\n        pour_amount = min(B, capA - A)\n        moves.append(('pour B->A', (A + pour_amount, B - pour_amount, C)))\n    if B > 0 and C < capC:\n        pour_amount = min(B, capC - C)\n        moves.append(('pour B->C', (A, B - pour_amount, C + pour_amount)))\n    if C > 0 and A < capA:\n        pour_amount = min(C, capA - A)\n        moves.append(('pour C->A', (A + pour_amount, B, C - pour_amount)))\n    if C > 0 and B < capB:\n        pour_amount = min(C, capB - B)\n        moves.append(('pour C->B', (A, B + pour_amount, C - pour_amount)))\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef solve_jug_problem(capacities, target):\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_target_reached(current_state, target):\n            return path\n        \n        for move, new_state in get_possible_moves(current_state, capacities):\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n    \n    return None\n\ncapacities = (6, 11, 11)\ntarget = 3\nsolution = solve_jug_problem(capacities, target)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will find the sequence of moves to achieve exactly 3 liters in one of the jugs.
