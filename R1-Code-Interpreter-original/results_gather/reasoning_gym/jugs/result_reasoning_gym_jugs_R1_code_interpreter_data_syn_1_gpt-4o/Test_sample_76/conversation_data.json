    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 4 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 8 liters, 8 liters, and 13 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another until the first jug is empty or the second jug is full.\n\nLet's explore the possible moves systematically to reach the target of 4 liters in one of the jugs. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible states of the jugs until we find a solution.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Start with all jugs empty: (0, 0, 0).\n2. Use a queue to explore each state and the sequence of moves that led to it.\n3. For each state, generate all possible next states by applying the allowed operations.\n4. Check if any of the resulting states have a jug with exactly 4 liters.\n5. If a solution is found, return the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve_jug_problem():\n    # Initial state: all jugs are empty\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    # Target amount of water\n    target = 4\n    # Jug capacities\n    capacities = (8, 8, 13)\n    \n    # Queue for BFS: stores (state, path)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    # Set to keep track of visited states\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (a, b, c), path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the target\n        if a == target or b == target or c == target:\n            return path\n        \n        # Generate all possible next states\n        next_states = []\n        \n        # Fill operations\n        if a < capacities[0]:\n            next_states.append(((capacities[0], b, c), path + ['fill A']))\n        if b < capacities[1]:\n            next_states.append(((a, capacities[1], c), path + ['fill B']))\n        if c < capacities[2]:\n            next_states.append(((a, b, capacities[2]), path + ['fill C']))\n        \n        # Empty operations\n        if a > 0:\n            next_states.append(((0, b, c), path + ['empty A']))\n        if b > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, 0, c), path + ['empty B']))\n        if c > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, b, 0), path + ['empty C']))\n        \n        # Pour operations\n        # Pour A -> B\n        pour_amount = min(a, capacities[1] - b)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a - pour_amount, b + pour_amount, c), path + ['pour A->B']))\n        \n        # Pour A -> C\n        pour_amount = min(a, capacities[2] - c)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a - pour_amount, b, c + pour_amount), path + ['pour A->C']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> A\n        pour_amount = min(b, capacities[0] - a)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a + pour_amount, b - pour_amount, c), path + ['pour B->A']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> C\n        pour_amount = min(b, capacities[2] - c)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, b - pour_amount, c + pour_amount), path + ['pour B->C']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> A\n        pour_amount = min(c, capacities[0] - a)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a + pour_amount, b, c - pour_amount), path + ['pour C->A']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> B\n        pour_amount = min(c, capacities[1] - b)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, b + pour_amount, c - pour_amount), path + ['pour C->B']))\n        \n        # Add new states to the queue\n        for state, new_path in next_states:\n            if state not in visited:\n                visited.add(state)\n                queue.append((state, new_path))\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nprint(solve_jug_problem())\n```\n\nThis code will find the sequence of moves to achieve exactly 4 liters in one of the jugs.
