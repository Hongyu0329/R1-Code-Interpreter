    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 8 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 13 liters, 12 liters, and 13 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another until the first jug is empty or the second jug is full.\n\nWe can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible states of the jugs and find the shortest sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 8 liters of water. Each state can be represented as a tuple of the current amounts of water in the three jugs.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve_jug_problem():\n    # Initial state: all jugs are empty\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    # Target amount of water\n    target = 8\n    # Jug capacities\n    capacities = (13, 12, 13)\n    \n    # Queue for BFS\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    # Set to keep track of visited states\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (a, b, c), path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the target\n        if a == target or b == target or c == target:\n            return path\n        \n        # Generate all possible next states\n        next_states = []\n        \n        # Fill operations\n        next_states.append(((capacities[0], b, c), path + [\"fill A\"]))\n        next_states.append(((a, capacities[1], c), path + [\"fill B\"]))\n        next_states.append(((a, b, capacities[2]), path + [\"fill C\"]))\n        \n        # Empty operations\n        next_states.append(((0, b, c), path + [\"empty A\"]))\n        next_states.append(((a, 0, c), path + [\"empty B\"]))\n        next_states.append(((a, b, 0), path + [\"empty C\"]))\n        \n        # Pour operations\n        # Pour A -> B\n        pour_amount = min(a, capacities[1] - b)\n        next_states.append(((a - pour_amount, b + pour_amount, c), path + [\"pour A->B\"]))\n        \n        # Pour A -> C\n        pour_amount = min(a, capacities[2] - c)\n        next_states.append(((a - pour_amount, b, c + pour_amount), path + [\"pour A->C\"]))\n        \n        # Pour B -> A\n        pour_amount = min(b, capacities[0] - a)\n        next_states.append(((a + pour_amount, b - pour_amount, c), path + [\"pour B->A\"]))\n        \n        # Pour B -> C\n        pour_amount = min(b, capacities[2] - c)\n        next_states.append(((a, b - pour_amount, c + pour_amount), path + [\"pour B->C\"]))\n        \n        # Pour C -> A\n        pour_amount = min(c, capacities[0] - a)\n        next_states.append(((a + pour_amount, b, c - pour_amount), path + [\"pour C->A\"]))\n        \n        # Pour C -> B\n        pour_amount = min(c, capacities[1] - b)\n        next_states.append(((a, b + pour_amount, c - pour_amount), path + [\"pour C->B\"]))\n        \n        # Add valid next states to the queue\n        for state, new_path in next_states:\n            if state not in visited:\n                visited.add(state)\n                queue.append((state, new_path))\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nresult = solve_jug_problem()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the sequence of moves to achieve exactly 8 liters in one of the jugs. Let's execute it to get the result.",
