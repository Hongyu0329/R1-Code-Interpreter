    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 4 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 8 liters, 5 liters, and 13 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's approach this problem using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Each state in our search will be represented by a tuple of the current water levels in the three jugs. We will explore all possible states by applying the allowed operations and keep track of the sequence of moves that lead to each state.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Start with the initial state where all jugs are empty: (0, 0, 0).\n2. Use a queue to explore each state and the sequence of moves that lead to it.\n3. For each state, apply all possible operations to generate new states.\n4. If a state is reached where any jug contains exactly 4 liters, return the sequence of moves that led to this state.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve_jug_problem():\n    # Initial state: all jugs are empty\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    # Target amount of water\n    target = 4\n    # Jug capacities\n    capacities = (8, 5, 13)\n    \n    # Queue for BFS: stores (current_state, moves)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    # Set to keep track of visited states\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (a, b, c), moves = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if any jug has the target amount of water\n        if a == target or b == target or c == target:\n            return moves\n        \n        # Generate all possible next states\n        next_states = []\n        \n        # Fill operations\n        next_states.append(((capacities[0], b, c), moves + ['fill A']))\n        next_states.append(((a, capacities[1], c), moves + ['fill B']))\n        next_states.append(((a, b, capacities[2]), moves + ['fill C']))\n        \n        # Empty operations\n        next_states.append(((0, b, c), moves + ['empty A']))\n        next_states.append(((a, 0, c), moves + ['empty B']))\n        next_states.append(((a, b, 0), moves + ['empty C']))\n        \n        # Pour operations\n        # Pour A -> B\n        pour = min(a, capacities[1] - b)\n        next_states.append(((a - pour, b + pour, c), moves + ['pour A->B']))\n        \n        # Pour A -> C\n        pour = min(a, capacities[2] - c)\n        next_states.append(((a - pour, b, c + pour), moves + ['pour A->C']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> A\n        pour = min(b, capacities[0] - a)\n        next_states.append(((a + pour, b - pour, c), moves + ['pour B->A']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> C\n        pour = min(b, capacities[2] - c)\n        next_states.append(((a, b - pour, c + pour), moves + ['pour B->C']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> A\n        pour = min(c, capacities[0] - a)\n        next_states.append(((a + pour, b, c - pour), moves + ['pour C->A']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> B\n        pour = min(c, capacities[1] - b)\n        next_states.append(((a, b + pour, c - pour), moves + ['pour C->B']))\n        \n        # Add new states to the queue\n        for state, new_moves in next_states:\n            if state not in visited:\n                visited.add(state)\n                queue.append((state, new_moves))\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nresult = solve_jug_problem()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the sequence of moves to achieve exactly 4 liters in one of the jugs. Let's execute it to see the result.",
