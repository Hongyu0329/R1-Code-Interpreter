    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 10 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 13 liters, 13 liters, and 4 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another until the first jug is empty or the second jug is full.\n\nLet's explore the possible moves systematically to reach the target of 10 liters in one of the jugs. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible states of the jugs and find the shortest sequence of moves to reach the target.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Start with all jugs empty: (0, 0, 0).\n2. Use a queue to explore each state and the sequence of moves to reach that state.\n3. For each state, apply all possible moves (fill, empty, pour) to generate new states.\n4. If a state with 10 liters in any jug is reached, return the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve_jug_problem():\n    # Initial state: all jugs are empty\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    # Target amount of water\n    target = 10\n    # Jug capacities\n    capacities = (13, 13, 4)\n    \n    # Queue for BFS: stores (state, path)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    # Set to keep track of visited states\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (a, b, c), path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the target\n        if a == target or b == target or c == target:\n            return path\n        \n        # Generate all possible moves\n        # Fill operations\n        if a < capacities[0]:\n            new_state = (capacities[0], b, c)\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [\"fill A\"]))\n        if b < capacities[1]:\n            new_state = (a, capacities[1], c)\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [\"fill B\"]))\n        if c < capacities[2]:\n            new_state = (a, b, capacities[2])\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [\"fill C\"]))\n        \n        # Empty operations\n        if a > 0:\n            new_state = (0, b, c)\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [\"empty A\"]))\n        if b > 0:\n            new_state = (a, 0, c)\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [\"empty B\"]))\n        if c > 0:\n            new_state = (a, b, 0)\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [\"empty C\"]))\n        \n        # Pour operations\n        # Pour A -> B\n        if a > 0 and b < capacities[1]:\n            pour_amount = min(a, capacities[1] - b)\n            new_state = (a - pour_amount, b + pour_amount, c)\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [\"pour A->B\"]))\n        \n        # Pour A -> C\n        if a > 0 and c < capacities[2]:\n            pour_amount = min(a, capacities[2] - c)\n            new_state = (a - pour_amount, b, c + pour_amount)\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [\"pour A->C\"]))\n        \n        # Pour B -> A\n        if b > 0 and a < capacities[0]:\n            pour_amount = min(b, capacities[0] - a)\n            new_state = (a + pour_amount, b - pour_amount, c)\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [\"pour B->A\"]))\n        \n        # Pour B -> C\n        if b > 0 and c < capacities[2]:\n            pour_amount = min(b, capacities[2] - c)\n            new_state = (a, b - pour_amount, c + pour_amount)\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [\"pour B->C\"]))\n        \n        # Pour C -> A\n        if c > 0 and a < capacities[0]:\n            pour_amount = min(c, capacities[0] - a)\n            new_state = (a + pour_amount, b, c - pour_amount)\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [\"pour C->A\"]))\n        \n        # Pour C -> B\n        if c > 0 and b < capacities[1]:\n            pour_amount = min(c, capacities[1] - b)\n            new_state = (a, b + pour_amount, c - pour_amount)\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [\"pour C->B\"]))\n    \n    return []\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_jug_problem()\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will find the sequence of moves to get exactly 10 liters in one of the jugs.
