    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 4 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 10 liters, 10 liters, and 11 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another until one is empty or the other is full.\n\nLet's explore the possible moves systematically to reach the target of 4 liters in one of the jugs.\n\n1. Start with all jugs empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n2. Fill Jug C: A = 0, B = 0, C = 11.\n3. Pour C into A: A = 10, B = 0, C = 1.\n4. Empty A: A = 0, B = 0, C = 1.\n5. Pour C into A: A = 1, B = 0, C = 0.\n6. Fill C: A = 1, B = 0, C = 11.\n7. Pour C into A: A = 10, B = 0, C = 2.\n8. Empty A: A = 0, B = 0, C = 2.\n9. Pour C into A: A = 2, B = 0, C = 0.\n10. Fill C: A = 2, B = 0, C = 11.\n11. Pour C into A: A = 10, B = 0, C = 3.\n12. Empty A: A = 0, B = 0, C = 3.\n13. Pour C into A: A = 3, B = 0, C = 0.\n14. Fill C: A = 3, B = 0, C = 11.\n15. Pour C into A: A = 10, B = 0, C = 4.\n\nNow, Jug C contains exactly 4 liters of water, which is our target. Let's represent this sequence of moves in a JSON-parsable list.\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nmoves = [\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"empty A\",\n    \"pour C->A\",\n    \"fill C\",\n    \"pour C->A\"\n]\n\nprint(json.dumps(moves))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide us with the JSON-parsable list of moves.",
    "The code output provides the sequence of moves needed to achieve the target of 4 liters in one of the jugs. The sequence of operations is designed to fill Jug C, pour its contents into Jug A, and repeat the process until Jug C contains exactly 4 liters.\n\nHere is the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<[\"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\", \"empty A\", \"pour C->A\", \"fill C\", \"pour C->A\"]>>>"
