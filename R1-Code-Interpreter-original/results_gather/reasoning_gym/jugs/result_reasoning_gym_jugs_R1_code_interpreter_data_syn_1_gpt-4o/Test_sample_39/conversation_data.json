    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 3 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 13 liters, 12 liters, and 6 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another until the first jug is empty or the second jug is full.\n\nLet's consider the possible moves and try to find a sequence that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 3 liters. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the state space of the jugs' water levels.\n\nWe'll represent the state of the jugs as a tuple (A, B, C), where A, B, and C are the current amounts of water in jugs A, B, and C, respectively. We'll start with the initial state (0, 0, 0) and explore all possible moves until we reach a state where one of the jugs contains exactly 3 liters.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_target_reached(state, target):\n    return target in state\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state, capacities):\n    A, B, C = state\n    capA, capB, capC = capacities\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Fill operations\n    if A < capA:\n        moves.append((capA, B, C))\n    if B < capB:\n        moves.append((A, capB, C))\n    if C < capC:\n        moves.append((A, B, capC))\n    \n    # Empty operations\n    if A > 0:\n        moves.append((0, B, C))\n    if B > 0:\n        moves.append((A, 0, C))\n    if C > 0:\n        moves.append((A, B, 0))\n    \n    # Pour operations\n    # Pour A -> B\n    pour = min(A, capB - B)\n    moves.append((A - pour, B + pour, C))\n    \n    # Pour A -> C\n    pour = min(A, capC - C)\n    moves.append((A - pour, B, C + pour))\n    \n    # Pour B -> A\n    pour = min(B, capA - A)\n    moves.append((A + pour, B - pour, C))\n    \n    # Pour B -> C\n    pour = min(B, capC - C)\n    moves.append((A, B - pour, C + pour))\n    \n    # Pour C -> A\n    pour = min(C, capA - A)\n    moves.append((A + pour, B, C - pour))\n    \n    # Pour C -> B\n    pour = min(C, capB - B)\n    moves.append((A, B + pour, C - pour))\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef find_solution(capacities, target):\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_target_reached(current_state, target):\n            return path\n        \n        if current_state in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add(current_state)\n        \n        for next_state in get_possible_moves(current_state, capacities):\n            if next_state not in visited:\n                move = (current_state, next_state)\n                queue.append((next_state, path + [move]))\n    \n    return None\n\ncapacities = (13, 12, 6)\ntarget = 3\nsolution = find_solution(capacities, target)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will explore the state space of the jugs' water levels and find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 3 liters of water.
