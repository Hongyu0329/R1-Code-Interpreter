    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 9 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 13 liters, 13 liters, and 5 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nWe can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible states of the jugs until we find a state where one of the jugs contains exactly 9 liters. Each state can be represented as a tuple of the current amounts of water in the three jugs. We will also keep track of the sequence of moves that led to each state.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve_jug_problem():\n    # Initial state: all jugs are empty\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    # Target amount of water\n    target = 9\n    # Jug capacities\n    capacities = (13, 13, 5)\n    \n    # Queue for BFS: stores tuples of (current state, list of moves)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    # Set to keep track of visited states\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (a, b, c), moves = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the target\n        if a == target or b == target or c == target:\n            return moves\n        \n        # Generate all possible next states\n        next_states = []\n        \n        # Fill operations\n        if a < capacities[0]:\n            next_states.append(((capacities[0], b, c), moves + ['fill A']))\n        if b < capacities[1]:\n            next_states.append(((a, capacities[1], c), moves + ['fill B']))\n        if c < capacities[2]:\n            next_states.append(((a, b, capacities[2]), moves + ['fill C']))\n        \n        # Empty operations\n        if a > 0:\n            next_states.append(((0, b, c), moves + ['empty A']))\n        if b > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, 0, c), moves + ['empty B']))\n        if c > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, b, 0), moves + ['empty C']))\n        \n        # Pour operations\n        # Pour A -> B\n        pour_amount = min(a, capacities[1] - b)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a - pour_amount, b + pour_amount, c), moves + ['pour A->B']))\n        \n        # Pour A -> C\n        pour_amount = min(a, capacities[2] - c)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a - pour_amount, b, c + pour_amount), moves + ['pour A->C']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> A\n        pour_amount = min(b, capacities[0] - a)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a + pour_amount, b - pour_amount, c), moves + ['pour B->A']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> C\n        pour_amount = min(b, capacities[2] - c)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, b - pour_amount, c + pour_amount), moves + ['pour B->C']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> A\n        pour_amount = min(c, capacities[0] - a)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a + pour_amount, b, c - pour_amount), moves + ['pour C->A']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> B\n        pour_amount = min(c, capacities[1] - b)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, b + pour_amount, c - pour_amount), moves + ['pour C->B']))\n        \n        # Add new states to the queue\n        for state, new_moves in next_states:\n            if state not in visited:\n                visited.add(state)\n                queue.append((state, new_moves))\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nprint(solve_jug_problem())\n```\n\nThis code will find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 9 liters of water.
