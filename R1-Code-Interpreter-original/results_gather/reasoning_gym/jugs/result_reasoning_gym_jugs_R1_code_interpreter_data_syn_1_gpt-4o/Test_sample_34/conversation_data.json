    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 12 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 11, 13, and 13 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another until the first jug is empty or the second jug is full.\n\nThe goal is to use these operations to reach a state where one of the jugs contains exactly 12 liters. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible states and find the shortest sequence of moves to reach the target.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_target_reached(state, target):\n    return target in state\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state, capacities):\n    moves = []\n    # Fill operations\n    for i in range(3):\n        if state[i] < capacities[i]:\n            new_state = list(state)\n            new_state[i] = capacities[i]\n            moves.append((tuple(new_state), f'fill {chr(65+i)}'))\n    \n    # Empty operations\n    for i in range(3):\n        if state[i] > 0:\n            new_state = list(state)\n            new_state[i] = 0\n            moves.append((tuple(new_state), f'empty {chr(65+i)}'))\n    \n    # Pour operations\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if i != j and state[i] > 0 and state[j] < capacities[j]:\n                new_state = list(state)\n                pour_amount = min(state[i], capacities[j] - state[j])\n                new_state[i] -= pour_amount\n                new_state[j] += pour_amount\n                moves.append((tuple(new_state), f'pour {chr(65+i)}->{chr(65+j)}'))\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef solve_jug_problem(capacities, target):\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_target_reached(current_state, target):\n            return path\n        \n        for new_state, move in get_possible_moves(current_state, capacities):\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n    \n    return None\n\ncapacities = (11, 13, 13)\ntarget = 12\nsolution = solve_jug_problem(capacities, target)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will find the sequence of moves to achieve exactly 12 liters in one of the jugs. Let's execute it to get the solution.",
