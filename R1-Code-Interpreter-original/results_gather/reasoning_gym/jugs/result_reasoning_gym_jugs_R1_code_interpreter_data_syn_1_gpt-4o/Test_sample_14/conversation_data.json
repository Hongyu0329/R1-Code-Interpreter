    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 3 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 6, 7, and 7 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another until one is full or the other is empty.\n\nLet's explore the possible moves using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest sequence of moves that achieves the target.\n\n1. Start with all jugs empty: (0, 0, 0).\n2. Use BFS to explore all possible states by applying the allowed operations.\n3. Keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.\n4. Stop when one of the jugs contains exactly 3 liters.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_target_reached(state, target):\n    return target in state\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state, capacities):\n    moves = []\n    a, b, c = state\n    cap_a, cap_b, cap_c = capacities\n    \n    # Fill operations\n    if a < cap_a:\n        moves.append(('fill A', (cap_a, b, c)))\n    if b < cap_b:\n        moves.append(('fill B', (a, cap_b, c)))\n    if c < cap_c:\n        moves.append(('fill C', (a, b, cap_c)))\n    \n    # Empty operations\n    if a > 0:\n        moves.append(('empty A', (0, b, c)))\n    if b > 0:\n        moves.append(('empty B', (a, 0, c)))\n    if c > 0:\n        moves.append(('empty C', (a, b, 0)))\n    \n    # Pour operations\n    # Pour A -> B\n    if a > 0 and b < cap_b:\n        pour_amount = min(a, cap_b - b)\n        moves.append(('pour A->B', (a - pour_amount, b + pour_amount, c)))\n    # Pour A -> C\n    if a > 0 and c < cap_c:\n        pour_amount = min(a, cap_c - c)\n        moves.append(('pour A->C', (a - pour_amount, b, c + pour_amount)))\n    # Pour B -> A\n    if b > 0 and a < cap_a:\n        pour_amount = min(b, cap_a - a)\n        moves.append(('pour B->A', (a + pour_amount, b - pour_amount, c)))\n    # Pour B -> C\n    if b > 0 and c < cap_c:\n        pour_amount = min(b, cap_c - c)\n        moves.append(('pour B->C', (a, b - pour_amount, c + pour_amount)))\n    # Pour C -> A\n    if c > 0 and a < cap_a:\n        pour_amount = min(c, cap_a - a)\n        moves.append(('pour C->A', (a + pour_amount, b, c - pour_amount)))\n    # Pour C -> B\n    if c > 0 and b < cap_b:\n        pour_amount = min(c, cap_b - b)\n        moves.append(('pour C->B', (a, b + pour_amount, c - pour_amount)))\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef solve_jug_problem(capacities, target):\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_target_reached(current_state, target):\n            return path\n        \n        for move, new_state in get_possible_moves(current_state, capacities):\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n    \n    return None\n\ncapacities = (6, 7, 7)\ntarget = 3\nsolution = solve_jug_problem(capacities, target)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will find the sequence of moves to achieve exactly 3 liters in one of the jugs.
