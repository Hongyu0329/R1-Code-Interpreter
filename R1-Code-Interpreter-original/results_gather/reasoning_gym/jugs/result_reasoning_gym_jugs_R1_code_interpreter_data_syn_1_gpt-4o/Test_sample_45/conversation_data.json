    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 5 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 4 liters, 4 liters, and 11 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another until the first is empty or the second is full.\n\nLet's consider the initial state as (0, 0, 0), representing the amount of water in jugs A, B, and C, respectively. Our goal is to reach a state where one of the jugs contains exactly 5 liters.\n\nWe can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the possible states and find a sequence of moves that leads to the target state. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible states level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest sequence of moves.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_target_state(state, target):\n    return target in state\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state, capacities):\n    a, b, c = state\n    cap_a, cap_b, cap_c = capacities\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Fill operations\n    if a < cap_a:\n        moves.append(('fill A', (cap_a, b, c)))\n    if b < cap_b:\n        moves.append(('fill B', (a, cap_b, c)))\n    if c < cap_c:\n        moves.append(('fill C', (a, b, cap_c)))\n    \n    # Empty operations\n    if a > 0:\n        moves.append(('empty A', (0, b, c)))\n    if b > 0:\n        moves.append(('empty B', (a, 0, c)))\n    if c > 0:\n        moves.append(('empty C', (a, b, 0)))\n    \n    # Pour operations\n    # Pour A -> B\n    if a > 0 and b < cap_b:\n        pour_amount = min(a, cap_b - b)\n        moves.append(('pour A->B', (a - pour_amount, b + pour_amount, c)))\n    # Pour A -> C\n    if a > 0 and c < cap_c:\n        pour_amount = min(a, cap_c - c)\n        moves.append(('pour A->C', (a - pour_amount, b, c + pour_amount)))\n    # Pour B -> A\n    if b > 0 and a < cap_a:\n        pour_amount = min(b, cap_a - a)\n        moves.append(('pour B->A', (a + pour_amount, b - pour_amount, c)))\n    # Pour B -> C\n    if b > 0 and c < cap_c:\n        pour_amount = min(b, cap_c - c)\n        moves.append(('pour B->C', (a, b - pour_amount, c + pour_amount)))\n    # Pour C -> A\n    if c > 0 and a < cap_a:\n        pour_amount = min(c, cap_a - a)\n        moves.append(('pour C->A', (a + pour_amount, b, c - pour_amount)))\n    # Pour C -> B\n    if c > 0 and b < cap_b:\n        pour_amount = min(c, cap_b - b)\n        moves.append(('pour C->B', (a, b + pour_amount, c - pour_amount)))\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef find_solution(capacities, target):\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if is_target_state(current_state, target):\n            return path\n        \n        for move, new_state in get_possible_moves(current_state, capacities):\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n    \n    return None\n\ncapacities = (4, 4, 11)\ntarget = 5\nsolution = find_solution(capacities, target)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 5 liters of water.
