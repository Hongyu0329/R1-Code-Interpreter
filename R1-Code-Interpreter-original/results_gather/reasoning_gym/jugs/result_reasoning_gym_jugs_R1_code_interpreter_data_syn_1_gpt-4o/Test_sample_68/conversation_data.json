    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 2 litres of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 4 litres, 11 litres, and 4 litres, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State**: All jugs are empty: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0.\n2. **Goal State**: Any jug contains exactly 2 litres of water.\n\nWe can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible states and transitions between them until we reach the goal state. Each state can be represented as a tuple (A, B, C), and we will keep track of the sequence of moves that lead to each state.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python to find the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve_jug_problem():\n    # Initial state\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    # Target amount\n    target = 2\n    # Jug capacities\n    capacities = (4, 11, 4)\n    \n    # Queue for BFS\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    # Set to keep track of visited states\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (a, b, c), moves = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the target\n        if a == target or b == target or c == target:\n            return moves\n        \n        # Generate all possible next states\n        next_states = []\n        \n        # Fill operations\n        if a < capacities[0]:\n            next_states.append(((capacities[0], b, c), moves + ['fill A']))\n        if b < capacities[1]:\n            next_states.append(((a, capacities[1], c), moves + ['fill B']))\n        if c < capacities[2]:\n            next_states.append(((a, b, capacities[2]), moves + ['fill C']))\n        \n        # Empty operations\n        if a > 0:\n            next_states.append(((0, b, c), moves + ['empty A']))\n        if b > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, 0, c), moves + ['empty B']))\n        if c > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, b, 0), moves + ['empty C']))\n        \n        # Pour operations\n        # Pour A -> B\n        pour_amount = min(a, capacities[1] - b)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a - pour_amount, b + pour_amount, c), moves + ['pour A->B']))\n        \n        # Pour A -> C\n        pour_amount = min(a, capacities[2] - c)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a - pour_amount, b, c + pour_amount), moves + ['pour A->C']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> A\n        pour_amount = min(b, capacities[0] - a)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a + pour_amount, b - pour_amount, c), moves + ['pour B->A']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> C\n        pour_amount = min(b, capacities[2] - c)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, b - pour_amount, c + pour_amount), moves + ['pour B->C']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> A\n        pour_amount = min(c, capacities[0] - a)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a + pour_amount, b, c - pour_amount), moves + ['pour C->A']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> B\n        pour_amount = min(c, capacities[1] - b)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, b + pour_amount, c - pour_amount), moves + ['pour C->B']))\n        \n        # Add new states to the queue\n        for state, new_moves in next_states:\n            if state not in visited:\n                visited.add(state)\n                queue.append((state, new_moves))\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nprint(solve_jug_problem())\n```\n\nThis code will find the sequence of moves to achieve the target amount of 2 litres in one of the jugs.
