  "question": "You are a police officer. A maniac has planted a bomb next to a public fountain.\n\nTo defuse the bomb, you must solve a puzzle. The puzzle is solved when you fill any of the available jugs with the target amount of water.\n\nYou have three move types: 'fill', 'empty' and 'pour'.\n\nTo fill Jug A, you 'fill A'.\nTo empty Jug B, you 'empty B'.\nTo pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B, you 'pour A->B'.\nAll jugs are empty to begin with.\n\nThe empty jugs hold this many litres of water: A:3, B:13, C:10\nAnd your target is: 5 litres.\n\nHow do you defuse the bomb?\n\nReply as a JSON-parsable list of moves which result in any of the jugs being filled with the target amount, and enclose the JSON-parsable list in triple angle brackets, like <<<JSON-parsable list>>>.\n",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 5 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 3 liters, 13 liters, and 10 liters, respectively. We can perform the operations 'fill', 'empty', and 'pour' to manipulate the water levels in the jugs.\n\nThe goal is to reach a state where one of the jugs contains exactly 5 liters. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the possible states of the jugs and find a sequence of moves that achieves the target.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve_jug_problem():\n    # Initial state: all jugs are empty\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    target = 5\n    capacities = (3, 13, 10)\n    \n    # Queue for BFS\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (a, b, c), path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the target\n        if a == target or b == target or c == target:\n            return path\n        \n        # Generate all possible next states\n        next_states = []\n        \n        # Fill operations\n        next_states.append(((capacities[0], b, c), path + ['fill A']))\n        next_states.append(((a, capacities[1], c), path + ['fill B']))\n        next_states.append(((a, b, capacities[2]), path + ['fill C']))\n        \n        # Empty operations\n        next_states.append(((0, b, c), path + ['empty A']))\n        next_states.append(((a, 0, c), path + ['empty B']))\n        next_states.append(((a, b, 0), path + ['empty C']))\n        \n        # Pour operations\n        # Pour A -> B\n        pour_amount = min(a, capacities[1] - b)\n        next_states.append(((a - pour_amount, b + pour_amount, c), path + ['pour A->B']))\n        \n        # Pour A -> C\n        pour_amount = min(a, capacities[2] - c)\n        next_states.append(((a - pour_amount, b, c + pour_amount), path + ['pour A->C']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> A\n        pour_amount = min(b, capacities[0] - a)\n        next_states.append(((a + pour_amount, b - pour_amount, c), path + ['pour B->A']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> C\n        pour_amount = min(b, capacities[2] - c)\n        next_states.append(((a, b - pour_amount, c + pour_amount), path + ['pour B->C']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> A\n        pour_amount = min(c, capacities[0] - a)\n        next_states.append(((a + pour_amount, b, c - pour_amount), path + ['pour C->A']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> B\n        pour_amount = min(c, capacities[1] - b)\n        next_states.append(((a, b + pour_amount, c - pour_amount), path + ['pour C->B']))\n        \n        # Add valid next states to the queue\n        for state, new_path in next_states:\n            if state not in visited:\n                visited.add(state)\n                queue.append((state, new_path))\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = solve_jug_problem()\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 5 liters of water.
