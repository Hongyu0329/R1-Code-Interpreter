    "To solve this problem, we need to find a sequence of moves that results in one of the jugs containing exactly 9 liters of water. We have three jugs with capacities of 7 liters, 13 liters, and 13 liters, respectively. The operations allowed are filling a jug, emptying a jug, and pouring water from one jug to another.\n\nLet's consider the initial state as (0, 0, 0), representing the amount of water in jugs A, B, and C, respectively. Our goal is to reach a state where one of the jugs contains exactly 9 liters.\n\nWe can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the possible states and find a sequence of moves that achieves the target. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible states level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest sequence of moves.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Start with the initial state (0, 0, 0).\n2. Use a queue to explore each state and the sequence of moves that led to it.\n3. For each state, generate all possible next states by applying the allowed operations.\n4. If a state with 9 liters in any jug is reached, return the sequence of moves.\n5. Use a set to keep track of visited states to avoid redundant work.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve_jug_problem():\n    # Initial state: (A, B, C)\n    initial_state = (0, 0, 0)\n    target = 9\n    capacities = (7, 13, 13)\n    \n    # Queue for BFS: (state, moves)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (a, b, c), moves = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the target\n        if a == target or b == target or c == target:\n            return moves\n        \n        # Generate all possible next states\n        next_states = []\n        \n        # Fill operations\n        if a < capacities[0]:\n            next_states.append(((capacities[0], b, c), moves + ['fill A']))\n        if b < capacities[1]:\n            next_states.append(((a, capacities[1], c), moves + ['fill B']))\n        if c < capacities[2]:\n            next_states.append(((a, b, capacities[2]), moves + ['fill C']))\n        \n        # Empty operations\n        if a > 0:\n            next_states.append(((0, b, c), moves + ['empty A']))\n        if b > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, 0, c), moves + ['empty B']))\n        if c > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, b, 0), moves + ['empty C']))\n        \n        # Pour operations\n        # Pour A -> B\n        pour_amount = min(a, capacities[1] - b)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a - pour_amount, b + pour_amount, c), moves + ['pour A->B']))\n        \n        # Pour A -> C\n        pour_amount = min(a, capacities[2] - c)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a - pour_amount, b, c + pour_amount), moves + ['pour A->C']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> A\n        pour_amount = min(b, capacities[0] - a)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a + pour_amount, b - pour_amount, c), moves + ['pour B->A']))\n        \n        # Pour B -> C\n        pour_amount = min(b, capacities[2] - c)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, b - pour_amount, c + pour_amount), moves + ['pour B->C']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> A\n        pour_amount = min(c, capacities[0] - a)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a + pour_amount, b, c - pour_amount), moves + ['pour C->A']))\n        \n        # Pour C -> B\n        pour_amount = min(c, capacities[1] - b)\n        if pour_amount > 0:\n            next_states.append(((a, b + pour_amount, c - pour_amount), moves + ['pour C->B']))\n        \n        # Add next states to the queue\n        for state, new_moves in next_states:\n            if state not in visited:\n                visited.add(state)\n                queue.append((state, new_moves))\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nresult = solve_jug_problem()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the sequence of moves to achieve exactly 9 liters in one of the jugs.
