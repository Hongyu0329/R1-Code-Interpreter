    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The idea is to start from all the cells containing 0 and perform a multi-source BFS to calculate the minimum distance to a 0 for each cell in the matrix. This approach ensures that we explore the nearest cells first, which is optimal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nLet's implement this approach and calculate the distance matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the matrix\nn = len(matrix)\nm = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the distance matrix with a large number\ndistance = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Queue for BFS\nqueue = deque()\n\n# Directions for moving up, down, left, right\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Initialize the queue with all 0s in the matrix\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if matrix[i][j] == 0:\n            queue.append((i, j))\n            distance[i][j] = 0\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    x, y = queue.popleft()\n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m:\n            if distance[nx][ny] > distance[x][y] + 1:\n                distance[nx][ny] = distance[x][y] + 1\n                queue.append((nx, ny))\n\n# Convert the distance matrix to a numpy array for better formatting\ndistance_matrix = np.array(distance)\ndistance_matrix\nassistant > The matrix representing the taxicab (Manhattan) distance of the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n\n\\[\n<<<\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n>>>\n\\]"
