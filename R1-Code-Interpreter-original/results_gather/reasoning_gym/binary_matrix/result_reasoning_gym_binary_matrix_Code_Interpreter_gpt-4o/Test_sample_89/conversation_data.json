    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The idea is to start from all the cells containing 0 and then propagate the distance to the neighboring cells. This way, we can efficiently calculate the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in the matrix.\n\nLet's implement this approach and find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in the given matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    # Initialize the distance matrix with a large number\n    distance = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Start from all the cells containing 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                distance[r][c] = 0\n                queue.append((r, c))\n\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if distance[nr][nc] > distance[r][c] + 1:\n                    distance[nr][nc] = distance[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return distance\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell\noutput_matrix = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\noutput_matrix\nassistant > The matrix showing the taxicab (Manhattan) distance of the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n\n\\[\n<<<[[1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 1, 0, 0]]>>>\n\\]"
