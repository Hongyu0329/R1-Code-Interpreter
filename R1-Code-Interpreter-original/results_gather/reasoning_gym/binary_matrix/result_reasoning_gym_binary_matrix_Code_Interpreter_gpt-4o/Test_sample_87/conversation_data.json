    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The idea is to start from all the cells containing 0 and perform a multi-source BFS to calculate the minimum distance to a 0 for each cell in the matrix. This approach ensures that we explore the nearest cells first, updating the distance as we go.\n\nLet's implement this approach and calculate the distance matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the matrix\nrows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n\n# Initialize the distance matrix with a large number\ndistance = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n\n# Queue for BFS\nqueue = deque()\n\n# Initialize the queue with all 0 cells and set their distance to 0\nfor r in range(rows):\n    for c in range(cols):\n        if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n            queue.append((r, c))\n            distance[r][c] = 0\n\n# Directions for moving up, down, left, right\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    r, c = queue.popleft()\n    for dr, dc in directions:\n        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n            if distance[nr][nc] > distance[r][c] + 1:\n                distance[nr][nc] = distance[r][c] + 1\n                queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n# Convert the distance matrix to a numpy array for better formatting\ndistance_matrix = np.array(distance)\ndistance_matrix\nassistant > The distance matrix, which represents the taxicab (Manhattan) distance of the nearest 0 for each cell, is as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n\n\\[\n<<<\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n>>>\n\\]"
