    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The idea is to start from all the cells containing 0 and perform a multi-source BFS to calculate the minimum distance to a 0 for each cell in the matrix. This approach ensures that we explore the nearest cells first, updating the distance as we go.\n\nLet's implement this approach and calculate the distance matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, "
