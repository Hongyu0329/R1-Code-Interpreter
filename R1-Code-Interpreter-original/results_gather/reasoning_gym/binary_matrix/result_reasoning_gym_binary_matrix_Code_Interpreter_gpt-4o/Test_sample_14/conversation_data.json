    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The idea is to start from all the cells containing 0 and perform a multi-source BFS to calculate the minimum distance to a 0 for each cell in the matrix. This approach ensures that we explore the nearest cells first, updating the distance as we go.\n\nLet's implement this approach and calculate the distance matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the matrix\nn = len(matrix)\n\n# Initialize the distance matrix with a large number\ndistance = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Queue for BFS\nqueue = deque()\n\n# Initialize the queue with all the positions of 0s and set their distance to 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if matrix[i][j] == 0:\n            queue.append((i, j))\n            distance[i][j] = 0\n\n# Directions for moving up, down, left, right\ndirections = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n# Perform BFS\nwhile queue:\n    x, y = queue.popleft()\n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n:\n            if distance[nx][ny] > distance[x][y] + 1:\n                distance[nx][ny] = distance[x][y] + 1\n                queue.append((nx, ny))\n\n# Convert the distance matrix to a numpy array for better formatting\ndistance_matrix = np.array(distance)\ndistance_matrix\nassistant > The matrix representing the taxicab (Manhattan) distance of the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n\n\\[\n<<<\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n>>>\n\\]"
