    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. We will start by identifying all the cells containing 0s and add them to a queue. Then, we will perform a BFS to calculate the Manhattan distance for each cell to the nearest 0.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n1. Initialize a matrix to store the distances, with the same dimensions as the input matrix.\n2. Set the distance for each cell containing a 0 to 0, and mark other cells with a placeholder value (e.g., infinity).\n3. Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all the 0s simultaneously.\n4. For each cell, update the distance of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n5. Continue until all cells have been processed.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    distances = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all 0s and set their distance to 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                distances[r][c] = 0\n                queue.append((r, c))\n\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if distances[nr][nc] > distances[r][c] + 1:\n                    distances[nr][nc] = distances[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return distances\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\ndistance_matrix = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\ndistance_matrix\nassistant > The matrix representing the taxicab (Manhattan) distance of the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n\\[\n<<<\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n>>>\n\\]"
