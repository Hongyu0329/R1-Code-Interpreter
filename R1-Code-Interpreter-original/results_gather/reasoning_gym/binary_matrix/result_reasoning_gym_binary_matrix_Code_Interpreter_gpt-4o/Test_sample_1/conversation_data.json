    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The idea is to start from all the cells containing 0 and perform a multi-source BFS to calculate the minimum distance to a 0 for each cell in the matrix. Here's how we can implement this:\n\n1. Initialize a matrix of the same size as the input matrix to store the distances, with all values set to infinity (or a large number) initially.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue all the positions of 0s in the matrix, setting their corresponding distances to 0.\n3. Perform BFS from these positions, updating the distance for each cell as the minimum distance found so far.\n4. Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    distances = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Enqueue all positions of 0s and set their distances to 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                distances[r][c] = 0\n\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if distances[nr][nc] > distances[r][c] + 1:\n                    distances[nr][nc] = distances[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return distances\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\ndistance_matrix = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\ndistance_matrix_np = np.array(distance_matrix)\ndistance_matrix_np\nassistant > The matrix representing the taxicab (Manhattan) distance of the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n\n\\[\n<<<\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n>>>\n\\]"
