    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The idea is to start from all the cells containing 0 and perform a multi-source BFS to calculate the minimum distance to a 0 for each cell in the matrix. Here's how we can implement this:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add all the cells containing 0 to it.\n2. Initialize a distance matrix with infinity for all cells except those containing 0, which should be initialized to 0.\n3. Perform BFS from all the 0 cells simultaneously, updating the distance for each cell as we explore its neighbors.\n4. Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    m = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Initialize the distance matrix with infinity\n    distance = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Initialize the queue and add all 0 cells to it\n    queue = deque()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if matrix[i][j] == 0:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n                distance[i][j] = 0\n    \n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        \n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            \n            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m:\n                if distance[nx][ny] > distance[x][y] + 1:\n                    distance[nx][ny] = distance[x][y] + 1\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n    \n    return distance\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\noutput_matrix = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\noutput_matrix\nassistant > The matrix representing the taxicab (Manhattan) distance of the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n\n\\[\n<<<[[0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 2, 1, 1], [0, 1, 2, 2], [0, 1, 2, 3]]>>>\n\\]"
