    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n1. **Identify the positions of all 0s in the matrix:**\n   - (0, 0)\n   - (1, 0)\n   - (1, 3)\n   - (2, 3)\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix with a large number (infinity) for all cells except those containing 0s, which should be initialized to 0:**\n\n   ```\n   0 ∞ ∞ ∞\n   0 ∞ ∞ 0\n   ∞ ∞ ∞ 0\n   ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n   ```\n\n3. **First pass (top-left to bottom-right):**\n   - For each cell, update its value to the minimum of its current value and the value of its top or left neighbor plus 1.\n\n   After processing each row from top to bottom and each column from left to right:\n\n   ```\n   0 1 2 3\n   0 1 2 0\n   1 2 3 0\n   2 3 4 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Second pass (bottom-right to top-left):**\n   - For each cell, update its value to the minimum of its current value and the value of its bottom or right neighbor plus 1.\n\n   After processing each row from bottom to top and each column from right to left:\n\n   ```\n   0 1 2 1\n   0 1 1 0\n   1 2 1 0\n   2 3 2 1\n   ```\n\n5. **Final output matrix:**\n\n   The final matrix, which contains the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell, is:\n\n   ```\n   0 1 2 1\n   0 1 1 0\n   1 2 1 0\n   2 3 2 1\n   ```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 1 2 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 2 1 0\n2 3 2 1>>>"
