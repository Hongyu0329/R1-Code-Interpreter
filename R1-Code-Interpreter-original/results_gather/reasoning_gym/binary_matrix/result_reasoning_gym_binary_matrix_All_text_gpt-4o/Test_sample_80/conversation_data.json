    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given matrix. The matrix is square, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns.\n\n2. **Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1\n   0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n   1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n   0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n   0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1\n   0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n   1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1\n   1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n   1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n   1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Output Matrix**: The output matrix should have the same dimensions as the input matrix, with each cell containing the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach starting from all the 0s in the matrix. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - Initialize a queue with all positions of 0s in the matrix and set their distances to 0.\n   - For each cell, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) and update their distances if a shorter path to a 0 is found.\n   - Continue this process until all cells have been processed.\n\n5. **Implementation Details**:\n   - Create a distance matrix initialized with a large number (infinity) for all cells except those containing 0, which are initialized to 0.\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS, starting with all 0s.\n   - For each cell, check its neighbors and update their distances if a shorter path is found.\n\n6. **Final Output**: After processing all cells, the distance matrix will contain the required distances.\n\nNow, let's compute the output matrix:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n<<<0 1 2 1 0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 2\n1 1 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 3\n0 0 0 1 2 3 3 3 3 4\n0 1 1 2 2 2 0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 1 2 1 1 0 1 2\n1 1 0 1 2 0 1 0 1 2\n1 1 0 1 2 1 1 0 1 2\n1 1 0 1 2 2 0 1 2 3\n1 1 1 0 1 2 0 1 2 3>>>"
