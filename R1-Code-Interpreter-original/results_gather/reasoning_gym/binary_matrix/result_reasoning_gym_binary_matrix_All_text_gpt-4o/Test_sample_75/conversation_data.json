    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, we assume the distance to the nearest 0 is very large.\n\n2. **Identify Zero Cells**: Traverse the input matrix and identify all cells that contain a 0. These cells will have a distance of 0 to themselves.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all zero cells simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n4. **Update Distances**: For each zero cell, update the distance of its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) if the new calculated distance is smaller than the current value in the output matrix. Continue this process iteratively, expanding outwards from each zero cell.\n\n5. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that while updating neighbors, you do not go out of the matrix bounds.\n\n6. **Final Output**: Once all cells have been processed, the output matrix will contain the minimum distance to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n- Start by identifying all zero cells: (0,5), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,3), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,5), (4,0), (4,3), (5,0).\n\n- Initialize the output matrix with infinity, except for the positions of zeros which are initialized to 0.\n\n- Perform BFS from all zero cells, updating the distances for their neighbors.\n\nAfter processing, the output matrix will be:\n\n```\n5 4 3 2 1 0\n4 3 2 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0 1 1\n0 1 2 1 2 3\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n5 4 3 2 1 0\n4 3 2 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0 1 1\n0 1 2 1 2 3\n>>>"
