    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given matrix.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 10x10, as there are 10 rows and 10 columns.\n\n3. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent initially unknown distances.\n   - Identify all positions of 0s in the matrix, as these will be our starting points for calculating distances.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**:\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - Enqueue all positions of 0s with a distance of 0.\n   - For each position dequeued, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor has not been visited (i.e., its current distance is still infinity), update its distance to the current distance + 1 and enqueue it.\n\n5. **Iterate Until Completion**:\n   - Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed and their minimum distances to a 0 have been determined.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - The output matrix will contain the minimum distances from each cell to the nearest 0.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the output matrix with the distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n2 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n2 1 2 0 1 1 0 0 1 1\n2 1 2 0 0 1 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n2 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n2 1 2 0 1 1 0 0 1 1\n2 1 2 0 0 1 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n>>>"
