    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the nearest 0 for each cell in the matrix and calculate the Manhattan distance to that 0.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 7x7 square matrix.\n\n3. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Create a result matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances.\n   - Use a queue to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from all the cells containing 0s.\n\n4. **BFS Initialization**:\n   - Enqueue all positions of 0s in the matrix into the queue and set their corresponding positions in the result matrix to 0, as the distance from a 0 to itself is 0.\n\n5. **BFS Execution**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a cell and check its neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - For each neighbor, if the calculated distance from the current cell is less than the current value in the result matrix, update the result matrix and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n6. **Direction Vectors**: Use direction vectors to simplify checking the four possible neighbors of a cell.\n\n7. **Iterate Until Completion**: Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed and the queue is empty.\n\n8. **Output the Result**: The result matrix will contain the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1\n```\n\nAfter performing the BFS as described, the resulting matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n3 2 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 1 2\n2 1 1 0 0 1 2\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n3 2 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 1 2\n2 1 1 0 0 1 2\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1\n>>>"
