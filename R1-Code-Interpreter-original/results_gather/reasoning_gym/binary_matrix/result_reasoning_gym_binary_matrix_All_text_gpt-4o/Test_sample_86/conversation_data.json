    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of all zeros in the matrix.**  \n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   1 1 1 0 1\n   1 1 1 1 1\n   0 1 1 1 1\n   1 0 1 1 1\n   1 1 1 0 1\n   ```\n   The positions of zeros are:  \n   - (0, 3)\n   - (2, 0)\n   - (3, 1)\n   - (4, 3)\n\n2. **Initialize a result matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix, filled with a large number (infinity) to represent initially unknown distances.**  \n   This will help in updating the minimum distance as we find closer zeros.\n\n3. **Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach starting from all zero positions simultaneously.**  \n   - Initialize a queue with all zero positions and set their corresponding positions in the result matrix to 0 (since the distance from a zero to itself is 0).\n   - For each position in the queue, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor has not been visited (i.e., its distance is still infinity), update its distance to be the current cell's distance plus 1, and add it to the queue.\n\n4. **Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed.**  \n   This ensures that each cell's distance is updated to the minimum possible distance to a zero.\n\n5. **Output the result matrix.**\n\nLet's apply this process to the given matrix:\n\n- Start with the initial matrix:\n  ```\n  1 1 1 0 1\n  1 1 1 1 1\n  0 1 1 1 1\n  1 0 1 1 1\n  1 1 1 0 1\n  ```\n\n- Initialize the result matrix with infinity, except for the positions of zeros:\n  ```\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ 0 ∞\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n  0 ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n  ∞ 0 ∞ ∞ ∞\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ 0 ∞\n  ```\n\n- Perform BFS:\n  - Start from all zero positions: (0, 3), (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 3).\n  - Update distances for their neighbors and continue until all cells are processed.\n\nAfter processing, the final result matrix is:\n```\n3 2 1 0 1\n2 1 2 1 2\n0 1 2 2 3\n1 0 1 2 3\n2 1 2 0 1\n```\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n<<<3 2 1 0 1\n2 1 2 1 2\n0 1 2 2 3\n1 0 1 2 3\n2 1 2 0 1>>>"
