    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n1 1 1\n0 1 0\n0 1 1\n```\n\n1. **Identify the positions of 0s:**\n   - The 0s are located at positions (1, 0), (1, 2), and (2, 0).\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix:**\n   - Start with an output matrix of the same size, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances.\n\n3. **Calculate distances:**\n   - For each cell in the matrix, calculate the Manhattan distance to each 0 and take the minimum distance.\n\n4. **Step-by-step calculation:**\n\n   - **Cell (0, 0):**\n     - Distance to (1, 0): \\(|0 - 1| + |0 - 0| = 1\\)\n     - Distance to (1, 2): \\(|0 - 1| + |0 - 2| = 3\\)\n     - Distance to (2, 0): \\(|0 - 2| + |0 - 0| = 2\\)\n     - Minimum distance: 1\n\n   - **Cell (0, 1):**\n     - Distance to (1, 0): \\(|0 - 1| + |1 - 0| = 2\\)\n     - Distance to (1, 2): \\(|0 - 1| + |1 - 2| = 2\\)\n     - Distance to (2, 0): \\(|0 - 2| + |1 - 0| = 3\\)\n     - Minimum distance: 2\n\n   - **Cell (0, 2):**\n     - Distance to (1, 0): \\(|0 - 1| + |2 - 0| = 3\\)\n     - Distance to (1, 2): \\(|0 - 1| + |2 - 2| = 1\\)\n     - Distance to (2, 0): \\(|0 - 2| + |2 - 0| = 4\\)\n     - Minimum distance: 1\n\n   - **Cell (1, 0):**\n     - This cell is already 0, so the distance is 0.\n\n   - **Cell (1, 1):**\n     - Distance to (1, 0): \\(|1 - 1| + |1 - 0| = 1\\)\n     - Distance to (1, 2): \\(|1 - 1| + |1 - 2| = 1\\)\n     - Distance to (2, 0): \\(|1 - 2| + |1 - 0| = 2\\)\n     - Minimum distance: 1\n\n   - **Cell (1, 2):**\n     - This cell is already 0, so the distance is 0.\n\n   - **Cell (2, 0):**\n     - This cell is already 0, so the distance is 0.\n\n   - **Cell (2, 1):**\n     - Distance to (1, 0): \\(|2 - 1| + |1 - 0| = 2\\)\n     - Distance to (1, 2): \\(|2 - 1| + |1 - 2| = 2\\)\n     - Distance to (2, 0): \\(|2 - 2| + |1 - 0| = 1\\)\n     - Minimum distance: 1\n\n   - **Cell (2, 2):**\n     - Distance to (1, 0): \\(|2 - 1| + |2 - 0| = 3\\)\n     - Distance to (1, 2): \\(|2 - 1| + |2 - 2| = 1\\)\n     - Distance to (2, 0): \\(|2 - 2| + |2 - 0| = 2\\)\n     - Minimum distance: 1\n\n5. **Construct the output matrix:**\n\n```\n1 2 1\n0 1 0\n0 1 1\n```\n\nThe final output matrix, representing the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell, is:\n\n<<<1 2 1\n0 1 0\n0 1 1>>>"
