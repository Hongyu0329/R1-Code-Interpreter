    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given matrix.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is a square matrix, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns. In this case, the matrix is 9x9.\n\n3. **Initial Setup**: Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, the distance to the nearest 0 is unknown.\n\n4. **Locate Zeros**: Identify all the positions in the matrix that contain a 0. These positions will be the starting points for calculating distances.\n\n5. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n6. **Queue Initialization**: Initialize a queue with all the positions of 0s. Set their corresponding positions in the output matrix to 0, as the distance from a 0 to itself is 0.\n\n7. **BFS Execution**:\n   - Dequeue a position from the queue.\n   - For each of its four possible neighbors (up, down, left, right), calculate the potential new distance.\n   - If the new distance is less than the current distance recorded in the output matrix for that neighbor, update the distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n8. **Continue Until Queue is Empty**: Repeat the BFS process until the queue is empty, meaning all cells have been processed.\n\n9. **Output the Result**: The output matrix will now contain the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nApplying this process to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1\n```\n\nThe resulting matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 is:\n\n```\n5 4 3 2 1 0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 0 1 2 2 2 1 1\n2 2 1 2 3 3 2 0 1\n3 3 2 3 4 3 1 1 0\n0 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 2\n1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n5 4 3 2 1 0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 0 1 2 2 2 1 1\n2 2 1 2 3 3 2 0 1\n3 3 2 3 4 3 1 1 0\n0 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 2\n1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1\n>>>"
