    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 6x6 square matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size (6x6) initialized with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent the initial distances.\n\n3. **Locate All Zeros**: Identify the positions of all the zeros in the matrix. These positions will be the starting points for calculating distances.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all zero positions simultaneously. This is efficient for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n5. **Update Distances**: For each zero, initialize its distance to zero in the output matrix. Then, for each cell, update its distance by checking its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor's current distance is greater than the current cell's distance plus one, update the neighbor's distance.\n\n6. **Iterate Until Completion**: Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed and no further updates are possible.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once all distances are calculated, the output matrix will contain the Manhattan distances to the nearest zero for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nInitial matrix:\n```\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n1. **Identify Zeros**: The zeros are located at positions: (1,1), (1,3), (1,5), (2,2), (2,5), (3,3), (4,4), (5,0).\n\n2. **Initialize BFS Queue**: Start BFS from all zero positions.\n\n3. **Calculate Distances**: Update the distances using BFS.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the output matrix with the distances to the nearest zero for each cell is:\n\n```\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n2 1 1 0 1 1\n1 2 2 1 0 1\n0 1 2 2 1 2\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<1 0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n2 1 1 0 1 1\n1 2 2 1 0 1\n0 1 2 2 1 2>>>"
