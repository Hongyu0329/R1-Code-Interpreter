    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Positions of Zeros:**\n   - First, we need to identify the positions of all the zeros in the matrix. In the given matrix, the zeros are located at positions (1, 2), (2, 3), and (4, 2).\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix:**\n   - Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, the distance to a zero is unknown.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Use a BFS approach starting from all zero positions simultaneously. This is efficient because it explores all possible paths in increasing order of distance.\n   - Initialize a queue with all zero positions and set their corresponding positions in the output matrix to 0, as the distance from a zero to itself is zero.\n\n4. **Process the Queue:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element (current position) and explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - For each neighbor, calculate the potential new distance as the current distance + 1.\n   - If this new distance is less than the current recorded distance in the output matrix for that neighbor, update the distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n5. **Continue Until All Cells are Processed:**\n   - Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed and the shortest distance to a zero has been found for each cell.\n\n6. **Construct the Output Matrix:**\n   - After processing all cells, the output matrix will contain the shortest Manhattan distance to a zero for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\nInput Matrix:\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1\n```\n\n- Initialize the output matrix with infinity and set the positions of zeros to 0:\n\n```\nOutput Matrix (initial):\n∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n∞ ∞ 0 ∞ ∞\n∞ ∞ ∞ 0 ∞\n∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n∞ ∞ 0 ∞ ∞\n```\n\n- Perform BFS starting from all zero positions:\n\n```\nOutput Matrix (after BFS):\n2 2 1 1 2\n1 1 0 1 2\n2 1 1 0 1\n2 2 1 1 2\n1 1 0 1 2\n```\n\nThe final output matrix, representing the Manhattan distance to the nearest zero for each cell, is:\n\n<<<\n2 2 1 1 2\n1 1 0 1 2\n2 1 1 0 1\n2 2 1 1 2\n1 1 0 1 2\n>>>"
