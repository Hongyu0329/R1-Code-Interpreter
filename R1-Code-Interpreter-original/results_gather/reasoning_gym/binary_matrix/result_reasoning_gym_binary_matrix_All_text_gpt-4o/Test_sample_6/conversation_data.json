    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given matrix. The matrix is square, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns.\n\n2. **Input Matrix**: The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1\n   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n   0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n   1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1\n   1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1\n   1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1\n   0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1\n   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n   1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Output Matrix**: We need to create an output matrix of the same size where each cell contains the distance to the nearest 0.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach starting from all the 0s in the matrix. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - Initialize a queue with all positions of 0s in the matrix and set their distances to 0 in the output matrix.\n   - For each cell in the queue, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor has not been visited (i.e., its distance is not set), update its distance to the current cell's distance plus one and add it to the queue.\n   - Continue this process until all cells have been processed.\n\n5. **Implementation**:\n   - Initialize the output matrix with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent unvisited cells.\n   - Populate the queue with all positions of 0s and set their distances to 0 in the output matrix.\n   - Perform BFS to update distances for all cells.\n\n6. **Final Output**: After processing all cells, the output matrix will contain the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nLet's apply this approach to the given matrix:\n\n```\nInitial matrix:\n1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0\n\nOutput matrix:\n2 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 2\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 2\n1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 2\n1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 2\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1\n1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 2\n2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0\n```\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n2 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 2\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 2\n1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 2\n1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 2\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1\n1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 2\n2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0\n>>>"
