    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0\n```\n\n1. **Identify the positions of 0s:**\n   - (1, 2)\n   - (2, 1)\n   - (3, 3)\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances:**\n\n```\n∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n∞ ∞ 0 ∞\n∞ 0 ∞ ∞\n∞ ∞ ∞ 0\n```\n\n3. **First pass (top-left to bottom-right):**\n   - For each cell, calculate the distance to the nearest 0 found so far.\n   - Update the distance using the minimum of the current value and the value from the top or left cell plus one.\n\n   After the first pass, the matrix looks like this:\n\n```\n3 2 1 2\n2 1 0 1\n1 0 1 2\n2 1 1 0\n```\n\n4. **Second pass (bottom-right to top-left):**\n   - For each cell, calculate the distance to the nearest 0 found so far.\n   - Update the distance using the minimum of the current value and the value from the bottom or right cell plus one.\n\n   After the second pass, the matrix is updated to:\n\n```\n3 2 1 2\n2 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n2 1 1 0\n```\n\n5. **Final output:**\n   - The matrix now contains the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n```\n3 2 1 2\n2 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n2 1 1 0\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<3 2 1 2\n2 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n2 1 1 0>>>"
