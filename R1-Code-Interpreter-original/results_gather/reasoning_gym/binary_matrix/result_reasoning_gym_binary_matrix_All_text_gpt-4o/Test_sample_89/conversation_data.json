    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of all 0s in the matrix:**\n   - (0, 1), (0, 3)\n   - (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)\n   - (3, 2), (3, 3)\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix with a large number (infinity) for each cell, except for cells that already contain 0, which should be initialized to 0.**\n\n3. **Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) from each 0, updating the distance for each cell:**\n   - Start from each 0 and explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor's current distance is greater than the distance from the current 0 plus 1, update the neighbor's distance.\n   - Continue this process until all cells have been processed.\n\n4. **Iterate over the matrix to fill in the distances:**\n\n   - For cell (0, 0): Nearest 0 is at (0, 1), distance = 1\n   - For cell (0, 1): It is 0, distance = 0\n   - For cell (0, 2): Nearest 0 is at (0, 1), distance = 1\n   - For cell (0, 3): It is 0, distance = 0\n\n   - For cell (1, 0): It is 0, distance = 0\n   - For cell (1, 1): It is 0, distance = 0\n   - For cell (1, 2): It is 0, distance = 0\n   - For cell (1, 3): Nearest 0 is at (1, 2), distance = 1\n\n   - For cell (2, 0): Nearest 0 is at (1, 0), distance = 1\n   - For cell (2, 1): Nearest 0 is at (1, 1), distance = 1\n   - For cell (2, 2): Nearest 0 is at (1, 2), distance = 1\n   - For cell (2, 3): Nearest 0 is at (3, 3), distance = 1\n\n   - For cell (3, 0): Nearest 0 is at (3, 2), distance = 2\n   - For cell (3, 1): Nearest 0 is at (3, 2), distance = 1\n   - For cell (3, 2): It is 0, distance = 0\n   - For cell (3, 3): It is 0, distance = 0\n\n5. **Construct the output matrix:**\n\n```\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n2 1 0 0\n```\n\nThe final output matrix, with each cell containing the distance to the nearest 0, is:\n\n<<<1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n2 1 0 0>>>"
