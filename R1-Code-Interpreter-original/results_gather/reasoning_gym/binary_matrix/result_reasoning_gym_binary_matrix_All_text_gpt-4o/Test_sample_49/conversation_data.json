    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given matrix. The matrix is a 10x10 grid of 1s and 0s.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, we assume the distance to the nearest 0 is very large.\n\n3. **Locate All Zeros**: First, identify all the positions in the matrix that contain a 0. These positions will be the starting points for our distance calculations.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n5. **Queue Initialization**: Initialize a queue with all the positions of 0s. Set the distance for these positions to 0 in the output matrix since they are already 0.\n\n6. **BFS Execution**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element (current position).\n   - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), calculate the new position.\n   - If the new position is within bounds and the current calculated distance is less than the previously recorded distance in the output matrix, update the distance and enqueue the new position.\n\n7. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that the BFS does not go out of the matrix bounds.\n\n8. **Final Output**: Once the BFS completes, the output matrix will contain the minimum distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\nAfter applying the BFS approach, the output matrix with the distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n4 3 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 2 2 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1\n2 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 2\n2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n2 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 2\n1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0\n2 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 2 3\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n4 3 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 2 2 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1\n2 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 2\n2 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n2 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 2\n1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0\n2 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 2 3\n>>>"
