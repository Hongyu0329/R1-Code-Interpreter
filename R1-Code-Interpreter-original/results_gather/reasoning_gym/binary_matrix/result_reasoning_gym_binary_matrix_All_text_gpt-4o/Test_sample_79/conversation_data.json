    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Positions of Zeros:**\n   - First, we need to identify all the positions in the matrix that contain a 0. These positions will serve as the starting points for calculating distances.\n\n2. **Initialize the Distance Matrix:**\n   - Create a matrix of the same size as the input matrix to store the distances. Initialize all cells with a large number (infinity) except for the cells that contain a 0, which should be initialized to 0.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Use a BFS approach starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the cells to be processed. Initially, enqueue all the positions of the 0s.\n   - For each cell processed, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If moving to a neighbor results in a shorter distance than previously recorded, update the distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n4. **Process the Matrix:**\n   - Continue processing until the queue is empty, ensuring that each cell's distance is updated to reflect the shortest path to a 0.\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - Once all cells have been processed, the distance matrix will contain the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify positions of 0s: (0,0), (1,0), (1,4), (3,5), (4,3).\n- **Step 2:** Initialize the distance matrix with 0s at these positions and infinity elsewhere.\n- **Step 3 & 4:** Use BFS to update distances.\n\nAfter processing, the distance matrix will be:\n\n```\n0 1 2 3 0 1\n0 1 2 2 0 1\n1 2 3 2 1 2\n2 3 2 1 1 0\n3 2 1 0 1 1\n4 3 2 1 2 2\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n0 1 2 3 0 1\n0 1 2 2 0 1\n1 2 3 2 1 2\n2 3 2 1 1 0\n3 2 1 0 1 1\n4 3 2 1 2 2\n>>>"
