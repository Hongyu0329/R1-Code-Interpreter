    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 5x5 square matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size (5x5) initialized with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent the initial distances.\n\n3. **Locate All Zeros**: Identify the positions of all the zeros in the matrix. These will be our starting points for calculating distances.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all zero positions simultaneously. This is efficient for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n5. **Queue Initialization**: Initialize a queue with all the positions of zeros. Set the distance for these positions to 0 in the output matrix.\n\n6. **BFS Execution**:\n   - Dequeue a position from the queue.\n   - For each of its four possible neighbors (up, down, left, right), calculate the potential new distance.\n   - If the new distance is less than the current distance recorded in the output matrix for that neighbor, update the distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n7. **Repeat Until Queue is Empty**: Continue the BFS process until all positions have been processed and the queue is empty.\n\n8. **Output the Result**: The output matrix will now contain the Manhattan distances to the nearest zero for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0 1\n```\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify zeros and initialize the queue with their positions: \\((0,0), (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,3)\\).\n\n- **Step 2**: Initialize the output matrix with infinity, except for the positions of zeros which are set to 0.\n\n- **Step 3**: Perform BFS from all zero positions, updating distances in the output matrix.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the output matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest zero for each cell is:\n\n```\n0 1 2 1 2\n1 2 1 0 1\n2 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0 1\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n0 1 2 1 2\n1 2 1 0 1\n2 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0 1\n>>>"
