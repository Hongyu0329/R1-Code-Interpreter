    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Positions of Zeros:**\n   - First, identify all the positions in the matrix that contain a 0. These will be our starting points for calculating distances.\n\n2. **Initialize the Distance Matrix:**\n   - Create a matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, the distance to a 0 is unknown.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - For each 0 in the matrix, set its distance to 0 in the distance matrix and add its position to the queue.\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element, and for each of its 4 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right), check if moving to that neighbor would result in a shorter distance than currently recorded. If so, update the distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n4. **Update the Distance Matrix:**\n   - As we process each cell, update the distance matrix with the shortest distance found to a 0.\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - Once the BFS completes, the distance matrix will contain the shortest Manhattan distance to a 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n0 1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n```\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify positions of 0s:\n  - Positions: (0,0), (0,2), (0,5), (0,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,5), (6,5)\n\n- **Step 2:** Initialize the distance matrix with infinity, except for the positions of 0s which are set to 0.\n\n- **Step 3 & 4:** Perform BFS to update the distance matrix.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the distance matrix will be:\n\n```\n0 1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 2 1 2 2 1 1\n2 3 2 3 2 2 2\n3 2 3 2 0 1 0\n4 3 4 3 1 0 1\n5 4 5 4 2 1 2\n6 5 6 5 3 0 1\n```\n\n- **Step 5:** Output the result.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n0 1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 2 1 2 2 1 1\n2 3 2 3 2 2 2\n3 2 3 2 0 1 0\n4 3 4 3 1 0 1\n5 4 5 4 2 1 2\n6 5 6 5 3 0 1\n>>>"
