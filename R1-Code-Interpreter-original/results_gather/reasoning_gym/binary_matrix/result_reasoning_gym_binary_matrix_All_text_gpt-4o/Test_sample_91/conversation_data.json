    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of 0s**: First, we need to identify the positions of all the 0s in the matrix. In this case, the matrix is:\n   ```\n   1 1 1\n   1 1 1\n   1 1 0\n   ```\n   The position of the 0 is at (2, 2) (using 0-based indexing).\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, we assume the distance to the nearest 0 is very large.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) from each 0**: Use a BFS approach starting from each 0 to update the distances in the output matrix. BFS is suitable here because it explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring that the shortest path (minimum distance) is found.\n\n4. **Update distances**: For each cell containing a 0, set its distance to 0 in the output matrix. Then, for each neighboring cell (up, down, left, right), calculate the distance and update it in the output matrix if it is smaller than the current value.\n\n5. **Iterate until all cells are processed**: Continue the BFS process until all cells have been processed and the shortest distance to a 0 has been found for each cell.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start with the matrix:\n  ```\n  1 1 1\n  1 1 1\n  1 1 0\n  ```\n\n- Initialize the output matrix with infinity, except for the position of the 0:\n  ```\n  inf inf inf\n  inf inf inf\n  inf inf 0\n  ```\n\n- Perform BFS starting from the 0 at (2, 2):\n  - From (2, 2), update its neighbors:\n    - (2, 1) becomes 1\n    - (1, 2) becomes 1\n  - Output matrix:\n    ```\n    inf inf inf\n    inf inf 1\n    inf 1 0\n    ```\n\n- Continue BFS:\n  - From (2, 1), update its neighbors:\n    - (2, 0) becomes 2\n    - (1, 1) becomes 2\n  - From (1, 2), update its neighbors:\n    - (0, 2) becomes 2\n    - (1, 1) is already 2, no update needed\n  - Output matrix:\n    ```\n    inf inf 2\n    inf 2 1\n    2 1 0\n    ```\n\n- Continue BFS:\n  - From (2, 0), update its neighbor:\n    - (1, 0) becomes 3\n  - From (1, 1), update its neighbor:\n    - (0, 1) becomes 3\n  - From (0, 2), update its neighbor:\n    - (0, 1) is already 3, no update needed\n  - Output matrix:\n    ```\n    inf 3 2\n    3 2 1\n    2 1 0\n    ```\n\n- Continue BFS:\n  - From (1, 0), update its neighbor:\n    - (0, 0) becomes 4\n  - From (0, 1), update its neighbor:\n    - (0, 0) is already 4, no update needed\n  - Output matrix:\n    ```\n    4 3 2\n    3 2 1\n    2 1 0\n    ```\n\nNow, all cells have been processed, and the output matrix contains the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n```\n4 3 2\n3 2 1\n2 1 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<4 3 2\n3 2 1\n2 1 0>>>"
