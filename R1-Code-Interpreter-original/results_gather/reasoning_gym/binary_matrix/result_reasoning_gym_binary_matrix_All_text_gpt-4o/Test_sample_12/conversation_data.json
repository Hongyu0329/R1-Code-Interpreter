    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given square matrix.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 9x9, as there are 9 rows and 9 columns.\n\n3. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent uncalculated distances.\n   - Identify all the positions of 0s in the matrix, as these will be the starting points for our distance calculations.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**:\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - Initialize the queue with all positions of 0s and set their corresponding positions in the output matrix to 0 (since the distance to themselves is 0).\n\n5. **BFS Execution**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element (current position) and explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - For each neighbor, if the calculated distance (current distance + 1) is less than the current value in the output matrix at that neighbor's position, update the output matrix and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n6. **Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Ensure that while exploring neighbors, we do not go out of the matrix bounds.\n\n7. **Final Output**:\n   - After the BFS completes, the output matrix will contain the minimum distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the given matrix:\n\n```\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the output matrix with the distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n0 1 1 2 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 2\n1 0 1 2 0 1 0 1 0\n2 1 2 3 1 2 1 0 1\n3 2 3 1 0 1 1 0 1\n2 3 2 2 1 1 2 1 2\n0 1 2 3 2 0 1 1 0\n1 2 3 4 3 1 2 2 1\n0 0 1 2 3 2 3 3 2\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n0 1 1 2 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 2\n1 0 1 2 0 1 0 1 0\n2 1 2 3 1 2 1 0 1\n3 2 3 1 0 1 1 0 1\n2 3 2 2 1 1 2 1 2\n0 1 2 3 2 0 1 1 0\n1 2 3 4 3 1 2 2 1\n0 0 1 2 3 2 3 3 2\n>>>"
