    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given matrix.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 7x7, as there are 7 rows and 7 columns.\n\n3. **Initial Setup**: Create an output matrix of the same size, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, we assume the distance to the nearest 0 is very large.\n\n4. **Locate Zeros**: Identify all the positions in the matrix that contain a 0. These will be our starting points for calculating distances.\n\n5. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**:\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - Initialize the queue with all positions of 0s and set their distance to 0 in the output matrix.\n   - For each position, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If moving to a neighbor results in a smaller distance than currently recorded in the output matrix, update the distance and add the neighbor to the queue.\n\n6. **Iterate Until Completion**: Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed and the queue is empty.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: The output matrix will now contain the minimum distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 1 0 1 1\n```\n\nFollowing the BFS approach, we calculate the distances:\n\n```\n4 3 2 1 0 1 0\n3 2 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 1 2\n0 0 0 1 0 1 2\n0 1 0 1 0 1 2\n0 1 1 2 1 2 3\n0 0 0 1 0 1 2\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n4 3 2 1 0 1 0\n3 2 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 1 2\n0 0 0 1 0 1 2\n0 1 0 1 0 1 2\n0 1 1 2 1 2 3\n0 0 0 1 0 1 2\n>>>"
