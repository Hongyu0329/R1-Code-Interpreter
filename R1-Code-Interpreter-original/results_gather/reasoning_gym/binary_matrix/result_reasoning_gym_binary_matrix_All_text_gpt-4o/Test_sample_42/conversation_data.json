    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n0 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify all the 0s in the matrix:**\n   - The positions of 0s are: (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix:**\n   - Start with a matrix of the same size, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances.\n\n3. **First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right):**\n   - Traverse the matrix from top-left to bottom-right.\n   - If the current cell is 0, set the distance to 0.\n   - Otherwise, calculate the minimum distance from the top or left neighbor plus one.\n\n4. **Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left):**\n   - Traverse the matrix from bottom-right to top-left.\n   - Update the distance by considering the minimum distance from the bottom or right neighbor plus one.\n\n### Detailed Calculation:\n\n**First Pass:**\n\n- Start with the initial matrix:\n  ```\n  0 0 ∞ 0\n  ∞ ∞ 0 ∞\n  ∞ ∞ 0 0\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n  ```\n\n- Traverse from top-left to bottom-right:\n  - (0,0): Already 0.\n  - (0,1): Already 0.\n  - (0,2): Min(∞, 0+1) = 1.\n  - (0,3): Already 0.\n  - (1,0): Min(∞, 0+1) = 1.\n  - (1,1): Min(∞, 0+1) = 1.\n  - (1,2): Already 0.\n  - (1,3): Min(∞, 0+1) = 1.\n  - (2,0): Min(∞, 1+1) = 2.\n  - (2,1): Min(∞, 1+1) = 2.\n  - (2,2): Already 0.\n  - (2,3): Already 0.\n  - (3,0): Min(∞, 2+1) = 3.\n  - (3,1): Min(∞, 2+1) = 3.\n  - (3,2): Min(∞, 0+1) = 1.\n  - (3,3): Min(∞, 0+1) = 1.\n\n- Matrix after first pass:\n  ```\n  0 0 1 0\n  1 1 0 1\n  2 2 0 0\n  3 3 1 1\n  ```\n\n**Second Pass:**\n\n- Traverse from bottom-right to top-left:\n  - (3,3): Already 1.\n  - (3,2): Already 1.\n  - (3,1): Min(3, 1+1) = 2.\n  - (3,0): Min(3, 2+1) = 3.\n  - (2,3): Already 0.\n  - (2,2): Already 0.\n  - (2,1): Min(2, 0+1) = 1.\n  - (2,0): Min(2, 1+1) = 2.\n  - (1,3): Min(1, 0+1) = 1.\n  - (1,2): Already 0.\n  - (1,1): Min(1, 0+1) = 1.\n  - (1,0): Min(1, 1+1) = 1.\n  - (0,3): Already 0.\n  - (0,2): Min(1, 0+1) = 1.\n  - (0,1): Already 0.\n  - (0,0): Already 0.\n\n- Final matrix after second pass:\n  ```\n  0 0 1 0\n  1 1 0 1\n  2 1 0 0\n  3 2 1 1\n  ```\n\nThe final output matrix, representing the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell, is:\n\n<<<\n0 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n2 1 0 0\n3 2 1 1\n>>>"
