    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 5x5 square matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size (5x5) initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent initially unknown distances.\n\n3. **Locate All Zeros**: Identify the positions of all zeros in the matrix. These positions will be the starting points for calculating distances.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all zero positions simultaneously. This is efficient for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n5. **Update Distances**: For each zero, initialize its distance to zero in the output matrix. Then, for each cell, update its distance based on its neighbors. If moving to a neighboring cell results in a shorter distance than previously recorded, update the distance and continue the BFS from that cell.\n\n6. **Iterate Over the Matrix**: Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed and the shortest distance to a zero has been found for each cell.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once all distances are calculated, format the output matrix as required.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n- **Matrix**:\n  ```\n  1 1 1 1 1\n  1 1 0 1 1\n  1 1 1 0 0\n  1 0 0 0 1\n  0 1 0 1 1\n  ```\n\n- **Zero Positions**: \n  - (1, 2)\n  - (2, 3)\n  - (2, 4)\n  - (3, 1)\n  - (3, 2)\n  - (3, 3)\n  - (4, 0)\n  - (4, 2)\n\n- **BFS Initialization**: Start BFS from all zero positions with initial distance 0.\n\n- **Distance Calculation**:\n  - For each cell, calculate the minimum distance to any zero using BFS.\n  - Update the distance for each cell based on its neighbors.\n\n- **Final Output Matrix**:\n  ```\n  2 2 1 1 2\n  1 1 0 1 1\n  1 1 1 0 0\n  1 0 0 0 1\n  0 1 0 1 2\n  ```\n\nThe final output matrix, showing the Manhattan distance to the nearest zero for each cell, is:\n\n<<<\n2 2 1 1 2\n1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 2\n>>>"
