    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 7x7 square matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size (7x7) initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent initially unknown distances.\n\n3. **Locate All Zeros**: Identify all the positions in the matrix that contain a 0. These will be the starting points for our distance calculations.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all zero positions simultaneously. This is efficient for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n5. **Queue Initialization**: Initialize a queue with all the positions of the zeros. Set the distance for these positions to 0 in the output matrix.\n\n6. **BFS Execution**:\n   - Dequeue a position from the queue.\n   - For each of its four possible neighbors (up, down, left, right), calculate the potential new distance as the current cell's distance plus one.\n   - If this new distance is less than the current recorded distance in the output matrix for that neighbor, update the neighbor's distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n7. **Repeat**: Continue the BFS process until the queue is empty, ensuring all cells have been processed.\n\n8. **Output the Result**: Once the BFS completes, the output matrix will contain the Manhattan distances to the nearest zero for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n```\n\nFollowing the BFS approach, we calculate the distances:\n\n```\n4 3 2 1 0 1 1\n3 2 0 1 1 1 0\n2 1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 2 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0 1\n2 1 1 2 1 1 0\n3 2 2 1 1 0 1\n```\n\nThus, the output matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n<<<\n4 3 2 1 0 1 1\n3 2 0 1 1 1 0\n2 1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 2 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0 1\n2 1 1 2 1 1 0\n3 2 2 1 1 0 1\n>>>"
