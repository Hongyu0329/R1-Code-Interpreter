    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 4x4 square matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size (4x4) initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent the initial distances.\n\n3. **First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right)**:\n   - Traverse the matrix from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.\n   - If a cell contains a 0, set the corresponding cell in the output matrix to 0.\n   - For each cell containing a 1, calculate the minimum distance from the top or left neighbor plus one (if they exist).\n\n4. **Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left)**:\n   - Traverse the matrix from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner.\n   - For each cell, update the distance by considering the minimum distance from the bottom or right neighbor plus one (if they exist).\n\n5. **Output the Result**: The output matrix will contain the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n### Given Matrix:\n```\n1 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n```\n\n### First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right):\n- Start with an output matrix initialized to infinity:\n  ```\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n  ```\n\n- Traverse the matrix:\n  - (0,2) is 0, set output[0][2] = 0\n  - (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are 0, set output[1][0] = output[1][1] = output[1][2] = output[1][3] = 0\n  - (2,3) is 0, set output[2][3] = 0\n  - (3,1) and (3,3) are 0, set output[3][1] = output[3][3] = 0\n\n- Update distances using top and left neighbors:\n  ```\n  2 1 0 1\n  0 0 0 0\n  1 1 1 0\n  1 0 1 0\n  ```\n\n### Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left):\n- Update distances using bottom and right neighbors:\n  ```\n  1 1 0 1\n  0 0 0 0\n  1 1 1 0\n  1 0 1 0\n  ```\n\n### Final Output Matrix:\nThe final matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n```\n1 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0>>>"
