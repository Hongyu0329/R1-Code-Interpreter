    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given matrix.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 8x8, so we need to output an 8x8 matrix.\n\n3. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent that initially, we assume all cells are far from a 0.\n   - Identify all the positions of 0s in the matrix and set their corresponding positions in the output matrix to 0, as the distance from a 0 to itself is 0.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**:\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - For each 0, add its position to the queue.\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element, and for each of its 4 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right), calculate the distance from the current cell.\n   - If the calculated distance is less than the current value in the output matrix for that neighbor, update the output matrix and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n5. **Iterate Over the Matrix**:\n   - Start the BFS from all 0s, updating the distances in the output matrix as you go.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - After processing all cells, the output matrix will contain the minimum distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1\n```\n\nAfter applying the BFS approach, the output matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n3 2 1 2 2 1 1 0\n2 1 0 1 2 2 1 1\n2 1 1 2 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1 1 2\n0 0 1 1 1 0 1 2\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2\n2 2 1 0 1 1 0 1\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n3 2 1 2 2 1 1 0\n2 1 0 1 2 2 1 1\n2 1 1 2 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1 1 2\n0 0 1 1 1 0 1 2\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2\n2 2 1 0 1 1 0 1\n>>>"
