    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of all zeros in the matrix.**  \n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   1 1 0 1\n   1 1 1 1\n   1 1 1 0\n   1 0 1 1\n   ```\n   The positions of zeros are: (0, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 1).\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix with a large number (infinity) for all cells except those containing zeros.**  \n   This is because we want to find the minimum distance, and starting with a large number ensures that any valid distance will be smaller.\n\n3. **Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach starting from all zero positions.**  \n   BFS is suitable here because it explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time we reach a cell, it is with the shortest possible path.\n\n4. **Update the distance for each cell as we explore the matrix.**  \n   For each cell, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If moving to a neighbor results in a shorter distance than currently recorded, update the distance for that neighbor and add it to the queue for further exploration.\n\n5. **Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed.**\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start with the initial matrix and mark the positions of zeros:\n  ```\n  1 1 0 1\n  1 1 1 1\n  1 1 1 0\n  1 0 1 1\n  ```\n\n- Initialize the output matrix with infinity, except for zeros:\n  ```\n  ∞ ∞ 0 ∞\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ 0\n  ∞ 0 ∞ ∞\n  ```\n\n- Perform BFS starting from all zero positions:\n  - From (0, 2), update its neighbors:\n    - (0, 1) becomes 1\n    - (1, 2) becomes 1\n    - (0, 3) becomes 1\n  - From (2, 3), update its neighbors:\n    - (2, 2) becomes 1\n    - (1, 3) becomes 1\n    - (3, 3) becomes 1\n  - From (3, 1), update its neighbors:\n    - (2, 1) becomes 1\n    - (3, 0) becomes 1\n    - (3, 2) becomes 1\n\n- Continue BFS to update further:\n  - From (0, 1), update (0, 0) to 2\n  - From (1, 2), update (1, 1) to 2\n  - From (0, 3), no further updates needed\n  - From (2, 2), update (2, 1) to 2\n  - From (1, 3), no further updates needed\n  - From (3, 3), no further updates needed\n  - From (2, 1), update (1, 1) to 2\n  - From (3, 0), no further updates needed\n  - From (3, 2), no further updates needed\n\n- Final output matrix:\n  ```\n  2 1 0 1\n  2 2 1 1\n  2 1 1 0\n  1 0 1 1\n  ```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n<<<2 1 0 1\n2 2 1 1\n2 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1>>>"
