    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n1 1 1\n0 1 1\n0 0 0\n```\n\n1. **Identify the positions of 0s:**\n   - The 0s are located at positions (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), and (2, 2).\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix:**\n   - Start with an output matrix of the same size, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all 0s simultaneously. This ensures that we calculate the shortest distance to a 0 for each cell.\n   - Initialize the queue with all positions of 0s and set their distances to 0 in the output matrix.\n\n4. **Process each cell in the queue:**\n   - For each cell, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor has not been visited (i.e., its distance is still infinity), update its distance to be the current cell's distance plus 1, and add it to the queue.\n\n5. **Iterate until the queue is empty:**\n   - Continue processing cells until all cells have been visited and their distances updated.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start with the initial matrix:\n  ```\n  inf inf inf\n  0   inf inf\n  0   0   0\n  ```\n\n- Initialize the queue with positions of 0s: [(1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)].\n\n- Process each cell in the queue:\n  - (1, 0): Update (0, 0) to 1, (1, 1) to 1.\n  - (2, 0): Update (1, 0) is already 0, (2, 1) is already 0.\n  - (2, 1): Update (2, 0) is already 0, (2, 2) is already 0, (1, 1) is already 1.\n  - (2, 2): Update (2, 1) is already 0, (1, 2) to 1.\n\n- Continue processing:\n  - (0, 0): Update (0, 1) to 2.\n  - (1, 1): Update (0, 1) is already 2, (1, 2) is already 1.\n  - (1, 2): Update (0, 2) to 2.\n  - (0, 1): No updates needed.\n  - (0, 2): No updates needed.\n\nThe final output matrix, with each cell containing the distance to the nearest 0, is:\n\n```\n1 2 2\n0 1 1\n0 0 0\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1 2 2\n0 1 1\n0 0 0>>>"
