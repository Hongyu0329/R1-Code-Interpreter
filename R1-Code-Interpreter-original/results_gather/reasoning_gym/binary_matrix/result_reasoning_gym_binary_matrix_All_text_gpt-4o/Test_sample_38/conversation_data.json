    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of all 0s in the matrix:**\n   - (0, 2)\n   - (1, 0)\n   - (2, 1)\n   - (2, 3)\n\n2. **Initialize a result matrix with the same dimensions, filled with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances:**\n\n   ```\n   inf inf inf inf\n   inf inf inf inf\n   inf inf inf inf\n   inf inf inf inf\n   ```\n\n3. **Set the distance to 0 for all cells that contain a 0:**\n\n   ```\n   inf inf 0 inf\n   0 inf inf inf\n   inf 0 inf 0\n   inf inf inf inf\n   ```\n\n4. **Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach starting from all 0s simultaneously to calculate the minimum distance for each cell:**\n\n   - **First pass (from top-left to bottom-right):**\n     - For each cell, update its distance based on its top and left neighbors.\n     - If a neighbor has a smaller distance plus one, update the current cell's distance.\n\n   - **Second pass (from bottom-right to top-left):**\n     - For each cell, update its distance based on its bottom and right neighbors.\n     - If a neighbor has a smaller distance plus one, update the current cell's distance.\n\n5. **Perform the BFS:**\n\n   - **First pass:**\n\n     ```\n     1 1 0 1\n     0 1 1 2\n     1 0 1 0\n     2 1 1 1\n     ```\n\n   - **Second pass:**\n\n     ```\n     1 1 0 1\n     0 1 1 1\n     1 0 1 0\n     2 1 1 1\n     ```\n\n6. **Final result matrix:**\n\n   After performing the BFS, the final matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n   ```\n   1 1 0 1\n   0 1 1 1\n   1 0 1 0\n   2 1 1 1\n   ```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe output matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n<<<\n1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 0\n2 1 1 1\n>>>"
