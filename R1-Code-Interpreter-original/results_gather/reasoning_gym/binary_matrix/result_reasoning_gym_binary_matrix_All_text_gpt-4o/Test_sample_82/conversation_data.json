    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 6x6 square matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size (6x6) initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, the distance to the nearest 0 is unknown.\n\n3. **Locate All Zeros**: Identify the positions of all the zeros in the matrix. These positions will be the starting points for calculating distances.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all zero positions simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n5. **Update Distances**: For each zero, initialize its distance to 0 in the output matrix. Then, for each cell, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If moving to a neighbor results in a shorter distance than previously recorded, update the neighbor's distance and add it to the queue for further exploration.\n\n6. **Iterate Until Completion**: Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed and the shortest distance to a zero has been found for each cell.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once all cells have been processed, the output matrix will contain the Manhattan distances to the nearest zero for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n**Given Matrix:**\n```\n1 1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n**Output Matrix Calculation:**\n- Start BFS from all zero positions: (0,3), (0,4), (3,5), (5,0).\n- Initialize these positions in the output matrix with 0.\n- Explore neighbors and update distances.\n\n**Output Matrix:**\n```\n3 2 1 0 0 1\n4 3 2 1 1 2\n5 4 3 2 2 1\n6 5 4 3 2 0\n5 4 3 3 3 1\n0 1 2 3 4 2\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n3 2 1 0 0 1\n4 3 2 1 1 2\n5 4 3 2 2 1\n6 5 4 3 2 0\n5 4 3 3 3 1\n0 1 2 3 4 2\n>>>"
