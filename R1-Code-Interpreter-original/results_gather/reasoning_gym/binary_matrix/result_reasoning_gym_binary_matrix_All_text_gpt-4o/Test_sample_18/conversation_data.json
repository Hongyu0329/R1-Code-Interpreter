    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given matrix. The matrix is square, and the distance is the Manhattan distance.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: \n   - We have a 10x10 matrix.\n   - We need to create an output matrix of the same size where each cell contains the distance to the nearest 0.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - Initialize a queue with all positions of 0s in the matrix.\n   - Initialize the output matrix with a large number (infinity) for all cells except those containing 0, which should be initialized to 0.\n\n4. **BFS Execution**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, pop the front element, which gives the current cell position.\n   - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), calculate the new position.\n   - If the new position is within bounds and the current distance + 1 is less than the distance recorded in the output matrix for the new position, update the distance and add the new position to the queue.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that the BFS does not go out of bounds.\n   - Handle cases where the matrix is filled with 0s or 1s.\n\n6. **Final Output**:\n   - After the BFS completes, the output matrix will contain the minimum distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the given matrix:\n\n```\n0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1\n```\n\nAfter applying the BFS approach, the output matrix with the distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n0 1 0 1 1 2 1 0 1 2\n1 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 2 3\n2 2 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 2\n0 1 2 1 2 2 1 0 1 2\n1 0 1 2 3 2 1 1 0 1\n1 1 2 3 2 1 1 0 0 0\n0 1 2 3 0 1 1 1 1 0\n1 2 2 2 0 1 0 1 2 1\n2 2 1 1 1 0 1 2 2 2\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 2\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n0 1 0 1 1 2 1 0 1 2\n1 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 2 3\n2 2 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 2\n0 1 2 1 2 2 1 0 1 2\n1 0 1 2 3 2 1 1 0 1\n1 1 2 3 2 1 1 0 0 0\n0 1 2 3 0 1 1 1 1 0\n1 2 2 2 0 1 0 1 2 1\n2 2 1 1 1 0 1 2 2 2\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 2\n>>>"
