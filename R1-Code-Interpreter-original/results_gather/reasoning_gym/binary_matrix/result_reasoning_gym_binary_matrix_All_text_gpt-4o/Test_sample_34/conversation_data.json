    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Positions of Zeros:**\n   - First, we need to identify the positions of all the zeros in the matrix. In the given matrix, the zeros are located at positions \\((2, 1)\\), \\((2, 3)\\), and \\((3, 0)\\).\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix:**\n   - Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, the distance to a zero is unknown.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Use a BFS approach starting from all zero positions simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - Initialize a queue with all zero positions and set their corresponding positions in the output matrix to 0, as the distance from a zero to itself is 0.\n\n4. **Process the Queue:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element, which gives the current position and its distance.\n   - For each dequeued position, check its four possible neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is within bounds and the current calculated distance to a zero is less than the previously recorded distance in the output matrix, update the output matrix and enqueue the neighbor with the updated distance.\n\n5. **Continue Until All Cells are Processed:**\n   - Continue the BFS process until all cells have been processed and the queue is empty.\n\n6. **Output the Result:**\n   - The output matrix will now contain the Manhattan distance to the nearest zero for each cell.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\nInput Matrix:\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 1\n```\n\n- Initialize the output matrix with infinity, except for the positions of zeros which are initialized to 0:\n\n```\nOutput Matrix (initial):\n∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n∞ 0 ∞ 0\n0 ∞ ∞ ∞\n```\n\n- Start BFS from all zero positions \\((2, 1)\\), \\((2, 3)\\), and \\((3, 0)\\).\n\n- Process each cell and update the distances:\n\n```\nOutput Matrix (after BFS):\n3 2 1 1\n2 1 1 1\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 2 1\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix, representing the Manhattan distance to the nearest zero for each cell, is:\n\n<<<3 2 1 1\n2 1 1 1\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 2 1>>>"
