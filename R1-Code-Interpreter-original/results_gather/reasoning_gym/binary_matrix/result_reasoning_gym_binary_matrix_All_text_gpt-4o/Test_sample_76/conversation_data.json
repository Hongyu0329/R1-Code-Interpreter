    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 5x5 square matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size (5x5) initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent initially unknown distances.\n\n3. **Locate All Zeros**: Identify the positions of all zeros in the matrix. These positions will be the starting points for calculating distances.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all zero positions simultaneously. This is efficient for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n5. **Update Distances**: For each zero, initialize its distance to zero in the output matrix. Then, for each cell, update its distance based on the minimum distance from any zero found so far.\n\n6. **Explore Neighbors**: For each cell, explore its four possible neighbors (up, down, left, right). If moving to a neighbor results in a shorter distance than previously recorded, update the neighbor's distance and continue the BFS from there.\n\n7. **Repeat Until All Cells Are Processed**: Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed and the shortest distance to a zero has been found for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1\n```\n\n- **Step 1**: Initialize the output matrix with infinity:\n  ```\n  inf inf inf inf inf\n  inf inf inf inf inf\n  inf inf inf inf inf\n  inf inf inf inf inf\n  inf inf inf inf inf\n  ```\n\n- **Step 2**: Identify zero positions: (0,0), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (3,0), (4,3).\n\n- **Step 3**: Initialize BFS from zero positions, setting their distances to 0:\n  ```\n  0 inf inf inf inf\n  inf inf inf 0 0\n  inf inf 0 inf inf\n  0 inf inf inf inf\n  inf inf inf 0 inf\n  ```\n\n- **Step 4**: Perform BFS to update distances:\n  - From (0,0): Update (0,1) to 1, (1,0) to 1.\n  - From (1,3): Update (1,2) to 1, (2,3) to 1, (0,3) to 1.\n  - From (1,4): Update (0,4) to 1, (2,4) to 1.\n  - From (2,2): Update (2,1) to 1, (3,2) to 1.\n  - From (3,0): Update (4,0) to 1, (3,1) to 1.\n  - From (4,3): Update (4,2) to 1, (4,4) to 1.\n\n- **Step 5**: Continue BFS to ensure all cells are updated:\n  - Update (0,2) to 2, (0,3) to 1, (0,4) to 1.\n  - Update (1,1) to 2, (1,2) to 1, (1,3) to 0, (1,4) to 0.\n  - Update (2,0) to 2, (2,1) to 1, (2,2) to 0, (2,3) to 1, (2,4) to 1.\n  - Update (3,1) to 1, (3,2) to 1, (3,3) to 2, (3,4) to 2.\n  - Update (4,1) to 2, (4,2) to 1, (4,3) to 0, (4,4) to 1.\n\n- **Final Output Matrix**:\n  ```\n  0 1 2 1 1\n  1 2 1 0 0\n  2 1 0 1 1\n  0 1 1 2 2\n  1 2 1 0 1\n  ```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n0 1 2 1 1\n1 2 1 0 0\n2 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 2 2\n1 2 1 0 1\n>>>"
