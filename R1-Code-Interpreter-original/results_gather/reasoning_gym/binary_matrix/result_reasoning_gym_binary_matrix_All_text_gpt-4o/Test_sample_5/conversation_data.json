    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n```\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of 0s:**\n   - (0, 3)\n   - (2, 1)\n   - (3, 2)\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances:**\n\n   ```\n   inf inf inf inf\n   inf inf inf inf\n   inf inf inf inf\n   inf inf inf inf\n   ```\n\n3. **Set the distance to 0 for cells that contain 0:**\n\n   ```\n   inf inf inf 0\n   inf inf inf inf\n   inf 0 inf inf\n   inf inf 0 inf\n   ```\n\n4. **Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach starting from each 0 to calculate the minimum distance for each cell:**\n\n   - **From (0, 3):**\n     - Update (0, 2) to 1, (1, 3) to 1\n     - Update (0, 1) to 2, (1, 2) to 2\n     - Update (0, 0) to 3, (1, 1) to 3\n     - Update (1, 0) to 4\n\n   - **From (2, 1):**\n     - Update (1, 1) to 1, (2, 0) to 1, (3, 1) to 1\n     - Update (1, 0) to 2, (2, 2) to 2\n     - Update (3, 0) to 3, (3, 3) to 3\n\n   - **From (3, 2):**\n     - Update (2, 2) to 1, (3, 1) to 1, (3, 3) to 1\n     - Update (2, 3) to 2\n\n5. **Combine the results to get the final output matrix:**\n\n   ```\n   3 2 1 0\n   2 1 2 1\n   1 0 1 2\n   2 1 0 1\n   ```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe output matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n<<<3 2 1 0\n2 1 2 1\n1 0 1 2\n2 1 0 1>>>"
