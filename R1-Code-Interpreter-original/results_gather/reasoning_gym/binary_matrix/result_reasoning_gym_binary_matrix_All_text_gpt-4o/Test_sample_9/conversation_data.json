    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given matrix.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 9x9, as there are 9 rows and 9 columns.\n\n3. **Initial Setup**: Create an output matrix of the same size, initialized with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent that initially, the distance to a 0 is unknown.\n\n4. **Locate Zeros**: Identify all the positions in the matrix that contain a 0. These will be our starting points for calculating distances.\n\n5. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**:\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all zero positions simultaneously.\n   - Initialize the queue with all positions of 0s and set their corresponding positions in the output matrix to 0 (since the distance from a 0 to itself is 0).\n\n6. **BFS Execution**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element (current position).\n   - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), calculate the new position.\n   - If the new position is within bounds and the current calculated distance is less than the previously recorded distance in the output matrix, update the distance and enqueue the new position.\n\n7. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that the BFS does not go out of the matrix bounds.\n\n8. **Final Output**: Once the BFS completes, the output matrix will contain the minimum distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the output matrix with the distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n2 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 2\n0 0 0 1 1 0 1 2 3\n1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0\n0 1 2 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 2\n2 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 2\n3 2 1 1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n2 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 2\n0 0 0 1 1 0 1 2 3\n1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0\n0 1 2 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 2\n2 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 2\n3 2 1 1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n>>>"
