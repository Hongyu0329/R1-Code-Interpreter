    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given matrix. The matrix is square, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Create a result matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, we assume the distance to a 0 is very large.\n   - Identify all the cells in the matrix that contain a 0. These will be our starting points for calculating distances.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**:\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - Initialize the queue with all the positions of 0s in the matrix, and set their corresponding positions in the result matrix to 0 (since the distance to themselves is zero).\n\n4. **BFS Execution**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element (current cell position).\n   - For each dequeued cell, check its four possible neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is within bounds and the current calculated distance to a 0 is greater than the distance from the current cell plus one, update the neighbor's distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n5. **Final Result**:\n   - After the BFS completes, the result matrix will contain the minimum distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the given matrix:\n\n```\n0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n```\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the resulting matrix with the distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n0 1 2 3 1 0 0 1 1 2\n1 2 2 1 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 2 2 1 0 1 1 2\n2 1 2 3 2 1 1 2 1 0\n2 1 2 0 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 2 1 1 0 1 2\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n0 1 2 3 1 0 0 1 1 2\n1 2 2 1 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 2 2 1 0 1 1 2\n2 1 2 3 2 1 1 2 1 0\n2 1 2 0 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 2 1 1 0 1 2\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n>>>"
