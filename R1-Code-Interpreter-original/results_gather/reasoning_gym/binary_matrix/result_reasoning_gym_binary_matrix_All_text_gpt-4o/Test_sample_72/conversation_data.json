    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n0 1 0\n1 0 1\n0 1 1\n```\n\n1. **Identify the positions of 0s:**\n   - (0, 0)\n   - (0, 2)\n   - (1, 1)\n   - (2, 0)\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix with a large number (infinity) for each cell except those containing 0, which should be initialized to 0:**\n\n   ```\n   0 ∞ 0\n   ∞ 0 ∞\n   0 ∞ ∞\n   ```\n\n3. **Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach starting from all 0s simultaneously:**\n   - This approach ensures that we explore the nearest cells first, updating the distance for each cell as we go.\n\n4. **Perform BFS:**\n   - Start from each 0 and explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor's current distance is greater than the distance from the current cell plus one, update the neighbor's distance and add it to the queue for further exploration.\n\n5. **Step-by-step BFS updates:**\n\n   - Start from (0, 0):\n     - Update (0, 1) to 1\n     - Update (1, 0) to 1\n\n   - Start from (0, 2):\n     - Update (0, 1) to 1 (already 1, no change)\n     - Update (1, 2) to 1\n\n   - Start from (1, 1):\n     - Update (1, 0) to 1 (already 1, no change)\n     - Update (1, 2) to 1 (already 1, no change)\n     - Update (2, 1) to 1\n\n   - Start from (2, 0):\n     - Update (2, 1) to 1 (already 1, no change)\n\n6. **Final output matrix:**\n\n   ```\n   0 1 0\n   1 0 1\n   0 1 2\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix represents the Manhattan distance of each cell to the nearest 0.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0 1 0\n1 0 1\n0 1 2>>>"
