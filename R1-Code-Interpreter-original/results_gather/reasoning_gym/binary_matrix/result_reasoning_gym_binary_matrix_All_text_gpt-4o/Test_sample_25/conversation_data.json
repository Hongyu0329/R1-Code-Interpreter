    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n1 0 1\n1 1 1\n1 0 1\n```\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of 0s:**\n   - The 0s are located at positions (0, 1) and (2, 1).\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix:**\n   - Start with a matrix of the same size, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances.\n\n3. **First pass (top-left to bottom-right):**\n   - For each cell, calculate the distance to the nearest 0 found so far.\n   - Update the distance using the minimum of the current distance and the distance from the top or left neighbor plus one.\n\n4. **Second pass (bottom-right to top-left):**\n   - For each cell, update the distance using the minimum of the current distance and the distance from the bottom or right neighbor plus one.\n\n### Detailed Calculation:\n\n**First Pass:**\n\n- Start with the initial matrix:\n  ```\n  inf 0 inf\n  inf inf inf\n  inf 0 inf\n  ```\n\n- Update distances from top-left to bottom-right:\n\n  - (0, 0): min(inf, 1 + 0) = 1\n  - (0, 1): 0 (already 0)\n  - (0, 2): min(inf, 1 + 0) = 1\n\n  - (1, 0): min(inf, 1 + 1) = 2\n  - (1, 1): min(inf, 1 + 0) = 1\n  - (1, 2): min(inf, 1 + 1) = 2\n\n  - (2, 0): min(inf, 1 + 2) = 3\n  - (2, 1): 0 (already 0)\n  - (2, 2): min(inf, 1 + 0) = 1\n\n  Result after first pass:\n  ```\n  1 0 1\n  2 1 2\n  3 0 1\n  ```\n\n**Second Pass:**\n\n- Update distances from bottom-right to top-left:\n\n  - (2, 2): min(1, 1 + 0) = 1\n  - (2, 1): 0 (already 0)\n  - (2, 0): min(3, 1 + 0) = 1\n\n  - (1, 2): min(2, 1 + 1) = 2\n  - (1, 1): min(1, 1 + 0) = 1\n  - (1, 0): min(2, 1 + 1) = 1\n\n  - (0, 2): min(1, 1 + 1) = 1\n  - (0, 1): 0 (already 0)\n  - (0, 0): min(1, 1 + 0) = 1\n\n  Final result after second pass:\n  ```\n  1 0 1\n  1 1 1\n  1 0 1\n  ```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n<<<\n1 0 1\n1 1 1\n1 0 1\n>>>"
