    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of all 0s in the matrix.**  \n   The matrix is:\n   ```\n   1 0 0 0 1 1\n   1 0 1 1 1 1\n   1 0 1 1 1 1\n   1 1 0 1 0 1\n   1 0 1 1 1 1\n   1 1 0 0 1 0\n   ```\n   The positions of 0s are:  \n   - Row 0: Columns 1, 2, 3\n   - Row 1: Column 1\n   - Row 2: Column 1\n   - Row 3: Columns 2, 4\n   - Row 4: Column 1\n   - Row 5: Columns 2, 3, 5\n\n2. **Initialize a result matrix with the same dimensions, filled with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances.**\n\n3. **Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach starting from all 0s simultaneously.**  \n   - Initialize a queue with all positions of 0s and set their distances to 0 in the result matrix.\n   - For each cell, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor has not been visited (i.e., its distance is still infinity), update its distance to the current cell's distance + 1 and add it to the queue.\n\n4. **Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed.**\n\n5. **The result matrix will contain the minimum distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.**\n\nLet's apply this process to the given matrix:\n\n- Start with the initial positions of 0s and set their distances to 0.\n- Perform BFS to update distances for all other cells.\n\nThe resulting matrix with the distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n1 0 0 0 1 2\n1 0 1 1 2 3\n1 0 1 2 1 2\n1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 2 1 2\n2 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n1 0 0 0 1 2\n1 0 1 1 2 3\n1 0 1 2 1 2\n1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 2 1 2\n2 1 0 0 1 0\n>>>"
