    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given matrix. The matrix is square, and the distance metric is the Manhattan distance.\n\n2. **Matrix Representation**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1\n   1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0\n   1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1\n   1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n   1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1\n   1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n   1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n   1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**:\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all cells containing 0. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - Enqueue all positions of 0s in the matrix with a distance of 0.\n   - For each cell dequeued, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor has not been visited (i.e., its distance is still infinity), update its distance to the current cell's distance plus one, and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n5. **Iterate Over the Matrix**:\n   - Start BFS from all 0s simultaneously. This ensures that the first time a cell is reached, it is reached via the shortest path.\n   - Update the distance for each cell as you process it.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: After processing all cells, the output matrix will contain the minimum distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nFollowing these steps, the output matrix is calculated as follows:\n\n```\n2 1 0 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n2 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n2 1 0 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n2 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n>>>"
