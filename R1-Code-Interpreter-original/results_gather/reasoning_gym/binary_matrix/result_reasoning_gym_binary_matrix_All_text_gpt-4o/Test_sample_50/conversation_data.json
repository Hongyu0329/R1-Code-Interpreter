    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 5x5 square matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size (5x5) initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, the distance to the nearest 0 is unknown.\n\n3. **Locate All Zeros**: Identify the positions of all the zeros in the matrix. These positions will be the starting points for calculating distances.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all zero positions simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n5. **Update Distances**: For each zero, initialize its distance to 0 in the output matrix. Then, for each cell, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor's current distance is greater than the current cell's distance plus one, update the neighbor's distance and add it to the queue for further exploration.\n\n6. **Iterate Until Completion**: Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed and the shortest distance to a zero has been found for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n- **Matrix**:\n  ```\n  1 1 1 1 1\n  1 0 1 1 1\n  1 0 1 1 0\n  0 1 0 0 0\n  1 0 0 1 1\n  ```\n\n- **Initialize Output Matrix**:\n  ```\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n  ∞ 0 ∞ ∞ ∞\n  ∞ 0 ∞ ∞ 0\n  0 ∞ 0 0 0\n  ∞ 0 0 ∞ ∞\n  ```\n\n- **BFS Processing**:\n  - Start from all zeros and update distances:\n  - After processing, the output matrix becomes:\n  ```\n  2 1 2 1 1\n  1 0 1 1 1\n  1 0 1 1 0\n  0 1 0 0 0\n  1 0 0 1 1\n  ```\n\n### Final Output Matrix:\n\nThe final matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest zero for each cell is:\n\n<<<\n2 1 2 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n>>>"
