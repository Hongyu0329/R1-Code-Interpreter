    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the nearest 0 for each cell in the matrix and calculate the Manhattan distance to that 0.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is 8x8.\n\n3. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances.\n   - Identify all the positions of 0s in the matrix, as these will be our starting points for calculating distances.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**:\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - Initialize the queue with all positions of 0s and set their corresponding positions in the output matrix to 0 (distance to themselves).\n\n5. **BFS Execution**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element (current position).\n   - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), calculate the new position.\n   - If the new position is within bounds and the current calculated distance is greater than the distance from the current position plus one, update the distance and enqueue the new position.\n\n6. **Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Ensure that the new positions calculated during BFS are within the matrix bounds.\n   - Only update the distance if the new calculated distance is smaller than the current stored distance.\n\n7. **Final Output**:\n   - After the BFS completes, the output matrix will contain the minimum distances from each cell to the nearest 0.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the given matrix:\n\n```\nInput Matrix:\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the output matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\nOutput Matrix:\n4 3 2 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 2 1 2 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 1 2 1\n0 1 1 2 1 2 1 0\n1 0 1 0 1 2 1 1\n0 1 2 1 2 1 0 1\n1 2 1 1 0 1 1 0\n2 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n4 3 2 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 2 1 2 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 1 2 1\n0 1 1 2 1 2 1 0\n1 0 1 0 1 2 1 1\n0 1 2 1 2 1 0 1\n1 2 1 1 0 1 1 0\n2 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n>>>"
