    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n0 0 1\n1 1 1\n0 1 1\n```\n\n1. **Identify the positions of 0s:**\n   - The 0s are located at positions (0,0), (0,1), and (2,0).\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix:**\n   - Start with an output matrix of the same size, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances:\n     ```\n     inf inf inf\n     inf inf inf\n     inf inf inf\n     ```\n\n3. **Set the distance for cells containing 0 to 0:**\n   - For cells that contain a 0, the distance to the nearest 0 is 0:\n     ```\n     0 0 inf\n     inf inf inf\n     0 inf inf\n     ```\n\n4. **Calculate distances using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS starting from all 0s simultaneously. This ensures that we calculate the shortest distance to a 0 for each cell.\n   - Initialize the queue with all positions of 0s: [(0,0), (0,1), (2,0)].\n\n5. **Process each cell in the queue:**\n   - For each cell, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor has not been visited (i.e., its distance is still infinity), update its distance and add it to the queue.\n\n6. **Perform BFS:**\n   - Start with the initial queue: [(0,0), (0,1), (2,0)].\n   - Process each cell and update distances:\n     - From (0,0), update (1,0) to 1.\n     - From (0,1), update (0,2) to 1 and (1,1) to 1.\n     - From (2,0), update (1,0) to 1 (already updated, so no change).\n     - Continue processing the queue until all cells are visited.\n\n7. **Final output matrix:**\n   - After processing all cells, the output matrix with the distances to the nearest 0 is:\n     ```\n     0 0 1\n     1 1 2\n     0 1 2\n     ```\n\nThe final answer, enclosed in triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<\n0 0 1\n1 1 2\n0 1 2\n>>>"
