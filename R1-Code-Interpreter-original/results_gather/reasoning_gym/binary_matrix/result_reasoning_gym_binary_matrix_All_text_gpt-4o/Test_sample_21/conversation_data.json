    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, the distance to the nearest 0 is unknown.\n\n2. **Identify Zero Cells**: Traverse the input matrix and identify all cells that contain a 0. These cells will have a distance of 0 to themselves.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all zero cells simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n4. **Update Distances**: For each zero cell, update the distance of its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) if the new calculated distance is smaller than the current distance stored in the output matrix.\n\n5. **Iterate Until Completion**: Continue the BFS process until all cells have been processed and the shortest distance to a zero has been found for each cell.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Once all cells have been processed, the output matrix will contain the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n```\n\n- **Step 1**: Initialize the output matrix with infinity, except for cells with 0, which are initialized to 0.\n\n- **Step 2**: Identify zero cells and start BFS from these cells.\n\n- **Step 3**: Perform BFS to update distances.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the output matrix will be:\n\n```\n2 1 0 1 1 2\n0 1 0 1 1 2\n1 2 1 2 1 2\n1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n2 1 0 1 1 2\n0 1 0 1 1 2\n1 2 1 2 1 2\n1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n>>>"
