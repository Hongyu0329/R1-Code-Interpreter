    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of all 0s in the matrix.**  \n   We will first scan the matrix to find all the cells that contain a 0. These will be our starting points for calculating distances.\n\n2. **Initialize the distance matrix.**  \n   Create a matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, we assume all cells are far from a 0.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) from each 0.**  \n   Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from each 0. For each 0, set its distance to 0 in the distance matrix. Then, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) and update their distances if a shorter path to a 0 is found.\n\n4. **Update distances.**  \n   For each cell, if moving to a neighboring cell results in a shorter distance to a 0, update the distance and add the neighboring cell to the queue for further exploration.\n\n5. **Continue until all cells are processed.**  \n   The BFS will ensure that each cell is processed in order of increasing distance from a 0, ensuring that the shortest distance is found.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n0 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 0\n```\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify positions of 0s:\n  - (0,0), (0,2), (0,4), (0,5)\n  - (1,1)\n  - (2,1)\n  - (3,0), (3,3)\n  - (4,2), (4,4)\n  - (5,3), (5,5)\n\n- **Step 2:** Initialize the distance matrix with infinity, except for the positions of 0s which are set to 0.\n\n- **Step 3 & 4:** Perform BFS from each 0, updating distances.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the distance matrix will be:\n\n```\n0 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 2 1 1\n1 0 1 1 2 2\n0 1 1 0 1 2\n1 1 0 1 0 1\n2 2 1 0 1 0\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n0 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 2 1 1\n1 0 1 1 2 2\n0 1 1 0 1 2\n1 1 0 1 0 1\n2 2 1 0 1 0\n>>>"
