    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions:**\n   - The given matrix is a 10x10 square matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix:**\n   - Create an output matrix of the same size (10x10) initialized with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent initially unknown distances.\n\n3. **Locate All Zeros:**\n   - Traverse the matrix to find all cells containing 0. These will be the starting points for our distance calculations.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Use a BFS starting from all zero cells simultaneously. This is efficient for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - Initialize a queue with all zero cells and set their corresponding positions in the output matrix to 0 (distance to themselves).\n\n5. **Process the Queue:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a cell and check its neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - For each neighbor, if the current path offers a shorter distance than previously recorded, update the distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n6. **Boundary Conditions:**\n   - Ensure that the BFS does not go out of the matrix bounds.\n\n7. **Output the Result:**\n   - After processing all cells, the output matrix will contain the minimum distances to the nearest zero for each cell.\n\n### Applying the Steps to the Given Matrix:\n\nGiven matrix:\n```\n1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n```\n\nAfter applying the BFS approach, the output matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n>>>"
