    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n1 0 0\n1 0 1\n1 1 1\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of 0s:**\n   - The 0s are located at positions (0,1), (0,2), and (1,1).\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix:**\n   - Start with a matrix of the same size, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances.\n\n3. **Calculate distances:**\n   - For each cell in the matrix, calculate the Manhattan distance to each 0 and take the minimum distance.\n\n4. **Iterate over each cell:**\n\n   - **Cell (0,0):**\n     - Distance to (0,1): \\(|0-0| + |0-1| = 1\\)\n     - Distance to (0,2): \\(|0-0| + |0-2| = 2\\)\n     - Distance to (1,1): \\(|0-1| + |0-1| = 2\\)\n     - Minimum distance: 1\n\n   - **Cell (0,1):**\n     - This cell is already 0, so the distance is 0.\n\n   - **Cell (0,2):**\n     - This cell is already 0, so the distance is 0.\n\n   - **Cell (1,0):**\n     - Distance to (0,1): \\(|1-0| + |0-1| = 2\\)\n     - Distance to (0,2): \\(|1-0| + |0-2| = 3\\)\n     - Distance to (1,1): \\(|1-1| + |0-1| = 1\\)\n     - Minimum distance: 1\n\n   - **Cell (1,1):**\n     - This cell is already 0, so the distance is 0.\n\n   - **Cell (1,2):**\n     - Distance to (0,1): \\(|1-0| + |2-1| = 2\\)\n     - Distance to (0,2): \\(|1-0| + |2-2| = 1\\)\n     - Distance to (1,1): \\(|1-1| + |2-1| = 1\\)\n     - Minimum distance: 1\n\n   - **Cell (2,0):**\n     - Distance to (0,1): \\(|2-0| + |0-1| = 3\\)\n     - Distance to (0,2): \\(|2-0| + |0-2| = 4\\)\n     - Distance to (1,1): \\(|2-1| + |0-1| = 2\\)\n     - Minimum distance: 2\n\n   - **Cell (2,1):**\n     - Distance to (0,1): \\(|2-0| + |1-1| = 2\\)\n     - Distance to (0,2): \\(|2-0| + |1-2| = 3\\)\n     - Distance to (1,1): \\(|2-1| + |1-1| = 1\\)\n     - Minimum distance: 1\n\n   - **Cell (2,2):**\n     - Distance to (0,1): \\(|2-0| + |2-1| = 3\\)\n     - Distance to (0,2): \\(|2-0| + |2-2| = 2\\)\n     - Distance to (1,1): \\(|2-1| + |2-1| = 2\\)\n     - Minimum distance: 2\n\n5. **Construct the output matrix:**\n   - Based on the calculated minimum distances, the output matrix is:\n\n```\n1 0 0\n1 0 1\n2 1 2\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n1 0 0\n1 0 1\n2 1 2\n>>>"
