    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n```\n\n1. **Identify the positions of 0s:**\n   - (0, 0)\n   - (0, 2)\n   - (0, 3)\n   - (2, 0)\n   - (3, 0)\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix with a large number (infinity) for non-zero cells and 0 for zero cells:**\n\n   ```\n   0 ∞ 0 0\n   ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n   0 ∞ ∞ ∞\n   0 ∞ ∞ ∞\n   ```\n\n3. **First pass (top-left to bottom-right):**\n   - For each cell, check the top and left neighbors to update the distance.\n\n   ```\n   0 1 0 0\n   1 2 1 1\n   0 1 2 3\n   0 1 2 3\n   ```\n\n4. **Second pass (bottom-right to top-left):**\n   - For each cell, check the bottom and right neighbors to update the distance.\n\n   ```\n   0 1 0 0\n   1 2 1 1\n   0 1 2 2\n   0 1 2 3\n   ```\n\n5. **Final output matrix:**\n   - After both passes, the matrix contains the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nThe final output matrix is:\n\n```\n0 1 0 0\n1 2 1 1\n0 1 2 2\n0 1 2 3\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<0 1 0 0\n1 2 1 1\n0 1 2 2\n0 1 2 3>>>"
