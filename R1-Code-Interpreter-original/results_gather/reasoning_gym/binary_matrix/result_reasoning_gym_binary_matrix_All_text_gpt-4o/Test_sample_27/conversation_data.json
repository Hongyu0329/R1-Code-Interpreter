    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, we assume the distance to the nearest 0 is very large.\n\n2. **First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right)**: \n   - Traverse the matrix from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.\n   - If the current cell contains a 0, set the corresponding cell in the output matrix to 0.\n   - If the current cell contains a 1, update the distance in the output matrix by considering the minimum distance from the top or left neighbor plus one (if they exist).\n\n3. **Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left)**:\n   - Traverse the matrix from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner.\n   - If the current cell contains a 1, update the distance in the output matrix by considering the minimum distance from the bottom or right neighbor plus one (if they exist).\n\n4. **Result**: After these two passes, the output matrix will contain the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n**Input Matrix**:\n```\n1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n**First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right)**:\n- Start with an output matrix initialized to infinity, except for cells with 0 in the input matrix, which are set to 0.\n- Update distances based on top and left neighbors.\n\n**Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left)**:\n- Update distances based on bottom and right neighbors.\n\n**Final Output Matrix**:\n```\n1 0 1 2 2 3\n1 0 1 2 2 3\n0 1 2 1 1 2\n0 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0 0\n1 2 1 1 1 0\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix, representing the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell, is:\n\n<<<\n1 0 1 2 2 3\n1 0 1 2 2 3\n0 1 2 1 1 2\n0 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0 0\n1 2 1 1 1 0\n>>>"
