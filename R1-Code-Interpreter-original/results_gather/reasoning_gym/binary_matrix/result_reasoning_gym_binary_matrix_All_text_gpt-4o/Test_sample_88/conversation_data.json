    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Initialize the Output Matrix:**\n   - Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, the distance to the nearest 0 is unknown.\n\n2. **First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right):**\n   - Traverse the matrix from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.\n   - If a cell contains a 0, set the corresponding cell in the output matrix to 0.\n   - For each cell that is not 0, update its distance based on the minimum distance from its top or left neighbor plus one.\n\n3. **Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left):**\n   - Traverse the matrix from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner.\n   - For each cell, update its distance based on the minimum distance from its bottom or right neighbor plus one.\n\n4. **Output the Result:**\n   - After both passes, the output matrix will contain the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n**Input Matrix:**\n```\n1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n**First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right):**\n- Initialize the output matrix with infinity, except for cells with 0 in the input matrix, which are set to 0.\n- Update distances based on top and left neighbors.\n\n**Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left):**\n- Update distances based on bottom and right neighbors.\n\n**Final Output Matrix:**\n```\n1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 1 2\n0 1 0 1 2 1\n1 0 1 2 1 0\n0 0 1 2 1 1\n1 1 2 1 1 0\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix, representing the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell, is:\n\n<<<\n1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 1 2\n0 1 0 1 2 1\n1 0 1 2 1 0\n0 0 1 2 1 1\n1 1 2 1 1 0\n>>>"
