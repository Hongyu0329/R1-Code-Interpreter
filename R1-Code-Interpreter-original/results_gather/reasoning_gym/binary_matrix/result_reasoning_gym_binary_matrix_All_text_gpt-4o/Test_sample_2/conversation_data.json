    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given matrix.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 8x8, so we need to output an 8x8 matrix.\n\n3. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Create an output matrix of the same size initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent initially unknown distances.\n   - Identify all positions of 0s in the matrix and set their corresponding positions in the output matrix to 0, as the distance from a 0 to itself is 0.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**:\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all 0s simultaneously. This is efficient for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n   - Enqueue all positions of 0s initially.\n   - For each position dequeued, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor has not been visited (i.e., its distance is still infinity), update its distance to be the current cell's distance plus 1, and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n5. **Iterate Until Completion**:\n   - Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed and the queue is empty.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - The output matrix will now contain the minimum distances from each cell to the nearest 0.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1\n```\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the output matrix with the distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n3 3 2 1 0 1 1 2\n2 2 1 1 0 1 1 2\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 2\n0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 2 1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 2 2 1 1 2\n1 0 1 2 2 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n3 3 2 1 0 1 1 2\n2 2 1 1 0 1 1 2\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 2\n0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 2 1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 2 2 1 1 2\n1 0 1 2 2 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1\n>>>"
