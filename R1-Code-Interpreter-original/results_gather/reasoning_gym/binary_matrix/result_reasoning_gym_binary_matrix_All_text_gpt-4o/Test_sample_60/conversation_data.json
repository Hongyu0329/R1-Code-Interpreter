    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, the distance to the nearest 0 is unknown.\n\n2. **Identify All Zeros**: Traverse the input matrix and identify all the cells that contain a 0. These cells will have a distance of 0 to themselves.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n4. **Queue Initialization**: Initialize a queue and enqueue all the positions of the 0s found in the matrix. Set their corresponding positions in the output matrix to 0.\n\n5. **BFS Traversal**: While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n   - Dequeue a cell from the front of the queue.\n   - For each of its four possible neighbors (up, down, left, right), calculate the potential new distance as the current cell's distance plus one.\n   - If this new distance is less than the current distance recorded in the output matrix for the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n6. **Continue Until Queue is Empty**: Repeat the BFS traversal until the queue is empty, ensuring that all cells have been processed and the shortest distance to a 0 has been found for each cell.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once the BFS completes, the output matrix will contain the shortest Manhattan distance to a 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given matrix:\n\n```\n0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1\n```\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the output matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 2\n0 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 2\n1 2 1 0 1 0 1 0 1\n2 3 2 1 1 0 1 1 2\n2 2 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 1 2 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 0 1 2 1 2 2\n0 1 0 1 2 1 0 1 2\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 2\n0 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 2\n1 2 1 0 1 0 1 0 1\n2 3 2 1 1 0 1 1 2\n2 2 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 1 2 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 0 1 2 1 2 2\n0 1 0 1 2 1 0 1 2\n>>>"
