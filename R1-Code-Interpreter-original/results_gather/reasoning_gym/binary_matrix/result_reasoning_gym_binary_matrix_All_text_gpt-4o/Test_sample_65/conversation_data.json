    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Initialize the Output Matrix:**\n   - Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent that initially, the distance to the nearest 0 is unknown.\n\n2. **Identify All Zeros:**\n   - Traverse the input matrix and identify all cells containing a 0. These cells will have a distance of 0 to themselves.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This approach ensures that we explore the nearest cells first.\n   - For each 0 found in the matrix, enqueue its position and set its distance to 0 in the output matrix.\n\n4. **Process the Queue:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element, which gives the current cell position.\n   - For each dequeued cell, check its four possible neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is within bounds and the current path offers a shorter distance than previously recorded, update the neighbor's distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n5. **Continue Until All Cells Are Processed:**\n   - Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed and the shortest distance to a 0 has been found for each cell.\n\n6. **Output the Result:**\n   - The output matrix will now contain the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n```\n\nFollowing the steps outlined, the output matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n1 1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 1 1 2 1\n1 0 1 0 1 2\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n1 1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 1 1 2 1\n1 0 1 0 1 2\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n>>>"
