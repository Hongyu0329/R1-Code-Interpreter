    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation:**\n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   1 0 1\n   1 1 1\n   1 0 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Cells with 0:**\n   We need to identify the positions of all the 0s in the matrix:\n   - Position (0, 1)\n   - Position (2, 1)\n\n3. **Calculate Distance for Each Cell:**\n   We will calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell to the nearest 0.\n\n   - **Row 0:**\n     - Cell (0, 0): Distance to (0, 1) is \\(|0-0| + |0-1| = 1\\).\n     - Cell (0, 1): It is already 0, so distance is 0.\n     - Cell (0, 2): Distance to (0, 1) is \\(|0-0| + |2-1| = 1\\).\n\n   - **Row 1:**\n     - Cell (1, 0): Distance to (0, 1) is \\(|1-0| + |0-1| = 2\\) and to (2, 1) is \\(|1-2| + |0-1| = 2\\). The minimum distance is 2.\n     - Cell (1, 1): Distance to (0, 1) is \\(|1-0| + |1-1| = 1\\) and to (2, 1) is \\(|1-2| + |1-1| = 1\\). The minimum distance is 1.\n     - Cell (1, 2): Distance to (0, 1) is \\(|1-0| + |2-1| = 2\\) and to (2, 1) is \\(|1-2| + |2-1| = 2\\). The minimum distance is 2.\n\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - Cell (2, 0): Distance to (2, 1) is \\(|2-2| + |0-1| = 1\\).\n     - Cell (2, 1): It is already 0, so distance is 0.\n     - Cell (2, 2): Distance to (2, 1) is \\(|2-2| + |2-1| = 1\\).\n\n4. **Construct the Output Matrix:**\n   Based on the calculated distances, the output matrix is:\n   ```\n   1 0 1\n   2 1 2\n   1 0 1\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n1 0 1\n2 1 2\n1 0 1\n>>>"
