    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Positions of Zeros:**\n   - First, we need to identify all the positions in the matrix that contain a 0. These will be our starting points for calculating distances.\n\n2. **Initialize the Distance Matrix:**\n   - Create a matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, we assume all cells are far from a 0.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - For each 0 in the matrix, set its distance to 0 in the distance matrix and add its position to the queue.\n   - While the queue is not empty, pop a position from the queue, and for each of its 4 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right), calculate the potential new distance as the current cell's distance plus 1.\n   - If this new distance is less than the current recorded distance for that neighbor, update the neighbor's distance and add it to the queue.\n\n4. **Iterate Over the Matrix:**\n   - After the BFS completes, the distance matrix will contain the minimum distance to a 0 for each cell.\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - Format the distance matrix as required and output it.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n```\n\n**Step-by-step Calculation:**\n\n- Initialize the distance matrix with infinity, except for cells with 0, which are initialized to 0.\n- Perform BFS starting from all 0s, updating distances for each cell.\n\nThe resulting distance matrix is:\n\n```\n3 2 1 0 1 1 1\n2 1 0 1 2 2 2\n3 2 1 2 1 1 1\n2 1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<3 2 1 0 1 1 1\n2 1 0 1 2 2 2\n3 2 1 2 1 1 1\n2 1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1>>>"
