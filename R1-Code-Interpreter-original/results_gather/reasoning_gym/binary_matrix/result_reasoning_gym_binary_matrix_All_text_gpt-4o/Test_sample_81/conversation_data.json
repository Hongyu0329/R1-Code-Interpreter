    "To solve the problem of finding the taxicab (Manhattan) distance of the nearest 0 for each cell in a given square matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a matrix where each cell contains either a 0 or a 1. Our task is to create a new matrix of the same size where each cell contains the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 in the original matrix.\n\n2. **Manhattan Distance**: The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\n3. **Input Matrix**:\n   ```\n   0 0 1\n   1 1 0\n   1 1 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Start by creating an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, we assume the distance to the nearest 0 is very large.\n\n5. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**:\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all the cells that contain 0. This is because the distance from a 0 to itself is 0, and we can propagate this information to neighboring cells.\n   - Enqueue all positions of 0s in the matrix with a distance of 0.\n   - For each cell dequeued, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If moving to a neighbor results in a smaller distance than currently recorded in the output matrix, update the distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n6. **Process the Matrix**:\n   - Start with the initial positions of 0s in the queue.\n   - For each position, calculate the distance for its neighbors.\n   - Update the distance for each neighbor if the new calculated distance is smaller.\n   - Continue this process until all cells have been processed.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: After processing all cells, the output matrix will contain the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start with the initial matrix:\n  ```\n  0 0 1\n  1 1 0\n  1 1 1\n  ```\n\n- Initialize the output matrix with infinity, except for the positions of 0s:\n  ```\n  0 0 ∞\n  ∞ ∞ 0\n  ∞ ∞ ∞\n  ```\n\n- Enqueue all 0s with distance 0: \\((0,0)\\), \\((0,1)\\), \\((1,2)\\).\n\n- Process the queue:\n  - Dequeue \\((0,0)\\): Update neighbors \\((1,0)\\) to 1.\n  - Dequeue \\((0,1)\\): Update neighbors \\((0,2)\\) to 1, \\((1,1)\\) to 1.\n  - Dequeue \\((1,2)\\): Update neighbors \\((2,2)\\) to 1, \\((1,1)\\) to 1 (already 1, no change).\n  - Dequeue \\((1,0)\\): Update neighbors \\((2,0)\\) to 2.\n  - Dequeue \\((0,2)\\): Update neighbors \\((1,2)\\) to 0 (already 0, no change).\n  - Dequeue \\((1,1)\\): Update neighbors \\((2,1)\\) to 2.\n  - Dequeue \\((2,2)\\): No update needed.\n  - Dequeue \\((2,0)\\): No update needed.\n  - Dequeue \\((2,1)\\): No update needed.\n\n- Final output matrix:\n  ```\n  0 0 1\n  1 1 0\n  2 2 1\n  ```\n\nThe final answer is the output matrix:\n\n<<<\n0 0 1\n1 1 0\n2 2 1\n>>>"
