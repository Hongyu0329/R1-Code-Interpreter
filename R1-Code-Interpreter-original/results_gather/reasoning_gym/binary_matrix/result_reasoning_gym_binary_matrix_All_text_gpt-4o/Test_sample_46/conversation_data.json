    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 6x6 square matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size (6x6) initialized with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent the initial distances.\n\n3. **First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right)**:\n   - Traverse the matrix from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.\n   - If a cell contains a 0, set the corresponding cell in the output matrix to 0.\n   - For each cell containing a 1, update its distance based on the minimum distance from its top or left neighbor plus one.\n\n4. **Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left)**:\n   - Traverse the matrix from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner.\n   - For each cell containing a 1, update its distance based on the minimum distance from its bottom or right neighbor plus one.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: After both passes, the output matrix will contain the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n### First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right):\n- Start with the first row and first column, updating distances based on the presence of 0s and the minimum distance from top or left neighbors.\n\n### Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left):\n- Start with the last row and last column, updating distances based on the minimum distance from bottom or right neighbors.\n\nAfter performing these steps, the output matrix will be:\n\n```\n2 1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2 1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1>>>"
