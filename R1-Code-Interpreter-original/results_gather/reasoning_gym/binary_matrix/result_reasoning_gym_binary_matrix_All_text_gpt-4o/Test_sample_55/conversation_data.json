    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Positions of Zeros:**\n   - First, we need to identify all the positions in the matrix that contain a 0. These will be our starting points for calculating distances.\n\n2. **Initialize the Distance Matrix:**\n   - Create a distance matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, we assume all cells are far from a 0.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - For each 0 in the matrix, set its corresponding position in the distance matrix to 0 and add its position to the queue.\n\n4. **Process the Queue:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element, which gives the current cell position.\n   - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), calculate the new position.\n   - If the new position is within bounds and the distance at the new position can be minimized (i.e., the current distance + 1 is less than the distance currently recorded in the distance matrix), update the distance and enqueue the new position.\n\n5. **Output the Distance Matrix:**\n   - After processing all cells, the distance matrix will contain the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1\n```\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify positions of 0s: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2).\n- **Step 2:** Initialize the distance matrix with infinity, except for the positions of 0s which are initialized to 0.\n- **Step 3 & 4:** Perform BFS from all 0s, updating distances.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the distance matrix will be:\n\n```\n2 2 3 4 5\n1 1 2 3 4\n0 0 1 2 3\n1 0 0 1 2\n2 1 0 1 2\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n2 2 3 4 5\n1 1 2 3 4\n0 0 1 2 3\n1 0 0 1 2\n2 1 0 1 2\n>>>"
