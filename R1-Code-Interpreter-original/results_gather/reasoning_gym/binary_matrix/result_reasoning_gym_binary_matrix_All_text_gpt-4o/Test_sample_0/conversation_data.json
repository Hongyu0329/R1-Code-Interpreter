    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0\n```\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify all the 0s in the matrix:**\n   - The positions of 0s are: (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,2), (3,3).\n\n2. **Initialize a result matrix with the same dimensions, filled with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances:**\n\n   ```\n   inf inf inf inf\n   inf inf inf inf\n   inf inf inf inf\n   inf inf inf inf\n   ```\n\n3. **Set the distance to 0 for all cells that contain a 0:**\n\n   ```\n   inf 0 0 inf\n   0 inf 0 inf\n   inf inf 0 inf\n   inf inf inf 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Calculate the Manhattan distance for each cell to the nearest 0:**\n\n   - **First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right):**\n     - For each cell, check the top and left neighbors to update the distance.\n\n   - **Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left):**\n     - For each cell, check the bottom and right neighbors to update the distance.\n\n5. **First Pass Calculation:**\n\n   - (0,0): min(inf, 1+0) = 1\n   - (0,3): min(inf, 1+0) = 1\n   - (1,1): min(inf, 1+0, 1+0) = 1\n   - (1,3): min(inf, 1+0) = 1\n   - (2,0): min(inf, 1+0) = 1\n   - (2,1): min(inf, 1+0) = 1\n   - (3,0): min(inf, 1+1) = 2\n   - (3,1): min(inf, 1+1) = 2\n   - (3,2): min(inf, 1+0) = 1\n\n   Result after first pass:\n\n   ```\n   1 0 0 1\n   0 1 0 1\n   1 1 0 1\n   2 2 1 0\n   ```\n\n6. **Second Pass Calculation:**\n\n   - (2,3): min(1, 1+0) = 1\n   - (2,1): min(1, 1+0) = 1\n   - (2,0): min(1, 1+1) = 1\n   - (1,3): min(1, 1+0) = 1\n   - (1,1): min(1, 1+0) = 1\n   - (0,3): min(1, 1+0) = 1\n   - (0,0): min(1, 1+0) = 1\n\n   Result after second pass:\n\n   ```\n   1 0 0 1\n   0 1 0 1\n   1 1 0 1\n   2 2 1 0\n   ```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n<<<\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1\n2 2 1 0\n>>>"
