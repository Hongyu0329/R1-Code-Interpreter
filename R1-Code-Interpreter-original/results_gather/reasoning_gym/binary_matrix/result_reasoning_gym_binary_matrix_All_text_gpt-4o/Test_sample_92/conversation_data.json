    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify all the 0s in the matrix**: We need to know the positions of all the 0s because these are the target points from which we will calculate the distance for each cell.\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix**: Create a matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent the initial distance to the nearest 0.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) from all 0s**: \n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because it allows us to explore all possible paths from the 0s to other cells in increasing order of distance.\n   - For each 0, set its distance to 0 in the output matrix and add its position to the queue.\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element, and for each of its 4 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right), calculate the distance from the current cell.\n   - If the calculated distance is less than the current value in the output matrix for that neighbor, update the output matrix and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n4. **Iterate until all cells are processed**: Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed and the shortest distance to a 0 has been found for each cell.\n\n5. **Output the result**: Once the BFS is complete, the output matrix will contain the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n0 0 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the output matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n0 0 1 0 0 1 2\n1 1 1 0 0 1 2\n2 1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 0 1 1 2\n2 1 1 1 2 2 3\n2 1 0 0 1 2 3\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n0 0 1 0 0 1 2\n1 1 1 0 0 1 2\n2 1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 0 1 1 2\n2 1 1 1 2 2 3\n2 1 0 0 1 2 3\n>>>"
