    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Positions of Zeros**: First, we need to identify all the positions in the matrix where the value is 0. These positions will be our starting points for calculating distances.\n\n2. **Initialize the Distance Matrix**: Create a matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, all distances are unknown.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all the zero positions simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n4. **Update Distances**: For each zero position, set its distance to 0 in the distance matrix. Then, for each cell, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If the distance to a neighbor can be minimized (i.e., the current cell's distance + 1 is less than the neighbor's current distance), update the neighbor's distance and add it to the queue for further exploration.\n\n5. **Iterate Until Completion**: Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed and the shortest distance to a zero has been found for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify zero positions: (0,6), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,5), (6,7), (7,1), (7,3).\n\n- **Step 2**: Initialize the distance matrix with infinity, except for the zero positions which are set to 0.\n\n- **Step 3 & 4**: Perform BFS from all zero positions, updating distances.\n\nAfter performing these steps, the resulting distance matrix is:\n\n```\n2 1 2 3 4 3 0 1\n0 0 1 2 3 2 1 2\n0 1 0 1 2 3 2 3\n1 0 1 2 2 0 1 2\n2 1 2 3 3 1 2 3\n3 2 3 4 4 2 3 4\n4 3 4 5 5 3 2 1\n1 0 1 0 1 2 3 2\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n2 1 2 3 4 3 0 1\n0 0 1 2 3 2 1 2\n0 1 0 1 2 3 2 3\n1 0 1 2 2 0 1 2\n2 1 2 3 3 1 2 3\n3 2 3 4 4 2 3 4\n4 3 4 5 5 3 2 1\n1 0 1 0 1 2 3 2\n>>>"
