    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given matrix. The matrix is square, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, we assume all cells are far from a 0.\n   - Identify all the cells in the matrix that contain a 0. These will be our starting points for calculating distances.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**:\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - Enqueue all positions of 0s with a distance of 0, as they are already at the nearest 0.\n   - For each cell dequeued, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If moving to a neighbor results in a shorter distance than currently recorded in the output matrix, update the distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n4. **Iterate Until Completion**:\n   - Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed. This ensures that each cell in the matrix has the shortest distance to a 0.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - After processing all cells, the output matrix will contain the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n```\n\nAfter applying the BFS approach, the output matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n4 3 2 1 0 1 1 1 0 0\n3 2 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1 2 1 1 2\n0 0 1 0 1 2 1 0 1 2\n1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 0 1\n2 2 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 2\n2 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 2\n1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 2 2 1 1 0 0 0\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n4 3 2 1 0 1 1 1 0 0\n3 2 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1 2 1 1 2\n0 0 1 0 1 2 1 0 1 2\n1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 0 1\n2 2 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 2\n2 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 2\n1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 2 2 1 1 0 0 0\n>>>"
