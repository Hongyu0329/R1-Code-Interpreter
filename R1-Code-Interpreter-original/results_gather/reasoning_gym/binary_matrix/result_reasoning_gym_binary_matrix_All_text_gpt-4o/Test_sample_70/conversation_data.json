    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 5x5 square matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size (5x5) initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances.\n\n3. **Locate All Zeros**: Identify the positions of all zeros in the matrix. These positions will be the starting points for calculating distances.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all zero positions simultaneously. This is efficient for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n5. **Queue Initialization**: Initialize a queue with all zero positions and set their corresponding positions in the output matrix to 0, as the distance from a zero to itself is zero.\n\n6. **BFS Execution**:\n   - Dequeue a position from the queue.\n   - For each of its four possible neighbors (up, down, left, right), calculate the potential new distance as the current cell's distance plus one.\n   - If this new distance is less than the current recorded distance in the output matrix for that neighbor, update the neighbor's distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n7. **Repeat Until Queue is Empty**: Continue the BFS process until all positions have been processed and the queue is empty.\n\n8. **Output the Result**: The output matrix now contains the Manhattan distances to the nearest zero for each cell.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n**Given Matrix**:\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step BFS Execution**:\n\n- **Initial Queue**: Positions of zeros: \\((0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)\\).\n\n- **Initial Output Matrix**:\n  ```\n  ∞ ∞ 0 0 0\n  ∞ ∞ 0 ∞ ∞\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n  ∞ ∞ 0 0 ∞\n  ```\n\n- **BFS Iterations**:\n  - Process each zero position and update neighbors.\n  - Continue updating distances and enqueueing neighbors until the queue is empty.\n\n**Final Output Matrix**:\n```\n2 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1 1\n2 2 1 2 2\n3 3 2 3 3\n2 1 0 0 1\n```\n\nThus, the matrix of distances to the nearest zero for each cell is:\n\n<<<\n2 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1 1\n2 2 1 2 2\n3 3 2 3 3\n2 1 0 0 1\n>>>"
