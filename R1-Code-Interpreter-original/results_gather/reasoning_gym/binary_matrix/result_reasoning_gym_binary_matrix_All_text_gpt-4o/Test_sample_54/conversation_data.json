    "To solve the problem of finding the taxicab (Manhattan) distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given square matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a square matrix, and for each cell in this matrix, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\n2. **Input Matrix**: The input matrix is:\n   ```\n   1 1 1\n   1 0 1\n   1 1 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Output Matrix**: We need to create an output matrix of the same size, where each cell contains the distance to the nearest 0.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach starting from all the 0s in the matrix. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - Initialize a queue with all the positions of 0s in the matrix and set their distances to 0 in the output matrix.\n   - For each cell in the queue, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor has not been visited (or if the current calculated distance is less than the previously recorded distance), update its distance and add it to the queue.\n   - Continue this process until all cells have been processed.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Execution**:\n   - Initialize the output matrix with a large number (infinity) to represent unvisited cells.\n   - Start with the cell containing 0 at position (1, 1). Set its distance to 0.\n   - Add (1, 1) to the queue.\n   - Process the queue:\n     - Dequeue (1, 1), check its neighbors:\n       - (0, 1): Update distance to 1, add to queue.\n       - (2, 1): Update distance to 1, add to queue.\n       - (1, 0): Update distance to 1, add to queue.\n       - (1, 2): Update distance to 1, add to queue.\n     - Dequeue (0, 1), check its neighbors:\n       - (0, 0): Update distance to 2, add to queue.\n       - (0, 2): Update distance to 2, add to queue.\n     - Dequeue (2, 1), check its neighbors:\n       - (2, 0): Update distance to 2, add to queue.\n       - (2, 2): Update distance to 2, add to queue.\n     - Dequeue (1, 0), check its neighbors:\n       - Already visited or updated.\n     - Dequeue (1, 2), check its neighbors:\n       - Already visited or updated.\n     - Continue processing until the queue is empty.\n\n6. **Final Output Matrix**:\n   After processing all cells, the output matrix with the distances to the nearest 0 is:\n   ```\n   2 1 2\n   1 0 1\n   2 1 2\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2 1 2\n1 0 1\n2 1 2>>>"
