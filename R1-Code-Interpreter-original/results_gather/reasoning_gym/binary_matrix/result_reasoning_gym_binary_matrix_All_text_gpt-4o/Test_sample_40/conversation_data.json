    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 0\n```\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of all 0s in the matrix:**\n   - (0, 2)\n   - (1, 0)\n   - (1, 1)\n   - (3, 1)\n   - (3, 2)\n   - (3, 3)\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix with a large number (e.g., infinity) for each cell, except for cells that already contain a 0, which should be initialized to 0.**\n\n3. **First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right):**\n   - For each cell, calculate the minimum distance to a 0 by considering the top and left neighbors.\n   - Update the distance for each cell based on the minimum distance found.\n\n4. **Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left):**\n   - For each cell, calculate the minimum distance to a 0 by considering the bottom and right neighbors.\n   - Update the distance for each cell based on the minimum distance found.\n\n### Detailed Calculation:\n\n**First Pass:**\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and move to the bottom-right corner.\n- Update distances based on top and left neighbors.\n\n```\nInitial matrix with distances:\ninf inf 0 inf\n0 0 inf inf\ninf inf inf inf\ninf 0 0 0\n\nAfter first pass:\n2 1 0 1\n0 0 1 2\n1 1 2 3\n1 0 0 0\n```\n\n**Second Pass:**\n\n- Start from the bottom-right corner and move to the top-left corner.\n- Update distances based on bottom and right neighbors.\n\n```\nAfter second pass:\n1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 2\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 0\n```\n\n### Final Output Matrix:\n\nThe final matrix, where each cell contains the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0, is:\n\n```\n1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 2\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 0\n```\n\nThus, the output matrix is:\n\n<<<1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 2\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 0>>>"
