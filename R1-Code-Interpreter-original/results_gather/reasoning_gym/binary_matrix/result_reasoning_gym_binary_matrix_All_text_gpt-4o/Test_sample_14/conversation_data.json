    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n```\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of all 0s in the matrix:**\n   - (0, 2), (0, 3)\n   - (1, 0), (1, 1)\n   - (2, 0)\n\n2. **Initialize a result matrix with the same dimensions, filled with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances:**\n\n   ```\n   inf inf inf inf\n   inf inf inf inf\n   inf inf inf inf\n   inf inf inf inf\n   ```\n\n3. **Set the distance to 0 for all cells that contain a 0:**\n\n   ```\n   inf inf 0 0\n   0 0 inf inf\n   0 inf inf inf\n   inf inf inf inf\n   ```\n\n4. **Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach starting from all 0s simultaneously to calculate the minimum distance for each cell:**\n\n   - **First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right):**\n     - For each cell, update its distance based on its top and left neighbors.\n     - If a neighbor has a smaller distance + 1, update the current cell's distance.\n\n   - **Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left):**\n     - For each cell, update its distance based on its bottom and right neighbors.\n     - If a neighbor has a smaller distance + 1, update the current cell's distance.\n\n5. **Calculate the distances:**\n\n   - **First Pass:**\n\n     ```\n     inf inf 0 0\n     0 0 inf inf\n     0 inf inf inf\n     inf inf inf inf\n     ```\n\n     - Update (0, 0): min(inf, 1 + 0) = 1\n     - Update (0, 1): min(inf, 1 + 0) = 1\n     - Update (1, 2): min(inf, 1 + 0) = 1\n     - Update (1, 3): min(inf, 1 + 0) = 1\n     - Update (2, 1): min(inf, 1 + 0) = 1\n     - Update (2, 2): min(inf, 1 + 1) = 2\n     - Update (2, 3): min(inf, 1 + 1) = 2\n     - Update (3, 0): min(inf, 1 + 0) = 1\n     - Update (3, 1): min(inf, 1 + 1) = 2\n     - Update (3, 2): min(inf, 1 + 2) = 3\n     - Update (3, 3): min(inf, 1 + 2) = 3\n\n     Result after first pass:\n\n     ```\n     1 1 0 0\n     0 0 1 1\n     0 1 2 2\n     1 2 3 3\n     ```\n\n   - **Second Pass:**\n\n     - Update (3, 2): min(3, 1 + 2) = 3\n     - Update (3, 1): min(2, 1 + 3) = 2\n     - Update (3, 0): min(1, 1 + 2) = 1\n     - Update (2, 3): min(2, 1 + 3) = 2\n     - Update (2, 2): min(2, 1 + 2) = 2\n     - Update (2, 1): min(1, 1 + 2) = 1\n     - Update (2, 0): min(0, 1 + 1) = 0\n     - Update (1, 3): min(1, 1 + 2) = 1\n     - Update (1, 2): min(1, 1 + 1) = 1\n     - Update (1, 1): min(0, 1 + 1) = 0\n     - Update (1, 0): min(0, 1 + 0) = 0\n     - Update (0, 3): min(0, 1 + 1) = 0\n     - Update (0, 2): min(0, 1 + 0) = 0\n     - Update (0, 1): min(1, 1 + 0) = 1\n     - Update (0, 0): min(1, 1 + 1) = 1\n\n     Final result after second pass:\n\n     ```\n     1 1 0 0\n     0 0 1 1\n     0 1 2 2\n     1 2 3 3\n     ```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n<<<\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 2 2\n1 2 3 3\n>>>"
