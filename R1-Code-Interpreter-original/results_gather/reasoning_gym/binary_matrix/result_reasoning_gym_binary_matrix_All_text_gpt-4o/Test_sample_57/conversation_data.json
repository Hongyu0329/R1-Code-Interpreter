    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 4x4 square matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size (4x4) initialized with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent initially unknown distances.\n\n3. **First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right)**:\n   - Traverse the matrix from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.\n   - If a cell contains a 0, set the corresponding cell in the output matrix to 0.\n   - For each cell containing a 1, calculate the minimum distance to a 0 by checking the top and left neighbors (if they exist) and adding 1 to the minimum of these distances.\n\n4. **Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left)**:\n   - Traverse the matrix from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner.\n   - For each cell containing a 1, update the distance by checking the bottom and right neighbors (if they exist) and adding 1 to the minimum of these distances.\n\n5. **Construct the Final Output Matrix**: After completing both passes, the output matrix will contain the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n**Given Matrix**:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\n**First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right)**:\n- Start with an output matrix initialized to infinity:\n  ```\n  ∞ ∞ 0 0\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n  ∞ ∞ 0 ∞\n  ∞ 0 0 ∞\n  ```\n- Update distances based on top and left neighbors:\n  ```\n  2 1 0 0\n  3 2 1 1\n  2 1 0 1\n  1 0 0 1\n  ```\n\n**Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left)**:\n- Update distances based on bottom and right neighbors:\n  ```\n  2 1 0 0\n  2 1 1 1\n  1 1 0 1\n  1 0 0 1\n  ```\n\nThe final output matrix, representing the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell, is:\n\n<<<2 1 0 0\n2 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1>>>"
