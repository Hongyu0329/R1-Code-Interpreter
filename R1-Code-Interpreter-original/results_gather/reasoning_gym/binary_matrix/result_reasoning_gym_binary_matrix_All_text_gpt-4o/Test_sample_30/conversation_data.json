    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 5x5 square matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size (5x5) initialized with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent the initial distances.\n\n3. **First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right)**:\n   - Traverse the matrix from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.\n   - If a cell contains a 0, set the corresponding cell in the output matrix to 0.\n   - For each cell containing a 1, calculate the minimum distance to a 0 by considering the top and left neighbors (if they exist) and adding 1 to their distance values.\n\n4. **Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left)**:\n   - Traverse the matrix from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner.\n   - For each cell containing a 1, update the distance by considering the bottom and right neighbors (if they exist) and adding 1 to their distance values.\n   - This ensures that all possible paths to the nearest 0 are considered.\n\n5. **Construct the Final Output Matrix**: After completing both passes, the output matrix will contain the minimum Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n### Given Matrix:\n```\n1 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n**First Pass (Top-Left to Bottom-Right):**\n- Initialize the output matrix with infinity, except for cells with 0, which are set to 0.\n- Traverse the matrix and update distances based on top and left neighbors.\n\n**Second Pass (Bottom-Right to Top-Left):**\n- Traverse the matrix and update distances based on bottom and right neighbors.\n\n### Final Output Matrix:\nAfter performing the above steps, the final output matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n2 1 0 1 2\n1 0 0 1 2\n1 1 1 1 2\n0 0 0 1 2\n1 0 0 1 2\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n2 1 0 1 2\n1 0 0 1 2\n1 1 1 1 2\n0 0 0 1 2\n1 0 0 1 2\n>>>"
