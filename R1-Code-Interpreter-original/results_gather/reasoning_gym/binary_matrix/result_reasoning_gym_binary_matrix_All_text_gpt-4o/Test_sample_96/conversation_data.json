    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of all zeros in the matrix.**  \n   We need to know where all the zeros are located so that we can calculate the distance from each cell to the nearest zero.\n\n2. **Initialize the output matrix.**  \n   Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent that initially, the distance to a zero is unknown.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) from each zero.**  \n   Use a BFS approach starting from each zero. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time we reach a cell, it is via the shortest path.\n\n4. **Update distances in the output matrix.**  \n   As we perform the BFS, update the distance in the output matrix for each cell. If a cell is reached with a shorter distance than previously recorded, update it.\n\n5. **Iterate over all cells.**  \n   For each cell in the matrix, if it contains a 0, its distance is 0. Otherwise, it will have been updated during the BFS.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify zeros:\n  - Positions of zeros: (1,5), (2,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,5), (5,0)\n\n- **Step 2:** Initialize the output matrix with infinity, except for the positions of zeros which are initialized to 0.\n\n- **Step 3 & 4:** Perform BFS from each zero and update distances.\n\n- **Step 5:** Finalize the output matrix.\n\nAfter performing these steps, the output matrix with the Manhattan distances to the nearest zero for each cell is:\n\n```\n3 2 2 1 1 0\n2 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 1 1 2\n0 1 2 2 1 2\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n3 2 2 1 1 0\n2 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 1 1 2\n0 1 2 2 1 2\n>>>"
