    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a given matrix.\n\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 9x9, as there are 9 rows and 9 columns.\n\n3. **Initial Setup**: Create an output matrix of the same size, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent that initially, we assume the distance to the nearest 0 is very large.\n\n4. **Locate Zeros**: Identify all the positions in the matrix where there is a 0. These positions will be the starting points for our distance calculations.\n\n5. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**:\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all the 0s simultaneously. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - Initialize the queue with all positions of 0s and set their corresponding positions in the output matrix to 0 (since the distance to themselves is 0).\n\n6. **BFS Execution**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element (current position).\n   - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), calculate the new position.\n   - If the new position is within bounds and the current calculated distance is less than the previously recorded distance in the output matrix, update the distance and enqueue the new position.\n\n7. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that while calculating new positions, they remain within the matrix boundaries.\n\n8. **Final Output**: Once the BFS completes, the output matrix will contain the minimum distances to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1\n```\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the output matrix with the distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n4 3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 2 1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 0\n1 2 3 2 2 2 0 1 1\n2 3 2 1 2 1 1 0 1\n3 2 2 2 1 2 1 1 0\n4 3 2 1 0 0 0 1 0\n3 2 1 0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n4 3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 2 1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 0\n1 2 3 2 2 2 0 1 1\n2 3 2 1 2 1 1 0 1\n3 2 2 2 1 2 1 1 0\n4 3 2 1 0 0 0 1 0\n3 2 1 0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1\n>>>"
