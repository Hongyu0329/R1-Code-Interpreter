    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of all 0s in the matrix.**  \n   We need to know where all the 0s are located so we can calculate the distance from each cell to the nearest 0.\n\n2. **Initialize a distance matrix.**  \n   Create a matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent the initial distance to a 0 for each cell.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) from each 0.**  \n   Use a BFS approach starting from each 0 to update the distance matrix. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n4. **Update the distance matrix.**  \n   For each cell, update its distance to the nearest 0 by checking its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If moving to a neighbor results in a smaller distance, update the neighbor's distance and continue the BFS from there.\n\n5. **Output the final distance matrix.**  \n   After processing all cells, the distance matrix will contain the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1\n```\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify positions of 0s:  \n  - (0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (5, 2)\n\n- **Step 2:** Initialize the distance matrix with infinity, except for the positions of 0s which are initialized to 0.\n\n- **Step 3 & 4:** Perform BFS from each 0, updating the distance matrix.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the distance matrix will be:\n\n```\n1 0 1 1 2 3\n2 1 1 0 1 2\n3 2 1 0 1 2\n4 3 2 1 2 3\n5 4 1 2 3 4\n4 3 0 1 2 3\n```\n\n- **Step 5:** Output the final distance matrix.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<\n1 0 1 1 2 3\n2 1 1 0 1 2\n3 2 1 0 1 2\n4 3 2 1 2 3\n5 4 1 2 3 4\n4 3 0 1 2 3\n>>>"
