    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 6x6 square matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size (6x6) initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent initially unknown distances.\n\n3. **Locate All Zeros**: Identify the positions of all the zeros in the matrix. These will be our starting points for calculating distances.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all zero positions simultaneously. This is efficient for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n5. **Update Distances**: For each zero, initialize its distance to 0 in the output matrix. Then, for each cell, update its distance based on its neighbors. If moving to a neighboring cell results in a shorter distance than previously recorded, update the distance and continue the BFS from that cell.\n\n6. **Iterate Until Completion**: Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed and no further updates are possible.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once all cells have been processed, the output matrix will contain the Manhattan distances to the nearest zero for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n- **Matrix**:\n  ```\n  1 1 0 1 1 1\n  1 1 1 1 1 1\n  0 0 1 0 1 1\n  1 1 1 1 0 0\n  0 1 1 0 1 0\n  1 1 1 1 1 0\n  ```\n\n- **Output Matrix Initialization**:\n  ```\n  ∞ ∞ 0 ∞ ∞ ∞\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞\n  0 0 ∞ 0 ∞ ∞\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ 0 0\n  0 ∞ ∞ 0 ∞ 0\n  ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ 0\n  ```\n\n- **BFS Processing**:\n  - Start from all zero positions: (0,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,0), (4,3), (4,5), (5,5).\n  - Update distances for each cell by exploring neighbors and updating if a shorter path is found.\n\n- **Final Output Matrix**:\n  ```\n  2 1 0 1 2 2\n  1 1 1 1 1 1\n  0 0 1 0 1 1\n  1 1 1 1 0 0\n  0 1 1 0 1 0\n  1 2 2 1 1 0\n  ```\n\nThus, the final output matrix, representing the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell, is:\n\n<<<\n2 1 0 1 2 2\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 2 2 1 1 0\n>>>"
