    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We have a square matrix where each cell contains either a 0 or a 1. We need to find the distance from each cell to the nearest 0.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Create a result matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances.\n   - Use a queue to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from all the 0s in the matrix.\n\n3. **BFS Initialization**:\n   - Enqueue all positions of 0s in the matrix into the queue and set their corresponding positions in the result matrix to 0, as the distance from a 0 to itself is 0.\n\n4. **BFS Execution**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element which gives the current position.\n   - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), calculate the new position.\n   - If the new position is within bounds and the current calculated distance is less than the previously recorded distance in the result matrix, update the result matrix with the new distance and enqueue the new position.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - After the BFS completes, the result matrix will contain the minimum distances from each cell to the nearest 0.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n- Start by identifying all the 0s and initializing the queue with their positions: \n  - (0,0), (0,2), (0,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,0), (4,5), (5,6), (6,1), (6,6).\n\n- Perform BFS from these positions, updating the result matrix with the minimum distances.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the resulting matrix with the distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n0 1 0 1 2 1 0\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1\n2 3 2 2 1 2 1\n3 2 2 1 0 1 0\n0 1 2 2 1 0 1\n1 2 3 3 2 1 0\n1 0 1 2 2 1 0\n```\n\nThus, the final output matrix is:\n\n<<<\n0 1 0 1 2 1 0\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1\n2 3 2 2 1 2 1\n3 2 2 1 0 1 0\n0 1 2 2 1 0 1\n1 2 3 3 2 1 0\n1 0 1 2 2 1 0\n>>>"
