    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 5x5 square matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize the Output Matrix**: Create an output matrix of the same size (5x5) initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent initially unknown distances.\n\n3. **Locate All Zeros**: Identify the positions of all the zeros in the matrix. These positions will be the starting points for calculating distances.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Use a BFS approach starting from all zero positions simultaneously. This is efficient for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n5. **Queue Initialization**: Initialize a queue with all the positions of zeros. Set the distance for these positions to 0 in the output matrix since the distance from a zero to itself is zero.\n\n6. **BFS Execution**:\n   - Dequeue a position from the queue.\n   - For each of its four possible neighbors (up, down, left, right), calculate the potential new distance as the current cell's distance plus one.\n   - If this new distance is less than the current recorded distance in the output matrix for that neighbor, update the neighbor's distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n7. **Repeat**: Continue the BFS until the queue is empty, ensuring all cells have been processed.\n\n8. **Output the Result**: Once the BFS completes, the output matrix will contain the minimum distances to the nearest zero for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\nInput Matrix:\n1 1 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n- Start with the positions of zeros: (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,4).\n- Initialize the output matrix with infinity, except for the positions of zeros which are set to 0.\n- Perform BFS from all zero positions.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the output matrix with the distances to the nearest zero for each cell is:\n\n```\n2 1 0 1 2\n0 0 1 1 2\n1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0\n2 2 1 1 0\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n2 1 0 1 2\n0 0 1 1 2\n1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0\n2 2 1 1 0\n>>>"
