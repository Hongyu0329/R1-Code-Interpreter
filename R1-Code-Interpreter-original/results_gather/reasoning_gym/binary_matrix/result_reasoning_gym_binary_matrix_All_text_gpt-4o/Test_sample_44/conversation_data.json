    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of how to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in the matrix. The matrix is 8x8, and we need to output another 8x8 matrix with the calculated distances.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (infinity) to represent uncalculated distances.\n   - Use a queue to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from all the 0s in the matrix.\n\n3. **BFS Initialization**:\n   - Enqueue all positions of 0s in the matrix into the queue and set their corresponding positions in the output matrix to 0, as the distance from a 0 to itself is 0.\n\n4. **BFS Execution**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element which gives the current position.\n   - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), calculate the new position.\n   - If the new position is within bounds and the current calculated distance is greater than the distance from the current position plus one, update the distance and enqueue the new position.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - After the BFS completes, the output matrix will contain the minimum distances from each cell to the nearest 0.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given matrix:\n\n```\n0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1\n```\n\nAfter performing the BFS as described, the output matrix with the distances to the nearest 0 for each cell is:\n\n```\n0 1 1 1 0 0 1 2\n1 0 0 1 1 1 2 1\n2 1 1 2 2 2 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1 2 2 1\n0 1 0 1 2 2 3 2\n0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 2 1 0 0 0 1 1\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n0 1 1 1 0 0 1 2\n1 0 0 1 1 1 2 1\n2 1 1 2 2 2 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1 2 2 1\n0 1 0 1 2 2 3 2\n0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 2 1 0 0 0 1 1\n>>>"
