    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Initialize the Output Matrix:**\n   - Create an output matrix of the same size as the input matrix, initialized with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent that initially, the distance to the nearest 0 is unknown.\n\n2. **Identify All Zero Cells:**\n   - Traverse the input matrix and identify all cells that contain a 0. These cells will be the starting points for our distance calculations.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Use a queue to perform a BFS starting from all zero cells simultaneously. This approach ensures that we explore all cells layer by layer, updating the distance to the nearest 0 as we go.\n   - For each cell containing a 0, set its distance to 0 in the output matrix and add it to the queue.\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue a cell \\((i, j)\\).\n     - For each of its four neighbors (up, down, left, right), calculate the potential new distance as the current cell's distance plus 1.\n     - If this new distance is less than the current recorded distance in the output matrix for the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n4. **Output the Result:**\n   - After processing all cells, the output matrix will contain the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given matrix:\n\n```\n1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 1\n```\n\n- Start by identifying all zero cells: (0,1), (1,2), (2,0), (3,0), (3,2), (3,4), (4,1), (4,3).\n- Initialize the output matrix with infinity, except for the zero cells which are initialized to 0.\n- Perform BFS from all zero cells, updating distances for their neighbors.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the output matrix will be:\n\n```\n1 0 1 2 2\n1 1 0 1 2\n0 1 1 2 3\n0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 1\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n1 0 1 2 2\n1 1 0 1 2\n0 1 1 2 3\n0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 1\n>>>"
