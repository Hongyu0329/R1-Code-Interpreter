    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nThe most efficient way to solve this problem is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. We can start by initializing a queue with all the positions of 0s in the matrix. Then, we perform a BFS to update the distance for each cell based on its neighbors.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize a matrix `dist` of the same size as the input matrix, filled with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent unvisited cells.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue all positions of 0s in the matrix, setting their corresponding `dist` values to 0.\n3. Perform a BFS from each 0, updating the `dist` matrix with the minimum distance found for each cell.\n4. Return the `dist` matrix as the result.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    dist = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all 0 positions\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                dist[r][c] = 0\n                queue.append((r, c))\n\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # BFS to update distances\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if dist[nr][nc] > dist[r][c] + 1:\n                    dist[nr][nc] = dist[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return dist\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\ndistance_matrix = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\n\n# Print the result\nfor row in distance_matrix:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output matrix.",
