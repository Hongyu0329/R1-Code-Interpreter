    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n1 0 1\n1 1 1\n1 0 1\n```\n\nWe can approach this problem using a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy. The idea is to start from all the cells containing 0s and perform a multi-source BFS to fill in the distances for all other cells. This is efficient because BFS explores nodes layer by layer, ensuring that the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) is found first.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Initialize a distance matrix with infinity for all cells except those containing 0, which should be initialized to 0.\n2. Use a queue to perform BFS, starting with all the cells that contain 0.\n3. For each cell, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor can be updated with a shorter distance, update it and add it to the queue.\n4. Continue the process until all cells have been processed.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    distance = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all 0s and set their distance to 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                distance[r][c] = 0\n\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if distance[nr][nc] > distance[r][c] + 1:\n                    distance[nr][nc] = distance[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return distance\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\nresult = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output matrix.",

Now, let's provide the final answer based on the result obtained from the code execution.\n\nThe output matrix, which represents the taxicab (Manhattan) distance of the nearest 0 for each cell in the given input matrix, is:\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1]]>>>"
