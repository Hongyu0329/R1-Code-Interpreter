    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nThe most efficient way to solve this problem is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. We can start by initializing a queue with all the positions of 0s in the matrix. Then, we perform a multi-source BFS to calculate the minimum distance to a 0 for each cell.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize a queue with all positions of 0s in the matrix.\n2. Create a distance matrix initialized with infinity for all cells except those containing 0, which should be initialized to 0.\n3. Perform BFS from all 0s simultaneously, updating the distance for each cell as the minimum distance found so far.\n4. Return the distance matrix as the result.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    distance = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all 0 positions and set their distance to 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                distance[r][c] = 0\n\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if distance[nr][nc] > distance[r][c] + 1:\n                    distance[nr][nc] = distance[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return distance\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\ndistance_matrix = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\n\n# Print the result\nfor row in distance_matrix:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
