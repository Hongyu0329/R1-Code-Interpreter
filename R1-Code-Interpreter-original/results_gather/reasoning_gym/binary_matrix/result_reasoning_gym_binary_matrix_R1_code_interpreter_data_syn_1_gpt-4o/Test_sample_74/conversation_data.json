    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nThe approach to solve this problem efficiently is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from all the cells containing 0s. This is because BFS explores nodes layer by layer, which naturally gives us the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Initialize a matrix of the same size as the input matrix to store the distances, initially filled with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent unvisited cells.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue all positions of 0s in the matrix, setting their distance to 0 in the distance matrix.\n3. Perform BFS from these positions, updating the distance for each cell based on its neighbors.\n4. For each cell, if a shorter path to a 0 is found, update the distance and enqueue the cell.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    distances = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Enqueue all 0s and set their distance to 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                distances[r][c] = 0\n\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if distances[nr][nc] > distances[r][c] + 1:\n                    distances[nr][nc] = distances[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return distances\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Calculate distances\noutput_matrix = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nfor row in output_matrix:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the distance of each cell to the nearest 0 and print the resulting matrix. Let's execute it to get the final answer.",
