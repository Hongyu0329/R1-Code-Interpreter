    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nThe approach to solve this problem efficiently is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from all the cells containing 0s. This is because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which naturally gives us the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Initialize a matrix of the same size as the input matrix to store the distances, initially filled with a large number (infinity).\n2. Use a queue to perform BFS. Start by enqueuing all positions of 0s in the matrix and set their distances to 0.\n3. For each position dequeued, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor has not been visited (i.e., its distance is still infinity), update its distance and enqueue it.\n4. Continue the BFS until all positions have been processed.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    distances = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all 0 positions\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                distances[r][c] = 0\n\n    # Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and distances[nr][nc] == float('inf'):\n                distances[nr][nc] = distances[r][c] + 1\n                queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return distances\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distances\noutput_matrix = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\n\n# Print the output matrix\nprint(output_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the desired output matrix, which contains the Manhattan distances to the nearest 0 for each cell in the input matrix.",
