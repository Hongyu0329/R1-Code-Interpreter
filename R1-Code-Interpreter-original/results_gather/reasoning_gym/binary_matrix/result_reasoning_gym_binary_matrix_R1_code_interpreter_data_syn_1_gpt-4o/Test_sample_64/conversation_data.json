    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nThe most efficient way to solve this problem is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. We can start by initializing a queue with all the positions of 0s in the matrix. Then, we perform a BFS to update the distance for each cell based on its neighbors.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize a distance matrix with infinity for all cells except those containing 0, which should be initialized to 0.\n2. Use a queue to perform BFS, starting with all the positions of 0s.\n3. For each cell, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If the neighbor's distance can be minimized by passing through the current cell, update its distance and add it to the queue.\n4. Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    distance = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all 0 positions and set their distance to 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                distance[r][c] = 0\n\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if distance[nr][nc] > distance[r][c] + 1:\n                    distance[nr][nc] = distance[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return distance\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\nresult = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\n\n# Print the result\nfor row in result:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the distance matrix and print it. Let's execute it to get the final answer.",
