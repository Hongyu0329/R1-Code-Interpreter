    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nWe can approach this problem using a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy. The idea is to start from all the cells containing 0s and perform a multi-source BFS to calculate the minimum distance to a 0 for each cell.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Initialize a distance matrix with infinity for all cells except those containing 0, which should be initialized to 0.\n2. Use a queue to perform BFS, starting with all the 0 cells.\n3. For each cell, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) and update their distances if a shorter path is found.\n4. Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    distance = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all 0 cells and set their distance to 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                distance[r][c] = 0\n\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if distance[nr][nc] > distance[r][c] + 1:\n                    distance[nr][nc] = distance[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return distance\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\nresult = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
