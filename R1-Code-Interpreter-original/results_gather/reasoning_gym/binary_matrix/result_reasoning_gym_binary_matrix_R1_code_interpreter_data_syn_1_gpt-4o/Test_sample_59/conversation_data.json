    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nThe matrix given is:\n```\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1\n```\n\nTo efficiently compute the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. This approach involves the following steps:\n\n1. Initialize a distance matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix, filled with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent unvisited cells.\n2. Create a queue to perform BFS. Enqueue all cells containing 0 and set their distance to 0 in the distance matrix.\n3. Perform BFS from each 0, updating the distance for each cell based on its neighbors.\n4. For each cell, check its four possible neighbors (up, down, left, right). If moving to a neighbor results in a shorter distance, update the neighbor's distance and enqueue it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    distance = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all 0s and set their distance to 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                distance[r][c] = 0\n\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if distance[nr][nc] > distance[r][c] + 1:\n                    distance[nr][nc] = distance[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return distance\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\nresult = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
