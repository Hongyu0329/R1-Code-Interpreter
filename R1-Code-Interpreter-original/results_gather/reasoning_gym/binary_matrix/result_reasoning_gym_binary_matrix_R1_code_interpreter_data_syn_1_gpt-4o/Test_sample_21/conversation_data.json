    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nThe approach to solve this problem efficiently is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from all the cells containing 0s. This is because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which naturally gives us the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Initialize a matrix `dist` of the same size as the input matrix, filled with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent unvisited cells.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue all positions of 0s in the matrix, setting their corresponding `dist` values to 0.\n3. Perform BFS from these positions, updating the `dist` matrix with the shortest distance to a 0 for each cell.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    dist = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all 0 positions\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                dist[r][c] = 0\n                queue.append((r, c))\n\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # BFS to find the shortest path to a 0\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if dist[nr][nc] > dist[r][c] + 1:\n                    dist[nr][nc] = dist[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return dist\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\ndistance_matrix = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(distance_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the output matrix.",
