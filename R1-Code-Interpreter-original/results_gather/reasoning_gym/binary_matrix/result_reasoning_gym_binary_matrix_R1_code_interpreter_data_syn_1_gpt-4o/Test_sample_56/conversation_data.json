    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nThe approach to solve this problem efficiently is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from all the cells containing 0s. This is because BFS explores nodes layer by layer, which naturally gives us the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add all the positions of 0s in the matrix to it.\n2. Create a distance matrix initialized with a large number (infinity) for all cells except those containing 0, which should be initialized to 0.\n3. Perform BFS from all 0s simultaneously. For each cell, update the distance of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n4. Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    m = len(matrix[0])\n    distance = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all 0 positions and set their distance to 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if matrix[i][j] == 0:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n                distance[i][j] = 0\n\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # BFS\n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m:\n                if distance[nx][ny] > distance[x][y] + 1:\n                    distance[nx][ny] = distance[x][y] + 1\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n\n    return distance\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\nresult = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\n\n# Print the result\nfor row in result:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the distance matrix and print it.
