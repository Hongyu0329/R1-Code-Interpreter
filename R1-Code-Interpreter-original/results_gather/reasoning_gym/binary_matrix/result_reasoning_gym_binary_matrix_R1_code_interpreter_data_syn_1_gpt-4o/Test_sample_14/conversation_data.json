    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nThe matrix given is:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\nWe can approach this problem using a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from all the cells containing 0s. This is efficient because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" (distance) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which naturally gives us the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Initialize a result matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix, filled with a large number (infinity) to represent unvisited cells.\n2. Use a queue to perform BFS. Start by enqueuing all positions of 0s in the matrix and set their corresponding positions in the result matrix to 0.\n3. For each cell dequeued, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If moving to a neighbor results in a shorter distance than currently recorded in the result matrix, update the distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n4. Continue until the queue is empty.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    result = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all 0 positions\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                result[r][c] = 0\n\n    # Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if result[nr][nc] > result[r][c] + 1:\n                    result[nr][nc] = result[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return result\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\ndistance_matrix = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\nprint(distance_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we obtained the output matrix. The matrix represents the Manhattan distance from each cell to the nearest 0 in the input matrix.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 2 2\n1 2 3 3\n```\n\nThis matrix indicates the shortest distance from each cell to the nearest 0. For example, the cell at position (0,0) has a distance of 1 to the nearest 0, which is at position (0,2).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[[1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 3, 3]]>>>"
