    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nThe approach to solve this problem efficiently is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from all the cells containing 0s simultaneously. This is because BFS explores nodes layer by layer, which naturally gives us the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize a matrix `dist` of the same size as the input matrix, filled with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent unvisited cells.\n2. Create a queue and enqueue all positions of 0s in the matrix, setting their corresponding `dist` values to 0.\n3. Perform BFS from these 0s, updating the `dist` matrix with the shortest distance to a 0 for each cell.\n4. For each cell dequeued, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If moving to a neighbor results in a shorter distance than previously recorded, update the distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    dist = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all 0s positions\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                dist[r][c] = 0\n                queue.append((r, c))\n\n    # Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if dist[nr][nc] > dist[r][c] + 1:\n                    dist[nr][nc] = dist[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return dist\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\ndistance_matrix = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(distance_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output matrix.",
