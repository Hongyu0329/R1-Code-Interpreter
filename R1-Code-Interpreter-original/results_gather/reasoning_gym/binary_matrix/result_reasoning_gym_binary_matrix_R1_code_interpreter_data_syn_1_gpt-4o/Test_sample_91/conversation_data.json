    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 0\n```\n\nWe can approach this problem using a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy. The idea is to start from all the cells containing 0 and perform a multi-source BFS to calculate the minimum distance to each cell.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Initialize a distance matrix with infinity for all cells except those containing 0, which should be initialized to 0.\n2. Use a queue to perform BFS, starting from all cells containing 0.\n3. For each cell, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) and update their distances if a shorter path is found.\n4. Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    distance = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all 0 cells and set their distance to 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                distance[r][c] = 0\n\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if distance[nr][nc] > distance[r][c] + 1:\n                    distance[nr][nc] = distance[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return distance\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\nresult = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the distance of each cell to the nearest 0 using BFS, ensuring that the shortest path is found efficiently. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the expected output. The matrix provided in the problem is:\n\n```\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 0\n```\n\nThe output matrix, which represents the Manhattan distance of each cell to the nearest 0, is:\n\n```\n4 3 2\n3 2 1\n2 1 0\n```\n\nThis output makes sense because:\n- The cell at (2, 2) is 0, so its distance is 0.\n- The cell at (2, 1) is one step away from the nearest 0, so its distance is 1.\n- The cell at (2, 0) is two steps away from the nearest 0, so its distance is 2.\n- Similarly, the distances for the other cells are calculated based on their proximity to the nearest 0.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[4, 3, 2], [3, 2, 1], [2, 1, 0]]>>>"
