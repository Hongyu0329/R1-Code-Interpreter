    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nThe approach to solve this problem efficiently is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from all the cells containing 0s. This is because BFS explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which naturally gives us the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize a matrix `dist` of the same size as the input matrix, filled with a large number (infinity), which will store the minimum distance to a 0 for each cell.\n2. Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all positions of 0s in the matrix and set their corresponding distances in `dist` to 0.\n3. For each cell dequeued, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If moving to a neighbor results in a shorter distance than currently recorded in `dist`, update the distance and enqueue the neighbor.\n4. Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    dist = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all 0 positions\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                dist[r][c] = 0\n\n    # Directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if dist[nr][nc] > dist[r][c] + 1:\n                    dist[nr][nc] = dist[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return dist\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\ndistance_matrix = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\n\n# Print the result\nfor row in distance_matrix:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output matrix.",
