    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nThe matrix given is:\n```\n0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0 1\n```\n\nTo efficiently compute the distance for each cell, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. We start by initializing a distance matrix with infinity for all cells except those containing 0, which are initialized to 0. We then perform a BFS starting from all 0s simultaneously, updating the distance for each cell as we explore the matrix.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    distance = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all the positions of 0s\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                distance[r][c] = 0\n                queue.append((r, c))\n\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # BFS to update distances\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if distance[nr][nc] > distance[r][c] + 1:\n                    distance[nr][nc] = distance[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return distance\n\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n]\n\nresult = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\nfor row in result:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the distance matrix and print it. Let's execute it to get the result.",
