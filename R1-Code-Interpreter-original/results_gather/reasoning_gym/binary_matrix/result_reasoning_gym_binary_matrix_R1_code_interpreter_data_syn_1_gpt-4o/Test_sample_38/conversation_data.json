    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance from each cell in the matrix to the nearest cell containing a 0. The Manhattan distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\\).\n\nThe approach to solve this problem efficiently is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from all the cells containing 0s. This way, we can propagate the distance from 0s to other cells in increasing order of distance, ensuring that each cell is updated with the minimum possible distance to a 0.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Initialize a matrix of the same size as the input matrix to store the distances, initially filled with a large number (e.g., infinity) to represent unvisited cells.\n2. Use a queue to perform BFS. Start by enqueuing all cells that contain 0, and set their distance to 0 in the distance matrix.\n3. For each cell dequeued, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor has not been visited (i.e., its distance is still infinity), update its distance to the current cell's distance plus one, and enqueue the neighbor.\n4. Continue the BFS until all cells have been processed.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearest_zero_distance(matrix):\n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    distances = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all 0s and set their distance to 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] == 0:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n                distances[r][c] = 0\n\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                if distances[nr][nc] > distances[r][c] + 1:\n                    distances[nr][nc] = distances[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return distances\n\n# Input matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the distance matrix\ndistance_matrix = nearest_zero_distance(matrix)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(distance_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we obtained the output matrix. The matrix represents the Manhattan distance of each cell to the nearest 0 in the input matrix.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n[[1, 1, 0, 1],\n [0, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 0, 1, 0],\n [2, 1, 2, 1]]\n```\n\nThis matrix indicates the distance from each cell to the nearest 0. For example, the cell at position (0, 0) has a distance of 1 to the nearest 0, which is at position (0, 2).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[[1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2, 1]]>>>"
