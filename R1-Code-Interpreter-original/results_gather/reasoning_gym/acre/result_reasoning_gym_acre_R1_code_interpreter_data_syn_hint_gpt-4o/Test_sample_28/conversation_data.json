  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan rubber cylinder → off\npurple rubber sphere, cyan rubber cylinder → on\npurple rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber cube, red metal sphere → off\nbrown metal cylinder → on\nbrown metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"brown metal cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **cyan rubber cylinder → off**: The cyan rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n2. **purple rubber sphere, cyan rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the purple rubber sphere activates the detector, even with the cyan rubber cylinder.\n3. **purple rubber sphere → on**: The purple rubber sphere alone activates the detector.\n4. **gray rubber cube, red metal sphere → off**: Neither the gray rubber cube nor the red metal sphere activates the detector.\n5. **brown metal cylinder → on**: The brown metal cylinder alone activates the detector.\n6. **brown metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on**: The brown metal cylinder activates the detector, regardless of the presence of the red metal sphere.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that the brown metal cylinder is a blicket, as it consistently activates the detector in both scenarios where it is present.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case \"brown metal cylinder,\" the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
