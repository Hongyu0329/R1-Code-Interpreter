  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\ngray rubber cube → on\ngray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\nbrown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cube, green rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Brown Metal Cube:**\n   - Alone: off\n   - With Gray Rubber Cube: on\n   - With Green Rubber Cylinder: unknown\n\n2. **Gray Rubber Cube:**\n   - Alone: on\n   - With Brown Metal Cube: on\n\n3. **Blue Rubber Cylinder:**\n   - Alone: unknown\n   - With Blue Rubber Cube, Green Rubber Cylinder, Red Rubber Cube: off\n   - With Brown Rubber Cube: on\n\n4. **Blue Rubber Cube:**\n   - Alone: unknown\n   - With Blue Rubber Cylinder, Green Rubber Cylinder, Red Rubber Cube: off\n\n5. **Green Rubber Cylinder:**\n   - Alone: unknown\n   - With Blue Rubber Cube, Red Rubber Cube: off\n   - With Brown Metal Cube: unknown\n\n6. **Red Rubber Cube:**\n   - Alone: unknown\n   - With Blue Rubber Cylinder, Blue Rubber Cube, Green Rubber Cylinder: off\n\n7. **Brown Rubber Cube:**\n   - Alone: unknown\n   - With Blue Rubber Cylinder: on\n\nFrom the above observations, we can infer:\n- The Gray Rubber Cube seems to be a blicket since it turns the detector on both alone and with the Brown Metal Cube.\n- The Brown Metal Cube alone does not activate the detector.\n- The Green Rubber Cylinder, when combined with other objects, has not activated the detector.\n\nFor the new test case \"brown metal cube, green rubber cylinder\":\n- The Brown Metal Cube alone does not activate the detector.\n- The Green Rubber Cylinder, when combined with other objects, has not activated the detector.\n\nSince neither the Brown Metal Cube nor the Green Rubber Cylinder has been shown to activate the detector in previous experiments, it is reasonable to conclude that the combination of these two objects will not activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
