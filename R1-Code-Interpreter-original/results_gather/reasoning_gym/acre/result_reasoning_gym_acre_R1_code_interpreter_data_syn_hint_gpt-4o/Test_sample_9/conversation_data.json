  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cylinder → on\nblue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ncyan rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"cyan rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **gray rubber cylinder → off**: The gray rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n2. **blue metal cylinder → on**: The blue metal cylinder alone activates the detector.\n3. **blue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on**: The combination of blue metal cylinder and gray rubber cylinder activates the detector, indicating that the blue metal cylinder is likely the activating object.\n4. **cyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on**: This combination activates the detector, suggesting that either the cyan metal cube or the brown rubber cube is an activator.\n5. **brown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector, indicating that neither the brown rubber cube nor the cyan rubber cube is an activator.\n6. **cyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off**: This combination also does not activate the detector, reinforcing that neither the cyan rubber cube nor the brown rubber cube is an activator.\n\nFrom the above observations, we can conclude that the cyan rubber cube alone does not activate the detector, as it was part of combinations that resulted in the detector staying off.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case \"cyan rubber cube,\" the detector light status is off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
