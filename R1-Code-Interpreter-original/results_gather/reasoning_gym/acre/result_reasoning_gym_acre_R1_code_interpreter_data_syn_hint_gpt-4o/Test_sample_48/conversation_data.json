  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nred metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cube, red metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"green rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The \"cyan metal cylinder\" alone causes the detector to turn on.\n   - The \"yellow metal cube\" alone causes the detector to turn off.\n   - The combination of \"cyan metal cylinder\" and \"yellow metal cube\" causes the detector to turn on, suggesting that the \"cyan metal cylinder\" is a blicket.\n   - The \"red metal cylinder\" alone does not cause the detector to turn on, as seen in the combination with \"gray rubber cube\" and \"green rubber cube.\"\n   - The \"green metal cube\" in combination with \"red metal cylinder\" causes the detector to turn on, suggesting that the \"green metal cube\" might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Analyze the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case is \"green rubber cube.\"\n   - From the previous results, the \"green rubber cube\" was part of a combination that did not activate the detector (with \"red metal cylinder\" and \"gray rubber cube\").\n   - There is no evidence from the previous results that the \"green rubber cube\" alone can activate the detector.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the \"green rubber cube\" was part of a combination that did not activate the detector and there is no evidence suggesting it can activate the detector on its own, we can conclude that the detector will stay off for the new test case.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the \"green rubber cube\" is off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
