  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber sphere → off\nblue metal sphere, red rubber sphere → on\nblue metal sphere → on\nred metal sphere, brown rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, brown rubber sphere, red metal sphere → on\nyellow rubber sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nred metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red metal sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Red Rubber Sphere**: The detector is off.\n2. **Blue Metal Sphere, Red Rubber Sphere**: The detector is on.\n3. **Blue Metal Sphere**: The detector is on.\n4. **Red Metal Sphere, Brown Rubber Sphere**: The detector is off.\n5. **Gray Metal Sphere, Cyan Rubber Cube, Brown Rubber Sphere, Red Metal Sphere**: The detector is on.\n6. **Yellow Rubber Sphere**: The detector is on.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer the following:\n- The blue metal sphere seems to be a blicket since it causes the detector to turn on in both cases it appears.\n- The red rubber sphere alone does not activate the detector, but when combined with the blue metal sphere, the detector turns on, suggesting the blue metal sphere is the activating factor.\n- The red metal sphere alone does not activate the detector when combined with a brown rubber sphere, but it does activate the detector when combined with other objects in the fifth example.\n- The yellow rubber sphere is a blicket since it activates the detector on its own.\n\nFor the new test case \"red metal sphere\":\n- In the fourth example, the red metal sphere combined with a brown rubber sphere results in the detector being off. This suggests that the red metal sphere alone is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the detector light status for the new test case \"red metal sphere\" is off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
