  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\ngreen metal cylinder → on\nred metal sphere → off\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off\ngreen metal sphere → off\nyellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"green metal sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **green metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on**: This indicates that either the green metal cylinder or the red metal sphere (or both) can activate the detector.\n\n2. **green metal cylinder → on**: This confirms that the green metal cylinder alone can activate the detector.\n\n3. **red metal sphere → off**: This shows that the red metal sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n\n4. **yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off**: This suggests that neither the yellow metal sphere nor the green metal sphere can activate the detector when combined.\n\n5. **green metal sphere → off**: This directly indicates that the green metal sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n\n6. **yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on**: This suggests that at least one of these objects can activate the detector, but it doesn't provide information about the green metal sphere.\n\nFrom the above observations, we can conclude that the green metal sphere alone does not activate the detector, as evidenced by the result in point 5.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case \"green metal sphere,\" the detector light status is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
