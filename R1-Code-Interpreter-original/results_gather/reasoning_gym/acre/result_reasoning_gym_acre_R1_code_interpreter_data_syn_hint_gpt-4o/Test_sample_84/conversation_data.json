    "To determine whether the detector light will turn on or off for the new test case \"yellow rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - \"blue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\"\n   - \"purple rubber cube → off\"\n   - \"blue rubber cube → on\"\n   - \"blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off\"\n   - \"blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off\"\n   - \"yellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\"\n\n2. **Observations:**\n   - The \"blue rubber cube\" seems to be a blicket since it consistently causes the detector to turn on.\n   - The \"purple rubber cube\" alone does not activate the detector.\n   - The combination of \"yellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder\" results in the detector turning on, suggesting that one or more of these objects might be blickets.\n   - The \"yellow rubber cube\" appears in a combination that turns the detector on, but it is not clear if it is the sole cause.\n\n3. **New Test Case:**\n   - \"yellow rubber cube\" alone is being tested.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the \"yellow rubber cube\" was part of a combination that turned the detector on, it is possible that it is a blicket. However, without additional evidence showing that the \"yellow rubber cube\" alone can activate the detector, we cannot be certain.\n   - The evidence is insufficient to definitively conclude that the \"yellow rubber cube\" alone will activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow rubber cube\" is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
