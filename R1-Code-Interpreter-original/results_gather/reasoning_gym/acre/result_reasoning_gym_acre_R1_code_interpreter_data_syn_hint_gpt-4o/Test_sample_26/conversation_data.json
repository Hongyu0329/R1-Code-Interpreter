  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cube → off\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nyellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen metal cube, purple rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **green metal cube → off**: The green metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **gray rubber cylinder → on**: The gray rubber cylinder alone activates the detector.\n   - **gray rubber cylinder, green metal cube → on**: The presence of the gray rubber cylinder seems to be the key factor in activating the detector, as the green metal cube alone does not activate it.\n   - **green rubber cylinder, purple rubber cube → off**: Neither the green rubber cylinder nor the purple rubber cube activates the detector.\n   - **yellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder → on**: The gray metal cylinder might be a key factor here, as it is the only object that appears in another \"on\" result.\n   - **gray metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → on**: The gray metal cylinder activates the detector, as the purple rubber cube alone does not.\n\n2. **Key Observations:**\n   - The gray rubber cylinder and gray metal cylinder are both associated with the detector turning on.\n   - The green metal cube and purple rubber cube are associated with the detector staying off.\n\n3. **New Test Case:**\n   - **green metal cube, purple rubber cube**: Both objects in this combination have been associated with the detector staying off in previous experiments.\n\nBased on the analysis, the new combination of a green metal cube and a purple rubber cube should result in the detector light staying off, as neither object has been shown to activate the detector in previous experiments.\n\n<<<off>>>"
