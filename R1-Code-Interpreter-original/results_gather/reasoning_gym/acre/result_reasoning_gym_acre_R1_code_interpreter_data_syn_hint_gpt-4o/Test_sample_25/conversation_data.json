  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cube → off\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nyellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\ngray metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"gray metal cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **green metal cube → off**: The green metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n2. **gray rubber cylinder → on**: The gray rubber cylinder alone activates the detector.\n3. **gray rubber cylinder, green metal cube → on**: The combination of gray rubber cylinder and green metal cube activates the detector. This suggests that the gray rubber cylinder is likely a blicket.\n4. **green rubber cylinder, purple rubber cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector, indicating neither the green rubber cylinder nor the purple rubber cube is a blicket.\n5. **yellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder → on**: This combination activates the detector. Since the gray metal cylinder is part of this combination, it might be a blicket.\n6. **gray metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → on**: This combination activates the detector. Since the purple rubber cube alone (in combination with the green rubber cylinder) did not activate the detector, the gray metal cylinder is likely a blicket.\n\nFrom the above observations, the gray metal cylinder appears to be a blicket because it is part of combinations that activate the detector, and it is not paired with any known blicket in those combinations. Therefore, the gray metal cylinder alone should activate the detector.\n\nThe detector light status for the new test case \"gray metal cylinder\" is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
