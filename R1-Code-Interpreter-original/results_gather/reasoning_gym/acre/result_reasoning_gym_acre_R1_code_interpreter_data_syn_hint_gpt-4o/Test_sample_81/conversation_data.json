  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal cube, green metal cube → on\nred metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nred metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red metal cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. \"red metal cube, green metal cube → on\": This indicates that the combination of a red metal cube and a green metal cube activates the detector.\n\n2. \"red metal cube → on\": This shows that a red metal cube alone is sufficient to activate the detector.\n\n3. \"green metal cube → off\": This suggests that a green metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\n4. \"blue rubber cube → on\": This indicates that a blue rubber cube alone activates the detector.\n\n5. \"blue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\": This shows that the combination of a blue metal cube and a purple metal cube activates the detector.\n\n6. \"blue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\": This suggests that the combination of a blue rubber cylinder and a purple metal cube does not activate the detector.\n\nFrom the second result, \"red metal cube → on,\" we can directly conclude that a red metal cube alone is sufficient to activate the detector. Therefore, for the new test case \"red metal cube,\" the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
