  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nyellow rubber sphere, cyan rubber cube → on\ncyan rubber cube → off\nyellow rubber sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder, red rubber cylinder, red metal cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\nred metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder, blue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **yellow rubber sphere, cyan rubber cube → on**\n   - **cyan rubber cube → off**\n   - **yellow rubber sphere → on**\n   - **red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → off**\n   - **blue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder, red rubber cylinder, red metal cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on**\n   - **red metal cylinder, yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, red rubber cylinder → off**\n\n2. **Observations:**\n   - The **yellow rubber sphere** seems to be a consistent activator since it causes the detector to turn on both when alone and in combination with the cyan rubber cube.\n   - The **cyan rubber cube** alone does not activate the detector.\n   - The combination of **red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder** consistently results in the detector being off.\n   - The presence of the **blue metal cube** and **purple rubber cylinder** in the fifth example results in the detector turning on, even though the other objects in that combination (red rubber cylinder, red metal cylinder, yellow metal sphere) are associated with the detector being off.\n\n3. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - The new test case includes: **red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder, blue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder**.\n   - The combination includes the **blue metal cube** and **purple rubber cylinder**, which were present in the example that resulted in the detector turning on.\n   - The presence of these two objects suggests that they might be the activators, as they were the only new additions in the example that turned the detector on.\n\nBased on the analysis, the presence of the **blue metal cube** and **purple rubber cylinder** in the new test case suggests that the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
