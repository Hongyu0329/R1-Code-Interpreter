  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan rubber cylinder → off\npurple rubber sphere, cyan rubber cylinder → on\npurple rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber cube, red metal sphere → off\nbrown metal cylinder → on\nbrown metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\ngray rubber cube, red metal sphere, purple rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **cyan rubber cylinder → off**: The cyan rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **purple rubber sphere, cyan rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the purple rubber sphere with the cyan rubber cylinder activates the detector. This suggests that the purple rubber sphere might be a blicket.\n   - **purple rubber sphere → on**: The purple rubber sphere alone activates the detector, reinforcing the idea that it is a blicket.\n   - **gray rubber cube, red metal sphere → off**: Neither the gray rubber cube nor the red metal sphere alone or in combination activates the detector.\n   - **brown metal cylinder → on**: The brown metal cylinder alone activates the detector, indicating it is a blicket.\n   - **brown metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on**: The presence of the brown metal cylinder ensures the detector is on, regardless of the red metal sphere.\n\n2. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - **gray rubber cube, red metal sphere, purple rubber sphere**: \n     - The gray rubber cube and red metal sphere together previously resulted in the detector being off.\n     - The purple rubber sphere alone is known to activate the detector.\n\nGiven that the purple rubber sphere is included in the new test case and it has been shown to activate the detector on its own, we can conclude that the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
