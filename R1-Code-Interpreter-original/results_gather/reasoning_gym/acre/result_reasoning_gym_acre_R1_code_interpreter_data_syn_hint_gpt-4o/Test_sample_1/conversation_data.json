  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\ngray rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine whether the new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Gray Rubber Cube**: The detector turns on.\n2. **Purple Rubber Cube**: The detector stays off.\n3. **Gray Rubber Cube, Purple Rubber Cube**: The detector turns on. This suggests that the gray rubber cube is a blicket, as it activates the detector even in the presence of the purple rubber cube.\n4. **Blue Rubber Cylinder, Blue Metal Cylinder, Brown Metal Cube, Green Metal Cylinder**: The detector turns on. This suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n5. **Gray Metal Cube, Red Rubber Cube**: The detector stays off.\n6. **Green Metal Cylinder, Brown Metal Cube, Gray Metal Cube, Red Rubber Cube**: The detector stays off.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- The gray rubber cube is likely a blicket.\n- The blue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, or green metal cylinder could be a blicket, but we cannot determine which one specifically from the given data.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case:\n- **Blue Rubber Cylinder**: This object was part of a combination that turned the detector on (test case 4). However, since it was tested with other objects, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket on its own.\n\nGiven the lack of conclusive evidence that the blue rubber cylinder alone is a blicket, the status of the detector light for this new test case is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
