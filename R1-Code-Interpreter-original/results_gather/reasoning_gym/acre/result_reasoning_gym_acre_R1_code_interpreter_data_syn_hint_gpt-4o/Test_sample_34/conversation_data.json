  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal sphere, gray rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, brown rubber cube, yellow metal cube, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal cube → off\nbrown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngray rubber sphere, yellow rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Gray Metal Sphere**: \n   - When combined with a gray rubber sphere, the detector turns on.\n   - Alone, it also turns on the detector.\n   - This suggests that the gray metal sphere is a blicket.\n\n2. **Gray Rubber Sphere**:\n   - When combined with a gray metal sphere, the detector turns on.\n   - Alone, it does not turn on the detector.\n   - This suggests that the gray rubber sphere is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Yellow Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - When combined with a yellow metal cube, the detector does not turn on.\n   - Alone, it is not tested, but in combination with other non-blicket objects, it does not activate the detector.\n   - This suggests that the yellow rubber cylinder is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Yellow Metal Cube**:\n   - When combined with a yellow rubber cylinder, the detector does not turn on.\n   - Alone, it is not tested, but in combination with other non-blicket objects, it does not activate the detector.\n   - This suggests that the yellow metal cube is not a blicket.\n\n5. **Brown Rubber Cube**:\n   - Alone, it does not turn on the detector.\n   - This suggests that the brown rubber cube is not a blicket.\n\n6. **Red Metal Cylinder**:\n   - When combined with other objects, the detector turns on.\n   - Alone, it is not tested, but it is part of a combination that activates the detector.\n   - This suggests that the red metal cylinder might be a blicket, but we cannot be certain without further evidence.\n\nFor the new test case, we have:\n- Gray Rubber Sphere\n- Yellow Rubber Cylinder\n\nBased on the analysis:\n- The gray rubber sphere is not a blicket.\n- The yellow rubber cylinder is not a blicket.\n\nSince neither of the objects in the new test case is a blicket, the detector light will stay off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
