  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\ngray rubber cube → on\ngray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\nbrown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue rubber cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **brown metal cube → off**: The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n2. **gray rubber cube → on**: The gray rubber cube alone activates the detector.\n3. **gray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on**: The presence of the gray rubber cube activates the detector, even with the brown metal cube.\n4. **blue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off**: None of these objects activate the detector when combined.\n5. **brown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on**: The combination activates the detector, suggesting the brown rubber cube might be a blicket.\n6. **green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off**: Neither of these objects activates the detector.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- The gray rubber cube is a blicket since it activates the detector alone.\n- The brown rubber cube might be a blicket since it activates the detector in combination with the blue rubber cylinder.\n- The blue rubber cylinder, when tested with other non-blicket objects, does not activate the detector.\n\nFor the new test case \"blue rubber cylinder,\" based on the previous results where the blue rubber cylinder was tested with other non-blicket objects and did not activate the detector, we can conclude that the blue rubber cylinder alone will not activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"blue rubber cylinder\" is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
