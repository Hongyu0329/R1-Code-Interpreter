  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cylinder → on\nblue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **gray rubber cylinder → off**: The gray rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **blue metal cylinder → on**: The blue metal cylinder alone activates the detector.\n   - **blue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the blue metal cylinder still activates the detector even with the gray rubber cylinder.\n   - **cyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on**: The combination of a cyan metal cube and a brown rubber cube activates the detector.\n   - **brown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off**: The combination of a brown rubber cube and a cyan rubber cube does not activate the detector.\n   - **cyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off**: The combination of a cyan rubber cube and a brown rubber cube does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification:**\n   - The blue metal cylinder is a blicket since it activates the detector.\n   - The cyan metal cube is likely a blicket because it activates the detector when combined with a brown rubber cube, which alone does not activate the detector.\n   - The brown rubber cube and cyan rubber cube do not activate the detector when combined, suggesting they are not blickets.\n\n3. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - **brown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube**: \n     - The brown rubber cube and cyan rubber cube together do not activate the detector (as seen in previous results).\n     - The cyan metal cube, when combined with a brown rubber cube, activates the detector (as seen in previous results).\n\nGiven that the cyan metal cube is likely a blicket, its presence in the new test case should activate the detector, regardless of the other objects.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
