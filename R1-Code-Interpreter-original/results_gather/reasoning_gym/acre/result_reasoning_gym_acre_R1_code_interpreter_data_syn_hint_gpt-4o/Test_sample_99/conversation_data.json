  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal sphere, purple metal cylinder, yellow rubber sphere → off\npurple metal cylinder → off\ngreen metal cube, blue rubber cube, purple metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cylinder, gray rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Gray Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - Alone: \"on\"\n   - With Green Rubber Cylinder: \"on\"\n\n2. **Green Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - Alone: \"off\"\n   - With Gray Rubber Cylinder: \"on\"\n\nFrom the above observations, we can infer:\n- The Gray Rubber Cylinder is likely a blicket because it consistently causes the detector to turn on, even when combined with the Green Rubber Cylinder, which alone does not activate the detector.\n\n3. **Other Objects**:\n   - Cyan Metal Sphere, Purple Metal Cylinder, Yellow Rubber Sphere: \"off\"\n   - Purple Metal Cylinder: \"off\"\n   - Green Metal Cube, Blue Rubber Cube, Purple Metal Cylinder: \"on\"\n\nThe combination of Green Metal Cube and Blue Rubber Cube with the Purple Metal Cylinder turns the detector on, suggesting that either the Green Metal Cube or the Blue Rubber Cube is a blicket.\n\nFor the new test case:\n- **Green Rubber Cylinder, Gray Rubber Cylinder**: \n  - Since the Gray Rubber Cylinder is likely a blicket, it should activate the detector regardless of the presence of the Green Rubber Cylinder.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is \"on\".\n\n<<<on>>>"
