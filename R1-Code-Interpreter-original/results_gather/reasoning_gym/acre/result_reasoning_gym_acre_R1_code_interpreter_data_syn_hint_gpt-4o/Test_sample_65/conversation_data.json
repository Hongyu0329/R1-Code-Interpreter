  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nbrown metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\npurple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\npurple metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"purple metal cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - \"brown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\"\n   - \"gray rubber cylinder → off\"\n   - \"brown metal cube → on\"\n   - \"green metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\"\n   - \"purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\"\n   - \"green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\"\n\n2. **Identifying Patterns:**\n   - The \"brown metal cube\" consistently causes the detector to turn on, suggesting it is a blicket.\n   - The \"gray rubber cylinder\" alone does not activate the detector, indicating it is not a blicket.\n   - The \"green rubber cube\" and \"red rubber cylinder\" together do not activate the detector, suggesting neither is a blicket.\n   - The \"blue metal cylinder\" appears in combinations that activate the detector, but it is not clear if it is a blicket on its own.\n   - The \"purple metal cube\" appears in a combination that activates the detector, but it is not clear if it is a blicket on its own.\n\n3. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - The new test case is \"purple metal cube.\"\n   - In the previous results, the \"purple metal cube\" was part of a combination that activated the detector, but it was not tested alone.\n   - There is no direct evidence that the \"purple metal cube\" alone is a blicket.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the \"purple metal cube\" has not been tested alone and there is no conclusive evidence from the previous results that it is a blicket, the status of the detector light is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
