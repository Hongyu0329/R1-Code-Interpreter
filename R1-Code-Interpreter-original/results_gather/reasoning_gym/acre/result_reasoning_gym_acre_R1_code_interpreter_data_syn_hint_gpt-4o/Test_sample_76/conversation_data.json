    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue metal sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The red metal sphere alone turns the detector on.\n   - The purple metal sphere alone turns the detector off.\n   - The combination of a red metal sphere and a purple metal sphere turns the detector on, suggesting that the red metal sphere is a blicket.\n   - The combination of a blue metal sphere, purple metal cube, and green metal cylinder turns the detector off, indicating that none of these objects are blickets.\n   - The combination of red rubber cylinder, red rubber sphere, and purple metal cube turns the detector on, suggesting that either the red rubber cylinder or the red rubber sphere is a blicket.\n   - The combination of cyan rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, and red rubber sphere turns the detector on, reinforcing that the red rubber cylinder or the red rubber sphere is a blicket.\n\n2. **Analyze the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case is a \"blue metal sphere.\"\n   - From the previous results, the blue metal sphere was part of a combination that resulted in the detector being off. This suggests that the blue metal sphere is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the blue metal sphere was previously part of a combination that did not activate the detector, and there is no evidence suggesting it is a blicket, we can conclude that the detector will stay off for the new test case.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the \"blue metal sphere\" is off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
