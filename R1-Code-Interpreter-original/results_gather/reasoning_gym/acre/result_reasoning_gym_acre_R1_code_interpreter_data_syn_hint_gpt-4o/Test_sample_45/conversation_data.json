  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cylinder → off\npurple metal cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\npurple metal cube → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, cyan rubber cube → on\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\npurple metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"purple metal cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **blue rubber cylinder → off**: The blue rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n2. **purple metal cube, blue rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the purple metal cube with the blue rubber cylinder activates the detector. This suggests that the purple metal cube might be a blicket.\n3. **purple metal cube → on**: The purple metal cube alone activates the detector, confirming that it is indeed a blicket.\n4. **cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube → off**: Neither the cyan rubber cube nor the cyan metal cube activates the detector.\n5. **red rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, cyan rubber cube → on**: The combination activates the detector, but it's unclear which object(s) are blickets.\n6. **red rubber cube, cyan metal cube → on**: The presence of the red rubber cube with the cyan metal cube activates the detector, suggesting the red rubber cube might be a blicket.\n\nFor the new test case \"purple metal cube,\" we have already observed that the purple metal cube alone activates the detector in the previous experiments. Therefore, we can confidently determine that the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
