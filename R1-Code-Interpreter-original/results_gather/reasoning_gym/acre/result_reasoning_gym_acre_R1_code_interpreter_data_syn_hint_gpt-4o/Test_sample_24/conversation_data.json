  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cube → off\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nyellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - The \"green metal cube\" alone results in \"off.\"\n   - The \"gray rubber cylinder\" alone results in \"on.\"\n   - The combination of \"gray rubber cylinder\" and \"green metal cube\" results in \"on.\"\n   - The combination of \"green rubber cylinder\" and \"purple rubber cube\" results in \"off.\"\n   - The combination of \"yellow rubber cube,\" \"green metal cylinder,\" and \"gray metal cylinder\" results in \"on.\"\n   - The combination of \"gray metal cylinder\" and \"purple rubber cube\" results in \"on.\"\n\n2. **Observations:**\n   - The \"gray rubber cylinder\" seems to be a blicket since it turns the detector \"on\" by itself and in combination with the \"green metal cube.\"\n   - The \"gray metal cylinder\" also seems to be a blicket since it turns the detector \"on\" in combination with the \"purple rubber cube.\"\n   - The \"yellow rubber cube\" was part of a combination that resulted in \"on,\" but it was with other objects that could be blickets.\n\n3. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - The \"yellow rubber cube\" alone has not been tested before.\n   - In the previous result where the \"yellow rubber cube\" was involved, it was combined with other objects that could be blickets, so we cannot definitively say if the \"yellow rubber cube\" is a blicket on its own.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is insufficient evidence to determine if the \"yellow rubber cube\" alone will activate the detector since it was only tested in combination with other potential blickets.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the \"yellow rubber cube\" is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
