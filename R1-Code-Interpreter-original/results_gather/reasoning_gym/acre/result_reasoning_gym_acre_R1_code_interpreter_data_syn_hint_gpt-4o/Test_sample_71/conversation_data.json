  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal sphere, yellow metal cube → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nbrown metal sphere → on\nbrown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\ncyan metal sphere, gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere → on\npurple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\npurple rubber sphere, red rubber cube, gray metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects that consistently cause the detector to turn on:**\n   - The \"brown metal sphere\" appears in two combinations that result in the detector turning on:\n     - brown metal sphere, yellow metal cube → on\n     - brown metal sphere → on\n   - The \"cyan metal sphere\" appears in a combination that results in the detector turning on:\n     - cyan metal sphere, gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere → on\n\n2. **Identify objects that consistently do not cause the detector to turn on:**\n   - The \"yellow metal cube\" appears in a combination that results in the detector turning off:\n     - yellow metal cube → off\n   - The \"purple rubber sphere\" and \"red rubber cube\" appear in combinations that result in the detector turning off:\n     - brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\n     - purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\n\n3. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - The new test case includes \"purple rubber sphere,\" \"red rubber cube,\" and \"gray metal cylinder.\"\n   - From the previous results, the \"purple rubber sphere\" and \"red rubber cube\" have been associated with the detector turning off.\n   - The \"gray metal cylinder\" appears in a combination that results in the detector turning on, but it was with the \"cyan metal sphere,\" which is a known activator.\n\nGiven the evidence, the presence of \"purple rubber sphere\" and \"red rubber cube\" in the new test case suggests that the detector will likely stay off, as these objects have been associated with the detector turning off in previous experiments.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
