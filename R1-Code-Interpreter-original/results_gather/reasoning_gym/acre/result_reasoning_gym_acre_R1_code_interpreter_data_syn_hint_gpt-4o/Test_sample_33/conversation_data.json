  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal sphere, gray rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, brown rubber cube, yellow metal cube, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal cube → off\nbrown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngray metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"gray metal sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. \"gray metal sphere, gray rubber sphere → on\": This indicates that the combination of a gray metal sphere and a gray rubber sphere activates the detector. However, it doesn't specify which object is responsible for activation.\n\n2. \"gray rubber sphere → off\": This suggests that the gray rubber sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n\n3. \"gray metal sphere → on\": This result directly indicates that the gray metal sphere alone activates the detector.\n\n4. \"red metal cylinder, brown rubber cube, yellow metal cube, yellow rubber cylinder → on\": This combination activates the detector, but it involves multiple objects, so it's not directly relevant to the gray metal sphere.\n\n5. \"yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal cube → off\": This combination does not activate the detector, but it doesn't involve the gray metal sphere.\n\n6. \"brown rubber cube → off\": This indicates that the brown rubber cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\nFrom the above observations, the third result \"gray metal sphere → on\" clearly shows that the gray metal sphere alone is sufficient to activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case \"gray metal sphere,\" the detector light status is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
