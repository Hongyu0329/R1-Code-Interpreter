  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cylinder → off\npurple metal cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\npurple metal cube → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, cyan rubber cube → on\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube, red rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify potential blickets:**\n   - The purple metal cube is a potential blicket because it activates the detector both alone and in combination with the blue rubber cylinder.\n   - The red rubber cube is a potential blicket because it activates the detector in combination with the gray metal cylinder and cyan rubber cube, and also with the cyan metal cube.\n\n2. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - The new test case includes a cyan rubber cube, a cyan metal cube, and a red rubber cube.\n   - From the previous results, the red rubber cube has been associated with activating the detector when combined with other objects.\n\n3. **Determine the detector status:**\n   - Since the red rubber cube is present in the new test case and has previously been associated with activating the detector, it is likely that the detector will turn on.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the detector light status for the new test case is likely to be \"on.\"\n\n<<<on>>>"
