  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber sphere → off\nblue metal sphere, red rubber sphere → on\nblue metal sphere → on\nred metal sphere, brown rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, brown rubber sphere, red metal sphere → on\nyellow rubber sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"cyan rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - The \"red rubber sphere\" alone does not activate the detector (off).\n   - The \"blue metal sphere\" alone activates the detector (on).\n   - The combination of \"blue metal sphere\" and \"red rubber sphere\" activates the detector (on).\n   - The \"red metal sphere\" and \"brown rubber sphere\" together do not activate the detector (off).\n   - The combination of \"gray metal sphere,\" \"cyan rubber cube,\" \"brown rubber sphere,\" and \"red metal sphere\" activates the detector (on).\n   - The \"yellow rubber sphere\" alone activates the detector (on).\n\n2. **Pattern Identification:**\n   - The \"blue metal sphere\" is a blicket since it activates the detector both alone and in combination.\n   - The \"yellow rubber sphere\" is also a blicket since it activates the detector alone.\n   - The \"cyan rubber cube\" appears in a combination that activates the detector, but it is not clear if it is a blicket on its own since it was not tested alone.\n\n3. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - The \"cyan rubber cube\" was part of a combination that activated the detector, but there is no evidence that it can activate the detector by itself. It was tested with other objects, and the presence of a blicket in that combination could have been responsible for the activation.\n\nGiven the lack of evidence that the \"cyan rubber cube\" can activate the detector on its own, the status of the detector light for this new test case is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
