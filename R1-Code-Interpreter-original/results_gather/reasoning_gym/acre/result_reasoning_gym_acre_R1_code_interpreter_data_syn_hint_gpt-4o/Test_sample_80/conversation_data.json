  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal cube, green metal cube → on\nred metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. \"red metal cube, green metal cube → on\"\n2. \"red metal cube → on\"\n3. \"green metal cube → off\"\n4. \"blue rubber cube → on\"\n5. \"blue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\"\n6. \"blue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\"\n\nFrom these results, we can observe the following:\n\n- The \"red metal cube\" seems to be a blicket since it causes the detector to turn on both when alone and in combination with the \"green metal cube.\"\n- The \"green metal cube\" alone does not activate the detector, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n- The \"blue rubber cube\" alone activates the detector, indicating it is a blicket.\n- The \"blue metal cube\" and \"purple metal cube\" together activate the detector, but we don't have enough information to determine which one (or both) is a blicket.\n- The \"blue rubber cylinder\" and \"purple metal cube\" together do not activate the detector, suggesting that the \"blue rubber cylinder\" is not a blicket, and the \"purple metal cube\" alone might not be sufficient to activate the detector.\n\nGiven that the \"blue rubber cube\" alone has previously activated the detector, we can conclude that it is a blicket.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case \"blue rubber cube,\" the detector light status is \"on.\"\n\n<<<answer>>> on"
