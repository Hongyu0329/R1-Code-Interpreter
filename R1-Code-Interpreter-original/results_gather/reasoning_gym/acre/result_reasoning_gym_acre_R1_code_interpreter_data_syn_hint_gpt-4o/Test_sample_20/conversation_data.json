  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nblue rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off\nbrown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue rubber cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **cyan metal cylinder → on**: This suggests that the cyan metal cylinder is a blicket.\n2. **blue rubber cylinder → off**: This indicates that the blue rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n3. **cyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on**: Since the blue rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector, the cyan metal cylinder must be the activating object in this combination.\n4. **brown rubber sphere → on**: This suggests that the brown rubber sphere is a blicket.\n5. **brown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off**: None of these objects activate the detector, indicating they are not blickets.\n6. **brown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on**: Since the brown rubber sphere alone activates the detector, it is the activating object in this combination.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that the blue rubber cylinder does not activate the detector on its own, as shown in the second experimental result. Therefore, for the new test case \"blue rubber cylinder,\" the detector light will stay off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
