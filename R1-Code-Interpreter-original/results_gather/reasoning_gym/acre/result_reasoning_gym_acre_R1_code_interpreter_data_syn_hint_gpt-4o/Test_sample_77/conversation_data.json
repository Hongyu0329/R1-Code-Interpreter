  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal sphere → on\npurple metal sphere → off\nred metal sphere, purple metal sphere → on\nblue metal sphere, purple metal cube, green metal cylinder → off\nred rubber cylinder, red rubber sphere, purple metal cube → on\ncyan rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, red rubber sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nred rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red rubber sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Red Metal Sphere**: The detector turns on.\n2. **Purple Metal Sphere**: The detector stays off.\n3. **Red Metal Sphere, Purple Metal Sphere**: The detector turns on. This suggests that the red metal sphere is likely a blicket.\n4. **Blue Metal Sphere, Purple Metal Cube, Green Metal Cylinder**: The detector stays off. None of these objects are likely blickets.\n5. **Red Rubber Cylinder, Red Rubber Sphere, Purple Metal Cube**: The detector turns on. This suggests that either the red rubber cylinder or the red rubber sphere is a blicket.\n6. **Cyan Rubber Cube, Red Rubber Cylinder, Red Rubber Sphere**: The detector turns on. This further supports that either the red rubber cylinder or the red rubber sphere is a blicket.\n\nFrom the results, we can infer:\n- The red metal sphere is a blicket.\n- The red rubber sphere is likely a blicket, as it appears in combinations that activate the detector.\n\nGiven the new test case \"red rubber sphere,\" and considering that the red rubber sphere has been part of combinations that activate the detector, it is reasonable to conclude that the detector will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
