  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal sphere, blue metal cube → on\nred metal sphere → on\nblue metal cube → off\nyellow metal cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off\nbrown metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue metal cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **red metal sphere, blue metal cube → on**\n2. **red metal sphere → on**\n3. **blue metal cube → off**\n4. **yellow metal cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off**\n5. **blue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off**\n6. **brown metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on**\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The \"red metal sphere\" is likely a blicket because it causes the detector to turn on both when alone and when combined with the \"blue metal cube.\"\n- The \"blue metal cube\" alone does not activate the detector, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n- The \"blue metal cylinder\" appears in two combinations that result in the detector staying off, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n- The \"brown metal cylinder\" in combination with the \"blue rubber cylinder\" causes the detector to turn on, suggesting the \"brown metal cylinder\" might be a blicket.\n\nGiven the new test case \"blue metal cylinder,\" and considering that in previous experiments the \"blue metal cylinder\" was associated with the detector staying off, we can conclude that the detector light will stay off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
