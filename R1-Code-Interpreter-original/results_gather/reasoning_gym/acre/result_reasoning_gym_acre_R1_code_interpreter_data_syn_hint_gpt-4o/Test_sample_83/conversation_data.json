  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal cube, green metal cube → on\nred metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen metal cube, blue rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Red Metal Cube**: \n   - When combined with a green metal cube, the detector turns on.\n   - Alone, the red metal cube also turns the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the red metal cube is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **Green Metal Cube**:\n   - When combined with a red metal cube, the detector turns on.\n   - Alone, the green metal cube does not turn the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the green metal cube is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Blue Rubber Cube**:\n   - Alone, the blue rubber cube turns the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the blue rubber cube is likely a blicket.\n\n4. **Blue Metal Cube**:\n   - When combined with a purple metal cube, the detector turns on.\n   - This suggests that either the blue metal cube or the purple metal cube, or both, could be blickets.\n\n5. **Purple Metal Cube**:\n   - When combined with a blue rubber cylinder, the detector does not turn on.\n   - This suggests that the purple metal cube is not a blicket.\n\n6. **Blue Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - When combined with a purple metal cube, the detector does not turn on.\n   - This suggests that the blue rubber cylinder is not a blicket.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: **Green Metal Cube, Blue Rubber Cube**.\n\n- The green metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n- The blue rubber cube alone activates the detector.\n\nSince the blue rubber cube is likely a blicket, it should activate the detector regardless of the presence of the green metal cube.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is \"on\".\n\n<<<answer>>>on"
