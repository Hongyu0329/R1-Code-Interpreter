  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber sphere → off\nblue metal sphere, red rubber sphere → on\nblue metal sphere → on\nred metal sphere, brown rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, brown rubber sphere, red metal sphere → on\nyellow rubber sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nred rubber sphere, brown rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Red Rubber Sphere**: \n   - Alone, it results in \"off\".\n   - In combination with a blue metal sphere, it results in \"on\".\n\n2. **Blue Metal Sphere**:\n   - Alone, it results in \"on\".\n   - In combination with a red rubber sphere, it results in \"on\".\n\n3. **Red Metal Sphere**:\n   - Alone, it is not tested.\n   - In combination with a brown rubber sphere, it results in \"off\".\n   - In combination with a gray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, and brown rubber sphere, it results in \"on\".\n\n4. **Brown Rubber Sphere**:\n   - Alone, it is not tested.\n   - In combination with a red metal sphere, it results in \"off\".\n   - In combination with a gray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, and red metal sphere, it results in \"on\".\n\n5. **Yellow Rubber Sphere**:\n   - Alone, it results in \"on\".\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- The blue metal sphere is a blicket since it consistently turns the detector \"on\".\n- The yellow rubber sphere is also a blicket since it turns the detector \"on\" when alone.\n- The red rubber sphere alone does not activate the detector, but in combination with a blicket (blue metal sphere), it does.\n- The brown rubber sphere does not activate the detector when combined with a red metal sphere, but it does when combined with other objects that include a blicket.\n\nFor the new test case:\n- **Red Rubber Sphere, Brown Rubber Sphere**: \n  - The red rubber sphere alone results in \"off\".\n  - The brown rubber sphere, when combined with a non-blicket (red metal sphere), results in \"off\".\n\nSince neither the red rubber sphere nor the brown rubber sphere has been shown to activate the detector on their own or in combination without a known blicket, the detector light will stay \"off\" for this combination.\n\n<<<off>>>"
