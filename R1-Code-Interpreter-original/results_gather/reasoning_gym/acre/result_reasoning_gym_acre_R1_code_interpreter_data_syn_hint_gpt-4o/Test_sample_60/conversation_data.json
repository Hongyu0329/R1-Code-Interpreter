  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nyellow rubber sphere, cyan rubber cube → on\ncyan rubber cube → off\nyellow rubber sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder, red rubber cylinder, red metal cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\npurple rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"purple rubber cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects that consistently activate the detector:**\n   - The \"yellow rubber sphere\" appears in two examples where the detector turns on:\n     - yellow rubber sphere, cyan rubber cube → on\n     - yellow rubber sphere → on\n   - The \"cyan rubber cube\" is part of a combination that turns the detector on, but by itself, it turns the detector off:\n     - yellow rubber sphere, cyan rubber cube → on\n     - cyan rubber cube → off\n\n2. **Identify objects that consistently do not activate the detector:**\n   - The \"red metal cylinder,\" \"red rubber cylinder,\" \"yellow metal sphere,\" and \"yellow rubber cylinder\" appear in combinations that turn the detector off:\n     - red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → off\n     - red metal cylinder, yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, red rubber cylinder → off\n\n3. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - The \"purple rubber cylinder\" appears in a combination that turns the detector on:\n     - blue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder, red rubber cylinder, red metal cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n   - However, the \"purple rubber cylinder\" has not been tested alone, so we cannot definitively determine its effect based solely on the previous results.\n\nGiven the available data, the \"purple rubber cylinder\" has been part of a combination that turned the detector on, but it has not been tested in isolation. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether it will activate the detector by itself.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
