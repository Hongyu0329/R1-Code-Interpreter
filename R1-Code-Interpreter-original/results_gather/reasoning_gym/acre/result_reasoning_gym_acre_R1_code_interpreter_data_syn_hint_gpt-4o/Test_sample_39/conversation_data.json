  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\ngreen metal cylinder → on\nred metal sphere → off\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off\ngreen metal sphere → off\nyellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere, red metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Green Metal Cylinder**: \n   - When tested alone, it turns the detector on.\n   - When combined with a red metal sphere, it also turns the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the green metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\n2. **Red Metal Sphere**:\n   - When tested alone, it does not turn the detector on.\n   - When combined with a green metal cylinder, the detector turns on, but this is likely due to the green metal cylinder.\n\n3. **Yellow Metal Sphere**:\n   - When combined with a yellow rubber sphere and a brown rubber cylinder, the detector turns on.\n   - When combined with a green metal sphere, the detector stays off.\n   - This suggests that the yellow metal sphere might be a blicket, but it is not conclusive because it was not tested alone.\n\n4. **Green Metal Sphere**:\n   - When tested alone, it does not turn the detector on.\n   - When combined with a yellow metal sphere, the detector stays off.\n\n5. **Yellow Rubber Sphere and Brown Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - When combined with a yellow metal sphere, the detector turns on.\n   - This suggests that these objects are not blickets, as they do not turn the detector on when combined with a non-blicket (green metal sphere).\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere, red metal sphere.\n\n- The green metal sphere and red metal sphere have been shown not to activate the detector on their own.\n- The yellow metal sphere has been part of a combination that activated the detector, but it was not tested alone.\n\nGiven the evidence, the yellow metal sphere is the most likely candidate to be a blicket in this combination. However, since it was not tested alone, we cannot be certain.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case is undetermined due to insufficient evidence.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
