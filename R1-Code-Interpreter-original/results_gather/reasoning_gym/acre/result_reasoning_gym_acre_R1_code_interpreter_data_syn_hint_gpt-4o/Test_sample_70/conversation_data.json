  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal sphere, yellow metal cube → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nbrown metal sphere → on\nbrown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\ncyan metal sphere, gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere → on\npurple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\npurple rubber sphere, red rubber cube, cyan metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine whether the detector light will turn on or off for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - The combination of \"brown metal sphere\" and \"yellow metal cube\" results in the detector turning on.\n   - The \"yellow metal cube\" alone results in the detector staying off.\n   - The \"brown metal sphere\" alone results in the detector turning on.\n   - The combination of \"brown metal cylinder,\" \"purple rubber sphere,\" and \"red rubber cube\" results in the detector staying off.\n   - The combination of \"cyan metal sphere,\" \"gray metal cylinder,\" \"brown metal cylinder,\" and \"purple rubber sphere\" results in the detector turning on.\n   - The combination of \"purple rubber sphere\" and \"red rubber cube\" results in the detector staying off.\n\n2. **Identifying Patterns:**\n   - The \"brown metal sphere\" seems to be a blicket since it causes the detector to turn on both alone and in combination with the \"yellow metal cube.\"\n   - The \"yellow metal cube\" does not seem to be a blicket since it does not activate the detector alone.\n   - The \"purple rubber sphere\" and \"red rubber cube\" together do not activate the detector, and neither does the \"purple rubber sphere\" when combined with other objects.\n   - The \"cyan metal sphere\" seems to be a blicket since it activates the detector when combined with other objects.\n\n3. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - The new test case includes \"purple rubber sphere,\" \"red rubber cube,\" and \"cyan metal sphere.\"\n   - From the previous results, the \"cyan metal sphere\" is identified as a blicket, which means it should activate the detector regardless of the presence of other non-blicket objects.\n\nBased on this analysis, the presence of the \"cyan metal sphere\" in the new test case should cause the detector to turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
