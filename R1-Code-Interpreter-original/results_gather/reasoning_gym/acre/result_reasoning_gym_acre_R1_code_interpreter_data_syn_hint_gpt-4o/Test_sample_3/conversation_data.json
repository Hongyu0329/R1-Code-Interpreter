  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\ngray rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube, green metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n1. **Gray Rubber Cube**: The detector turns on when a gray rubber cube is placed on it. This suggests that the gray rubber cube is a blicket.\n\n2. **Purple Rubber Cube**: The detector does not turn on when a purple rubber cube is placed on it, indicating that the purple rubber cube is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Gray Rubber Cube and Purple Rubber Cube**: The detector turns on when both are placed, reinforcing that the gray rubber cube is a blicket, and the presence of the purple rubber cube does not affect the activation.\n\n4. **Blue Rubber Cylinder, Blue Metal Cylinder, Brown Metal Cube, Green Metal Cylinder**: The detector turns on with this combination. This suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n\n5. **Gray Metal Cube, Red Rubber Cube**: The detector does not turn on, indicating that neither the gray metal cube nor the red rubber cube is a blicket.\n\n6. **Green Metal Cylinder, Brown Metal Cube, Gray Metal Cube, Red Rubber Cube**: The detector does not turn on, suggesting that none of these objects are blickets.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: **Gray Metal Cube, Red Rubber Cube, Green Metal Cylinder**.\n\n- From the previous results, we know that the gray metal cube and red rubber cube together do not activate the detector.\n- The green metal cylinder was part of a combination that turned the detector on, but it was also part of a combination that did not turn the detector on. This suggests that the green metal cylinder alone is not a blicket.\n\nSince none of the objects in the new test case have been shown to activate the detector on their own or in combination, we can conclude that the detector light will stay off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
