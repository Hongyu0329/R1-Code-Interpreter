  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal sphere, gray rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, brown rubber cube, yellow metal cube, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal cube → off\nbrown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngray rubber sphere, brown rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Gray Metal Sphere**:\n   - When combined with a gray rubber sphere, the detector turns on.\n   - Alone, it also turns the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the gray metal sphere is a blicket.\n\n2. **Gray Rubber Sphere**:\n   - When combined with a gray metal sphere, the detector turns on.\n   - Alone, it does not turn the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the gray rubber sphere is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Red Metal Cylinder, Brown Rubber Cube, Yellow Metal Cube, Yellow Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - This combination turns the detector on.\n   - The yellow rubber cylinder and yellow metal cube together do not turn the detector on, suggesting neither is a blicket.\n   - The brown rubber cube alone does not turn the detector on, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n   - This implies the red metal cylinder is likely a blicket.\n\n4. **Brown Rubber Cube**:\n   - Alone, it does not turn the detector on, confirming it is not a blicket.\n\nFor the new test case:\n- **Gray Rubber Sphere, Brown Rubber Cube**:\n  - Both objects have been tested individually and neither activated the detector.\n  - Since neither object is a blicket, their combination should not activate the detector.\n\nBased on this analysis, the detector light status for the new test case is \"off\".\n\n<<<off>>>"
