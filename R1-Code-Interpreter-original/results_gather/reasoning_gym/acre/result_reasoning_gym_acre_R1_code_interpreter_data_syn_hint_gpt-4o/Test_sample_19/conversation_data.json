  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal sphere, blue metal cube → on\nred metal sphere → on\nblue metal cube → off\nyellow metal cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off\nbrown metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue metal cube, blue metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Red Metal Sphere**: \n   - When combined with a blue metal cube, the detector turns on.\n   - Alone, it also turns on the detector.\n   - This suggests that the red metal sphere is a blicket.\n\n2. **Blue Metal Cube**:\n   - When combined with a red metal sphere, the detector turns on.\n   - Alone, it does not turn on the detector.\n   - This suggests that the blue metal cube is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Yellow Metal Cylinder and Blue Metal Cylinder**:\n   - Together, they do not turn on the detector.\n   - This suggests neither is a blicket.\n\n4. **Blue Rubber Cylinder and Blue Metal Cylinder**:\n   - Together, they do not turn on the detector.\n   - This suggests neither is a blicket.\n\n5. **Brown Metal Cylinder and Blue Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - Together, they turn on the detector.\n   - This suggests the brown metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: **Blue Metal Cube and Blue Metal Cylinder**.\n\n- The blue metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n- The blue metal cylinder, when tested with other objects, has not activated the detector.\n\nSince neither the blue metal cube nor the blue metal cylinder has been shown to activate the detector in previous experiments, and there is no evidence of them being blickets, the most logical conclusion is that the detector will stay off.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
