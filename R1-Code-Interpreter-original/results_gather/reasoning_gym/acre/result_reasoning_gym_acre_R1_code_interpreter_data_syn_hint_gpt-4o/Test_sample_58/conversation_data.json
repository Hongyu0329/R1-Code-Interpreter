  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nyellow rubber cylinder → off\nyellow metal sphere → on\nyellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nblue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube, blue metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine whether the new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Yellow Metal Sphere**: \n   - When tested alone, it turned the detector on.\n   - When combined with a yellow rubber cylinder, it still turned the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the yellow metal sphere is a blicket.\n\n2. **Yellow Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - When tested alone, it did not activate the detector.\n   - When combined with a yellow metal sphere, the detector was on, but this is likely due to the yellow metal sphere being a blicket.\n\n3. **Yellow Metal Cube, Red Metal Cylinder, Purple Rubber Cube**:\n   - This combination did not activate the detector, suggesting none of these are blickets.\n\n4. **Blue Metal Sphere**:\n   - In a combination with other objects, it activated the detector.\n   - Since the yellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, and green rubber cube were previously tested and did not activate the detector, the blue metal sphere is likely a blicket.\n\n5. **Green Rubber Cube, Red Metal Cylinder, Purple Rubber Cube, Yellow Metal Cube**:\n   - This combination did not activate the detector, reinforcing that these objects are not blickets.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case:\n- **Green Rubber Cube, Red Metal Cylinder, Purple Rubber Cube, Yellow Metal Cube, Blue Metal Sphere**:\n  - The blue metal sphere is likely a blicket, as it was part of a combination that activated the detector previously.\n  - The other objects in this combination have been tested and did not activate the detector.\n\nBased on this analysis, the presence of the blue metal sphere in the new test case suggests that the detector will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
