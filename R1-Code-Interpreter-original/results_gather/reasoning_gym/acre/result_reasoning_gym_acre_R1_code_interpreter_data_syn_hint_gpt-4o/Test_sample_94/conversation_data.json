  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\nyellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on\nyellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube, cyan rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **brown metal cube → off**: The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **yellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on**: The presence of the yellow metal cylinder seems to activate the detector, as the brown metal cube alone does not.\n   - **yellow metal cylinder → on**: Confirms that the yellow metal cylinder is a blicket.\n   - **cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off**: None of these objects alone or in combination activate the detector.\n   - **cyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on**: The cyan rubber cylinder or the cyan metal cylinder might be a blicket.\n   - **green rubber cube → off**: The green rubber cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **New Test Case:**\n   - **green rubber cube, cyan rubber cube**\n\nFrom the previous results:\n- The green rubber cube alone does not activate the detector.\n- The cyan rubber cube, when combined with other objects, did not activate the detector either.\n\nSince both the green rubber cube and the cyan rubber cube have been shown not to activate the detector in previous experiments, and there is no evidence suggesting a combination of these two specific objects would result in activation, we can conclude that the detector will stay off.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
