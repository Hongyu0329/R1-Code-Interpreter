  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off\nblue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off\nyellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **blue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on**: This suggests that either the blue rubber cube or the purple rubber cube (or both) could be a blicket.\n\n2. **purple rubber cube → off**: This indicates that the purple rubber cube alone is not a blicket.\n\n3. **blue rubber cube → on**: This confirms that the blue rubber cube is a blicket since it activates the detector on its own.\n\n4. **blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off**: None of these objects are blickets.\n\n5. **blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off**: Again, none of these objects are blickets.\n\n6. **yellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on**: At least one of these objects is a blicket, but it doesn't affect the conclusion about the blue rubber cube.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the blue rubber cube is confirmed to be a blicket because it activates the detector on its own. Therefore, the detector light will turn on for the new test case \"blue rubber cube.\"\n\n<<<on>>>"
