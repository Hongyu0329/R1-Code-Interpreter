  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cylinder → on\nblue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nblue metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **gray rubber cylinder → off**: This indicates that the gray rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **blue metal cylinder → on**: This shows that the blue metal cylinder alone activates the detector.\n\n3. **blue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the blue metal cylinder in this combination suggests it is the activating object, as it was already known to activate the detector on its own.\n\n4. **cyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on**: This combination activates the detector, but it is unclear which object is responsible.\n\n5. **brown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector, suggesting neither the brown rubber cube nor the cyan rubber cube is an activator.\n\n6. **cyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off**: This further confirms that neither the cyan rubber cube nor the brown rubber cube activates the detector.\n\nNow, for the new test case:\n\n- **blue metal cylinder**: From the previous results, we know that the blue metal cylinder alone activates the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is \"on\".\n\n<<<answer>>>on"
