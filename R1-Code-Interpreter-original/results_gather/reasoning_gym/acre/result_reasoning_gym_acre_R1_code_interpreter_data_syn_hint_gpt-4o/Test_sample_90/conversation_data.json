  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber sphere, cyan metal cylinder → on\ncyan metal cylinder → off\ngray rubber cube, purple metal cube, yellow metal cylinder → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, purple metal cube, gray rubber cube, yellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal cylinder, purple metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"cyan metal cylinder, purple metal cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **gray rubber sphere → on**: The gray rubber sphere alone activates the detector.\n2. **gray rubber sphere, cyan metal cylinder → on**: The presence of the gray rubber sphere ensures the detector is on, even with the cyan metal cylinder.\n3. **cyan metal cylinder → off**: The cyan metal cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n4. **gray rubber cube, purple metal cube, yellow metal cylinder → off**: None of these objects activate the detector.\n5. **cyan rubber cylinder, purple metal cube, gray rubber cube, yellow metal cylinder → on**: The cyan rubber cylinder is likely the activating object here, as the other objects have been shown not to activate the detector.\n6. **cyan rubber cylinder → on**: Confirms that the cyan rubber cylinder activates the detector.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce:\n- The cyan metal cylinder does not activate the detector on its own.\n- The purple metal cube does not activate the detector on its own, as seen in the fourth result.\n- The combination of cyan metal cylinder and purple metal cube does not include any object that has been shown to activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, the detector light status for the new test case \"cyan metal cylinder, purple metal cube\" is determined to be \"off.\"\n\n<<<off>>>"
