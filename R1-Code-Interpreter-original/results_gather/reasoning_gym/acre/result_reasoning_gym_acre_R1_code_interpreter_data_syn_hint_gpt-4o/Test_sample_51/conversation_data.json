  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nred metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cube, red metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Cyan Metal Cylinder**: \n   - In the first example, the combination of a cyan metal cylinder and a yellow metal cube results in the detector turning on.\n   - In the second example, the cyan metal cylinder alone also results in the detector turning on.\n   - This suggests that the cyan metal cylinder is a blicket and can activate the detector on its own.\n\n2. **Yellow Metal Cube**:\n   - In the first example, it is part of a combination that turns the detector on.\n   - In the third example, the yellow metal cube alone results in the detector staying off.\n   - This suggests that the yellow metal cube is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Red Metal Cylinder**:\n   - In the fourth example, it is part of a combination that results in the detector staying off.\n   - In the sixth example, the combination of a green metal cube and a red metal cylinder results in the detector turning on.\n   - This suggests that the red metal cylinder is not a blicket on its own, but it can be part of a combination that activates the detector.\n\n4. **Green Metal Cube**:\n   - In the sixth example, it is part of a combination that results in the detector turning on.\n   - This suggests that the green metal cube is a blicket.\n\n5. **Cyan Rubber Cylinder, Green Rubber Cube, Gray Rubber Cube**:\n   - In the fifth example, the combination of these objects with a red metal cylinder results in the detector staying off.\n   - This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: cyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder.\n\n- The presence of the cyan metal cylinder, which is a confirmed blicket, suggests that the detector will turn on.\n\nTherefore, based on the presence of the cyan metal cylinder, we can conclude that the detector light will turn on for the new test case.\n\n<<<on>>>"
