  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nblue rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off\nbrown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cylinder, cyan metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Cyan Metal Cylinder**: \n   - Alone, it turns the detector \"on\".\n   - With a blue rubber cylinder, it still turns the detector \"on\".\n   - This suggests that the cyan metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\n2. **Blue Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - Alone, it turns the detector \"off\".\n   - With a cyan metal cylinder, the detector is \"on\", but this is likely due to the cyan metal cylinder being a blicket.\n\n3. **Brown Rubber Sphere**:\n   - Alone, it turns the detector \"on\".\n   - With a brown rubber cube, it still turns the detector \"on\".\n   - This suggests that the brown rubber sphere is a blicket.\n\n4. **Brown Rubber Cube, Green Rubber Sphere, Cyan Metal Cube**:\n   - Together, they turn the detector \"off\".\n   - This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n\n5. **Brown Rubber Sphere, Brown Rubber Cube**:\n   - Together, they turn the detector \"on\".\n   - This is consistent with the brown rubber sphere being a blicket.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: **Blue Rubber Cylinder, Cyan Metal Cube**.\n\n- The blue rubber cylinder alone turns the detector \"off\".\n- The cyan metal cube, when tested with other non-blicket objects, also results in \"off\".\n- There is no evidence that either the blue rubber cylinder or the cyan metal cube is a blicket.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the new combination of objects (blue rubber cylinder, cyan metal cube) should result in the detector light staying \"off\".\n\n<<<off>>>"
