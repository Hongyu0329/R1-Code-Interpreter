  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nred metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cube, red metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"cyan metal cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. \"cyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on\": The presence of the cyan metal cylinder in combination with the yellow metal cube turns the detector on.\n2. \"cyan metal cylinder → on\": The cyan metal cylinder alone turns the detector on.\n3. \"yellow metal cube → off\": The yellow metal cube alone does not turn the detector on.\n4. \"red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off\": None of these objects turn the detector on.\n5. \"cyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off\": None of these objects turn the detector on.\n6. \"green metal cube, red metal cylinder → on\": This combination turns the detector on.\n\nFrom the above observations, we can conclude that the cyan metal cylinder is a blicket because it activates the detector on its own, as shown in the second result. Therefore, for the new test case \"cyan metal cylinder,\" the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
