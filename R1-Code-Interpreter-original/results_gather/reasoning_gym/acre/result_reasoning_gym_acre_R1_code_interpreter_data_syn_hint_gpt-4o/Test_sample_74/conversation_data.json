  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\ngray rubber cube → on\ngray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\nbrown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cube, brown rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **brown metal cube → off**: The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **gray rubber cube → on**: The gray rubber cube alone activates the detector.\n   - **gray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on**: The presence of the gray rubber cube activates the detector, even with the brown metal cube.\n   - **blue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off**: None of these objects activate the detector.\n   - **brown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the brown rubber cube activates the detector, even with the blue rubber cylinder.\n   - **green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off**: None of these objects activate the detector.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification:**\n   - The gray rubber cube and the brown rubber cube are the only objects that have been shown to activate the detector.\n   - The brown metal cube does not activate the detector on its own, but it does not prevent activation when combined with an activating object (e.g., gray rubber cube).\n\n3. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - **brown metal cube, brown rubber cube**: The brown rubber cube is known to activate the detector, and the presence of the brown metal cube does not prevent activation.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the presence of the brown rubber cube in the new test case should activate the detector.\n\n<<<on>>>"
