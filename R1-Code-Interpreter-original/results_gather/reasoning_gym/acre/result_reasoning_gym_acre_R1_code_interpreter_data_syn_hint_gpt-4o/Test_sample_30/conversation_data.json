  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan rubber cylinder → off\npurple rubber sphere, cyan rubber cylinder → on\npurple rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber cube, red metal sphere → off\nbrown metal cylinder → on\nbrown metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\ngray rubber cube, red metal sphere, brown metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **cyan rubber cylinder → off**: The cyan rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **purple rubber sphere, cyan rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the purple rubber sphere seems to activate the detector, as the cyan rubber cylinder alone does not.\n   - **purple rubber sphere → on**: Confirms that the purple rubber sphere is a blicket.\n   - **gray rubber cube, red metal sphere → off**: Neither the gray rubber cube nor the red metal sphere alone or in combination activates the detector.\n   - **brown metal cylinder → on**: The brown metal cylinder is a blicket.\n   - **brown metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on**: The presence of the brown metal cylinder activates the detector, regardless of the red metal sphere.\n\n2. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - **gray rubber cube, red metal sphere, brown metal cylinder**: \n     - The gray rubber cube and red metal sphere together do not activate the detector (as seen in the previous results).\n     - The brown metal cylinder alone activates the detector.\n\nGiven that the brown metal cylinder is present in the new test case and it is a known blicket, the detector will turn on.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
