  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nyellow rubber cylinder → off\nyellow metal sphere → on\nyellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nblue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nblue metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine whether the detector light will turn on or off for the new test case \"blue metal sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - \"yellow rubber cylinder → off\": The yellow rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - \"yellow metal sphere → on\": The yellow metal sphere alone activates the detector.\n   - \"yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → on\": The presence of the yellow metal sphere seems to be the activating factor since the yellow rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - \"yellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\": None of these objects activate the detector.\n   - \"blue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → on\": The blue metal sphere is part of this combination, which activates the detector.\n   - \"green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → off\": None of these objects activate the detector.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification:**\n   - The yellow metal sphere is a confirmed blicket since it activates the detector.\n   - The blue metal sphere is part of a combination that activates the detector, suggesting it might be a blicket.\n\n3. **New Test Case:**\n   - \"blue metal sphere\": Since the blue metal sphere was part of a combination that activated the detector, it is likely a blicket.\n\nBased on the analysis, the blue metal sphere is likely to activate the detector.\n\n<<<on>>>"
