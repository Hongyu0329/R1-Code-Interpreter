  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\ngray rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nred rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine whether the detector light will turn on or off for the new test case \"red rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **gray rubber cube → on**: This suggests that the gray rubber cube is a blicket.\n2. **purple rubber cube → off**: This suggests that the purple rubber cube is not a blicket.\n3. **gray rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on**: The presence of the gray rubber cube likely causes the detector to turn on, as the purple rubber cube alone does not.\n4. **blue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder → on**: At least one of these objects is a blicket.\n5. **gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off**: Neither the gray metal cube nor the red rubber cube is a blicket.\n6. **green metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off**: None of these objects are blickets.\n\nFrom the results, we can infer that the red rubber cube is not a blicket because it was tested in combination with the gray metal cube and the detector stayed off. Therefore, the red rubber cube alone will not activate the detector.\n\nThe detector light status for the new test case \"red rubber cube\" is off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
