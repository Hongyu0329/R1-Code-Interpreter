  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nred metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cube, red metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, yellow metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Cyan Metal Cylinder**: \n   - When tested alone, it turns the detector on.\n   - When combined with a yellow metal cube, it also turns the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the cyan metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\n2. **Yellow Metal Cube**:\n   - When tested alone, it turns the detector off.\n   - When combined with a cyan metal cylinder, it turns the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the yellow metal cube is not a blicket, and the activation in the combination is due to the cyan metal cylinder.\n\n3. **Red Metal Cylinder**:\n   - When combined with a green metal cube, it turns the detector on.\n   - When combined with other non-blicket objects, it turns the detector off.\n   - This suggests that the red metal cylinder is not a blicket, and the activation in the combination is due to the green metal cube.\n\n4. **Green Metal Cube**:\n   - When combined with a red metal cylinder, it turns the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the green metal cube is a blicket.\n\n5. **Cyan Rubber Cylinder, Green Rubber Cube, Gray Rubber Cube**:\n   - In various combinations, these objects do not activate the detector.\n   - This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case:\n- **Cyan Rubber Cylinder**: Previously shown to be non-blicket.\n- **Green Rubber Cube**: Previously shown to be non-blicket.\n- **Red Metal Cylinder**: Previously shown to be non-blicket.\n- **Gray Rubber Cube**: Previously shown to be non-blicket.\n- **Yellow Metal Cube**: Previously shown to be non-blicket.\n\nIn the new test case, none of the objects are identified as blickets based on previous experiments. Therefore, the detector light will stay off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
