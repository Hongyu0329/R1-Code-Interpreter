  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nbrown metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\npurple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"brown metal cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. \"brown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\"\n2. \"gray rubber cylinder → off\"\n3. \"brown metal cube → on\"\n4. \"green metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\"\n5. \"purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\"\n6. \"green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\"\n\nFrom these results, we can observe the following:\n\n- The \"brown metal cube\" alone has been tested and resulted in the detector turning \"on\" (as seen in result 3).\n- The presence of the \"brown metal cube\" in combination with other objects (as in result 1) also resulted in the detector turning \"on.\"\n\nGiven this information, the \"brown metal cube\" appears to be a blicket, as it consistently causes the detector to activate when present.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case \"brown metal cube,\" we can confidently determine that the detector light will turn \"on.\"\n\n<<<on>>>"
