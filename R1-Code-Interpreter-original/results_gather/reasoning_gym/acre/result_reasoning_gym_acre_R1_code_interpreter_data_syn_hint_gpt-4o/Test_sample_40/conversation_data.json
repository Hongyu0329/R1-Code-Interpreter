  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber cylinder → off\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on\nblue metal cube → off\nyellow metal cube → off\ngray metal sphere, red metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow metal cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - \"red rubber cylinder → off\": The red rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - \"brown rubber sphere → on\": The brown rubber sphere alone activates the detector.\n   - \"brown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on\": The presence of the brown rubber sphere seems to be the key factor in activating the detector, as it activates even with the red rubber cylinder, which alone does not activate the detector.\n   - \"blue metal cube → off\": The blue metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - \"yellow metal cube → off\": The yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - \"gray metal sphere, red metal cube → on\": This combination activates the detector, suggesting that either the gray metal sphere or the red metal cube (or both) could be blickets.\n\n2. **New Test Case:**\n   - \"yellow metal cube\": From the previous results, we know that the yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector, as shown in the result \"yellow metal cube → off.\"\n\nBased on the above analysis, the new test case \"yellow metal cube\" has already been tested and resulted in the detector light staying off.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"yellow metal cube\" is off.\n\n<<<answer>>> off"
