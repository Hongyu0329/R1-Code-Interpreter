  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nblue rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off\nbrown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"green rubber sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **Cyan metal cylinder → on**: This indicates that the cyan metal cylinder is a blicket.\n2. **Blue rubber cylinder → off**: This suggests that the blue rubber cylinder is not a blicket.\n3. **Cyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the cyan metal cylinder is enough to activate the detector, confirming it as a blicket.\n4. **Brown rubber sphere → on**: This suggests that the brown rubber sphere is a blicket.\n5. **Brown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off**: None of these objects are blickets, or at least not in this combination.\n6. **Brown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on**: The brown rubber sphere is confirmed as a blicket, as it activates the detector even with the brown rubber cube.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- The brown rubber sphere is a blicket.\n- The cyan metal cylinder is a blicket.\n- The green rubber sphere, when tested with other non-blicket objects, did not activate the detector.\n\nFor the new test case \"green rubber sphere,\" since it was previously tested in a combination that resulted in \"off,\" and there is no evidence of it being a blicket, the detector light status is likely to be \"off.\"\n\n<<<off>>>"
