  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nbrown metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\npurple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, green metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **brown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on**\n   - **gray rubber cylinder → off**\n   - **brown metal cube → on**\n   - **green metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on**\n   - **purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on**\n   - **green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off**\n\n2. **Observations:**\n   - The **brown metal cube** seems to be a blicket because it causes the detector to turn on both when alone and in combination with the gray rubber cylinder.\n   - The **gray rubber cylinder** alone does not activate the detector, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n   - The **green metal cube** appears in a combination that turns the detector on, but it is not clear if it is a blicket on its own.\n   - The **blue metal cylinder** appears in combinations that turn the detector on, but it is not clear if it is a blicket on its own.\n   - The **green rubber cube** appears in a combination that turns the detector on and in another that does not, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n   - The **red rubber cylinder** does not activate the detector when combined with the green rubber cube, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\n3. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - **green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, green metal cube**\n\n   From the previous observations:\n   - The **green rubber cube** and **red rubber cylinder** together do not activate the detector.\n   - The **green metal cube** has been seen in a combination that activates the detector, but it is not confirmed to be a blicket on its own.\n\nGiven the information, the presence of the green metal cube in the new test case is the only factor that could potentially activate the detector. However, since it has not been confirmed to be a blicket on its own, and the other two objects are known not to activate the detector, the status of the detector light remains uncertain.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
