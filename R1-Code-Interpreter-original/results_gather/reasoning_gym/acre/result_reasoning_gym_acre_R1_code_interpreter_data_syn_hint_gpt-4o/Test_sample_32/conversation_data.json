  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal sphere, gray rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, brown rubber cube, yellow metal cube, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal cube → off\nbrown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nred metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red metal cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Gray Metal Sphere**: \n   - When combined with a gray rubber sphere, the detector turns on.\n   - Alone, it also turns on the detector.\n   - This suggests that the gray metal sphere is a blicket.\n\n2. **Gray Rubber Sphere**:\n   - When alone, it does not activate the detector.\n   - When combined with a gray metal sphere, the detector turns on, likely due to the gray metal sphere.\n\n3. **Red Metal Cylinder**:\n   - In the previous example, when combined with a brown rubber cube, yellow metal cube, and yellow rubber cylinder, the detector turns on.\n   - However, the yellow rubber cylinder and yellow metal cube together do not activate the detector, nor does the brown rubber cube alone.\n   - This suggests that the red metal cylinder might be a blicket.\n\n4. **Yellow Rubber Cylinder and Yellow Metal Cube**:\n   - Together, they do not activate the detector.\n   - This suggests neither is a blicket.\n\n5. **Brown Rubber Cube**:\n   - Alone, it does not activate the detector.\n   - This suggests it is not a blicket.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the red metal cylinder was part of a combination that activated the detector, and the other objects in that combination have been shown not to activate the detector on their own. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the red metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\nThus, for the new test case \"red metal cylinder,\" the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
