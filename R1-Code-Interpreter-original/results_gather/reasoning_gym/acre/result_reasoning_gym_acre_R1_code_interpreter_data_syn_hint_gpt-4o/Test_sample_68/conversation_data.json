    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **brown metal sphere, yellow metal cube → on**\n2. **yellow metal cube → off**\n3. **brown metal sphere → on**\n4. **brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off**\n5. **cyan metal sphere, gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere → on**\n6. **purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off**\n\nFrom these results, we can make the following observations:\n\n- The **brown metal sphere** seems to be a blicket because it causes the detector to turn on in both cases where it is present (examples 1 and 3).\n- The **yellow metal cube** alone does not activate the detector (example 2), but when combined with the brown metal sphere, the detector turns on (example 1). This suggests that the yellow metal cube is not a blicket.\n- The **red rubber cube** appears in two examples (4 and 6), and in both cases, the detector stays off. This suggests that the red rubber cube is not a blicket.\n- The **purple rubber sphere** also appears in two examples (4 and 6), and in both cases, the detector stays off. This suggests that the purple rubber sphere is not a blicket.\n- The **brown metal cylinder** appears in example 4, where the detector stays off, and in example 5, where the detector turns on. This suggests that the brown metal cylinder might be a blicket, but it is not conclusive without further evidence.\n- The **cyan metal sphere** and **gray metal cylinder** appear in example 5, where the detector turns on. However, without additional data, we cannot determine if they are blickets.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the red rubber cube has consistently been associated with the detector staying off. Therefore, for the new test case \"red rubber cube,\" we can conclude that the detector light will stay off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
