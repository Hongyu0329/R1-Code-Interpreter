  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal sphere, blue metal cube → on\nred metal sphere → on\nblue metal cube → off\nyellow metal cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off\nbrown metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"brown metal cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **red metal sphere, blue metal cube → on**\n2. **red metal sphere → on**\n3. **blue metal cube → off**\n4. **yellow metal cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off**\n5. **blue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off**\n6. **brown metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on**\n\nFrom these results, we can make the following observations:\n\n- The \"red metal sphere\" is a blicket because it causes the detector to turn on both when alone and in combination with the \"blue metal cube.\"\n- The \"blue metal cube\" is not a blicket because it does not activate the detector when alone.\n- The \"yellow metal cylinder\" and \"blue metal cylinder\" do not activate the detector, as seen in examples 4 and 5.\n- The \"blue rubber cylinder\" does not activate the detector when combined with the \"blue metal cylinder\" (example 5), but it does when combined with the \"brown metal cylinder\" (example 6).\n- The \"brown metal cylinder\" activates the detector when combined with the \"blue rubber cylinder\" (example 6).\n\nGiven that the \"brown metal cylinder\" activates the detector in combination with the \"blue rubber cylinder,\" it suggests that the \"brown metal cylinder\" might be a blicket. However, we do not have a test case where the \"brown metal cylinder\" is tested alone.\n\nSince the \"brown metal cylinder\" has not been tested alone, we cannot definitively conclude whether it is a blicket based solely on the available data. Therefore, the status of the detector light for the \"brown metal cylinder\" alone is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
