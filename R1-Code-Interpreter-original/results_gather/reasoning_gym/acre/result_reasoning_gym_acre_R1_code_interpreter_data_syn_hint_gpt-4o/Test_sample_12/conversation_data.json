  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal sphere → off\nblue metal cube → on\nblue metal cube, cyan metal sphere → on\ngray metal cube, cyan metal cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, cyan metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"cyan metal sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **cyan metal sphere → off**: This indicates that the cyan metal sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **blue metal cube → on**: The blue metal cube activates the detector.\n\n3. **blue metal cube, cyan metal sphere → on**: The presence of the blue metal cube activates the detector, even with the cyan metal sphere present.\n\n4. **gray metal cube, cyan metal cube, cyan metal cylinder → on**: The combination of these objects activates the detector, but it's unclear which specific object(s) are responsible.\n\n5. **cyan metal cube → off**: The cyan metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\n6. **red rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, cyan metal cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector, suggesting that none of these objects are blickets.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n\n- The cyan metal sphere alone has been tested and resulted in the detector being off.\n- There is no evidence from the other tests to suggest that the cyan metal sphere has any hidden property that would activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, based on the previous results, the detector light status for the new test case \"cyan metal sphere\" is off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
