  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber cylinder → off\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on\nblue metal cube → off\nyellow metal cube → off\ngray metal sphere, red metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nred metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red metal cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **red rubber cylinder → off**: This indicates that the red rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **brown rubber sphere → on**: The brown rubber sphere alone activates the detector.\n\n3. **brown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on**: The combination of a brown rubber sphere and a red rubber cylinder activates the detector. Since the brown rubber sphere alone activates the detector, the red rubber cylinder does not affect the activation in this combination.\n\n4. **blue metal cube → off**: The blue metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\n5. **yellow metal cube → off**: The yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\n6. **gray metal sphere, red metal cube → on**: The combination of a gray metal sphere and a red metal cube activates the detector. This suggests that either the gray metal sphere or the red metal cube (or both) could be responsible for activation.\n\nNow, let's focus on the new test case \"red metal cube\":\n\n- The red metal cube was part of a combination that activated the detector (gray metal sphere, red metal cube → on). However, we do not have evidence that the red metal cube alone can activate the detector, as it was only tested in combination with the gray metal sphere.\n\nGiven the available evidence, we cannot conclusively determine if the red metal cube alone will activate the detector. Therefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case is \"undetermined.\"\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
