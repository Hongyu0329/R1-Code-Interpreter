  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber sphere → off\nblue metal sphere, red rubber sphere → on\nblue metal sphere → on\nred metal sphere, brown rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, brown rubber sphere, red metal sphere → on\nyellow rubber sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nred rubber sphere, yellow rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Red Rubber Sphere**: \n   - Alone, it results in \"off\".\n   - In combination with a blue metal sphere, it results in \"on\".\n\n2. **Blue Metal Sphere**:\n   - Alone, it results in \"on\".\n   - In combination with a red rubber sphere, it results in \"on\".\n\n3. **Red Metal Sphere**:\n   - Alone, it results in \"off\".\n   - In combination with a brown rubber sphere, it results in \"off\".\n   - In combination with a gray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, and brown rubber sphere, it results in \"on\".\n\n4. **Yellow Rubber Sphere**:\n   - Alone, it results in \"on\".\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- The blue metal sphere and yellow rubber sphere seem to have the property of activating the detector, as they cause the detector to turn on when present.\n- The red rubber sphere does not activate the detector on its own, but it does not prevent activation when combined with an activating object.\n\nFor the new test case:\n- The combination is \"red rubber sphere, yellow rubber sphere\".\n- The yellow rubber sphere alone activates the detector.\n\nTherefore, the presence of the yellow rubber sphere in the new test case should activate the detector, regardless of the presence of the red rubber sphere.\n\n<<<on>>>"
