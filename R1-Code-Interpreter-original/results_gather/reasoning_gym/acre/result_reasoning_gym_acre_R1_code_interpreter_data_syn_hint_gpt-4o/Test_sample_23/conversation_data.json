  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nblue rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off\nbrown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cylinder, green rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Cyan Metal Cylinder**: \n   - Alone, it turns the detector on.\n   - With a blue rubber cylinder, it still turns the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the cyan metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\n2. **Blue Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - Alone, it turns the detector off.\n   - With a cyan metal cylinder, the detector is on, but this is likely due to the cyan metal cylinder being a blicket.\n   - This suggests that the blue rubber cylinder is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Brown Rubber Sphere**:\n   - Alone, it turns the detector on.\n   - With a brown rubber cube, it still turns the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the brown rubber sphere is a blicket.\n\n4. **Brown Rubber Cube, Green Rubber Sphere, Cyan Metal Cube**:\n   - Together, they turn the detector off.\n   - This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n\n5. **Brown Rubber Sphere, Brown Rubber Cube**:\n   - Together, they turn the detector on.\n   - Since the brown rubber sphere is already identified as a blicket, the brown rubber cube is likely not a blicket.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: **Blue Rubber Cylinder, Green Rubber Sphere**.\n\n- The blue rubber cylinder is not a blicket, as determined from previous results.\n- The green rubber sphere is also not a blicket, as determined from the combination with the brown rubber cube and cyan metal cube.\n\nSince neither the blue rubber cylinder nor the green rubber sphere is a blicket, the detector will not turn on.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
