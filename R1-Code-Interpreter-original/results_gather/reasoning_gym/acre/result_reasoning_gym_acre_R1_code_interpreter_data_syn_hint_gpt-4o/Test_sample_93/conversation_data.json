  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\nyellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on\nyellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case \"yellow metal cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **brown metal cube → off**: The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n2. **yellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on**: The combination of yellow metal cylinder and brown metal cube activates the detector. This suggests that the yellow metal cylinder might be a blicket.\n3. **yellow metal cylinder → on**: The yellow metal cylinder alone activates the detector, confirming that it is a blicket.\n4. **cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector.\n5. **cyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on**: This combination activates the detector, but it does not involve the yellow metal cylinder.\n6. **green rubber cube → off**: The green rubber cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\nFrom the above observations, the yellow metal cylinder consistently activates the detector, both alone and in combination with other objects. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the yellow metal cylinder is a blicket and will activate the detector.\n\nThe detector light status for the new test case \"yellow metal cylinder\" is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
