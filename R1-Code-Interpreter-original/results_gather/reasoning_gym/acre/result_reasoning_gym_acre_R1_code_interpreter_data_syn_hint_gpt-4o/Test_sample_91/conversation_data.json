  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber sphere, cyan metal cylinder → on\ncyan metal cylinder → off\ngray rubber cube, purple metal cube, yellow metal cylinder → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, purple metal cube, gray rubber cube, yellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal cylinder, gray rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Gray Rubber Sphere**: \n   - Alone, it turns the detector on.\n   - With a cyan metal cylinder, it still turns the detector on.\n\n2. **Cyan Metal Cylinder**:\n   - Alone, it does not turn the detector on.\n   - With a gray rubber sphere, the detector is on, suggesting the gray rubber sphere is the activating object.\n\n3. **Gray Rubber Cube, Purple Metal Cube, Yellow Metal Cylinder**:\n   - This combination does not turn the detector on.\n\n4. **Cyan Rubber Cylinder, Purple Metal Cube, Gray Rubber Cube, Yellow Metal Cylinder**:\n   - This combination turns the detector on, suggesting the cyan rubber cylinder is the activating object since the gray rubber cube, purple metal cube, and yellow metal cylinder were previously shown not to activate the detector.\n\n5. **Cyan Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - Alone, it turns the detector on.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce:\n- The gray rubber sphere is a blicket (activates the detector).\n- The cyan rubber cylinder is a blicket.\n- The gray rubber cube, purple metal cube, yellow metal cylinder, and cyan metal cylinder are not blickets.\n\nFor the new test case:\n- **Cyan Metal Cylinder, Gray Rubber Cube**: \n  - Both objects have been shown not to activate the detector in previous experiments.\n\nTherefore, the detector light will stay off for this combination.\n\n<<<off>>>"
