  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber cylinder → off\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on\nblue metal cube → off\nyellow metal cube → off\ngray metal sphere, red metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal cube, gray metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - The red rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector (off).\n   - The brown rubber sphere alone activates the detector (on).\n   - The combination of a brown rubber sphere and a red rubber cylinder activates the detector (on). This suggests that the brown rubber sphere is a blicket.\n   - The blue metal cube alone does not activate the detector (off).\n   - The yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector (off).\n   - The combination of a gray metal sphere and a red metal cube activates the detector (on). This suggests that either the gray metal sphere or the red metal cube, or both, are blickets.\n\n2. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - The new test case involves a yellow metal cube and a gray metal sphere.\n   - From previous results, the yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector (off).\n   - The gray metal sphere, when combined with a red metal cube, activates the detector (on). This suggests that the gray metal sphere could be a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the gray metal sphere has been associated with activating the detector in a previous experiment, it is likely that it is a blicket.\n   - Therefore, the presence of the gray metal sphere in the new test case suggests that the detector will turn on.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the detector light status for the new test case is \"on\".\n\n<<<answer>>> on"
