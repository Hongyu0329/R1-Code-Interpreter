  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber sphere, cyan metal cylinder → on\ncyan metal cylinder → off\ngray rubber cube, purple metal cube, yellow metal cylinder → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, purple metal cube, gray rubber cube, yellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\npurple metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"purple metal cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Gray Rubber Sphere**: \n   - Alone, it turns the detector on.\n   - With a cyan metal cylinder, it still turns the detector on.\n\n2. **Cyan Metal Cylinder**:\n   - Alone, it turns the detector off.\n   - With a gray rubber sphere, it turns the detector on.\n\n3. **Gray Rubber Cube, Purple Metal Cube, Yellow Metal Cylinder**:\n   - This combination turns the detector off.\n\n4. **Cyan Rubber Cylinder, Purple Metal Cube, Gray Rubber Cube, Yellow Metal Cylinder**:\n   - This combination turns the detector on.\n\n5. **Cyan Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - Alone, it turns the detector on.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- The gray rubber sphere is likely a blicket since it consistently turns the detector on.\n- The cyan rubber cylinder is also likely a blicket since it turns the detector on both alone and in combination.\n- The cyan metal cylinder is not a blicket since it turns the detector off when alone.\n- The purple metal cube, when combined with other objects, has resulted in both on and off outcomes, making it difficult to determine its status as a blicket.\n\nFor the new test case \"purple metal cube\":\n- In the previous experiments, the purple metal cube was part of a combination that turned the detector off and another combination that turned it on. However, in both cases, it was not alone, and the presence of other objects complicates the determination of its individual effect.\n\nGiven the lack of consistent evidence regarding the purple metal cube's ability to activate the detector on its own, the status of the detector light for this new test case is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
