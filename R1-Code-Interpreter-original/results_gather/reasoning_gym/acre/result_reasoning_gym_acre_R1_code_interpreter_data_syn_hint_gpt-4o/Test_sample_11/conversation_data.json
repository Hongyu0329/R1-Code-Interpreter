  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cylinder → on\nblue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube, blue metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - The blue metal cylinder alone turns the detector on.\n   - The blue metal cylinder combined with the gray rubber cylinder also turns the detector on. This suggests that the blue metal cylinder is a blicket.\n   - The cyan metal cube and brown rubber cube together turn the detector on, but the brown rubber cube and cyan rubber cube together turn it off. This suggests that the cyan metal cube might be a blicket, but the brown rubber cube and cyan rubber cube are not.\n   - The gray rubber cylinder alone turns the detector off, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\n2. **New Test Case:**\n   - The new combination includes a brown rubber cube, a cyan rubber cube, and a blue metal cylinder.\n   - From the previous results, we know that the blue metal cylinder is a blicket and can activate the detector on its own.\n\nGiven this information, the presence of the blue metal cylinder in the new test case is sufficient to conclude that the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
