  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector.

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"gray rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Gray Rubber Sphere**: The detector turns on when a gray rubber sphere is placed on it. This suggests that the gray rubber sphere is a blicket.\n\n2. **Gray Rubber Sphere, Cyan Metal Cylinder**: The detector still turns on with this combination, reinforcing the idea that the gray rubber sphere is a blicket. The cyan metal cylinder alone does not activate the detector, as seen in the third result.\n\n3. **Cyan Metal Cylinder**: The detector stays off, indicating that the cyan metal cylinder is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Gray Rubber Cube, Purple Metal Cube, Yellow Metal Cylinder**: The detector stays off with this combination. This suggests that none of these objects are blickets, or at least not in this combination.\n\n5. **Cyan Rubber Cylinder, Purple Metal Cube, Gray Rubber Cube, Yellow Metal Cylinder**: The detector turns on. The cyan rubber cylinder is likely a blicket, as it turns on the detector by itself in the sixth result.\n\n6. **Cyan Rubber Cylinder**: The detector turns on, confirming that the cyan rubber cylinder is a blicket.\n\nNow, let's focus on the new test case \"gray rubber cube\":\n\n- In the fourth result, the gray rubber cube was part of a combination that did not activate the detector. This suggests that the gray rubber cube is not a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, the gray rubber cube alone is not sufficient to activate the detector. Therefore, the detector light will stay off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
