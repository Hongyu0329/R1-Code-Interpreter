  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cylinder → off\npurple metal cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\npurple metal cube → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, cyan rubber cube → on\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube, red rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object effects:**\n   - Blue rubber cylinder: off\n   - Purple metal cube: on\n   - Cyan rubber cube: off\n   - Cyan metal cube: off\n   - Red rubber cube: on\n\n2. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - Purple metal cube + blue rubber cylinder: on\n     - Since the purple metal cube alone turns the detector on, it is likely the cause of the detector turning on in this combination.\n   - Cyan rubber cube + cyan metal cube: off\n     - Both objects individually do not activate the detector, and together they also do not activate it.\n   - Red rubber cube + gray metal cylinder + cyan rubber cube: on\n     - The red rubber cube alone turns the detector on, suggesting it is the cause in this combination.\n   - Red rubber cube + cyan metal cube: on\n     - Again, the red rubber cube is likely the cause of the detector turning on.\n\n3. **Determine the effect of each object in the new test case:**\n   - Cyan rubber cube: off\n   - Cyan metal cube: off\n   - Red rubber cube: on\n\n4. **Conclusion for the new test case:**\n   - The presence of the red rubber cube, which has consistently turned the detector on in previous experiments, suggests that the detector will turn on in the new test case.\n\nBased on the analysis, the detector light status for the new test case is on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
