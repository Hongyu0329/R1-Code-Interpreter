In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector.

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red rubber cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Identify objects in each test case:**\n   - Test 1: yellow rubber sphere, cyan rubber cube → on\n   - Test 2: cyan rubber cube → off\n   - Test 3: yellow rubber sphere → on\n   - Test 4: red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → off\n   - Test 5: blue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder, red rubber cylinder, red metal cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n   - Test 6: red metal cylinder, yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, red rubber cylinder → off\n\n2. **Determine the effect of each object:**\n   - The \"yellow rubber sphere\" appears in tests 1 and 3, both resulting in \"on.\" This suggests it might be a blicket.\n   - The \"cyan rubber cube\" appears in tests 1 and 2. It is \"on\" in test 1 (with the yellow rubber sphere) and \"off\" in test 2 (alone), suggesting it is not a blicket.\n   - The \"red rubber cylinder\" appears in tests 4, 5, and 6. It is \"off\" in tests 4 and 6, and \"on\" in test 5. This suggests it is not a blicket, as it does not consistently cause the detector to turn on.\n   - The \"red metal cylinder\" appears in tests 4, 5, and 6. It is \"off\" in tests 4 and 6, and \"on\" in test 5. This suggests it is not a blicket.\n   - The \"yellow metal sphere\" appears in tests 4, 5, and 6. It is \"off\" in tests 4 and 6, and \"on\" in test 5. This suggests it is not a blicket.\n   - The \"yellow rubber cylinder\" appears in tests 4 and 6, both resulting in \"off.\" This suggests it is not a blicket.\n   - The \"blue metal cube\" and \"purple rubber cylinder\" appear only in test 5, which is \"on.\" We cannot determine their individual effects from this single occurrence.\n\n3. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - The new test case is \"red rubber cylinder.\"\n   - From the analysis, the \"red rubber cylinder\" does not consistently cause the detector to turn on, as it was \"off\" in tests 4 and 6.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the detector light status for the new test case \"red rubber cylinder\" is determined to be \"off.\"\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
