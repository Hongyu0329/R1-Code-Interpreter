  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\ngray rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube, blue metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The gray rubber cube alone turns the detector on.\n   - The purple rubber cube alone turns the detector off.\n   - The combination of gray rubber cube and purple rubber cube turns the detector on, suggesting the gray rubber cube is a blicket.\n   - The combination of blue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, and green metal cylinder turns the detector on. This suggests at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n   - The combination of gray metal cube and red rubber cube turns the detector off.\n   - The combination of green metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, and red rubber cube turns the detector off.\n\n2. **Analyze the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case includes a gray metal cube, a red rubber cube, and a blue metal cylinder.\n   - From previous results, the gray metal cube and red rubber cube together do not activate the detector.\n   - The blue metal cylinder was part of a combination that turned the detector on.\n\n3. **Determine the Causal Object:**\n   - Since the blue metal cylinder was part of a combination that turned the detector on, it is likely a blicket.\n   - The gray metal cube and red rubber cube combination alone does not activate the detector, so they are not blickets.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The presence of the blue metal cylinder in the new test case suggests that the detector will turn on, as it was part of a previous combination that activated the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
