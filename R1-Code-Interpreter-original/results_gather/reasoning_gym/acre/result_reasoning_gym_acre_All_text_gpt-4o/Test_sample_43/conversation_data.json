  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber cylinder → off\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on\nblue metal cube → off\nyellow metal cube → off\ngray metal sphere, red metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal cube, red metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object effects:**\n   - Red rubber cylinder: off\n   - Brown rubber sphere: on\n   - Blue metal cube: off\n   - Yellow metal cube: off\n\n2. **Identify combinations of objects:**\n   - Brown rubber sphere + red rubber cylinder: on\n   - Gray metal sphere + red metal cube: on\n\n3. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - New test case: yellow metal cube, red metal cube\n\n4. **Determine the effect of each object in the new test case:**\n   - Yellow metal cube: previously tested alone and resulted in off.\n   - Red metal cube: previously tested in combination with gray metal sphere and resulted in on.\n\n5. **Consider the effect of combinations:**\n   - The combination of gray metal sphere and red metal cube resulted in on, suggesting that the red metal cube might have a causal effect when combined with certain objects.\n\n6. **Evaluate the new combination:**\n   - The yellow metal cube alone results in off.\n   - The red metal cube, when combined with the gray metal sphere, results in on. However, there is no evidence that the red metal cube alone or with the yellow metal cube will result in on.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the combination of yellow metal cube and red metal cube will activate the detector, as the red metal cube's effect is only observed in combination with the gray metal sphere.\n\nBased on the analysis, the detector light status for the new test case is undetermined.\n\nFinal answer: <<<undetermined>>>"
