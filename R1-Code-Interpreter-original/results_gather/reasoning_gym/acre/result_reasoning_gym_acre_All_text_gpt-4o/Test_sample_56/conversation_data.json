  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nyellow rubber cylinder → off\nyellow metal sphere → on\nyellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nblue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\npurple rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"purple rubber cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **yellow rubber cylinder → off**: The yellow rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **yellow metal sphere → on**: The yellow metal sphere alone activates the detector.\n\n3. **yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → on**: The combination of the yellow metal sphere and yellow rubber cylinder activates the detector. Since the yellow rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector, the yellow metal sphere is likely the activating object.\n\n4. **yellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector. The purple rubber cube is part of this combination, suggesting it does not activate the detector.\n\n5. **blue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → on**: This combination activates the detector. However, since the purple rubber cube was part of a combination that did not activate the detector (as seen in point 4), it is unlikely to be the activating object here.\n\n6. **green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector. Again, the purple rubber cube is part of a non-activating combination.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the purple rubber cube appears in two combinations that do not activate the detector (points 4 and 6). There is no evidence from the previous results that the purple rubber cube can activate the detector on its own.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case \"purple rubber cube,\" the detector light status is determined to be off.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
