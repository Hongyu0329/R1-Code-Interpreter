  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal sphere, purple metal cylinder, yellow rubber sphere → off\npurple metal cylinder → off\ngreen metal cube, blue rubber cube, purple metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cylinder, gray rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object effects:**\n   - The gray rubber cylinder alone causes the detector to turn on.\n   - The green rubber cylinder alone causes the detector to stay off.\n   - The purple metal cylinder alone causes the detector to stay off.\n\n2. **Identify combination effects:**\n   - The combination of gray rubber cylinder and green rubber cylinder causes the detector to turn on.\n   - The combination of cyan metal sphere, purple metal cylinder, and yellow rubber sphere causes the detector to stay off.\n   - The combination of green metal cube, blue rubber cube, and purple metal cylinder causes the detector to turn on.\n\n3. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - The new test case involves the combination of a green rubber cylinder and a gray rubber cylinder.\n   - From the previous results, we know that the gray rubber cylinder alone is sufficient to turn the detector on.\n   - The presence of the green rubber cylinder, which alone causes the detector to stay off, does not negate the effect of the gray rubber cylinder when they are combined, as seen in the second example where both together still result in the detector turning on.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the gray rubber cylinder is present in the new test case and it has been shown to activate the detector in previous experiments, the detector light will turn on.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
