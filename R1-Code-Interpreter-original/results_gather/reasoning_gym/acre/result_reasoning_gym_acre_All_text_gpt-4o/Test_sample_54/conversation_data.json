  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder → on\nbrown metal cylinder → off\ngreen metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal sphere → on\nblue metal sphere, gray rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cylinder, green metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects that activate the detector:**\n   - The gray metal cylinder appears in two examples where the detector turns on:\n     - gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder → on\n     - gray metal cylinder → on\n   - The green metal cube appears in two examples where the detector turns on:\n     - green metal cube → on\n     - green metal cube, blue metal sphere → on\n\n2. **Identify objects that do not activate the detector:**\n   - The brown metal cylinder appears in one example where the detector stays off:\n     - brown metal cylinder → off\n   - The blue metal sphere appears in one example where the detector stays off:\n     - blue metal sphere, gray rubber cylinder → off\n\n3. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - The new test case involves a brown metal cylinder and a green metal cube.\n   - From the previous results, the brown metal cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - However, the green metal cube alone does activate the detector.\n\n4. **Determine the outcome for the new test case:**\n   - Since the green metal cube is known to activate the detector, its presence in the new test case suggests that the detector will turn on, regardless of the presence of the brown metal cylinder.\n\nBased on the analysis, the detector light status for the new test case is determined to be on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
