    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"green rubber sphere,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Cyan metal cylinder → on**: This indicates that the cyan metal cylinder is a blicket, as it activates the detector on its own.\n\n2. **Blue rubber cylinder → off**: This suggests that the blue rubber cylinder is not a blicket, as it does not activate the detector on its own.\n\n3. **Cyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the cyan metal cylinder, which is already known to be a blicket, causes the detector to turn on. The blue rubber cylinder does not affect the outcome.\n\n4. **Brown rubber sphere → on**: This indicates that the brown rubber sphere is a blicket, as it activates the detector on its own.\n\n5. **Brown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off**: None of these objects are blickets, as their combination does not activate the detector.\n\n6. **Brown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on**: The brown rubber sphere is already known to be a blicket, which explains why the detector turns on in this combination.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case \"green rubber sphere\":\n\n- From the previous results, the green rubber sphere was part of a combination that did not activate the detector (brown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off). This suggests that the green rubber sphere is not a blicket.\n\nSince the green rubber sphere has been shown not to activate the detector in the previous experiment, we can conclude that it will not activate the detector on its own.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"green rubber sphere\" is off.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
