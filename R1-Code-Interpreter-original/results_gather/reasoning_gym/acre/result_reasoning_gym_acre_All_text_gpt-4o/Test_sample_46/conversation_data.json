  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cylinder → off\npurple metal cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\npurple metal cube → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, cyan rubber cube → on\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube, gray metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object effects:**\n   - **Blue rubber cylinder:** Alone, it results in \"off.\"\n   - **Purple metal cube:** Alone, it results in \"on.\"\n   - **Cyan rubber cube:** Alone, it is not tested, but in combination with cyan metal cube, it results in \"off.\"\n   - **Cyan metal cube:** Alone, it is not tested, but in combination with cyan rubber cube, it results in \"off.\"\n   - **Red rubber cube:** Alone, it is not tested, but in combination with gray metal cylinder and cyan rubber cube, it results in \"on.\"\n   - **Gray metal cylinder:** Alone, it is not tested, but in combination with red rubber cube and cyan rubber cube, it results in \"on.\"\n\n2. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - **Purple metal cube, blue rubber cylinder:** Results in \"on,\" suggesting the purple metal cube is a blicket.\n   - **Cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube:** Results in \"off,\" suggesting neither is a blicket.\n   - **Red rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, cyan rubber cube:** Results in \"on,\" suggesting either the red rubber cube or gray metal cylinder is a blicket.\n   - **Red rubber cube, cyan metal cube:** Results in \"on,\" reinforcing that the red rubber cube is likely a blicket.\n\n3. **Determine the effect of each object in the new test case:**\n   - **Cyan rubber cube:** Previously tested with cyan metal cube, resulting in \"off.\"\n   - **Cyan metal cube:** Previously tested with cyan rubber cube, resulting in \"off.\"\n   - **Gray metal cylinder:** Previously tested with red rubber cube and cyan rubber cube, resulting in \"on.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion for the new test case:**\n   - The gray metal cylinder, when combined with the red rubber cube, resulted in \"on.\" Since the red rubber cube is not present in the new test case, we need to determine if the gray metal cylinder alone can activate the detector.\n   - The gray metal cylinder has not been tested alone, but its presence in a combination that resulted in \"on\" suggests it might be a blicket.\n   - However, since the gray metal cylinder's effect alone is not directly tested, and the other objects (cyan rubber cube and cyan metal cube) are known to result in \"off,\" the evidence is insufficient to definitively conclude the detector will turn on.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case is undetermined.\n\nFinal answer: <<<undetermined>>>"
