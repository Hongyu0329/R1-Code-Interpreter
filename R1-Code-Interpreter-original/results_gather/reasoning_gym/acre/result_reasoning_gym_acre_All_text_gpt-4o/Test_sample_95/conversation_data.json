  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\nyellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on\nyellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object effects:**\n   - **Brown metal cube:** Alone, it results in \"off.\"\n   - **Yellow metal cylinder:** Alone, it results in \"on.\"\n   - **Cyan rubber cube:** Alone, it results in \"off\" (in combination with other objects, but never alone).\n   - **Cyan metal cylinder:** Alone, it results in \"on\" (in combination with other objects, but never alone).\n   - **Green rubber cube:** Alone, it results in \"off.\"\n\n2. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - **Yellow metal cylinder + brown metal cube:** Results in \"on.\" The yellow metal cylinder seems to be the activating object since it also activates the detector alone.\n   - **Cyan rubber cylinder + cyan rubber cube + cyan metal cylinder:** Results in \"on.\" The cyan metal cylinder seems to be the activating object since it is the only object that appears in both \"on\" and \"off\" combinations.\n   - **Cyan rubber cube + cyan metal cylinder + green rubber cube:** Results in \"off.\" The presence of the cyan metal cylinder in an \"off\" combination suggests that the cyan rubber cube and green rubber cube might negate its effect.\n\n3. **Determine the effect of the new combination:**\n   - **Green rubber cube + cyan metal cylinder:** The green rubber cube alone results in \"off.\" The cyan metal cylinder has been part of both \"on\" and \"off\" combinations. However, the presence of the green rubber cube, which has consistently resulted in \"off,\" suggests it might negate the effect of the cyan metal cylinder.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that the green rubber cube has consistently resulted in \"off\" and the cyan metal cylinder's effect is negated in the presence of certain objects, the combination of the green rubber cube and cyan metal cylinder is likely to result in \"off.\"\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
