    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"brown rubber cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **brown metal cube → off**: The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **gray rubber cube → on**: The gray rubber cube alone activates the detector.\n\n3. **gray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on**: The combination of gray rubber cube and brown metal cube activates the detector. Since the gray rubber cube alone activates the detector, the brown metal cube does not affect the activation in this combination.\n\n4. **blue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector. None of these objects individually or in combination activate the detector.\n\n5. **brown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on**: This combination activates the detector. Since the blue rubber cylinder was part of a combination that did not activate the detector (see point 4), the brown rubber cube must be responsible for the activation.\n\n6. **green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector. Neither the green rubber cylinder nor the red rubber cube activate the detector.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the new test case:\n\n- **brown rubber cube**: From point 5, we know that the brown rubber cube, when combined with the blue rubber cylinder, activates the detector. Since the blue rubber cylinder alone was part of a combination that did not activate the detector, the brown rubber cube must have the property of activating the detector.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, the brown rubber cube alone should activate the detector.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
