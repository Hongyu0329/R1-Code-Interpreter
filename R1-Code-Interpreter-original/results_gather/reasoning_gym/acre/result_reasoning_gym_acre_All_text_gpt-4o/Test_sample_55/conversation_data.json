  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder → on\nbrown metal cylinder → off\ngreen metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal sphere → on\nblue metal sphere, gray rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects and their properties:**\n   - Gray metal cylinder\n   - Brown metal cylinder\n   - Green metal cube\n   - Blue metal sphere\n   - Gray rubber cylinder\n\n2. **Analyze previous results:**\n   - **Gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder → on**\n     - The presence of the gray metal cylinder seems to activate the detector.\n   - **Gray metal cylinder → on**\n     - Confirms that the gray metal cylinder alone can activate the detector.\n   - **Brown metal cylinder → off**\n     - The brown metal cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **Green metal cube → on**\n     - The green metal cube alone can activate the detector.\n   - **Green metal cube, blue metal sphere → on**\n     - The green metal cube activates the detector, regardless of the blue metal sphere.\n   - **Blue metal sphere, gray rubber cylinder → off**\n     - Neither the blue metal sphere nor the gray rubber cylinder activates the detector.\n\n3. **Determine the causal object(s):**\n   - The gray metal cylinder and the green metal cube are the only objects that have consistently activated the detector in previous tests.\n\n4. **Evaluate the new test case:**\n   - **Brown metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder**\n     - The gray metal cylinder is present in this combination.\n     - Previous results show that the gray metal cylinder activates the detector.\n\nBased on the analysis, the presence of the gray metal cylinder in the new test case suggests that the detector light will turn on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
