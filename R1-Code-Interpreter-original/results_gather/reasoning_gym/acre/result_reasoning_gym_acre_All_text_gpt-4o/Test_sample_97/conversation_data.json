    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"purple metal cylinder,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **gray rubber cylinder → on**: This indicates that the gray rubber cylinder is a blicket.\n\n2. **gray rubber cylinder, green rubber cylinder → on**: Since the gray rubber cylinder alone causes the detector to turn on, the addition of the green rubber cylinder does not change the outcome. This suggests that the green rubber cylinder is not a blicket.\n\n3. **green rubber cylinder → off**: This confirms that the green rubber cylinder is not a blicket, as it does not activate the detector on its own.\n\n4. **cyan metal sphere, purple metal cylinder, yellow rubber sphere → off**: None of these objects are blickets, as their combination does not activate the detector.\n\n5. **purple metal cylinder → off**: This directly shows that the purple metal cylinder is not a blicket, as it does not activate the detector on its own.\n\n6. **green metal cube, blue rubber cube, purple metal cylinder → on**: The presence of the purple metal cylinder in this combination does not affect the outcome, as it was previously shown to be non-blicket. Therefore, either the green metal cube or the blue rubber cube (or both) must be blickets.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the new test case:\n\n- **purple metal cylinder**: From the previous results, we know that the purple metal cylinder alone does not activate the detector (as shown in point 5).\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence from the previous experiments, the detector light status for the new test case \"purple metal cylinder\" is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
