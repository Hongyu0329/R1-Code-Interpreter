    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The blue rubber cube seems to be a consistent factor in turning the detector on:\n     - In the first example, the combination of a blue rubber cube and a purple rubber cube turns the detector on.\n     - In the third example, the blue rubber cube alone turns the detector on.\n   - The purple rubber cube alone does not activate the detector, as seen in the second example.\n   - The blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, and green metal cylinder do not activate the detector, as seen in the fourth and fifth examples.\n   - The yellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, and blue rubber cylinder combination turns the detector on, but the blue rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector, as seen in the fourth and fifth examples.\n\n2. **Analyze the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case includes the following objects: blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, and blue rubber cube.\n   - From the previous analysis, the blue rubber cube is a key object that has been associated with turning the detector on.\n\n3. **Determine the Detector Status:**\n   - Since the blue rubber cube is present in the new test case and has been shown to activate the detector in previous examples, we can conclude that the detector light will turn on.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
