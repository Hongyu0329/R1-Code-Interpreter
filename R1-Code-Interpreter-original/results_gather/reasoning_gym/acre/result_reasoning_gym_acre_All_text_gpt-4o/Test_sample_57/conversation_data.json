    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue metal sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects that activate the detector:**\n   - The \"yellow metal sphere\" alone causes the detector to turn on.\n   - The combination of \"yellow metal sphere\" and \"yellow rubber cylinder\" also causes the detector to turn on. This suggests that the \"yellow metal sphere\" is likely a blicket, as it activates the detector both alone and in combination with another object.\n\n2. **Identify objects that do not activate the detector:**\n   - The \"yellow rubber cylinder\" alone does not activate the detector.\n   - The combination of \"yellow metal cube,\" \"red metal cylinder,\" and \"purple rubber cube\" does not activate the detector.\n   - The combination of \"green rubber cube,\" \"red metal cylinder,\" \"purple rubber cube,\" and \"yellow metal cube\" does not activate the detector.\n\n3. **Analyze the combination that activates the detector:**\n   - The combination of \"blue metal sphere,\" \"purple metal cube,\" \"red metal cylinder,\" \"green rubber cube,\" \"purple rubber cube,\" and \"yellow metal cube\" activates the detector. Since the \"yellow metal cube,\" \"red metal cylinder,\" \"purple rubber cube,\" and \"green rubber cube\" are known to not activate the detector, the \"blue metal sphere\" or \"purple metal cube\" must be responsible for activating the detector.\n\n4. **Determine the status for \"blue metal sphere\":**\n   - Since the \"blue metal sphere\" is part of a combination that activates the detector and none of the other objects in that combination are known to activate the detector, it is reasonable to conclude that the \"blue metal sphere\" is a blicket and will activate the detector on its own.\n\nBased on this analysis, the detector light status for the new test case \"blue metal sphere\" is determined to be on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
