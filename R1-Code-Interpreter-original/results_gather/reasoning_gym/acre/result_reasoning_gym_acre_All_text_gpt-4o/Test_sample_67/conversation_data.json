In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector.

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects that consistently activate the detector:**\n   - The \"brown metal cube\" appears in two examples where the detector turns on:\n     - brown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\n     - brown metal cube → on\n   - The \"purple metal cube\" appears in one example where the detector turns on:\n     - purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\n   - The \"blue metal cylinder\" appears in two examples where the detector turns on:\n     - green metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\n     - purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\n\n2. **Identify objects that do not activate the detector:**\n   - The \"gray rubber cylinder\" appears in one example where the detector stays off:\n     - gray rubber cylinder → off\n   - The \"green rubber cube\" and \"red rubber cylinder\" appear in one example where the detector stays off:\n     - green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\n\n3. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - New test case: green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder\n   - The \"purple metal cube\" and \"blue metal cylinder\" have been associated with the detector turning on in previous examples.\n   - The \"green rubber cube\" and \"red rubber cylinder\" have been associated with the detector staying off in a previous example.\n\n4. **Determine the outcome:**\n   - Since the \"purple metal cube\" and \"blue metal cylinder\" have been associated with the detector turning on, and they are both present in the new test case, it is likely that the detector will turn on.\n   - The presence of \"green rubber cube\" and \"red rubber cylinder\" does not negate the effect of the \"purple metal cube\" and \"blue metal cylinder\" based on previous results.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is likely to be on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
