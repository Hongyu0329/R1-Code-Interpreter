  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\ngray rubber cube → on\ngray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\nbrown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cube, brown rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object effects:**\n   - **Brown metal cube:** \n     - Alone: off\n     - With gray rubber cube: on\n   - **Gray rubber cube:** \n     - Alone: on\n     - With brown metal cube: on\n   - **Blue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube:** \n     - All together: off\n   - **Brown rubber cube:** \n     - With blue rubber cylinder: on\n\n2. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - The gray rubber cube seems to be a blicket since it turns the detector on both alone and in combination with the brown metal cube.\n   - The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector, but when combined with the gray rubber cube, the detector turns on, suggesting the gray rubber cube is the activating factor.\n   - The brown rubber cube, when combined with the blue rubber cylinder, turns the detector on, suggesting it might be a blicket.\n   - The blue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, and red rubber cube together do not activate the detector, suggesting none of these are blickets.\n\n3. **Evaluate the new test case:**\n   - **Brown metal cube, brown rubber cube:**\n     - The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n     - The brown rubber cube, when combined with the blue rubber cylinder, activates the detector, suggesting it might be a blicket.\n\nGiven that the brown rubber cube has previously been part of a combination that activated the detector, it is reasonable to conclude that the brown rubber cube is a blicket. Therefore, in the new test case, the presence of the brown rubber cube should cause the detector to turn on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
