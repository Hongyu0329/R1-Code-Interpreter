  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cylinder → on\nblue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nblue metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the objects and their properties:**\n   - Gray rubber cylinder\n   - Blue metal cylinder\n   - Cyan metal cube\n   - Brown rubber cube\n   - Cyan rubber cube\n\n2. **Analyze the results:**\n   - Gray rubber cylinder alone results in \"off.\"\n   - Blue metal cylinder alone results in \"on.\"\n   - Blue metal cylinder with gray rubber cylinder results in \"on.\"\n   - Cyan metal cube with brown rubber cube results in \"on.\"\n   - Brown rubber cube with cyan rubber cube results in \"off.\"\n   - Cyan rubber cube with brown rubber cube results in \"off.\"\n\n3. **Determine the properties of blickets:**\n   - The blue metal cylinder alone activates the detector, indicating it is a blicket.\n   - The gray rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector, but when combined with the blue metal cylinder, the detector is still \"on,\" suggesting the blue metal cylinder is the activating object.\n   - The cyan metal cube, when combined with the brown rubber cube, activates the detector, suggesting the cyan metal cube is a blicket.\n   - The brown rubber cube and cyan rubber cube together do not activate the detector, indicating neither is a blicket.\n\n4. **Evaluate the new test case:**\n   - The new test case is a blue metal cylinder.\n   - From the previous results, the blue metal cylinder alone activates the detector.\n\nBased on the analysis, the detector light status for the new test case \"blue metal cylinder\" is \"on.\"\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
