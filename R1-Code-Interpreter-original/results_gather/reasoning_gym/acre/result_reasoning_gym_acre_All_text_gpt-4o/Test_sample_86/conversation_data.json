In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector.

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The blue rubber cube seems to be a blicket because:\n     - In the first example, the combination of a blue rubber cube and a purple rubber cube turns the detector on.\n     - In the third example, the blue rubber cube alone turns the detector on.\n   - The purple rubber cube alone does not activate the detector, as seen in the second example.\n   - The blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, and green metal cylinder do not activate the detector, as seen in the fourth and fifth examples.\n   - The yellow rubber cube might be a blicket because:\n     - In the sixth example, the combination of a yellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, and blue rubber cylinder turns the detector on.\n\n2. **Analyze the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case includes:\n     - Blue metal cube\n     - Blue metal cylinder\n     - Blue rubber cylinder\n     - Green metal cylinder\n     - Yellow rubber cube\n   - From the previous analysis, the blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, and green metal cylinder do not activate the detector.\n   - The yellow rubber cube is likely a blicket, as it was part of a combination that turned the detector on in the sixth example.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the yellow rubber cube is included in the new test case and is likely a blicket, it is reasonable to conclude that the detector will turn on.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
