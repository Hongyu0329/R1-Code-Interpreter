  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal sphere → off\nblue metal cube → on\nblue metal cube, cyan metal sphere → on\ngray metal cube, cyan metal cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, cyan metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal cube, gray metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The blue metal cube consistently causes the detector to turn on, as seen in the second and third examples.\n   - The cyan metal sphere consistently causes the detector to stay off, as seen in the first and third examples.\n   - The cyan metal cube causes the detector to stay off, as seen in the fifth and sixth examples.\n   - The gray metal cube, when combined with other objects, causes the detector to turn on, as seen in the fourth example.\n\n2. **Analyze the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case involves a cyan metal cube and a gray metal cube.\n   - From the previous results, the cyan metal cube alone does not activate the detector (fifth and sixth examples).\n   - The gray metal cube, when combined with other objects, has been associated with the detector turning on (fourth example).\n\n3. **Determine the Outcome:**\n   - Since the gray metal cube has been associated with the detector turning on in a previous example, and there is no evidence that the cyan metal cube can prevent the detector from turning on, it is reasonable to conclude that the presence of the gray metal cube will cause the detector to activate.\n\nBased on the analysis, the detector light status for the new test case is likely to be on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
