  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal sphere, purple metal cylinder, yellow rubber sphere → off\npurple metal cylinder → off\ngreen metal cube, blue rubber cube, purple metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object effects:**\n   - **Gray rubber cylinder:** Activates the detector (on).\n   - **Green rubber cylinder:** Does not activate the detector (off).\n   - **Cyan metal sphere:** Does not activate the detector (off).\n   - **Purple metal cylinder:** Does not activate the detector (off).\n   - **Green metal cube:** Activates the detector when combined with other objects (on).\n   - **Blue rubber cube:** Activates the detector when combined with other objects (on).\n\n2. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - **Gray rubber cylinder, green rubber cylinder:** The presence of the gray rubber cylinder seems to dominate, as the detector is on.\n   - **Cyan metal sphere, purple metal cylinder, yellow rubber sphere:** The detector is off, indicating none of these objects activate the detector.\n   - **Green metal cube, blue rubber cube, purple metal cylinder:** The detector is on, suggesting that either the green metal cube or the blue rubber cube (or both) can activate the detector.\n\n3. **Evaluate the new test case:**\n   - **Green rubber cylinder:** Known to be off.\n   - **Blue rubber cube:** Previously associated with an on result when combined with the green metal cube.\n   - **Green metal cube:** Previously associated with an on result when combined with the blue rubber cube.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The combination of the blue rubber cube and the green metal cube has previously resulted in the detector being on. Since both are present in the new test case, it is reasonable to conclude that the detector will turn on.\n\nBased on the analysis, the detector light status for the new test case is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
