  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal sphere, yellow metal cube → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nbrown metal sphere → on\nbrown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\ncyan metal sphere, gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere → on\npurple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nred rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The \"brown metal sphere\" appears in two combinations that result in the detector turning \"on\":\n     - brown metal sphere, yellow metal cube → on\n     - brown metal sphere → on\n   - The \"yellow metal cube\" alone results in the detector being \"off\":\n     - yellow metal cube → off\n   - The \"brown metal cylinder\" appears in a combination that results in the detector turning \"on\":\n     - cyan metal sphere, gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere → on\n   - The \"purple rubber sphere\" and \"red rubber cube\" appear in combinations that result in the detector being \"off\":\n     - brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\n     - purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\n\n2. **Analyze the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case is \"red rubber cube.\"\n   - In the previous results, the \"red rubber cube\" appears in two combinations, both resulting in the detector being \"off\":\n     - brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\n     - purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\n\n3. **Determine the Detector Status:**\n   - Since the \"red rubber cube\" has consistently appeared in combinations that result in the detector being \"off,\" it suggests that the \"red rubber cube\" does not have the property to activate the detector.\n\nBased on the analysis, the detector light status for the new test case \"red rubber cube\" is determined to be \"off.\"\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
