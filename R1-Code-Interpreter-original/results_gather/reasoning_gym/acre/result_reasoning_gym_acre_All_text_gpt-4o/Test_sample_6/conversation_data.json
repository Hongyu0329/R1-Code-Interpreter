  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber sphere → off\nblue metal sphere, red rubber sphere → on\nblue metal sphere → on\nred metal sphere, brown rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, brown rubber sphere, red metal sphere → on\nyellow rubber sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nred rubber sphere, yellow rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object effects:**\n   - Red rubber sphere: off\n   - Blue metal sphere: on\n   - Yellow rubber sphere: on\n\n2. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - Blue metal sphere + red rubber sphere: on\n     - Since the blue metal sphere alone causes the detector to turn on, it is likely the cause of the activation in this combination.\n   - Red metal sphere + brown rubber sphere: off\n     - Neither object seems to activate the detector.\n   - Gray metal sphere + cyan rubber cube + brown rubber sphere + red metal sphere: on\n     - The presence of the gray metal sphere or cyan rubber cube might be causing the activation, as the red metal sphere and brown rubber sphere alone do not activate the detector.\n   - Yellow rubber sphere: on\n     - The yellow rubber sphere alone activates the detector.\n\n3. **Evaluate the new test case:**\n   - New combination: red rubber sphere + yellow rubber sphere\n   - The red rubber sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n   - The yellow rubber sphere alone activates the detector.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the yellow rubber sphere alone is sufficient to activate the detector, the presence of the red rubber sphere does not change this outcome.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
