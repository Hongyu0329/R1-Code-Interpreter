  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\ngray rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube, green metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects that consistently activate the detector:**\n   - The gray rubber cube activates the detector when placed alone.\n   - The gray rubber cube also activates the detector when combined with the purple rubber cube.\n\n2. **Identify objects that consistently do not activate the detector:**\n   - The purple rubber cube does not activate the detector when placed alone.\n   - The gray metal cube and red rubber cube together do not activate the detector.\n   - The green metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, and red rubber cube together do not activate the detector.\n\n3. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - The combination of the gray rubber cube and purple rubber cube results in the detector turning on, suggesting the gray rubber cube is a blicket.\n   - The combination of blue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, and green metal cylinder results in the detector turning on, but it's unclear which specific object(s) are blickets.\n\n4. **Evaluate the new test case:**\n   - The new test case includes a gray metal cube, red rubber cube, and green metal cylinder.\n   - From previous results, the gray metal cube and red rubber cube together do not activate the detector.\n   - The green metal cylinder, when combined with other objects, has not shown a consistent pattern of activating the detector.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the gray metal cube and red rubber cube combination is known to not activate the detector, and the green metal cylinder has not been shown to activate the detector in previous tests, there is no evidence to suggest that this new combination will activate the detector.\n\nBased on the analysis, the detector light status for the new test case is determined to be off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
