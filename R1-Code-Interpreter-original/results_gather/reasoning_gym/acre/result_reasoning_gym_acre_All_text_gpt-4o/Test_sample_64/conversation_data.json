    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case \"brown metal cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **brown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on**: This combination turns the detector on. The presence of the brown metal cube might be a factor, but we cannot be certain yet because the gray rubber cylinder is also present.\n\n2. **gray rubber cylinder → off**: The gray rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector. This suggests that the gray rubber cylinder is not a blicket.\n\n3. **brown metal cube → on**: The brown metal cube alone activates the detector. This strongly indicates that the brown metal cube is a blicket.\n\n4. **green metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on**: This combination turns the detector on. We cannot determine which object is responsible without further information.\n\n5. **purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on**: This combination also turns the detector on. Again, we cannot determine which object(s) are responsible without further information.\n\n6. **green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off**: This combination does not activate the detector, suggesting that neither the green rubber cube nor the red rubber cylinder is a blicket.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the new test case:\n\n- **brown metal cube**: From the previous results, we know that the brown metal cube alone activates the detector (as seen in the third result). Therefore, the brown metal cube is a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, the detector light status for the new test case \"brown metal cube\" is determined to be on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
