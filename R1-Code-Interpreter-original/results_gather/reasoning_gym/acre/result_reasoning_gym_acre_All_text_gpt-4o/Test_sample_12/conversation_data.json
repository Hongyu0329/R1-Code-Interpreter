  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal sphere → off\nblue metal cube → on\nblue metal cube, cyan metal sphere → on\ngray metal cube, cyan metal cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, cyan metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"cyan metal sphere,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Cyan Metal Sphere**: \n   - Previous result: \"off\"\n   - This suggests that the cyan metal sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **Blue Metal Cube**: \n   - Previous result: \"on\"\n   - This indicates that the blue metal cube alone activates the detector.\n\n3. **Blue Metal Cube, Cyan Metal Sphere**: \n   - Previous result: \"on\"\n   - Since the blue metal cube alone activates the detector, the addition of the cyan metal sphere does not change the outcome.\n\n4. **Gray Metal Cube, Cyan Metal Cube, Cyan Metal Cylinder**: \n   - Previous result: \"on\"\n   - The presence of the gray metal cube or the cyan metal cylinder might be responsible for activating the detector, as the cyan metal cube alone (see point 5) does not activate it.\n\n5. **Cyan Metal Cube**: \n   - Previous result: \"off\"\n   - This suggests that the cyan metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\n6. **Red Rubber Cube, Cyan Metal Cylinder, Cyan Metal Cube**: \n   - Previous result: \"off\"\n   - This suggests that neither the red rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, nor the cyan metal cube alone or in combination activate the detector.\n\n**New Test Case Analysis**:\n- **Cyan Metal Sphere**: \n  - Based on the previous result for the cyan metal sphere alone, the detector light was \"off.\"\n\nGiven the consistent result that the cyan metal sphere alone does not activate the detector, we can conclude that the detector light will stay off for the new test case.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
