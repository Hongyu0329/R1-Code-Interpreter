  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\ngreen metal cylinder → on\nred metal sphere → off\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off\ngreen metal sphere → off\nyellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case \"green metal sphere,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **green metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on**: This combination turns the detector on. It suggests that either the green metal cylinder or the red metal sphere (or both) could be a blicket.\n\n2. **green metal cylinder → on**: This result indicates that the green metal cylinder alone is sufficient to activate the detector. Therefore, the green metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\n3. **red metal sphere → off**: This result shows that the red metal sphere alone does not activate the detector. Therefore, the red metal sphere is not a blicket.\n\n4. **yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off**: This combination does not activate the detector, suggesting that neither the yellow metal sphere nor the green metal sphere is a blicket.\n\n5. **green metal sphere → off**: This result confirms that the green metal sphere alone does not activate the detector. Therefore, the green metal sphere is not a blicket.\n\n6. **yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on**: This combination turns the detector on. It suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket, but it does not provide information about the green metal sphere.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the new test case:\n\n- **green metal sphere**: Based on the previous results, the green metal sphere alone does not activate the detector (as seen in point 5). Therefore, the detector light will stay off.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
