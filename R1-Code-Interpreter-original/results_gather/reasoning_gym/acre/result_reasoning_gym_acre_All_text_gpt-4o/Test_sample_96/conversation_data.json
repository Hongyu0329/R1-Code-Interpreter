    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue rubber cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Gray Rubber Cylinder:**\n   - Alone, it turns the detector on.\n   - With a green rubber cylinder, it still turns the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the gray rubber cylinder is a blicket.\n\n2. **Green Rubber Cylinder:**\n   - Alone, it does not turn the detector on.\n   - With a gray rubber cylinder, the detector is on, but this is likely due to the gray rubber cylinder being a blicket.\n   - This suggests that the green rubber cylinder is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Cyan Metal Sphere, Purple Metal Cylinder, Yellow Rubber Sphere:**\n   - This combination does not turn the detector on.\n   - The purple metal cylinder alone also does not turn the detector on.\n   - This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n\n4. **Green Metal Cube, Blue Rubber Cube, Purple Metal Cylinder:**\n   - This combination turns the detector on.\n   - The purple metal cylinder alone does not turn the detector on, so it is not a blicket.\n   - The blue rubber cube is part of a combination that turns the detector on, but it is not clear if it is a blicket or if the green metal cube is the blicket.\n\n5. **Blue Rubber Cube:**\n   - It is part of a combination that turns the detector on, but it is not tested alone.\n   - We cannot definitively say if the blue rubber cube is a blicket based on the available data.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the blue rubber cube has been part of a combination that turned the detector on, but it has not been tested alone. The presence of the green metal cube in the combination that turned the detector on suggests that it might be the blicket, not the blue rubber cube. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the blue rubber cube alone will activate the detector.\n\nFinal conclusion: The status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue rubber cube\" is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
