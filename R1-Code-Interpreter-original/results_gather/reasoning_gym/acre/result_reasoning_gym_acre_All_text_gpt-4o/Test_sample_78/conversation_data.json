    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The red metal sphere alone turns the detector on.\n   - The purple metal sphere alone turns the detector off.\n   - The combination of a red metal sphere and a purple metal sphere turns the detector on.\n   - The blue metal sphere, purple metal cube, and green metal cylinder together turn the detector off.\n   - The combination of red rubber cylinder, red rubber sphere, and purple metal cube turns the detector on.\n   - The combination of cyan rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, and red rubber sphere turns the detector on.\n\n2. **Analyze the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case involves a purple metal sphere and a red metal sphere.\n   - From the previous results, we know that the red metal sphere alone is sufficient to turn the detector on.\n   - The presence of the purple metal sphere does not prevent the detector from turning on when combined with the red metal sphere, as seen in the previous example where both were present and the detector turned on.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the red metal sphere is a blicket (activates the detector), and its presence in the combination is sufficient to turn the detector on, the new test case will also result in the detector turning on.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
