  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cylinder → off\npurple metal cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\npurple metal cube → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, cyan rubber cube → on\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\npurple metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case \"purple metal cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **blue rubber cylinder → off**: The blue rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **purple metal cube, blue rubber cylinder → on**: The combination of a purple metal cube and a blue rubber cylinder activates the detector. Since the blue rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector, the purple metal cube must be responsible for activating the detector in this combination.\n\n3. **purple metal cube → on**: The purple metal cube alone activates the detector. This confirms that the purple metal cube is a blicket.\n\n4. **cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube → off**: Neither the cyan rubber cube nor the cyan metal cube activates the detector.\n\n5. **red rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, cyan rubber cube → on**: This combination activates the detector. Since the cyan rubber cube alone does not activate the detector, either the red rubber cube or the gray metal cylinder (or both) must be blickets.\n\n6. **red rubber cube, cyan metal cube → on**: This combination activates the detector. Since the cyan metal cube alone does not activate the detector, the red rubber cube must be a blicket.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the new test case:\n\n- **purple metal cube**: From the previous results, we know that the purple metal cube alone activates the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"purple metal cube\" is determined to be \"on.\"\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
