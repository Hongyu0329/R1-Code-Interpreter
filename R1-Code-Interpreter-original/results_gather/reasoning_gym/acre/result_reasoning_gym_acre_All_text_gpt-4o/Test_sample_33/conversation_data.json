  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal sphere, gray rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, brown rubber cube, yellow metal cube, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal cube → off\nbrown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngray metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case \"gray metal sphere,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Gray metal sphere, gray rubber sphere → on**: This combination turns the detector on. The gray metal sphere might be a blicket, or the gray rubber sphere might be, or both.\n\n2. **Gray rubber sphere → off**: The gray rubber sphere alone does not activate the detector. This suggests that the gray rubber sphere is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Gray metal sphere → on**: The gray metal sphere alone activates the detector. This strongly suggests that the gray metal sphere is a blicket.\n\n4. **Red metal cylinder, brown rubber cube, yellow metal cube, yellow rubber cylinder → on**: This combination turns the detector on, but it involves different objects, so it doesn't directly inform us about the gray metal sphere.\n\n5. **Yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector, but it doesn't involve the gray metal sphere, so it doesn't directly inform us about it.\n\n6. **Brown rubber cube → off**: The brown rubber cube alone does not activate the detector, but it doesn't involve the gray metal sphere, so it doesn't directly inform us about it.\n\nFrom the analysis, the key observation is that the gray metal sphere alone activates the detector (as seen in the third result). This provides strong evidence that the gray metal sphere is a blicket and will activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case \"gray metal sphere,\" the detector light status is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
