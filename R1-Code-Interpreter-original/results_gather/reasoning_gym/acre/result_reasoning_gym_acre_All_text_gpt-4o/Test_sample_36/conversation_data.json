  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\ngreen metal cylinder → on\nred metal sphere → off\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off\ngreen metal sphere → off\nyellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case \"yellow rubber sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The combination \"green metal cylinder, red metal sphere\" results in the detector turning on.\n   - The \"green metal cylinder\" alone also results in the detector turning on.\n   - The \"red metal sphere\" alone results in the detector staying off.\n   - The combination \"yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere\" results in the detector staying off.\n   - The \"green metal sphere\" alone results in the detector staying off.\n   - The combination \"yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere\" results in the detector turning on.\n\n2. **Analyze the Role of Each Object:**\n   - The \"green metal cylinder\" seems to be a blicket since it causes the detector to turn on both alone and in combination.\n   - The \"red metal sphere\" is not a blicket since it does not activate the detector alone.\n   - The \"yellow metal sphere\" and \"green metal sphere\" do not activate the detector when combined, suggesting neither is a blicket.\n   - The \"yellow rubber sphere\" is part of a combination that turns the detector on, but it is unclear if it is a blicket since it is combined with other objects.\n\n3. **Evaluate the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case is \"yellow rubber sphere\" alone.\n   - The previous result with \"yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere\" turned the detector on, but it is not clear if the \"yellow rubber sphere\" alone is responsible for this activation.\n   - Since the \"yellow rubber sphere\" was only tested in combination with other objects, and there is no evidence of it being a blicket on its own, we cannot definitively determine its effect.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether the \"yellow rubber sphere\" alone will activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"yellow rubber sphere\" is undetermined.\n\nFinal answer: <<<undetermined>>>"
