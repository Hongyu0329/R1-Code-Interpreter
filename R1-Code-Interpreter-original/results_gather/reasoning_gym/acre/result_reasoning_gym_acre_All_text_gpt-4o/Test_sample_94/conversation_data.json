  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\nyellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on\nyellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube, cyan rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object effects:**\n   - **Brown metal cube:** off\n   - **Yellow metal cylinder:** on\n   - **Cyan rubber cube:** off\n   - **Cyan metal cylinder:** unknown (since it appears in both on and off combinations)\n   - **Green rubber cube:** off\n   - **Cyan rubber cylinder:** unknown (since it appears in an on combination)\n\n2. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - **Yellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube:** on\n     - The yellow metal cylinder is likely the activating object since it is on by itself.\n   - **Cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube:** off\n     - The cyan rubber cube and green rubber cube are both off individually, suggesting they do not activate the detector.\n   - **Cyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder:** on\n     - The cyan rubber cylinder might be the activating object since the cyan rubber cube is off individually.\n\n3. **New test case analysis:**\n   - **Green rubber cube, cyan rubber cube:**\n     - Both the green rubber cube and cyan rubber cube have been shown to be off individually.\n     - There is no evidence from previous experiments that these objects, when combined, activate the detector.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since both objects in the new test case have been shown to not activate the detector individually, and there is no evidence of them activating the detector in combination, the most logical conclusion is that the detector will stay off.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
