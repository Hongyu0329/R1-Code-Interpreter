    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects that consistently cause the detector to turn on:**\n   - The brown metal sphere appears in two examples where the detector turns on:\n     - brown metal sphere, yellow metal cube → on\n     - brown metal sphere → on\n   - The cyan metal sphere appears in one example where the detector turns on:\n     - cyan metal sphere, gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere → on\n\n2. **Identify objects that consistently do not cause the detector to turn on:**\n   - The yellow metal cube appears in one example where the detector turns off:\n     - yellow metal cube → off\n   - The purple rubber sphere and red rubber cube appear together in two examples where the detector turns off:\n     - brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\n     - purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\n\n3. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - The new test case includes:\n     - purple rubber sphere\n     - red rubber cube\n     - gray metal cylinder\n\n4. **Determine the effect of each object in the new test case:**\n   - The purple rubber sphere and red rubber cube have been shown to not activate the detector when they appear together.\n   - The gray metal cylinder appears in one example where the detector turns on, but it is not clear if it is the cause since it was combined with other objects (cyan metal sphere, brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the purple rubber sphere and red rubber cube together have consistently resulted in the detector staying off, and there is no clear evidence that the gray metal cylinder alone can activate the detector, the most likely outcome for the new test case is that the detector will stay off.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
