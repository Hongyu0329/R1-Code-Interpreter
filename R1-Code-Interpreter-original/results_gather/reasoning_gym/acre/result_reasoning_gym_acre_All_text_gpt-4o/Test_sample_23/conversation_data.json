  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nblue rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off\nbrown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cylinder, green rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The cyan metal cylinder consistently causes the detector to turn on, regardless of other objects present.\n   - The blue rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - The brown rubber sphere consistently causes the detector to turn on, regardless of other objects present.\n   - The combination of brown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, and cyan metal cube results in the detector staying off.\n   - The combination of brown rubber sphere and brown rubber cube results in the detector turning on.\n\n2. **Analyze the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case involves a blue rubber cylinder and a green rubber sphere.\n   - From previous results, the blue rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - The green rubber sphere was part of a combination that resulted in the detector staying off (brown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube).\n\n3. **Determine the Outcome:**\n   - Neither the blue rubber cylinder nor the green rubber sphere has been shown to activate the detector in previous experiments.\n   - There is no evidence from the previous results that this combination will activate the detector.\n\nBased on the analysis, the detector light status for the new test case is determined to be off.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
