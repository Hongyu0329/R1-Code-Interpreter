  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber cylinder → off\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on\nblue metal cube → off\nyellow metal cube → off\ngray metal sphere, red metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The red rubber cylinder alone results in the detector being off.\n   - The brown rubber sphere alone results in the detector being on.\n   - The combination of a brown rubber sphere and a red rubber cylinder results in the detector being on. This suggests that the brown rubber sphere is likely a blicket.\n   - The blue metal cube alone results in the detector being off.\n   - The yellow metal cube alone results in the detector being off.\n   - The combination of a gray metal sphere and a red metal cube results in the detector being on. This suggests that either the gray metal sphere or the red metal cube, or both, could be blickets.\n\n2. **Analyze the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case involves a yellow metal cube.\n   - From the previous results, we know that a yellow metal cube alone results in the detector being off.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the yellow metal cube alone has been tested before and resulted in the detector being off, we can conclude that the detector light will stay off for this new test case.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"yellow metal cube\" is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
