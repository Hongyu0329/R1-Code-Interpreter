  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal cube, green metal cube → on\nred metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nred metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case \"red metal cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Red Metal Cube, Green Metal Cube → On**: This combination turns the detector on. It suggests that either the red metal cube, the green metal cube, or both could be blickets.\n\n2. **Red Metal Cube → On**: This result shows that the red metal cube alone activates the detector. Therefore, the red metal cube is a blicket.\n\n3. **Green Metal Cube → Off**: This result indicates that the green metal cube alone does not activate the detector. Therefore, the green metal cube is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Blue Rubber Cube → On**: This result shows that the blue rubber cube alone activates the detector. Therefore, the blue rubber cube is a blicket.\n\n5. **Blue Metal Cube, Purple Metal Cube → On**: This combination turns the detector on. It suggests that either the blue metal cube, the purple metal cube, or both could be blickets.\n\n6. **Blue Rubber Cylinder, Purple Metal Cube → Off**: This result indicates that neither the blue rubber cylinder nor the purple metal cube alone or in combination activates the detector. Therefore, neither is a blicket.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the new test case:\n\n- **Red Metal Cube**: From the second experimental result, we know that the red metal cube alone activates the detector. Therefore, the detector light will turn on.\n\nBased on the analysis, the detector light status for the new test case \"red metal cube\" is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
