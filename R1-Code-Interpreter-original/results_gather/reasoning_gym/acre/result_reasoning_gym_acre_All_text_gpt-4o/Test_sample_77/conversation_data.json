    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red rubber sphere,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Red Metal Sphere → On**: This indicates that the red metal sphere is a blicket, as it activates the detector on its own.\n\n2. **Purple Metal Sphere → Off**: The purple metal sphere does not activate the detector on its own, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Red Metal Sphere, Purple Metal Sphere → On**: The presence of the red metal sphere is sufficient to activate the detector, as it was already established as a blicket.\n\n4. **Blue Metal Sphere, Purple Metal Cube, Green Metal Cylinder → Off**: None of these objects activate the detector, suggesting none are blickets.\n\n5. **Red Rubber Cylinder, Red Rubber Sphere, Purple Metal Cube → On**: The combination activates the detector. Since the purple metal cube was previously shown not to activate the detector, either the red rubber cylinder or the red rubber sphere (or both) must be blickets.\n\n6. **Cyan Rubber Cube, Red Rubber Cylinder, Red Rubber Sphere → On**: This combination also activates the detector. The cyan rubber cube is new, but since the red rubber cylinder and red rubber sphere were part of a previous successful activation, they are likely responsible for the activation.\n\nNow, let's focus on the new test case \"red rubber sphere\":\n\n- The red rubber sphere was part of two combinations that activated the detector: \"red rubber cylinder, red rubber sphere, purple metal cube\" and \"cyan rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, red rubber sphere.\"\n- In both cases, the red rubber sphere was present when the detector turned on, and since the purple metal cube and cyan rubber cube were previously shown not to activate the detector, the red rubber sphere is likely a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, the red rubber sphere is likely a blicket and should activate the detector.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
