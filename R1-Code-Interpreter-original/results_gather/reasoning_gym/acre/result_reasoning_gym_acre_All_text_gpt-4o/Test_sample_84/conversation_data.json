    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The combination \"blue rubber cube, purple rubber cube\" results in the detector turning on.\n   - A single \"purple rubber cube\" results in the detector staying off.\n   - A single \"blue rubber cube\" results in the detector turning on.\n   - The combination \"blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube\" results in the detector staying off.\n   - The combination \"blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder\" results in the detector staying off.\n   - The combination \"yellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder\" results in the detector turning on.\n\n2. **Analyze the Role of Each Object:**\n   - The \"blue rubber cube\" seems to be a blicket since it consistently causes the detector to turn on.\n   - The \"purple rubber cube\" alone does not activate the detector, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n   - The \"yellow rubber cube\" in combination with other objects (gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder) results in the detector turning on, but it is unclear if the yellow rubber cube alone is a blicket.\n\n3. **Evaluate the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case involves only the \"yellow rubber cube.\"\n   - From the previous results, the \"yellow rubber cube\" was part of a combination that turned the detector on, but it was not tested alone.\n   - There is no direct evidence from the previous results that the \"yellow rubber cube\" alone can activate the detector.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the \"yellow rubber cube\" was not tested alone in previous experiments, and there is no clear evidence that it is a blicket by itself, we cannot definitively determine if it will activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow rubber cube\" is undetermined.\n\nFinal answer: <<<undetermined>>>"
