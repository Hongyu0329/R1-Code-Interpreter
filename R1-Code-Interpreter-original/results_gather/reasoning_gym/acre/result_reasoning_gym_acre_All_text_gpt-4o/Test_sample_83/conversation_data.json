  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal cube, green metal cube → on\nred metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen metal cube, blue rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects and outcomes:**\n   - Red metal cube, green metal cube → on\n   - Red metal cube → on\n   - Green metal cube → off\n   - Blue rubber cube → on\n   - Blue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\n   - Blue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\n\n2. **Analyze individual object effects:**\n   - The red metal cube seems to activate the detector since it causes the detector to turn on both when alone and in combination with the green metal cube.\n   - The green metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - The blue rubber cube activates the detector when alone.\n   - The blue metal cube, when combined with the purple metal cube, activates the detector, but we don't have information about its effect alone.\n   - The purple metal cube does not activate the detector when combined with the blue rubber cylinder.\n\n3. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - The combination of red metal cube and green metal cube results in the detector turning on, likely due to the red metal cube.\n   - The combination of blue metal cube and purple metal cube results in the detector turning on, but the individual contribution of each is unclear.\n   - The combination of blue rubber cylinder and purple metal cube results in the detector staying off, suggesting neither activates the detector in this combination.\n\n4. **Evaluate the new test case:**\n   - New test case: green metal cube, blue rubber cube\n   - The green metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - The blue rubber cube alone activates the detector.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the blue rubber cube alone activates the detector, and it is part of the new test case, the detector will turn on.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
