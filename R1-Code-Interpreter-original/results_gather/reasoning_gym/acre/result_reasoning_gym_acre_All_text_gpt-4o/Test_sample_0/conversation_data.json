  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\ngray rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nred rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red rubber cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Gray Rubber Cube**: The detector turns on. This suggests that the gray rubber cube might be a blicket.\n\n2. **Purple Rubber Cube**: The detector stays off. This suggests that the purple rubber cube is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Gray Rubber Cube, Purple Rubber Cube**: The detector turns on. This reinforces the idea that the gray rubber cube is a blicket, as the presence of the purple rubber cube does not prevent activation.\n\n4. **Blue Rubber Cylinder, Blue Metal Cylinder, Brown Metal Cube, Green Metal Cylinder**: The detector turns on. This suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket, but it is unclear which one(s).\n\n5. **Gray Metal Cube, Red Rubber Cube**: The detector stays off. This suggests that neither the gray metal cube nor the red rubber cube is a blicket.\n\n6. **Green Metal Cylinder, Brown Metal Cube, Gray Metal Cube, Red Rubber Cube**: The detector stays off. This suggests that none of these objects are blickets, reinforcing the previous conclusion about the red rubber cube.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the red rubber cube has been tested in two different combinations, and in both cases, the detector stayed off. This provides sufficient evidence to conclude that the red rubber cube is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case \"red rubber cube,\" the detector light will stay off.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
