  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber sphere, cyan metal cylinder → on\ncyan metal cylinder → off\ngray rubber cube, purple metal cube, yellow metal cylinder → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, purple metal cube, gray rubber cube, yellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal cylinder, gray rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object effects:**\n   - **Gray rubber sphere:** Activates the detector (on).\n   - **Cyan metal cylinder:** Does not activate the detector (off).\n   - **Cyan rubber cylinder:** Activates the detector (on).\n   - **Gray rubber cube:** Does not activate the detector (off).\n   - **Purple metal cube:** Does not activate the detector (off).\n   - **Yellow metal cylinder:** Does not activate the detector (off).\n\n2. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - **Gray rubber sphere, cyan metal cylinder:** The detector is on. Since the gray rubber sphere alone activates the detector, the presence of the cyan metal cylinder does not change the outcome.\n   - **Gray rubber cube, purple metal cube, yellow metal cylinder:** The detector is off. None of these objects activate the detector individually, and their combination also does not activate it.\n   - **Cyan rubber cylinder, purple metal cube, gray rubber cube, yellow metal cylinder:** The detector is on. The cyan rubber cylinder alone activates the detector, so its presence in the combination causes the detector to turn on.\n\n3. **Determine the effect of the new combination:**\n   - **Cyan metal cylinder, gray rubber cube:** \n     - The cyan metal cylinder alone does not activate the detector (off).\n     - The gray rubber cube alone does not activate the detector (off).\n     - There is no evidence from previous experiments that the combination of these two objects would activate the detector, as neither has been shown to have the activating property.\n\nBased on the analysis, the new combination of a cyan metal cylinder and a gray rubber cube is expected to keep the detector light off, as neither object has been shown to activate the detector individually or in combination.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
