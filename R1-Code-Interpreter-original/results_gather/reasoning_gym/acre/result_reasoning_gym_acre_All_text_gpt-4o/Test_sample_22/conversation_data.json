  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nblue rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off\nbrown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cylinder, cyan metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - **Cyan Metal Cylinder:**\n     - Alone: on\n     - With Blue Rubber Cylinder: on\n   - **Blue Rubber Cylinder:**\n     - Alone: off\n     - With Cyan Metal Cylinder: on\n   - **Brown Rubber Sphere:**\n     - Alone: on\n     - With Brown Rubber Cube: on\n   - **Brown Rubber Cube, Green Rubber Sphere, Cyan Metal Cube:**\n     - Together: off\n   - **Brown Rubber Sphere, Brown Rubber Cube:**\n     - Together: on\n\n2. **Analyze Object Properties:**\n   - **Cyan Metal Cylinder** seems to be a blicket since it activates the detector both alone and in combination with the Blue Rubber Cylinder.\n   - **Blue Rubber Cylinder** does not activate the detector alone, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n   - **Brown Rubber Sphere** activates the detector both alone and in combination with the Brown Rubber Cube, indicating it is a blicket.\n   - **Brown Rubber Cube** does not activate the detector when combined with other non-blicket objects, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n   - **Cyan Metal Cube** does not activate the detector when combined with other non-blicket objects, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Evaluate New Test Case:**\n   - **Blue Rubber Cylinder, Cyan Metal Cube:**\n     - The Blue Rubber Cylinder is not a blicket.\n     - The Cyan Metal Cube is not a blicket.\n     - Since neither object is a blicket, the combination should not activate the detector.\n\nBased on the analysis, the detector light status for the new test case is determined to be off.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
