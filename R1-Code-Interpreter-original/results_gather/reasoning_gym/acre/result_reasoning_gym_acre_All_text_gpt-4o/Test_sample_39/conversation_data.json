  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\ngreen metal cylinder → on\nred metal sphere → off\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off\ngreen metal sphere → off\nyellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere, red metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects and outcomes:**\n   - Green metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\n   - Green metal cylinder → on\n   - Red metal sphere → off\n   - Yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off\n   - Green metal sphere → off\n   - Yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n\n2. **Analyze individual object effects:**\n   - The green metal cylinder seems to be a blicket because it causes the detector to turn on both when alone and in combination with the red metal sphere.\n   - The red metal sphere alone does not activate the detector, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n   - The yellow metal sphere alone does not appear in the results, but in combination with the green metal sphere, it does not activate the detector.\n   - The green metal sphere alone does not activate the detector, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n   - The yellow rubber sphere and brown rubber cylinder, when combined with the yellow metal sphere, activate the detector, but it's unclear which of these objects is responsible.\n\n3. **Evaluate the new test case:**\n   - The new test case includes a yellow metal sphere, a green metal sphere, and a red metal sphere.\n   - None of these objects have been shown to activate the detector on their own.\n   - The combination of yellow metal sphere and green metal sphere previously resulted in the detector staying off.\n   - The red metal sphere alone also results in the detector staying off.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since none of the objects in the new test case have been shown to activate the detector, and combinations of these objects in previous experiments have resulted in the detector staying off, we can conclude that the detector will not activate.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
