    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects and outcomes:**\n   - **yellow rubber sphere, cyan rubber cube → on**\n   - **cyan rubber cube → off**\n   - **yellow rubber sphere → on**\n   - **red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → off**\n   - **blue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder, red rubber cylinder, red metal cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on**\n   - **red metal cylinder, yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, red rubber cylinder → off**\n\n2. **Analyze individual objects:**\n   - **yellow rubber sphere**: Causes the detector to turn on when alone.\n   - **cyan rubber cube**: Does not cause the detector to turn on when alone.\n   - **red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder**: When combined, do not cause the detector to turn on.\n   - **blue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder**: When combined with other objects, cause the detector to turn on.\n\n3. **Focus on the purple rubber cylinder:**\n   - The purple rubber cylinder appears in one combination: **blue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder, red rubber cylinder, red metal cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on**.\n   - In this combination, the detector turns on, but it is not clear if the purple rubber cylinder alone is responsible, as it is combined with other objects.\n\n4. **Determine the effect of the purple rubber cylinder alone:**\n   - There is no direct evidence from the previous results that the purple rubber cylinder alone can activate the detector.\n   - The only instance where the purple rubber cylinder is present, it is part of a combination that includes other objects, making it impossible to isolate its effect.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is no clear evidence that the purple rubber cylinder alone can activate the detector, and it has not been tested in isolation, we cannot definitively determine its effect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the status of the detector light for the new test case with the purple rubber cylinder is undetermined.\n\nFinal answer: <<<undetermined>>>"
