  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal cube, green metal cube → on\nred metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue rubber cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **red metal cube, green metal cube → on**: This indicates that at least one of these objects is a blicket. Since the red metal cube alone also turns the detector on, the red metal cube is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **red metal cube → on**: Confirms that the red metal cube is a blicket.\n\n3. **green metal cube → off**: Indicates that the green metal cube is not a blicket.\n\n4. **blue rubber cube → on**: This suggests that the blue rubber cube is a blicket because it activates the detector on its own.\n\n5. **blue metal cube, purple metal cube → on**: At least one of these objects is a blicket. However, without further information, we cannot determine which one.\n\n6. **blue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off**: This suggests that neither the blue rubber cylinder nor the purple metal cube is a blicket.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the new test case:\n\n- **blue rubber cube**: From the previous result, the blue rubber cube alone turned the detector on. This strongly suggests that the blue rubber cube is a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, the detector light status for the new test case \"blue rubber cube\" is determined to be \"on.\"\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
