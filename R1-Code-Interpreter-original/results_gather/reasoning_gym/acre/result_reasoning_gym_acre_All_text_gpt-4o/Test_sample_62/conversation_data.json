    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects that consistently cause the detector to turn on:**\n   - The yellow rubber sphere appears in two examples where the detector turns on:\n     - yellow rubber sphere, cyan rubber cube → on\n     - yellow rubber sphere → on\n   - The blue metal cube appears in one example where the detector turns on:\n     - blue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder, red rubber cylinder, red metal cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n\n2. **Identify objects that consistently do not cause the detector to turn on:**\n   - The cyan rubber cube appears in one example where the detector turns off:\n     - cyan rubber cube → off\n   - The red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, and yellow rubber cylinder appear in examples where the detector turns off:\n     - red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → off\n     - red metal cylinder, yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, red rubber cylinder → off\n\n3. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - New test case: red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder, blue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder\n   - The new test case includes the blue metal cube, which is associated with the detector turning on in a previous example.\n   - The new test case also includes objects (red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder) that are associated with the detector turning off in previous examples.\n\n4. **Determine the outcome:**\n   - Since the blue metal cube is present in the new test case and has been associated with the detector turning on, it suggests that the detector will turn on.\n   - The presence of objects associated with the detector turning off does not negate the effect of the blue metal cube, as it has previously been part of a combination that turned the detector on.\n\nBased on the analysis, the detector light status for the new test case is determined to be on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
