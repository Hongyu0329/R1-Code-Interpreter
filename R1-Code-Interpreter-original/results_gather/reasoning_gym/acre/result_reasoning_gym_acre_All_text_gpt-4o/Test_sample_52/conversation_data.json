  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder → on\nbrown metal cylinder → off\ngreen metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal sphere → on\nblue metal sphere, gray rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\ngray metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case \"gray metal cylinder,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Gray Metal Cylinder, Brown Metal Cylinder → On**: This combination turns the detector on. It suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n\n2. **Gray Metal Cylinder → On**: This result shows that the gray metal cylinder alone can activate the detector. Therefore, the gray metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\n3. **Brown Metal Cylinder → Off**: This result indicates that the brown metal cylinder alone does not activate the detector. Therefore, the brown metal cylinder is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Green Metal Cube → On**: This result shows that the green metal cube alone can activate the detector. Therefore, the green metal cube is a blicket.\n\n5. **Green Metal Cube, Blue Metal Sphere → On**: Since the green metal cube is already known to be a blicket, this result does not provide new information about the blue metal sphere.\n\n6. **Blue Metal Sphere, Gray Rubber Cylinder → Off**: This result indicates that neither the blue metal sphere nor the gray rubber cylinder is a blicket, as the combination does not activate the detector.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the new test case:\n\n- **Gray Metal Cylinder**: From the previous results, we know that the gray metal cylinder alone activates the detector (as seen in the second result). Therefore, the gray metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, the detector light status for the new test case \"gray metal cylinder\" is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
