  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nbrown metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\npurple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\npurple metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"purple metal cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **brown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on**\n   - The combination of a brown metal cube and a gray rubber cylinder activates the detector.\n\n2. **gray rubber cylinder → off**\n   - The gray rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n\n3. **brown metal cube → on**\n   - The brown metal cube alone activates the detector, suggesting it is a blicket.\n\n4. **green metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on**\n   - The combination of a green metal cube and a blue metal cylinder activates the detector.\n\n5. **purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on**\n   - The combination of a purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, and green rubber cube activates the detector.\n\n6. **green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off**\n   - The combination of a green rubber cube and a red rubber cylinder does not activate the detector.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case \"purple metal cube\":\n\n- From the fifth example, we know that a combination including a purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, and green rubber cube activates the detector. However, we cannot determine if the purple metal cube alone is responsible for activation because the blue metal cylinder might be the activating object.\n- There is no direct evidence from the previous results that a purple metal cube alone activates the detector.\n- The purple metal cube was part of a combination that activated the detector, but without additional evidence, we cannot conclude that it is a blicket on its own.\n\nBased on the analysis, there is insufficient evidence to determine if the purple metal cube alone will activate the detector.\n\nFinal answer: <<<undetermined>>>"
