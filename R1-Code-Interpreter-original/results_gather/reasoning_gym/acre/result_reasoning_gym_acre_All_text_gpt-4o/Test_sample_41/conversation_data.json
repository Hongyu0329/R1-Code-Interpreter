    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case \"red metal cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **red rubber cylinder → off**: This indicates that the red rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **brown rubber sphere → on**: The brown rubber sphere alone activates the detector, suggesting it is a blicket.\n\n3. **brown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on**: The combination of a brown rubber sphere and a red rubber cylinder activates the detector. Since the brown rubber sphere is already known to activate the detector, the red rubber cylinder does not affect the outcome.\n\n4. **blue metal cube → off**: The blue metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\n5. **yellow metal cube → off**: The yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\n6. **gray metal sphere, red metal cube → on**: The combination of a gray metal sphere and a red metal cube activates the detector. This suggests that either the gray metal sphere, the red metal cube, or both could be blickets.\n\nNow, let's focus on the new test case:\n\n- **red metal cube**: We need to determine if the red metal cube alone can activate the detector.\n\nFrom the previous results, the red metal cube was part of a combination that activated the detector (gray metal sphere, red metal cube → on). However, we do not have evidence that the red metal cube alone is a blicket, as it was only tested in combination with the gray metal sphere.\n\nSince the red metal cube has not been tested alone and the previous results do not provide conclusive evidence that it is a blicket by itself, we cannot definitively determine if it will activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red metal cube\" is:\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
