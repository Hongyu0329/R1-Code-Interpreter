  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\nyellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on\nyellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the objects and their properties:**\n   - Objects are described by color, material, and shape.\n\n2. **Review previous results:**\n   - **brown metal cube → off**: The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **yellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on**: The combination activates the detector. Since the brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector, the yellow metal cylinder must be a blicket.\n   - **yellow metal cylinder → on**: The yellow metal cylinder alone activates the detector, confirming it is a blicket.\n   - **cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off**: None of these objects activate the detector.\n   - **cyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on**: The addition of the cyan rubber cylinder activates the detector, suggesting it is a blicket.\n   - **green rubber cube → off**: The green rubber cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\n3. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - **yellow metal cylinder**: From the previous results, we know that the yellow metal cylinder alone activates the detector.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the yellow metal cylinder is confirmed to be a blicket, it will activate the detector.\n\nBased on the analysis, the detector light status for the new test case \"yellow metal cylinder\" is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
