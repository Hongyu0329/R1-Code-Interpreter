  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber cylinder → off\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on\nblue metal cube → off\nyellow metal cube → off\ngray metal sphere, red metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal cube, gray metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object results:**\n   - Red rubber cylinder: off\n   - Brown rubber sphere: on\n   - Blue metal cube: off\n   - Yellow metal cube: off\n\n2. **Identify combinations and their results:**\n   - Brown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder: on\n   - Gray metal sphere, red metal cube: on\n\n3. **Analyze the results:**\n   - The brown rubber sphere consistently causes the detector to turn on, both alone and in combination with the red rubber cylinder.\n   - The red rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector, but in combination with the brown rubber sphere, the detector turns on. This suggests the brown rubber sphere is the activating object in that combination.\n   - The blue metal cube and yellow metal cube both result in the detector staying off, suggesting that metal cubes do not activate the detector.\n   - The gray metal sphere, when combined with the red metal cube, activates the detector. This suggests that either the gray metal sphere or the red metal cube, or both, could be blickets.\n\n4. **Evaluate the new test case:**\n   - The new test case involves a yellow metal cube and a gray metal sphere.\n   - The yellow metal cube alone results in the detector staying off.\n   - The gray metal sphere, when previously combined with the red metal cube, resulted in the detector turning on. This suggests that the gray metal sphere could be a blicket.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the gray metal sphere has been associated with the detector turning on in a previous experiment, it is reasonable to conclude that the gray metal sphere is likely a blicket.\n   - Therefore, in the new test case, the presence of the gray metal sphere suggests that the detector light will turn on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
