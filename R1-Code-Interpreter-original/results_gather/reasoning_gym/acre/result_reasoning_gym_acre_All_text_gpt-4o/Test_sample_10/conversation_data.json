  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cylinder → on\nblue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects and their properties:**\n   - Gray rubber cylinder\n   - Blue metal cylinder\n   - Cyan metal cube\n   - Brown rubber cube\n   - Cyan rubber cube\n\n2. **Analyze previous results:**\n   - **Gray rubber cylinder → off:** This suggests that the gray rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **Blue metal cylinder → on:** This indicates that the blue metal cylinder alone can activate the detector.\n   - **Blue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on:** The presence of the blue metal cylinder seems to be the activating factor, as the gray rubber cylinder alone was off.\n   - **Cyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on:** The cyan metal cube might be the activating factor here, as the brown rubber cube alone (in combination with cyan rubber cube) was off.\n   - **Brown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off:** Neither the brown rubber cube nor the cyan rubber cube alone or in combination activates the detector.\n   - **Cyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off:** Reiterates that neither the cyan rubber cube nor the brown rubber cube activates the detector.\n\n3. **Determine the activating objects:**\n   - The blue metal cylinder and the cyan metal cube are the only objects that have been associated with the detector turning on.\n\n4. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - **Brown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube:**\n     - The brown rubber cube and cyan rubber cube have been shown not to activate the detector.\n     - The cyan metal cube has been shown to activate the detector when combined with the brown rubber cube.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the cyan metal cube is present in the new test case and has previously been associated with the detector turning on, we can conclude that the detector light will turn on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
