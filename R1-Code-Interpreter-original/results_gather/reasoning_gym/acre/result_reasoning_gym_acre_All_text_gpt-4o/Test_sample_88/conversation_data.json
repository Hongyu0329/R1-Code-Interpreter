    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"purple metal cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Gray rubber sphere → on**: The gray rubber sphere alone activates the detector.\n\n2. **Gray rubber sphere, cyan metal cylinder → on**: The combination of gray rubber sphere and cyan metal cylinder activates the detector. Since the gray rubber sphere alone activates the detector, the cyan metal cylinder does not affect the outcome in this combination.\n\n3. **Cyan metal cylinder → off**: The cyan metal cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n\n4. **Gray rubber cube, purple metal cube, yellow metal cylinder → off**: This combination does not activate the detector. The presence of the purple metal cube in this combination does not activate the detector.\n\n5. **Cyan rubber cylinder, purple metal cube, gray rubber cube, yellow metal cylinder → on**: This combination activates the detector. The cyan rubber cylinder is known to activate the detector (as seen in the next point), so the presence of the purple metal cube does not prevent activation.\n\n6. **Cyan rubber cylinder → on**: The cyan rubber cylinder alone activates the detector.\n\nNow, let's focus on the new test case \"purple metal cube\":\n\n- In the fourth result, the purple metal cube was part of a combination that did not activate the detector.\n- In the fifth result, the purple metal cube was part of a combination that did activate the detector, but the activation was due to the presence of the cyan rubber cylinder, which is known to activate the detector on its own.\n\nFrom these observations, the purple metal cube has not been shown to activate the detector on its own. Therefore, based on the available evidence, the purple metal cube alone is not sufficient to activate the detector.\n\nFinal conclusion: The detector light status for the new test case \"purple metal cube\" is off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
