    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"cyan metal cylinder,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Cyan Metal Cylinder, Yellow Metal Cube → On**: This combination activates the detector. It suggests that either the cyan metal cylinder or the yellow metal cube (or both) could be a blicket.\n\n2. **Cyan Metal Cylinder → On**: This result shows that the cyan metal cylinder alone activates the detector. This strongly indicates that the cyan metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\n3. **Yellow Metal Cube → Off**: This result shows that the yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector. This suggests that the yellow metal cube is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Red Metal Cylinder, Gray Rubber Cube, Green Rubber Cube → Off**: This combination does not activate the detector. None of these objects are likely to be blickets.\n\n5. **Cyan Rubber Cylinder, Green Rubber Cube, Red Metal Cylinder, Gray Rubber Cube → Off**: This combination does not activate the detector. The cyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, and gray rubber cube are not blickets.\n\n6. **Green Metal Cube, Red Metal Cylinder → On**: This combination activates the detector. Either the green metal cube or the red metal cylinder (or both) could be a blicket.\n\nNow, let's focus on the new test case:\n\n- **Cyan Metal Cylinder**: Based on the second experimental result, the cyan metal cylinder alone activates the detector. This confirms that the cyan metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case \"cyan metal cylinder,\" the detector light will turn on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
