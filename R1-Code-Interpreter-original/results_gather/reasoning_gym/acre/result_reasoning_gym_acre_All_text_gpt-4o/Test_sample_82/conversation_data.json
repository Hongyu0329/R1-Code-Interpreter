  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal cube, green metal cube → on\nred metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen metal cube, blue rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects and outcomes:**\n   - Red metal cube, green metal cube → on\n   - Red metal cube → on\n   - Green metal cube → off\n   - Blue rubber cube → on\n   - Blue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\n   - Blue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\n\n2. **Analyze individual object effects:**\n   - The red metal cube seems to be a blicket since it causes the detector to turn on both when alone and in combination with the green metal cube.\n   - The green metal cube alone does not activate the detector, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n   - The blue rubber cube activates the detector when alone, indicating it is a blicket.\n   - The blue metal cube, when combined with the purple metal cube, activates the detector, but we cannot determine which of these is a blicket from this combination alone.\n   - The blue rubber cylinder, when combined with the purple metal cube, does not activate the detector, suggesting neither is a blicket in this combination.\n\n3. **Evaluate the new test case:**\n   - The new test case involves a green metal cube and a blue rubber cylinder.\n   - The green metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - The blue rubber cylinder, when previously tested with the purple metal cube, did not activate the detector.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Neither the green metal cube nor the blue rubber cylinder has been shown to activate the detector in previous tests.\n   - There is no evidence from the previous results that this combination will activate the detector.\n\nBased on the analysis, the detector light status for the new test case is determined to be off.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
