  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cube → off\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nyellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen metal cube, gray rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object effects:**\n   - Green metal cube alone results in \"off.\"\n   - Gray rubber cylinder alone results in \"on.\"\n\n2. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - Gray rubber cylinder and green metal cube together result in \"on.\" This suggests that the gray rubber cylinder has a strong effect, as it turns the detector on even when combined with the green metal cube, which alone results in \"off.\"\n   - Green rubber cylinder and purple rubber cube together result in \"off.\" This suggests neither has a strong effect to turn the detector on.\n   - Yellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, and gray metal cylinder together result in \"on.\" This suggests at least one of these objects has a strong effect.\n   - Gray metal cylinder and purple rubber cube together result in \"on.\" This suggests the gray metal cylinder has a strong effect, as the purple rubber cube alone does not turn the detector on.\n\n3. **Determine the effect of the gray rubber cylinder:**\n   - The gray rubber cylinder alone turns the detector on.\n   - In combination with the green metal cube, it still turns the detector on.\n\n4. **Conclusion for the new test case:**\n   - The new test case includes the gray rubber cylinder, which has been shown to turn the detector on both alone and in combination with other objects.\n   - Therefore, the presence of the gray rubber cylinder in the new test case is sufficient to determine that the detector light will turn on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
