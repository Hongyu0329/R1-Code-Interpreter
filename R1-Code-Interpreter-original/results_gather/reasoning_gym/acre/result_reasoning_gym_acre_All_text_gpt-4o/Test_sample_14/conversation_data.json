  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal sphere → off\nblue metal cube → on\nblue metal cube, cyan metal sphere → on\ngray metal cube, cyan metal cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, cyan metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal cube, red rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The blue metal cube consistently causes the detector to turn on, as seen in the second and third examples.\n   - The cyan metal sphere consistently causes the detector to stay off, as seen in the first and third examples.\n   - The cyan metal cube causes the detector to stay off, as seen in the fifth and sixth examples.\n   - The cyan metal cylinder does not seem to have a consistent effect on its own, but in combination with other objects, it has been part of both \"on\" and \"off\" results.\n\n2. **Analyze the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case involves a cyan metal cube and a red rubber cube.\n   - From previous results, the cyan metal cube has been associated with the detector staying off.\n   - The red rubber cube has only appeared once in the previous results, and in that instance, the detector stayed off.\n\n3. **Determine the Outcome:**\n   - Since the cyan metal cube has been associated with the detector staying off, and the red rubber cube has not been associated with turning the detector on, there is no evidence to suggest that this combination will activate the detector.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the combination of a cyan metal cube and a red rubber cube is expected to result in the detector staying off.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
