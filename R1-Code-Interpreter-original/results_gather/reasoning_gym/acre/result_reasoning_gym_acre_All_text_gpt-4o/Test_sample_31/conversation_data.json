  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan rubber cylinder → off\npurple rubber sphere, cyan rubber cylinder → on\npurple rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber cube, red metal sphere → off\nbrown metal cylinder → on\nbrown metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\ngray rubber cube, red metal sphere, purple rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object effects:**\n   - **Cyan rubber cylinder:** Alone, it results in \"off.\"\n   - **Purple rubber sphere:** Alone, it results in \"on.\"\n   - **Gray rubber cube:** In combination with the red metal sphere, it results in \"off.\"\n   - **Red metal sphere:** In combination with the gray rubber cube, it results in \"off.\" However, in combination with the brown metal cylinder, it results in \"on.\"\n   - **Brown metal cylinder:** Alone, it results in \"on.\"\n\n2. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - **Purple rubber sphere and cyan rubber cylinder:** Results in \"on.\" The presence of the purple rubber sphere seems to be a key factor in turning the detector \"on.\"\n   - **Gray rubber cube and red metal sphere:** Results in \"off.\" Neither object seems to activate the detector when combined.\n   - **Brown metal cylinder and red metal sphere:** Results in \"on.\" The brown metal cylinder seems to activate the detector, and the red metal sphere does not prevent it.\n\n3. **Determine the effect of the purple rubber sphere:**\n   - The purple rubber sphere alone turns the detector \"on,\" and it also turns the detector \"on\" when combined with the cyan rubber cylinder. This suggests that the purple rubber sphere is a strong activator of the detector.\n\n4. **Evaluate the new test case:**\n   - **Gray rubber cube, red metal sphere, purple rubber sphere:** The presence of the purple rubber sphere, which has consistently turned the detector \"on\" in previous tests, suggests that the detector will turn \"on\" in this new combination, regardless of the other objects.\n\nBased on the analysis, the presence of the purple rubber sphere is a decisive factor in activating the detector. Therefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
