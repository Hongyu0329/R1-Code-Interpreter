  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cube → off\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nyellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow rubber cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The \"gray rubber cylinder\" consistently causes the detector to turn on, both alone and in combination with the \"green metal cube.\"\n   - The \"green metal cube\" alone does not activate the detector.\n   - The \"purple rubber cube\" does not activate the detector when combined with the \"green rubber cylinder,\" but it does when combined with the \"gray metal cylinder.\"\n   - The \"yellow rubber cube\" is part of a combination that activates the detector when combined with the \"green metal cylinder\" and \"gray metal cylinder.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case is \"yellow rubber cube\" alone.\n   - In the previous results, the \"yellow rubber cube\" was part of a combination that activated the detector, but it was not tested alone.\n   - There is no direct evidence from the previous results that the \"yellow rubber cube\" alone can activate the detector.\n\n3. **Determine the Conclusion:**\n   - Since the \"yellow rubber cube\" was only tested in combination with other objects and not alone, and there is no clear pattern indicating it can activate the detector by itself, we cannot definitively conclude whether it will turn the detector on or off.\n\nBased on the analysis, the status of the detector light for the \"yellow rubber cube\" is undetermined.\n\nFinal answer: <<<undetermined>>>"
