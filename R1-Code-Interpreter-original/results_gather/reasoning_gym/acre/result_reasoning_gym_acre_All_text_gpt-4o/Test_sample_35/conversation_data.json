  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal sphere, gray rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, brown rubber cube, yellow metal cube, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal cube → off\nbrown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngray rubber sphere, brown rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects and outcomes:**\n   - Gray metal sphere, gray rubber sphere → on\n   - Gray rubber sphere → off\n   - Gray metal sphere → on\n   - Red metal cylinder, brown rubber cube, yellow metal cube, yellow rubber cylinder → on\n   - Yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal cube → off\n   - Brown rubber cube → off\n\n2. **Analyze individual objects:**\n   - **Gray metal sphere:** Appears in two tests, both resulting in \"on.\" This suggests it might be a blicket.\n   - **Gray rubber sphere:** Appears in two tests, one \"on\" and one \"off.\" This suggests it is not a blicket.\n   - **Red metal cylinder:** Appears once in an \"on\" test. Insufficient evidence to determine if it is a blicket.\n   - **Brown rubber cube:** Appears in two tests, both resulting in \"off.\" This suggests it is not a blicket.\n   - **Yellow metal cube:** Appears in two tests, one \"on\" and one \"off.\" Insufficient evidence to determine if it is a blicket.\n   - **Yellow rubber cylinder:** Appears in two tests, one \"on\" and one \"off.\" Insufficient evidence to determine if it is a blicket.\n\n3. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - The combination of gray metal sphere and gray rubber sphere results in \"on,\" suggesting the gray metal sphere is likely the blicket.\n   - The combination of red metal cylinder, brown rubber cube, yellow metal cube, and yellow rubber cylinder results in \"on,\" but since the brown rubber cube and yellow rubber cylinder are known to be \"off\" individually, the red metal cylinder or yellow metal cube might be blickets.\n\n4. **New test case analysis:**\n   - **Gray rubber sphere, brown rubber cube:** \n     - Gray rubber sphere is not a blicket (as it results in \"off\" when tested alone).\n     - Brown rubber cube is not a blicket (as it results in \"off\" when tested alone).\n\nSince both objects in the new test case are not blickets, the detector light will stay off.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
