  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal sphere, blue metal cube → on\nred metal sphere → on\nblue metal cube → off\nyellow metal cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off\nbrown metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue metal cube, blue metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects and outcomes:**\n   - Red metal sphere, blue metal cube → on\n   - Red metal sphere → on\n   - Blue metal cube → off\n   - Yellow metal cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off\n   - Blue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off\n   - Brown metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\n\n2. **Analyze individual objects:**\n   - **Red metal sphere:** Causes the detector to turn on, as seen in the first two examples.\n   - **Blue metal cube:** Does not cause the detector to turn on by itself, as seen in the third example.\n   - **Blue metal cylinder:** Does not cause the detector to turn on, as seen in the fourth and fifth examples.\n   - **Blue rubber cylinder:** Does not cause the detector to turn on, as seen in the fifth example.\n   - **Brown metal cylinder:** Causes the detector to turn on when combined with a blue rubber cylinder, as seen in the sixth example.\n\n3. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - The combination of a red metal sphere with any other object results in the detector turning on.\n   - The blue metal cube does not activate the detector by itself.\n   - The blue metal cylinder does not activate the detector by itself or in combination with a yellow metal cylinder or a blue rubber cylinder.\n\n4. **Evaluate the new test case:**\n   - New test case: Blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder\n   - Both the blue metal cube and the blue metal cylinder have been shown not to activate the detector in previous experiments.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since neither the blue metal cube nor the blue metal cylinder has been shown to activate the detector, and there is no evidence of a combination of these two objects causing the detector to turn on, we can conclude that the detector light will stay off.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
