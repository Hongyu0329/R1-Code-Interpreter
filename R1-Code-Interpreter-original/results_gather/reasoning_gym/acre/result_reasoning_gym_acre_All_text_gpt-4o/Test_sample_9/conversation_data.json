  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cylinder → on\nblue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ncyan rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"cyan rubber cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Gray Rubber Cylinder**: The detector is off. This suggests that the gray rubber cylinder does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **Blue Metal Cylinder**: The detector is on. This suggests that the blue metal cylinder activates the detector.\n\n3. **Blue Metal Cylinder, Gray Rubber Cylinder**: The detector is on. Since the blue metal cylinder alone activates the detector, the addition of the gray rubber cylinder does not change the outcome.\n\n4. **Cyan Metal Cube, Brown Rubber Cube**: The detector is on. This suggests that either the cyan metal cube or the brown rubber cube (or both) activate the detector.\n\n5. **Brown Rubber Cube, Cyan Rubber Cube**: The detector is off. This suggests that neither the brown rubber cube nor the cyan rubber cube activate the detector.\n\n6. **Cyan Rubber Cube, Brown Rubber Cube**: The detector is off. This further confirms that neither the cyan rubber cube nor the brown rubber cube activate the detector.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the new test case:\n\n- **Cyan Rubber Cube**: Based on the previous results (specifically the last two), the cyan rubber cube does not activate the detector, as it was tested in combination with the brown rubber cube and the detector remained off.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"cyan rubber cube\" is determined to be off.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
