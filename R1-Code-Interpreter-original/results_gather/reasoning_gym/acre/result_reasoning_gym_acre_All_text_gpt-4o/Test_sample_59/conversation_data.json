  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nyellow rubber cylinder → off\nyellow metal sphere → on\nyellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nblue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube, purple metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **yellow rubber cylinder → off**: The yellow rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **yellow metal sphere → on**: The yellow metal sphere alone activates the detector.\n\n3. **yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the yellow metal sphere still activates the detector, even with the yellow rubber cylinder.\n\n4. **yellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → off**: None of these objects activate the detector when combined.\n\n5. **blue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → on**: This combination activates the detector. The presence of the blue metal sphere or the yellow metal cube might be responsible, as other combinations with these objects have not been tested.\n\n6. **green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector, suggesting that the yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case:\n\n- **green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube, purple metal cube**\n\nFrom the previous results:\n- The combination of green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, and yellow metal cube was off.\n- The addition of the purple metal cube to this combination is the only change.\n\nSince the purple metal cube was part of a combination that turned the detector on (in combination with the blue metal sphere and other objects), it suggests that the purple metal cube might be a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the presence of the purple metal cube in the new test case suggests that the detector will turn on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
