  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cylinder → on\nblue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube, blue metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object effects:**\n   - **Gray rubber cylinder:** When placed alone, the detector is off.\n   - **Blue metal cylinder:** When placed alone, the detector is on.\n\n2. **Identify combinations of objects:**\n   - **Blue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder:** The detector is on. This suggests that the blue metal cylinder is likely a blicket, as it activates the detector even when combined with the gray rubber cylinder, which alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **Cyan metal cube, brown rubber cube:** The detector is on. This suggests that either the cyan metal cube or the brown rubber cube is a blicket.\n   - **Brown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube:** The detector is off. This suggests that neither the brown rubber cube nor the cyan rubber cube is a blicket when combined.\n   - **Cyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube:** The detector is off. This further supports that neither the brown rubber cube nor the cyan rubber cube is a blicket.\n\n3. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - **Brown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube, blue metal cylinder:** \n     - From previous results, the blue metal cylinder alone activates the detector (on).\n     - The combination of brown rubber cube and cyan rubber cube does not activate the detector (off).\n     - Since the blue metal cylinder is present in the new test case and it has been shown to activate the detector, the presence of the blue metal cylinder should cause the detector to turn on, regardless of the other objects.\n\nBased on the analysis, the presence of the blue metal cylinder, which is a blicket, will cause the detector to activate.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
