    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"cyan rubber cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **red rubber sphere → off**: A red rubber sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **blue metal sphere, red rubber sphere → on**: The combination of a blue metal sphere and a red rubber sphere activates the detector. Since the red rubber sphere alone does not activate the detector, the blue metal sphere is likely a blicket.\n\n3. **blue metal sphere → on**: A blue metal sphere alone activates the detector, confirming it is a blicket.\n\n4. **red metal sphere, brown rubber sphere → off**: Neither the red metal sphere nor the brown rubber sphere activates the detector when combined.\n\n5. **gray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, brown rubber sphere, red metal sphere → on**: This combination activates the detector. Since the red metal sphere and brown rubber sphere were previously shown not to activate the detector, either the gray metal sphere or the cyan rubber cube (or both) must be blickets.\n\n6. **yellow rubber sphere → on**: A yellow rubber sphere alone activates the detector, indicating it is a blicket.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case:\n\n- **cyan rubber cube**: From the previous results, the cyan rubber cube was part of a combination that activated the detector. However, it was not tested alone, so we cannot definitively conclude whether it is a blicket or if the activation was due to the gray metal sphere.\n\nSince the cyan rubber cube was only tested in combination with other objects and not alone, and there is no direct evidence that it is a blicket, the status of the detector light for the cyan rubber cube alone is:\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
