  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nbrown metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\npurple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, green metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects that consistently activate the detector:**\n   - The \"brown metal cube\" appears in two examples where the detector turns on:\n     - brown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\n     - brown metal cube → on\n   - The \"green metal cube\" appears in one example where the detector turns on:\n     - green metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\n\n2. **Identify objects that consistently do not activate the detector:**\n   - The \"gray rubber cylinder\" appears in one example where the detector turns off:\n     - gray rubber cylinder → off\n   - The \"green rubber cube\" and \"red rubber cylinder\" appear in one example where the detector turns off:\n     - green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\n\n3. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - The \"green metal cube\" is associated with the detector turning on in one example, suggesting it might be a blicket.\n   - The \"green rubber cube\" and \"red rubber cylinder\" are associated with the detector turning off, suggesting they are not blickets.\n\n4. **Evaluate the new test case:**\n   - New test case: green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, green metal cube\n   - The \"green metal cube\" has been associated with the detector turning on in a previous example, suggesting it might be a blicket.\n   - The presence of the \"green metal cube\" in the new test case suggests that the detector will turn on, despite the presence of the \"green rubber cube\" and \"red rubber cylinder,\" which are associated with the detector turning off.\n\nBased on the analysis, the presence of the \"green metal cube\" in the new test case suggests that the detector light will turn on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
