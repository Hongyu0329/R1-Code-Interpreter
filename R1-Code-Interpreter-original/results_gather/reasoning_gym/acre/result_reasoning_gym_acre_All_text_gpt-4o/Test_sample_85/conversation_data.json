In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector.

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case \"blue rubber cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **Example 1:** \"blue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\"\n     - The combination of a blue rubber cube and a purple rubber cube turns the detector on.\n   - **Example 2:** \"purple rubber cube → off\"\n     - A purple rubber cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **Example 3:** \"blue rubber cube → on\"\n     - A blue rubber cube alone activates the detector.\n   - **Example 4:** \"blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off\"\n     - This combination does not activate the detector.\n   - **Example 5:** \"blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off\"\n     - This combination also does not activate the detector.\n   - **Example 6:** \"yellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\"\n     - This combination activates the detector.\n\n2. **Key Observations:**\n   - The blue rubber cube alone (Example 3) activates the detector.\n   - The purple rubber cube alone (Example 2) does not activate the detector.\n   - The presence of a blue rubber cube in Example 1, along with a purple rubber cube, results in the detector turning on, suggesting the blue rubber cube is likely the activating object.\n\n3. **Conclusion for New Test Case:**\n   - Since the blue rubber cube alone has been shown to activate the detector in Example 3, we can conclude that the new test case \"blue rubber cube\" will also activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"blue rubber cube\" is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
