    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects and their properties:**\n   - Green metal cylinder\n   - Red metal sphere\n   - Yellow metal sphere\n   - Green metal sphere\n   - Yellow rubber sphere\n   - Brown rubber cylinder\n\n2. **Analyze previous results:**\n   - **Green metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on**\n     - Possible causes: Green metal cylinder or red metal sphere or both.\n   - **Green metal cylinder → on**\n     - Confirms that the green metal cylinder alone can activate the detector.\n   - **Red metal sphere → off**\n     - Confirms that the red metal sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **Yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off**\n     - Neither the yellow metal sphere nor the green metal sphere alone or together activate the detector.\n   - **Green metal sphere → off**\n     - Confirms that the green metal sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **Yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on**\n     - Possible causes: Yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, or a combination with the yellow metal sphere.\n\n3. **Determine the effect of each object:**\n   - **Green metal cylinder**: Activates the detector (proven by the second result).\n   - **Red metal sphere**: Does not activate the detector (proven by the third result).\n   - **Yellow metal sphere**: Does not activate the detector (proven by the fourth result).\n   - **Green metal sphere**: Does not activate the detector (proven by the fourth and fifth results).\n   - **Yellow rubber sphere and brown rubber cylinder**: At least one of these, or their combination with the yellow metal sphere, activates the detector (proven by the sixth result).\n\n4. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - **New test case**: Yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere, green metal cylinder\n   - The green metal cylinder is known to activate the detector on its own.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the green metal cylinder is present in the new test case and it is known to activate the detector, the detector light will turn on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
