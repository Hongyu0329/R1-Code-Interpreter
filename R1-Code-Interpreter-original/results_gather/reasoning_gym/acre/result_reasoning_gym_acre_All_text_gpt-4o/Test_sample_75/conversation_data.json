  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\ngray rubber cube → on\ngray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\nbrown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cube, green rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object effects:**\n   - Brown metal cube alone results in \"off.\"\n   - Gray rubber cube alone results in \"on.\"\n   - Green rubber cylinder alone results in \"off\" (from the combination with red rubber cube).\n\n2. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - Gray rubber cube with brown metal cube results in \"on.\" This suggests that the gray rubber cube is a blicket, as it activates the detector even when combined with a non-activating object.\n   - Blue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, and red rubber cube together result in \"off.\" This suggests none of these objects are blickets.\n   - Brown rubber cube with blue rubber cylinder results in \"on.\" This suggests that the brown rubber cube might be a blicket.\n   - Green rubber cylinder with red rubber cube results in \"off,\" reinforcing that neither is a blicket.\n\n3. **Evaluate the new test case:**\n   - The new test case involves a brown metal cube and a green rubber cylinder.\n   - The brown metal cube alone results in \"off.\"\n   - The green rubber cylinder alone results in \"off.\"\n   - There is no evidence from previous results that either of these objects can activate the detector when combined with each other or with other non-activating objects.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since both objects in the new test case have individually resulted in \"off\" and there is no evidence of them activating the detector in combination, the most logical conclusion is that the detector will remain \"off.\"\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
