  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nred metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cube, red metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case \"green rubber cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Cyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on**\n   - Either the cyan metal cylinder or the yellow metal cube (or both) is a blicket.\n\n2. **Cyan metal cylinder → on**\n   - The cyan metal cylinder is confirmed to be a blicket.\n\n3. **Yellow metal cube → off**\n   - The yellow metal cube is not a blicket.\n\n4. **Red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off**\n   - None of these objects are blickets.\n\n5. **Cyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off**\n   - None of these objects are blickets. This confirms that the green rubber cube is not a blicket.\n\n6. **Green metal cube, red metal cylinder → on**\n   - Either the green metal cube or the red metal cylinder (or both) is a blicket. However, since the red metal cylinder was previously tested and resulted in \"off,\" the green metal cube must be a blicket.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the new test case:\n\n- **Green rubber cube**\n  - From the previous results, the green rubber cube was tested in combination with other objects and resulted in \"off.\" Therefore, the green rubber cube is not a blicket.\n\nBased on the analysis, the green rubber cube alone will not activate the detector.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
