  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nred metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cube, red metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify objects that activate the detector:**\n   - The combination \"cyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube\" results in the detector turning on.\n   - The \"cyan metal cylinder\" alone also results in the detector turning on.\n   - The \"yellow metal cube\" alone results in the detector staying off.\n   - The combination \"green metal cube, red metal cylinder\" results in the detector turning on.\n\n2. **Identify objects that do not activate the detector:**\n   - The combination \"red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube\" results in the detector staying off.\n   - The combination \"cyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube\" results in the detector staying off.\n\n3. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - New test case: \"cyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder\"\n   - The \"cyan metal cylinder\" is known to activate the detector based on previous results.\n   - The presence of the \"cyan metal cylinder\" in the new test case suggests that the detector will turn on, regardless of the other objects present.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the \"cyan metal cylinder\" is a known blicket that activates the detector, and it is present in the new test case, we can conclude that the detector light will turn on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
