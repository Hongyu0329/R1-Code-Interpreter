  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal sphere, blue metal cube → on\nred metal sphere → on\nblue metal cube → off\nyellow metal cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off\nbrown metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case \"brown metal cylinder,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **red metal sphere, blue metal cube → on**\n   - Both objects together activate the detector.\n\n2. **red metal sphere → on**\n   - The red metal sphere alone activates the detector, suggesting it is a blicket.\n\n3. **blue metal cube → off**\n   - The blue metal cube alone does not activate the detector, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\n4. **yellow metal cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off**\n   - Neither the yellow metal cylinder nor the blue metal cylinder activates the detector.\n\n5. **blue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder → off**\n   - Neither the blue rubber cylinder nor the blue metal cylinder activates the detector.\n\n6. **brown metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on**\n   - This combination activates the detector. Since the blue rubber cylinder was previously shown not to activate the detector, the brown metal cylinder must be a blicket.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the new test case:\n\n- **brown metal cylinder**\n  - From the previous result (brown metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on), we determined that the brown metal cylinder is a blicket because it was the only new object in the combination that caused the detector to activate.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"brown metal cylinder\" is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
