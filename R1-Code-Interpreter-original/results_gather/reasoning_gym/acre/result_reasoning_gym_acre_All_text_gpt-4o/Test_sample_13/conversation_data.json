    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case \"cyan metal cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results step by step:\n\n1. **Cyan Metal Sphere → Off**: The cyan metal sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **Blue Metal Cube → On**: The blue metal cube alone activates the detector.\n\n3. **Blue Metal Cube, Cyan Metal Sphere → On**: The combination of a blue metal cube and a cyan metal sphere activates the detector. Since the blue metal cube alone activates the detector, the cyan metal sphere does not affect the outcome.\n\n4. **Gray Metal Cube, Cyan Metal Cube, Cyan Metal Cylinder → On**: This combination activates the detector. However, it's unclear which object(s) are responsible for activation. The gray metal cube or the cyan metal cylinder could be the blicket(s), or it could be a combination effect.\n\n5. **Cyan Metal Cube → Off**: The cyan metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\n6. **Red Rubber Cube, Cyan Metal Cylinder, Cyan Metal Cube → Off**: This combination does not activate the detector. The cyan metal cube and cyan metal cylinder together do not activate the detector, nor does the red rubber cube contribute to activation.\n\nNow, let's focus on the new test case:\n\n- **Cyan Metal Cube**: From the previous results, we see that the cyan metal cube alone was tested and resulted in the detector being off. There is no evidence from the previous results that the cyan metal cube can activate the detector on its own.\n\nBased on the analysis of the previous results, the cyan metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
