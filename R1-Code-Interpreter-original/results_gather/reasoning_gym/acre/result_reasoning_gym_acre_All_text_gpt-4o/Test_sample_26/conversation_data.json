In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector.

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify individual object effects:**\n   - Green metal cube: off\n   - Gray rubber cylinder: on\n   - Purple rubber cube: off (inferred from the combination with green rubber cylinder)\n\n2. **Analyze combinations:**\n   - Gray rubber cylinder, green metal cube: on\n     - Since the gray rubber cylinder alone turns the detector on, it is likely the cause of the detector turning on in this combination.\n   - Green rubber cylinder, purple rubber cube: off\n     - Neither object seems to activate the detector.\n   - Yellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder: on\n     - The presence of the gray metal cylinder might be the cause, as it also appears in another combination that turns the detector on.\n   - Gray metal cylinder, purple rubber cube: on\n     - The gray metal cylinder is likely the cause of the detector turning on.\n\n3. **Determine the effect of the new combination:**\n   - New test case: green metal cube, purple rubber cube\n   - From the previous results, the green metal cube alone results in the detector being off.\n   - The purple rubber cube, when combined with other objects that do not activate the detector, also results in the detector being off.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Neither the green metal cube nor the purple rubber cube has been shown to activate the detector in any previous experiments.\n   - Therefore, the combination of these two objects is unlikely to activate the detector.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
