  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\nyellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on\nyellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **brown metal cube → off**: The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **yellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on**: The presence of the yellow metal cylinder seems to activate the detector, even with the brown metal cube.\n   - **yellow metal cylinder → on**: The yellow metal cylinder alone activates the detector.\n   - **cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector.\n   - **cyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on**: The presence of the cyan rubber cylinder seems to activate the detector.\n   - **green rubber cube → off**: The green rubber cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **New Test Case:**\n   - **green rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder**\n\n3. **Reasoning:**\n   - The green rubber cube alone does not activate the detector, as seen in the previous results.\n   - The cyan metal cylinder was part of a combination that did not activate the detector (cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off).\n   - The cyan metal cylinder was also part of a combination that did activate the detector (cyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on), but the activation seems to be due to the presence of the cyan rubber cylinder.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the green rubber cube and cyan metal cylinder combination was part of a previous test that resulted in the detector being off, and there is no evidence that either object alone or together can activate the detector, the most likely conclusion is that the detector will stay off.\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
