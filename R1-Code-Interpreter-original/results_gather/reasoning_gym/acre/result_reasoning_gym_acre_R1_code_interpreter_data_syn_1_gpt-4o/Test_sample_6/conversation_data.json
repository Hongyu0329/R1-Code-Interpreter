  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber sphere → off\nblue metal sphere, red rubber sphere → on\nblue metal sphere → on\nred metal sphere, brown rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, brown rubber sphere, red metal sphere → on\nyellow rubber sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nred rubber sphere, yellow rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **red rubber sphere → off**: The red rubber sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **blue metal sphere, red rubber sphere → on**: The presence of the blue metal sphere seems to activate the detector, as the red rubber sphere alone does not.\n   - **blue metal sphere → on**: Confirms that the blue metal sphere is a blicket.\n   - **red metal sphere, brown rubber sphere → off**: Neither the red metal sphere nor the brown rubber sphere is a blicket.\n   - **gray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, brown rubber sphere, red metal sphere → on**: The gray metal sphere or the cyan rubber cube could be blickets, as the brown rubber sphere and red metal sphere are not.\n   - **yellow rubber sphere → on**: The yellow rubber sphere is a blicket.\n\n2. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - **red rubber sphere, yellow rubber sphere**: We know from the previous results that the red rubber sphere alone does not activate the detector. However, the yellow rubber sphere alone does activate the detector.\n\nGiven that the yellow rubber sphere is a blicket and activates the detector, the presence of the yellow rubber sphere in the new test case will cause the detector to turn on, regardless of the presence of the red rubber sphere.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is \"on\".\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
