  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber sphere, cyan metal cylinder → on\ncyan metal cylinder → off\ngray rubber cube, purple metal cube, yellow metal cylinder → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, purple metal cube, gray rubber cube, yellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal cylinder, gray rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n1. **Gray Rubber Sphere**: This object alone turns the detector on.\n2. **Gray Rubber Sphere, Cyan Metal Cylinder**: The detector is on. Since the gray rubber sphere alone turns the detector on, the presence of the cyan metal cylinder does not affect the outcome.\n3. **Cyan Metal Cylinder**: This object alone turns the detector off.\n4. **Gray Rubber Cube, Purple Metal Cube, Yellow Metal Cylinder**: The detector is off. None of these objects alone or in combination turn the detector on.\n5. **Cyan Rubber Cylinder, Purple Metal Cube, Gray Rubber Cube, Yellow Metal Cylinder**: The detector is on. The cyan rubber cylinder is the new object here, and it seems to be the cause of the detector turning on.\n6. **Cyan Rubber Cylinder**: This object alone turns the detector on.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- The **gray rubber sphere** and **cyan rubber cylinder** are likely blickets, as they consistently cause the detector to turn on.\n- The **cyan metal cylinder** alone turns the detector off, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n- The **gray rubber cube** does not turn the detector on when combined with other non-blicket objects.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: **cyan metal cylinder, gray rubber cube**.\n\n- The **cyan metal cylinder** alone turns the detector off.\n- The **gray rubber cube** has not been shown to turn the detector on in any combination.\n\nGiven these observations, the combination of a non-blicket (cyan metal cylinder) and an object that has not been shown to activate the detector (gray rubber cube) suggests that the detector will stay off.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
