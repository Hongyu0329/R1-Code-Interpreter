  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder → on\nbrown metal cylinder → off\ngreen metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal sphere → on\nblue metal sphere, gray rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cylinder, green metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Gray Metal Cylinder**: \n   - When combined with a brown metal cylinder, the detector turns on.\n   - When alone, the detector also turns on.\n   - This suggests that the gray metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\n2. **Brown Metal Cylinder**:\n   - When combined with a gray metal cylinder, the detector turns on.\n   - When alone, the detector turns off.\n   - This suggests that the brown metal cylinder is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Green Metal Cube**:\n   - When alone, the detector turns on.\n   - When combined with a blue metal sphere, the detector turns on.\n   - This suggests that the green metal cube is a blicket.\n\n4. **Blue Metal Sphere**:\n   - When combined with a green metal cube, the detector turns on.\n   - When combined with a gray rubber cylinder, the detector turns off.\n   - This suggests that the blue metal sphere is not a blicket.\n\n5. **Gray Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - When combined with a blue metal sphere, the detector turns off.\n   - This suggests that the gray rubber cylinder is not a blicket.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: **Brown Metal Cylinder, Green Metal Cube**.\n\n- The brown metal cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n- The green metal cube alone activates the detector.\n\nSince the green metal cube is a blicket and activates the detector on its own, the presence of the green metal cube in the new test case should cause the detector to turn on, regardless of the presence of the brown metal cylinder.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
