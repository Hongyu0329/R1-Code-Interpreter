  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\ngray rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine whether the new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Gray Rubber Cube**: The detector turns on.\n2. **Purple Rubber Cube**: The detector stays off.\n3. **Gray Rubber Cube, Purple Rubber Cube**: The detector turns on. This suggests that the gray rubber cube is a blicket, as it activates the detector even in the presence of the purple rubber cube.\n4. **Blue Rubber Cylinder, Blue Metal Cylinder, Brown Metal Cube, Green Metal Cylinder**: The detector turns on. This suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n5. **Gray Metal Cube, Red Rubber Cube**: The detector stays off. This suggests that neither the gray metal cube nor the red rubber cube is a blicket.\n6. **Green Metal Cylinder, Brown Metal Cube, Gray Metal Cube, Red Rubber Cube**: The detector stays off. This suggests that none of these objects is a blicket.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: **Blue Rubber Cylinder**.\n\nFrom the previous results, we know:\n- The blue rubber cylinder was part of a combination that turned the detector on (test case 4).\n- However, we cannot definitively conclude that the blue rubber cylinder alone is a blicket because it was tested in combination with other objects.\n\nSince the blue rubber cylinder was only tested in combination with other objects, and we do not have a test case where it was tested alone, we cannot determine with certainty whether it will activate the detector by itself.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case is \"undetermined\".\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
