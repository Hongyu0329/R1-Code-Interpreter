  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nyellow rubber cylinder → off\nyellow metal sphere → on\nyellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nblue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nblue metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine whether the detector light will turn on for the new test case \"blue metal sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\nLet's summarize the previous results:\n\n1. yellow rubber cylinder → off\n2. yellow metal sphere → on\n3. yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → on\n4. yellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\n5. blue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → on\n6. green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → off\n\nFrom these results, we can observe the following:\n\n- The yellow metal sphere seems to be a blicket since it causes the detector to turn on in both cases where it is present (examples 2 and 3).\n- The blue metal sphere is part of a combination that turns the detector on (example 5), but it is not clear if it is the cause since there are multiple objects in that combination.\n- The presence of the yellow metal sphere is a strong indicator of the detector turning on, but it is not present in the new test case.\n- The blue metal sphere has not been tested in isolation, so we cannot definitively determine its effect based on the given data.\n\nGiven the information, the effect of the blue metal sphere alone is undetermined because it was only part of a larger combination that turned the detector on, and we lack evidence of its individual effect.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue metal sphere\" is:\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
