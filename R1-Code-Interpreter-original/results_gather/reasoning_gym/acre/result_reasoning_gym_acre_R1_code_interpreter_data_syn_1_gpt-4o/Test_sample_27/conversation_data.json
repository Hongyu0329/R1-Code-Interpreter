  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cube → off\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nyellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen metal cube, gray rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **green metal cube → off**: The green metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **gray rubber cylinder → on**: The gray rubber cylinder alone activates the detector.\n   - **gray rubber cylinder, green metal cube → on**: The presence of the gray rubber cylinder activates the detector, even with the green metal cube.\n   - **green rubber cylinder, purple rubber cube → off**: Neither the green rubber cylinder nor the purple rubber cube activates the detector.\n   - **yellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder → on**: The combination activates the detector, possibly due to the gray metal cylinder.\n   - **gray metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → on**: The gray metal cylinder activates the detector, even with the purple rubber cube.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification:**\n   - The gray rubber cylinder consistently activates the detector, regardless of other objects present.\n   - The gray metal cylinder also activates the detector when present.\n\n3. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - **green metal cube, gray rubber cylinder**: The gray rubber cylinder is present, which has been shown to activate the detector in previous experiments.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the presence of the gray rubber cylinder in the new test case suggests that the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
