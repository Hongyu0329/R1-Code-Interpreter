  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan rubber cylinder → off\npurple rubber sphere, cyan rubber cylinder → on\npurple rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber cube, red metal sphere → off\nbrown metal cylinder → on\nbrown metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"brown metal cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\nLet's break down the previous results:\n\n1. **cyan rubber cylinder → off**: This suggests that the cyan rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **purple rubber sphere, cyan rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the purple rubber sphere seems to activate the detector, as the cyan rubber cylinder alone was previously off.\n\n3. **purple rubber sphere → on**: This confirms that the purple rubber sphere is a blicket, as it activates the detector on its own.\n\n4. **gray rubber cube, red metal sphere → off**: Neither the gray rubber cube nor the red metal sphere seems to activate the detector.\n\n5. **brown metal cylinder → on**: The brown metal cylinder activates the detector on its own, indicating it is a blicket.\n\n6. **brown metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on**: The presence of the red metal sphere does not affect the activation caused by the brown metal cylinder.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that the brown metal cylinder is a blicket, as it consistently activates the detector regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to the new test case:\n\n- **brown metal cylinder**: Since the brown metal cylinder has previously activated the detector on its own, we can confidently determine that it will activate the detector again.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"brown metal cylinder\" is \"on.\"\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
