  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off\nblue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off\nyellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, yellow rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\nLet's break down the previous results:\n\n1. **blue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on**\n2. **purple rubber cube → off**\n3. **blue rubber cube → on**\n4. **blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off**\n5. **blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off**\n6. **yellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on**\n\nFrom these results, we can observe the following:\n\n- The presence of a **blue rubber cube** seems to consistently result in the detector turning on (examples 1 and 3).\n- The presence of a **purple rubber cube** alone results in the detector staying off (example 2).\n- Combinations involving **blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, and green metal cylinder** result in the detector staying off (examples 4 and 5).\n- The presence of a **yellow rubber cube** in combination with other objects results in the detector turning on (example 6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case:\n\n- **blue metal cube**\n- **blue metal cylinder**\n- **blue rubber cylinder**\n- **green metal cylinder**\n- **yellow rubber cube**\n\nThe new test case includes a **yellow rubber cube**, which in previous experiments (example 6) resulted in the detector turning on. Therefore, based on the pattern observed, the presence of the yellow rubber cube is likely to activate the detector.\n\nThus, the detector light status for the new test case is predicted to be \"on\".\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
