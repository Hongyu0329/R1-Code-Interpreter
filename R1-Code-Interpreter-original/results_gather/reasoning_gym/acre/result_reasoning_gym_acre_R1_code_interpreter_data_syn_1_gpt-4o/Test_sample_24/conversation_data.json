  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cube → off\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nyellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine whether the detector light will turn on for the new test case \"yellow rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\nLet's summarize the previous results:\n\n1. green metal cube → off\n2. gray rubber cylinder → on\n3. gray rubber cylinder, green metal cube → on\n4. green rubber cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\n5. yellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder → on\n6. gray metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → on\n\nFrom these results, we can make the following observations:\n\n- The gray rubber cylinder seems to be a blicket since it causes the detector to turn on in both cases it appears (2 and 3).\n- The gray metal cylinder also seems to be a blicket since it causes the detector to turn on in case 6.\n- The green metal cube alone does not activate the detector (1), but when combined with the gray rubber cylinder, the detector turns on (3). This suggests that the green metal cube is not a blicket.\n- The purple rubber cube does not activate the detector when combined with the green rubber cylinder (4), but it does when combined with the gray metal cylinder (6). This suggests that the purple rubber cube is not a blicket.\n- The yellow rubber cube does not appear alone in any of the previous results, but it is part of a combination that turns the detector on (5). However, since the combination includes the gray metal cylinder, which is a blicket, we cannot conclude that the yellow rubber cube is a blicket.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the new test case \"yellow rubber cube\":\n\n- Since the yellow rubber cube has not been tested alone in previous experiments, and it was only part of a combination that included a known blicket (gray metal cylinder), we cannot determine if it is a blicket on its own.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow rubber cube\" is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
