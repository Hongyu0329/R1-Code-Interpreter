  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nyellow rubber sphere, cyan rubber cube → on\ncyan rubber cube → off\nyellow rubber sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder, red rubber cylinder, red metal cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\npurple rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"purple rubber cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\nLet's break down the previous results:\n\n1. **yellow rubber sphere, cyan rubber cube → on**\n2. **cyan rubber cube → off**\n3. **yellow rubber sphere → on**\n4. **red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → off**\n5. **blue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder, red rubber cylinder, red metal cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on**\n6. **red metal cylinder, yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, red rubber cylinder → off**\n\nFrom these results, we can make the following observations:\n\n- The \"yellow rubber sphere\" seems to be a blicket because it consistently causes the detector to turn on (examples 1 and 3).\n- The \"cyan rubber cube\" alone does not activate the detector (example 2).\n- The \"purple rubber cylinder\" appears in example 5, where the detector turns on. However, it is not clear if it is a blicket because it is combined with other objects.\n- The \"red metal cylinder,\" \"red rubber cylinder,\" \"yellow metal sphere,\" and \"yellow rubber cylinder\" appear in combinations that result in the detector staying off (examples 4 and 6).\n\nNow, let's focus on the \"purple rubber cylinder\":\n\n- It appears in example 5, where the detector turns on, but it is combined with other objects.\n- There is no evidence from the other examples that the \"purple rubber cylinder\" alone can activate the detector.\n\nGiven the available data, we cannot conclusively determine if the \"purple rubber cylinder\" alone is a blicket. Therefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case \"purple rubber cylinder\" is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
