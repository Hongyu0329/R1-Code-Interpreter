  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder → on\nbrown metal cylinder → off\ngreen metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal sphere → on\nblue metal sphere, gray rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n1. **Gray Metal Cylinder:**\n   - When tested alone, the gray metal cylinder turns the detector on.\n   - When combined with a brown metal cylinder, the detector is also on.\n\n2. **Brown Metal Cylinder:**\n   - When tested alone, the brown metal cylinder does not turn the detector on.\n\n3. **Green Metal Cube:**\n   - When tested alone, the green metal cube turns the detector on.\n   - When combined with a blue metal sphere, the detector is on.\n\n4. **Blue Metal Sphere:**\n   - When combined with a gray rubber cylinder, the detector is off.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- The gray metal cylinder is likely a blicket since it consistently turns the detector on, both alone and in combination with other objects.\n- The brown metal cylinder alone does not activate the detector, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n- The presence of the gray metal cylinder seems to be a sufficient condition for the detector to turn on.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to the new test case: \"brown metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder.\"\n\nSince the gray metal cylinder is present in this combination and it has been shown to activate the detector in previous tests, we can conclude that the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
