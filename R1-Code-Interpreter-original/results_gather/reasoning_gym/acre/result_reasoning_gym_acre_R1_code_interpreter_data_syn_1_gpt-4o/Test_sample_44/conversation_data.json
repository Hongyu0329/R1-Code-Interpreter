  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cylinder → off\npurple metal cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\npurple metal cube → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, cyan rubber cube → on\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\ngray metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"gray metal cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\nLet's break down the previous results:\n\n1. **blue rubber cylinder → off**: The blue rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n2. **purple metal cube, blue rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the purple metal cube with the blue rubber cylinder activates the detector. This suggests that the purple metal cube might be a blicket.\n3. **purple metal cube → on**: The purple metal cube alone activates the detector, reinforcing the idea that it is a blicket.\n4. **cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube → off**: Neither the cyan rubber cube nor the cyan metal cube activates the detector.\n5. **red rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, cyan rubber cube → on**: The combination activates the detector. The red rubber cube might be a blicket, as the gray metal cylinder and cyan rubber cube alone do not activate the detector.\n6. **red rubber cube, cyan metal cube → on**: The red rubber cube with the cyan metal cube activates the detector, further suggesting that the red rubber cube is a blicket.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- The purple metal cube and the red rubber cube are likely blickets.\n- The gray metal cylinder alone has not been shown to activate the detector in any previous test.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the new test case \"gray metal cylinder\":\n- The gray metal cylinder was part of a combination that activated the detector, but it was not the sole object responsible for activation (as seen in the test with the red rubber cube and cyan rubber cube).\n- There is no evidence from the previous results that the gray metal cylinder alone can activate the detector.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the detector light status for the \"gray metal cylinder\" is likely to be \"off.\"\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
