  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal cube, green metal cube → on\nred metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nred metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red metal cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\nLet's break down the previous results:\n\n1. \"red metal cube, green metal cube → on\": This suggests that either the red metal cube or the green metal cube (or both) can activate the detector.\n2. \"red metal cube → on\": This indicates that the red metal cube alone is sufficient to activate the detector.\n3. \"green metal cube → off\": This suggests that the green metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n4. \"blue rubber cube → on\": This indicates that the blue rubber cube alone can activate the detector.\n5. \"blue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\": This suggests that either the blue metal cube or the purple metal cube (or both) can activate the detector.\n6. \"blue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\": This suggests that neither the blue rubber cylinder nor the purple metal cube alone can activate the detector.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that the red metal cube is a blicket because it consistently activates the detector when present. Therefore, for the new test case \"red metal cube,\" the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
