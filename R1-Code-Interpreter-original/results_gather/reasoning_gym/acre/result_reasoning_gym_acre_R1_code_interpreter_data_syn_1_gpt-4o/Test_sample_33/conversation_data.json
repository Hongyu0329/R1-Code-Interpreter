In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector.

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"gray metal sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - \"gray metal sphere, gray rubber sphere → on\"\n   - \"gray rubber sphere → off\"\n   - \"gray metal sphere → on\"\n   - \"red metal cylinder, brown rubber cube, yellow metal cube, yellow rubber cylinder → on\"\n   - \"yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal cube → off\"\n   - \"brown rubber cube → off\"\n\n2. **Observations:**\n   - The \"gray metal sphere\" appears in two experiments:\n     - In the first experiment, \"gray metal sphere, gray rubber sphere → on,\" the presence of the gray metal sphere might be causing the detector to turn on, as the gray rubber sphere alone results in \"off.\"\n     - In the third experiment, \"gray metal sphere → on,\" the gray metal sphere alone causes the detector to turn on.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The consistent result of \"on\" when the gray metal sphere is present, even when it is the only object, suggests that the gray metal sphere is a blicket (i.e., it has the property of activating the detector).\n\nBased on this analysis, the new test case \"gray metal sphere\" will cause the detector light to turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
