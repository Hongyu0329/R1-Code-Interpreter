    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"cyan rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - \"red rubber sphere\" → off\n   - \"blue metal sphere, red rubber sphere\" → on\n   - \"blue metal sphere\" → on\n   - \"red metal sphere, brown rubber sphere\" → off\n   - \"gray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, brown rubber sphere, red metal sphere\" → on\n   - \"yellow rubber sphere\" → on\n\n2. **Observations:**\n   - The \"blue metal sphere\" consistently causes the detector to turn on, suggesting it might be a blicket.\n   - The \"red rubber sphere\" alone does not activate the detector, but when combined with the \"blue metal sphere,\" the detector turns on. This suggests the \"red rubber sphere\" is not a blicket.\n   - The \"red metal sphere\" and \"brown rubber sphere\" together do not activate the detector, suggesting neither is a blicket.\n   - The \"gray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, brown rubber sphere, red metal sphere\" combination turns the detector on. Since the \"brown rubber sphere\" and \"red metal sphere\" are not blickets, the \"gray metal sphere\" or \"cyan rubber cube\" might be blickets.\n   - The \"yellow rubber sphere\" alone turns the detector on, indicating it is a blicket.\n\n3. **New Test Case: \"cyan rubber cube\":**\n   - The \"cyan rubber cube\" was part of a combination that turned the detector on, but it was not tested alone. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude if it is a blicket based on the available data.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the status of the detector light for the \"cyan rubber cube\" is undetermined because there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether it alone can activate the detector.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
