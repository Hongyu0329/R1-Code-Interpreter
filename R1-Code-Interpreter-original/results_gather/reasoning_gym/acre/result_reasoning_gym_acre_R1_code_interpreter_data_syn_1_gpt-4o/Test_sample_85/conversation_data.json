    "To determine whether the detector light will turn on or off for the new test case \"blue rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\nLet's break down the previous results:\n\n1. **blue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on**\n   - The presence of a blue rubber cube in combination with a purple rubber cube turns the detector on.\n\n2. **purple rubber cube → off**\n   - A purple rubber cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\n3. **blue rubber cube → on**\n   - A blue rubber cube alone activates the detector.\n\n4. **blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off**\n   - None of these objects activate the detector.\n\n5. **blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off**\n   - None of these objects activate the detector.\n\n6. **yellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on**\n   - This combination activates the detector, but it includes a blue rubber cylinder, not a blue rubber cube.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce:\n\n- The blue rubber cube alone has been shown to activate the detector (as seen in the third result).\n- The presence of a blue rubber cube in a combination that turns the detector on suggests it might be a blicket.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the new test case \"blue rubber cube\" should activate the detector based on the evidence from the third result.\n\n<<<on>>>"
