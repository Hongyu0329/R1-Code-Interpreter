  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal sphere → off\nblue metal cube → on\nblue metal cube, cyan metal sphere → on\ngray metal cube, cyan metal cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, cyan metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal cube, red rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n### Observations from Previous Results:\n1. **cyan metal sphere → off**: The cyan metal sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n2. **blue metal cube → on**: The blue metal cube alone activates the detector.\n3. **blue metal cube, cyan metal sphere → on**: The presence of the blue metal cube seems to activate the detector, even with the cyan metal sphere.\n4. **gray metal cube, cyan metal cube, cyan metal cylinder → on**: The combination of these objects activates the detector. The presence of a metal cube (gray) might be significant.\n5. **cyan metal cube → off**: The cyan metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n6. **red rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, cyan metal cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector, suggesting that the red rubber cube and cyan metal cube do not contribute to activation.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The blue metal cube is a consistent activator of the detector.\n- The cyan metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n- The red rubber cube, when combined with other non-activating objects, does not activate the detector.\n\n### New Test Case:\n- **cyan metal cube, red rubber cube**: \n  - The cyan metal cube alone is known to not activate the detector.\n  - The red rubber cube, when combined with other non-activating objects, does not activate the detector.\n\nGiven these observations, the combination of a cyan metal cube and a red rubber cube is unlikely to activate the detector, as neither object has shown the ability to do so in previous experiments.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is likely to be \"off\".\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
