  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber sphere, cyan metal cylinder → on\ncyan metal cylinder → off\ngray rubber cube, purple metal cube, yellow metal cylinder → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, purple metal cube, gray rubber cube, yellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ngray rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"gray rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Gray Rubber Sphere**: \n   - Alone, it turns the detector on.\n   - With a cyan metal cylinder, it still turns the detector on.\n\n2. **Cyan Metal Cylinder**:\n   - Alone, it does not turn the detector on.\n   - With a gray rubber sphere, it does not prevent the detector from turning on.\n\n3. **Gray Rubber Cube**:\n   - In combination with a purple metal cube and a yellow metal cylinder, it does not turn the detector on.\n   - In combination with a cyan rubber cylinder, purple metal cube, and yellow metal cylinder, the detector turns on.\n\n4. **Cyan Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - Alone, it turns the detector on.\n   - In combination with other objects, it still turns the detector on.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- The gray rubber sphere is likely a blicket since it consistently turns the detector on.\n- The cyan rubber cylinder is also likely a blicket since it turns the detector on when alone.\n- The gray rubber cube does not turn the detector on when combined with other non-blicket objects (purple metal cube and yellow metal cylinder).\n\nGiven the new test case \"gray rubber cube,\" and considering that it did not activate the detector in a previous test when combined with other non-blicket objects, it is reasonable to conclude that the gray rubber cube alone will not activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"gray rubber cube\" is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
