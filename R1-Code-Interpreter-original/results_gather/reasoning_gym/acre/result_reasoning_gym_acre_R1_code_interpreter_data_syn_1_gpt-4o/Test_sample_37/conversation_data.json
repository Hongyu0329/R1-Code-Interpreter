  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\ngreen metal cylinder → on\nred metal sphere → off\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off\ngreen metal sphere → off\nyellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"green metal sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules.\n\nLet's break down the previous results:\n\n1. **green metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on**\n2. **green metal cylinder → on**\n3. **red metal sphere → off**\n4. **yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off**\n5. **green metal sphere → off**\n6. **yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on**\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer the following:\n\n- The \"green metal cylinder\" seems to be a blicket since it causes the detector to turn on both when alone and in combination with the \"red metal sphere.\"\n- The \"red metal sphere\" alone does not activate the detector, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n- The \"green metal sphere\" does not activate the detector when alone or in combination with the \"yellow metal sphere,\" suggesting it is not a blicket.\n- The \"yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere\" combination activates the detector, but it's unclear which specific object(s) are blickets.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the new test case \"green metal sphere\":\n\n- Based on observation 5, the \"green metal sphere\" alone does not activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"green metal sphere\" is \"off.\"\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
