  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan rubber cylinder → off\npurple rubber sphere, cyan rubber cylinder → on\npurple rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber cube, red metal sphere → off\nbrown metal cylinder → on\nbrown metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\npurple rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"purple rubber sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - \"cyan rubber cylinder → off\": The cyan rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - \"purple rubber sphere, cyan rubber cylinder → on\": The presence of the purple rubber sphere with the cyan rubber cylinder activates the detector. This suggests that the purple rubber sphere might be a blicket.\n   - \"purple rubber sphere → on\": The purple rubber sphere alone activates the detector, confirming it is a blicket.\n   - \"gray rubber cube, red metal sphere → off\": Neither the gray rubber cube nor the red metal sphere alone or in combination activates the detector.\n   - \"brown metal cylinder → on\": The brown metal cylinder alone activates the detector, indicating it is a blicket.\n   - \"brown metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\": The presence of the brown metal cylinder with the red metal sphere activates the detector, further confirming the brown metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\n2. **Conclusion for New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case is \"purple rubber sphere.\" From the previous results, we know that the purple rubber sphere alone activates the detector.\n\nBased on this analysis, the detector light status for the new test case \"purple rubber sphere\" is determined to be \"on.\"\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
