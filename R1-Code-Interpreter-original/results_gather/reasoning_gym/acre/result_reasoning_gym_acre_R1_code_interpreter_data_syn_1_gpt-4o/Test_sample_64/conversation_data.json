  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nbrown metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\npurple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"brown metal cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\nLet's break down the previous results:\n\n1. **brown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on**\n2. **gray rubber cylinder → off**\n3. **brown metal cube → on**\n4. **green metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on**\n5. **purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on**\n6. **green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off**\n\nFrom these results, we can observe the following:\n\n- The \"brown metal cube\" appears in two experiments:\n  - In the first experiment, it is combined with a \"gray rubber cylinder\" and the detector turns on.\n  - In the third experiment, it is alone and the detector also turns on.\n\n- The \"gray rubber cylinder\" alone results in the detector being off, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\n- The \"brown metal cube\" alone results in the detector being on, suggesting it is a blicket.\n\nGiven this analysis, the \"brown metal cube\" seems to have the property of activating the detector on its own. Therefore, for the new test case \"brown metal cube,\" we can conclude that the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
