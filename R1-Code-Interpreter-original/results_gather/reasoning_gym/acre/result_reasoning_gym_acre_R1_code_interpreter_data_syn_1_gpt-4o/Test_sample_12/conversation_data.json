    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"cyan metal sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - \"cyan metal sphere\" → off\n   - \"blue metal cube\" → on\n   - \"blue metal cube, cyan metal sphere\" → on\n   - \"gray metal cube, cyan metal cube, cyan metal cylinder\" → on\n   - \"cyan metal cube\" → off\n   - \"red rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, cyan metal cube\" → off\n\n2. **Observations:**\n   - The \"blue metal cube\" consistently causes the detector to turn on, suggesting it is a blicket.\n   - The \"cyan metal sphere\" alone results in the detector being off.\n   - The presence of the \"cyan metal sphere\" with the \"blue metal cube\" does not prevent the detector from turning on, indicating the \"cyan metal sphere\" is not a blicket.\n   - The \"cyan metal cube\" alone results in the detector being off, and its presence in a combination with other objects that result in \"off\" suggests it is not a blicket.\n   - The \"cyan metal cylinder\" appears in both \"on\" and \"off\" combinations, making its status unclear.\n\n3. **Conclusion for New Test Case:**\n   - Since the \"cyan metal sphere\" alone previously resulted in the detector being off, and there is no evidence to suggest it has become a blicket, we can conclude that the detector will remain off for the new test case.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"cyan metal sphere\" is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
