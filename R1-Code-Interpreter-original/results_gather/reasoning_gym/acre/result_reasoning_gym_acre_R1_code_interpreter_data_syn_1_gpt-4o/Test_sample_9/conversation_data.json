  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cylinder → on\nblue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ncyan rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"cyan rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - \"gray rubber cylinder\" → off\n   - \"blue metal cylinder\" → on\n   - \"blue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder\" → on\n   - \"cyan metal cube, brown rubber cube\" → on\n   - \"brown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube\" → off\n   - \"cyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube\" → off\n\n2. **Observations:**\n   - The \"blue metal cylinder\" consistently causes the detector to turn on, suggesting it is a blicket.\n   - The \"gray rubber cylinder\" alone does not activate the detector.\n   - The \"cyan metal cube\" in combination with the \"brown rubber cube\" activates the detector, but the \"brown rubber cube\" alone or with the \"cyan rubber cube\" does not.\n   - The \"cyan rubber cube\" consistently results in the detector staying off when combined with the \"brown rubber cube.\"\n\n3. **Inference:**\n   - The \"cyan rubber cube\" has been tested in two scenarios, both resulting in the detector staying off.\n   - There is no evidence from the previous results that the \"cyan rubber cube\" can activate the detector on its own.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the new test case \"cyan rubber cube\" is likely to result in the detector staying off, as there is no indication that it has the property to activate the detector.\n\n<<<off>>>"
