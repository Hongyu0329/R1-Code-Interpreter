  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cylinder → off\npurple metal cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\npurple metal cube → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, cyan rubber cube → on\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube, gray metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify potential blickets:**\n   - The purple metal cube seems to be a blicket because it activates the detector both alone and in combination with the blue rubber cylinder.\n   - The red rubber cube also seems to be a blicket because it activates the detector in two different combinations.\n\n2. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - The new test case includes a cyan rubber cube, a cyan metal cube, and a gray metal cylinder.\n   - From the previous results, the cyan rubber cube and cyan metal cube together did not activate the detector.\n   - The gray metal cylinder was part of a combination that activated the detector, but it was with the red rubber cube, which is likely the activating blicket in that scenario.\n\n3. **Determine the status:**\n   - Since the new test case does not include any of the identified blickets (purple metal cube or red rubber cube), and the combination of cyan rubber cube and cyan metal cube previously resulted in the detector staying off, it is reasonable to conclude that the detector will stay off.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case is \"off\".\n\n<<<off>>>"
