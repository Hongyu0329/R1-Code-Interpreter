  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\ngray rubber cube → on\ngray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\nbrown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cube, green rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\nLet's summarize the previous results:\n\n1. brown metal cube → off\n2. gray rubber cube → on\n3. gray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on\n4. blue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\n5. brown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\n6. green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer the following:\n\n- The gray rubber cube seems to be a blicket since it turns the detector on by itself (result 2) and also when combined with the brown metal cube (result 3).\n- The brown metal cube by itself does not activate the detector (result 1), but when combined with the gray rubber cube, the detector turns on (result 3).\n- The green rubber cylinder does not activate the detector when combined with other objects that do not activate it (results 4 and 6).\n- The brown rubber cube seems to be a blicket since it turns the detector on when combined with the blue rubber cylinder (result 5).\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: brown metal cube, green rubber cylinder.\n\n- The brown metal cube by itself does not activate the detector (result 1).\n- The green rubber cylinder does not activate the detector when combined with other non-blicket objects (results 4 and 6).\n\nSince neither the brown metal cube nor the green rubber cylinder has been shown to activate the detector in previous experiments, and there is no evidence of them activating the detector when combined, we can conclude that the detector light will stay off for this combination.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
