  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\ngray rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube, green metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The gray rubber cube seems to be a blicket since it turns the detector on when placed alone and also when combined with the purple rubber cube.\n   - The purple rubber cube alone does not activate the detector, but when combined with the gray rubber cube, the detector turns on. This suggests that the purple rubber cube is not a blicket.\n   - The blue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, and green metal cylinder together activate the detector. This suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n   - The gray metal cube and red rubber cube together do not activate the detector, suggesting neither is a blicket.\n   - The green metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, and red rubber cube together do not activate the detector, reinforcing that none of these are blickets.\n\n2. **Analyze the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case includes the gray metal cube, red rubber cube, and green metal cylinder.\n   - From previous results, the gray metal cube and red rubber cube together do not activate the detector.\n   - The green metal cylinder was part of a combination that activated the detector, but it was also part of a combination that did not activate the detector. This suggests that the green metal cylinder alone is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since none of the objects in the new test case have been shown to activate the detector on their own or in combination with each other, we can conclude that the detector will not turn on.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
