    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red metal cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - \"red rubber cylinder → off\": A red rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - \"brown rubber sphere → on\": A brown rubber sphere alone activates the detector.\n   - \"brown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on\": The combination of a brown rubber sphere and a red rubber cylinder activates the detector. This suggests that the brown rubber sphere is likely a blicket.\n   - \"blue metal cube → off\": A blue metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - \"yellow metal cube → off\": A yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - \"gray metal sphere, red metal cube → on\": The combination of a gray metal sphere and a red metal cube activates the detector. This suggests that either the gray metal sphere or the red metal cube, or both, could be blickets.\n\n2. **Inference for New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case is \"red metal cube.\"\n   - From the previous result \"gray metal sphere, red metal cube → on,\" we know that the combination activates the detector. Since the gray metal sphere was not tested alone, we cannot definitively conclude which of the two objects is responsible for activation.\n   - However, since the red metal cube was part of a combination that activated the detector, it is possible that the red metal cube is a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the evidence, the red metal cube has been part of a combination that activated the detector. While we cannot be absolutely certain without further testing, the evidence suggests that the red metal cube could be a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence, the detector light status for the new test case \"red metal cube\" is likely to be \"on.\"\n\n<<<on>>>"
