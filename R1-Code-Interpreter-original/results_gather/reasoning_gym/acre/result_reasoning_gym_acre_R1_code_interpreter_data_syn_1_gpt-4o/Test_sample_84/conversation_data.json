  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off\nblue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off\nyellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - \"blue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\"\n   - \"purple rubber cube → off\"\n   - \"blue rubber cube → on\"\n   - \"blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off\"\n   - \"blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off\"\n   - \"yellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\"\n\n2. **Observations:**\n   - The \"blue rubber cube\" seems to be a blicket since it consistently turns the detector on.\n   - The \"purple rubber cube\" alone does not activate the detector.\n   - The combination \"yellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder\" turns the detector on, suggesting that one or more of these objects could be blickets.\n\n3. **Focus on the \"yellow rubber cube\":**\n   - In the combination \"yellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder,\" the detector turns on. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the \"yellow rubber cube\" alone is a blicket because it was tested in combination with other objects.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the \"yellow rubber cube\" was only tested in combination with other objects and not alone, there is insufficient evidence to determine if it alone can activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the \"yellow rubber cube\" is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
