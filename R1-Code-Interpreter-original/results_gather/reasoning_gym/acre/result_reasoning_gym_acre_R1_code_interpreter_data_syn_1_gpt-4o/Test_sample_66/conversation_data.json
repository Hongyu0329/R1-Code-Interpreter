  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nbrown metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\npurple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, green metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n### Observations from Previous Results:\n1. **brown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on**\n2. **gray rubber cylinder → off**\n3. **brown metal cube → on**\n4. **green metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on**\n5. **purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on**\n6. **green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off**\n\n### Analysis:\n- The **brown metal cube** seems to be a blicket since it causes the detector to turn on both when alone and in combination with another object.\n- The **gray rubber cylinder** does not seem to be a blicket since it does not activate the detector when alone.\n- The **green metal cube** appears in a combination that turns the detector on, but it is not clear if it is a blicket on its own.\n- The **blue metal cylinder** appears in combinations that turn the detector on, suggesting it might be a blicket.\n- The **green rubber cube** and **red rubber cylinder** do not seem to be blickets since they appear in combinations that do not activate the detector.\n\n### New Test Case:\n- **green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, green metal cube**\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- The **green rubber cube** and **red rubber cylinder** are not blickets.\n- The **green metal cube** was part of a combination that turned the detector on, but it is not confirmed to be a blicket on its own.\n\nSince the new test case includes objects that are not confirmed blickets and the green metal cube's status is uncertain, we cannot definitively determine if the detector will turn on.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case is:\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
