  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal sphere, yellow metal cube → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nbrown metal sphere → on\nbrown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\ncyan metal sphere, gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere → on\npurple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\npurple rubber sphere, red rubber cube, gray metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n1. **Identify consistent patterns:**\n   - The \"brown metal sphere\" consistently causes the detector to turn on, as seen in the first and third examples.\n   - The \"yellow metal cube\" alone does not activate the detector, as seen in the second example.\n   - The \"purple rubber sphere\" and \"red rubber cube\" together do not activate the detector, as seen in the fourth and sixth examples.\n\n2. **Analyze the new test case:**\n   - The new test case includes \"purple rubber sphere,\" \"red rubber cube,\" and \"gray metal cylinder.\"\n   - From previous results, we know that the combination of \"purple rubber sphere\" and \"red rubber cube\" does not activate the detector.\n   - The \"gray metal cylinder\" was part of a combination that activated the detector in the fifth example, but it was not the only object present, so we cannot conclusively determine its individual effect.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the \"purple rubber sphere\" and \"red rubber cube\" combination is known to not activate the detector, and there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the \"gray metal cylinder\" alone can activate the detector, the outcome remains uncertain.\n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence, the status of the detector light for the new test case is \"undetermined.\"\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
