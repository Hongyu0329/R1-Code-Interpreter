  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\nyellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on\nyellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube, cyan rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **brown metal cube → off**: The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **yellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on**: The presence of the yellow metal cylinder seems to activate the detector, even with the brown metal cube present.\n   - **yellow metal cylinder → on**: The yellow metal cylinder alone activates the detector.\n   - **cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector.\n   - **cyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on**: The presence of the cyan rubber cylinder seems to activate the detector.\n   - **green rubber cube → off**: The green rubber cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **New Test Case:**\n   - **green rubber cube, cyan rubber cube**\n\n3. **Reasoning:**\n   - The green rubber cube alone does not activate the detector, as seen in the previous result.\n   - The cyan rubber cube, when combined with a cyan rubber cylinder and a cyan metal cylinder, results in the detector turning on. However, the cyan rubber cube alone or with other non-activating objects (like the green rubber cube) has not been shown to activate the detector.\n\nGiven the above observations, neither the green rubber cube nor the cyan rubber cube has been shown to activate the detector on their own or in combination with each other. Therefore, based on the available evidence, the detector light status for the new test case is likely to be \"off.\"\n\n<<<off>>>"
