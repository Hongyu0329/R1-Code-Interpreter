  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nbrown metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\npurple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine whether the new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that indicate which objects are blickets.\n\nLet's summarize the previous results:\n\n1. brown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\n2. gray rubber cylinder → off\n3. brown metal cube → on\n4. green metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\n5. purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\n6. green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nFrom these results, we can make the following observations:\n\n- The brown metal cube seems to be a blicket because it causes the detector to turn on both when alone and in combination with other objects.\n- The gray rubber cylinder is not a blicket, as it does not activate the detector when alone.\n- The blue metal cylinder appears to be a blicket because it causes the detector to turn on when combined with other objects.\n- The green rubber cube and red rubber cylinder do not seem to be blickets, as they do not activate the detector when alone or in combination with each other.\n- The purple metal cube might be a blicket, as it is part of a combination that activates the detector.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case:\n\n- green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder\n\nBased on our observations:\n\n- The green rubber cube and red rubber cylinder are not blickets.\n- The purple metal cube might be a blicket.\n- The blue metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\nSince the blue metal cylinder is present in the new test case and it is a blicket, the detector will likely turn on.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is \"on\".\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
