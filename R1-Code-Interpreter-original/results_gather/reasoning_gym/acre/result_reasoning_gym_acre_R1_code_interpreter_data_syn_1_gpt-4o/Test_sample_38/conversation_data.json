  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\ngreen metal cylinder → on\nred metal sphere → off\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off\ngreen metal sphere → off\nyellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere, green metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n### Observations from Previous Results:\n1. **Green Metal Cylinder**:\n   - Alone: Causes the detector to turn on.\n   - With Red Metal Sphere: Causes the detector to turn on.\n   \n   This suggests that the green metal cylinder is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **Red Metal Sphere**:\n   - Alone: Does not cause the detector to turn on.\n   - With Green Metal Cylinder: Causes the detector to turn on.\n   \n   This suggests that the red metal sphere is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Yellow Metal Sphere**:\n   - With Yellow Rubber Sphere and Brown Rubber Cylinder: Causes the detector to turn on.\n   - With Green Metal Sphere: Does not cause the detector to turn on.\n   \n   This suggests that the yellow metal sphere might be a blicket, but it is not conclusive without further evidence.\n\n4. **Green Metal Sphere**:\n   - Alone: Does not cause the detector to turn on.\n   - With Yellow Metal Sphere: Does not cause the detector to turn on.\n   \n   This suggests that the green metal sphere is not a blicket.\n\n5. **Yellow Rubber Sphere and Brown Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - With Yellow Metal Sphere: Causes the detector to turn on.\n   \n   This suggests that either the yellow rubber sphere or the brown rubber cylinder, or both, might be blickets.\n\n### New Test Case Analysis:\n- **Yellow Metal Sphere, Green Metal Sphere, Green Metal Cylinder**:\n  - The green metal cylinder is a known blicket, which should cause the detector to turn on regardless of the presence of other objects.\n  - The yellow metal sphere's status is uncertain, but it does not affect the outcome since the green metal cylinder is present.\n  - The green metal sphere is not a blicket, but its presence does not negate the effect of the green metal cylinder.\n\nGiven that the green metal cylinder is present and is a confirmed blicket, the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
