  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector.

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"purple rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The \"yellow metal sphere\" consistently causes the detector to turn on, whether alone or in combination with other objects.\n   - The \"yellow rubber cylinder\" alone does not activate the detector, but when combined with the \"yellow metal sphere,\" the detector turns on. This suggests that the \"yellow metal sphere\" is a blicket.\n   - The \"yellow metal cube\" does not activate the detector when combined with other objects that do not activate the detector.\n   - The \"purple rubber cube\" appears in two experiments:\n     - In combination with \"yellow metal cube, red metal cylinder,\" and \"purple rubber cube,\" the detector is off.\n     - In combination with \"blue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube,\" the detector is on. However, the presence of the \"blue metal sphere\" might be the cause of activation.\n\n2. **Analyze the New Test Case:**\n   - The \"purple rubber cube\" alone has not been tested before. In previous experiments, it was part of combinations that resulted in both \"on\" and \"off\" outcomes.\n   - Since the \"purple rubber cube\" was part of a combination that resulted in \"off\" and another that resulted in \"on\" (likely due to the presence of the \"blue metal sphere\"), there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the \"purple rubber cube\" alone can activate the detector.\n\nBased on the analysis, the status of the detector light for the \"purple rubber cube\" is undetermined. There is not enough evidence to conclude whether it will turn the detector on or off.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
