  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nred metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cube, red metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **cyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on**\n   - **cyan metal cylinder → on**\n   - **yellow metal cube → off**\n   - **red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off**\n   - **cyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off**\n   - **green metal cube, red metal cylinder → on**\n\n2. **Observations:**\n   - The presence of a **cyan metal cylinder** seems to be a strong indicator for the detector turning on, as seen in the first two results.\n   - The **yellow metal cube** alone does not activate the detector, but when combined with a cyan metal cylinder, it does.\n   - The **red metal cylinder** alone or with certain combinations does not activate the detector, but when combined with a green metal cube, it does.\n   - The presence of **gray rubber cube** and **green rubber cube** in combinations seems to correlate with the detector staying off.\n\n3. **New Test Case:**\n   - **cyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder**\n\n4. **Reasoning:**\n   - The new test case includes a **cyan metal cylinder**, which has been associated with the detector turning on in previous results.\n   - Although the test case also includes objects that have been associated with the detector staying off (e.g., gray rubber cube, green rubber cube), the presence of the cyan metal cylinder is a strong indicator that the detector will turn on.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the presence of the cyan metal cylinder in the new test case suggests that the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
