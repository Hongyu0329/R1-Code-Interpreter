  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal sphere → off\nblue metal cube → on\nblue metal cube, cyan metal sphere → on\ngray metal cube, cyan metal cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, cyan metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"cyan metal cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - \"cyan metal sphere\" → off\n   - \"blue metal cube\" → on\n   - \"blue metal cube, cyan metal sphere\" → on\n   - \"gray metal cube, cyan metal cube, cyan metal cylinder\" → on\n   - \"cyan metal cube\" → off\n   - \"red rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, cyan metal cube\" → off\n\n2. **Observations:**\n   - The \"blue metal cube\" seems to be a blicket since it causes the detector to turn on both alone and in combination with the \"cyan metal sphere.\"\n   - The \"cyan metal cube\" alone results in the detector being off.\n   - The \"cyan metal cube\" in combination with other objects (like in the last example) also results in the detector being off, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Conclusion for New Test Case:**\n   - Since the \"cyan metal cube\" alone has previously resulted in the detector being off, and there is no evidence from the other combinations that it can turn the detector on, we can conclude that the detector will stay off for the new test case.\n\n<<<off>>>"
