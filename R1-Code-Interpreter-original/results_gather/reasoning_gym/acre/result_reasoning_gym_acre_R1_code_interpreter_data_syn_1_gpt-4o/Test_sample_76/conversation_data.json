  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal sphere → on\npurple metal sphere → off\nred metal sphere, purple metal sphere → on\nblue metal sphere, purple metal cube, green metal cylinder → off\nred rubber cylinder, red rubber sphere, purple metal cube → on\ncyan rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, red rubber sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue metal sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n### Observations from Previous Results:\n1. **Red Metal Sphere**: The detector turns on.\n2. **Purple Metal Sphere**: The detector stays off.\n3. **Red Metal Sphere, Purple Metal Sphere**: The detector turns on.\n4. **Blue Metal Sphere, Purple Metal Cube, Green Metal Cylinder**: The detector stays off.\n5. **Red Rubber Cylinder, Red Rubber Sphere, Purple Metal Cube**: The detector turns on.\n6. **Cyan Rubber Cube, Red Rubber Cylinder, Red Rubber Sphere**: The detector turns on.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The presence of a \"red metal sphere\" seems to consistently turn the detector on, even when combined with other objects.\n- The \"purple metal sphere\" alone does not activate the detector, but when combined with a \"red metal sphere,\" the detector turns on, suggesting the red metal sphere is a blicket.\n- The combination of \"blue metal sphere, purple metal cube, green metal cylinder\" results in the detector staying off, indicating none of these objects are blickets.\n- The presence of \"red rubber cylinder\" and \"red rubber sphere\" in the last two examples also results in the detector turning on, suggesting these might also be blickets.\n\n### New Test Case: Blue Metal Sphere\n- From the previous results, the \"blue metal sphere\" was part of a combination that did not activate the detector. There is no evidence from the results that the \"blue metal sphere\" alone can activate the detector.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the \"blue metal sphere\" alone is likely not a blicket, as it was part of a combination that did not activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the \"blue metal sphere\" is likely to be \"off.\"\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
