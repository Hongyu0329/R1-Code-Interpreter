  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off\nblue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off\nyellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n### Observations from Previous Results:\n1. **Blue Rubber Cube**: \n   - When combined with a purple rubber cube, the detector turns on.\n   - Alone, it turns the detector on.\n   - In the new test case, it is present.\n\n2. **Purple Rubber Cube**:\n   - Alone, it does not activate the detector.\n   - When combined with a blue rubber cube, it activates the detector.\n\n3. **Blue Metal Cube, Blue Metal Cylinder, Blue Rubber Cylinder, Green Metal Cylinder**:\n   - This combination does not activate the detector.\n   - The presence of these objects alone or in combination does not seem to activate the detector.\n\n4. **Yellow Rubber Cube, Gray Metal Cylinder, Blue Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - This combination activates the detector.\n   - The blue rubber cylinder is present in both an \"on\" and \"off\" scenario, so it alone is not a determining factor.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The blue rubber cube seems to be a key object that can activate the detector, as it is present in all \"on\" scenarios.\n- The presence of the blue rubber cube in the new test case suggests that the detector will turn on, regardless of the other objects.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the presence of the blue rubber cube in the new test case, and its consistent association with the detector turning on in previous experiments, we can conclude that the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
