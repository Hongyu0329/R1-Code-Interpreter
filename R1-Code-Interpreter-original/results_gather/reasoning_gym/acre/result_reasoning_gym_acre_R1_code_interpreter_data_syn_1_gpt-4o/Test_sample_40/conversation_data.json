  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber cylinder → off\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on\nblue metal cube → off\nyellow metal cube → off\ngray metal sphere, red metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow metal cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - \"red rubber cylinder → off\": The red rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - \"brown rubber sphere → on\": The brown rubber sphere alone activates the detector.\n   - \"brown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on\": The presence of the brown rubber sphere seems to be the key factor in activating the detector, as it activates even with the red rubber cylinder.\n   - \"blue metal cube → off\": The blue metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - \"yellow metal cube → off\": The yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - \"gray metal sphere, red metal cube → on\": The combination of gray metal sphere and red metal cube activates the detector.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification:**\n   - The brown rubber sphere is a consistent activator of the detector.\n   - The combination of gray metal sphere and red metal cube also activates the detector.\n   - Metal cubes (blue and yellow) alone do not activate the detector.\n\n3. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - The new test case is \"yellow metal cube.\"\n   - From the previous results, we know that the yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the detector light status for the new test case \"yellow metal cube\" is determined to be \"off.\"\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
