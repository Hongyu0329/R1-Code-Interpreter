  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nblue rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off\nbrown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"green rubber sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Cyan Metal Cylinder**: This object alone turns the detector on.\n2. **Blue Rubber Cylinder**: This object alone does not turn the detector on.\n3. **Cyan Metal Cylinder + Blue Rubber Cylinder**: The presence of the cyan metal cylinder seems to be the determining factor for turning the detector on, as it turns on even with the blue rubber cylinder.\n4. **Brown Rubber Sphere**: This object alone turns the detector on.\n5. **Brown Rubber Cube + Green Rubber Sphere + Cyan Metal Cube**: This combination does not turn the detector on. The presence of the green rubber sphere in this combination does not activate the detector.\n6. **Brown Rubber Sphere + Brown Rubber Cube**: The presence of the brown rubber sphere seems to be the determining factor for turning the detector on, as it turns on even with the brown rubber cube.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- The cyan metal cylinder and the brown rubber sphere are likely blickets, as they consistently cause the detector to turn on.\n- The blue rubber cylinder and the green rubber sphere do not seem to activate the detector when combined with other objects that do not activate the detector.\n\nGiven the new test case \"green rubber sphere,\" and considering that the green rubber sphere was part of a combination that did not activate the detector, it is reasonable to conclude that the green rubber sphere alone will not activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"green rubber sphere\" is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
