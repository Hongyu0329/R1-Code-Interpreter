  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cylinder → on\nblue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **gray rubber cylinder → off**: This suggests that the gray rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **blue metal cylinder → on**: This indicates that the blue metal cylinder alone activates the detector.\n   - **blue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the blue metal cylinder seems to be the activating factor since it was already known to activate the detector.\n   - **cyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on**: The cyan metal cube or the combination with the brown rubber cube activates the detector.\n   - **brown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off**: Neither the brown rubber cube nor the cyan rubber cube alone or in combination activates the detector.\n   - **cyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off**: Reaffirms that neither the cyan rubber cube nor the brown rubber cube activates the detector.\n\n2. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - **brown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube**: \n     - From the previous results, the brown rubber cube and cyan rubber cube together do not activate the detector.\n     - The cyan metal cube, when combined with the brown rubber cube, activated the detector in a previous test.\n\nGiven this information, the presence of the cyan metal cube in the new test case is likely to activate the detector, as it did in the previous experiment when combined with the brown rubber cube.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is likely to be \"on\".\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
