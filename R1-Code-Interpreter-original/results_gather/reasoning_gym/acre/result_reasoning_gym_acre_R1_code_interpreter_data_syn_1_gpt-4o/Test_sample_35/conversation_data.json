  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal sphere, gray rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, brown rubber cube, yellow metal cube, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal cube → off\nbrown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngray rubber sphere, brown rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n### Observations from Previous Results:\n1. **Gray Metal Sphere**:\n   - When combined with a gray rubber sphere, the detector turns on.\n   - Alone, it also turns on the detector.\n   - This suggests that the gray metal sphere is likely a blicket.\n\n2. **Gray Rubber Sphere**:\n   - When combined with a gray metal sphere, the detector turns on.\n   - Alone, it does not turn on the detector.\n   - This suggests that the gray rubber sphere is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Red Metal Cylinder, Brown Rubber Cube, Yellow Metal Cube, Yellow Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - This combination turns on the detector.\n   - However, when the yellow rubber cylinder and yellow metal cube are tested together, the detector does not turn on.\n   - This suggests that the red metal cylinder might be a blicket, but we need more information to confirm.\n\n4. **Yellow Rubber Cylinder, Yellow Metal Cube**:\n   - This combination does not turn on the detector.\n   - This suggests that neither the yellow rubber cylinder nor the yellow metal cube is a blicket.\n\n5. **Brown Rubber Cube**:\n   - Alone, it does not turn on the detector.\n   - This suggests that the brown rubber cube is not a blicket.\n\n### New Test Case Analysis:\n- **Gray Rubber Sphere, Brown Rubber Cube**:\n  - From the previous results, we know that neither the gray rubber sphere nor the brown rubber cube is a blicket.\n  - Since both objects in the new test case are not blickets, the detector is unlikely to turn on.\n\nBased on this analysis, the detector light status for the new test case is \"off\".\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
