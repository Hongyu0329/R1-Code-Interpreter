  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber cylinder → off\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on\nblue metal cube → off\nyellow metal cube → off\ngray metal sphere, red metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal cube, gray metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **red rubber cylinder → off**: The red rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **brown rubber sphere → on**: The brown rubber sphere alone activates the detector.\n   - **brown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the brown rubber sphere seems to be the key factor in activating the detector, as it activates even with the red rubber cylinder.\n   - **blue metal cube → off**: The blue metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **yellow metal cube → off**: The yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **gray metal sphere, red metal cube → on**: The combination of gray metal sphere and red metal cube activates the detector.\n\n2. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - **yellow metal cube, gray metal sphere**: \n     - The yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector (as seen in the previous results).\n     - The gray metal sphere, when combined with a red metal cube, activates the detector. However, we do not have evidence that the gray metal sphere alone or with a yellow metal cube will activate the detector.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The yellow metal cube is known to not activate the detector.\n   - The gray metal sphere's ability to activate the detector is only confirmed when combined with a red metal cube, not with a yellow metal cube.\n\nGiven the lack of evidence that the combination of a yellow metal cube and a gray metal sphere will activate the detector, the status of the detector light for this new test case is \"undetermined.\"\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
