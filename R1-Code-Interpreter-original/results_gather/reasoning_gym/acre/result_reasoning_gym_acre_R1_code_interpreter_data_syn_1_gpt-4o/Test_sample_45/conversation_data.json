  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cylinder → off\npurple metal cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\npurple metal cube → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, cyan rubber cube → on\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\npurple metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"purple metal cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\nLet's summarize the previous results:\n\n1. blue rubber cylinder → off\n2. purple metal cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\n3. purple metal cube → on\n4. cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube → off\n5. red rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, cyan rubber cube → on\n6. red rubber cube, cyan metal cube → on\n\nFrom these results, we can observe the following:\n\n- The \"purple metal cube\" alone causes the detector to turn on (as seen in result 3).\n- The presence of the \"purple metal cube\" in combination with other objects (as in result 2) also results in the detector turning on.\n\nGiven this information, the presence of the \"purple metal cube\" is sufficient to activate the detector.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to the new test case:\n\n- The new test case is \"purple metal cube.\"\n\nSince the \"purple metal cube\" alone has been shown to activate the detector in previous experiments, we can conclude that the detector light will turn on for this new test case.\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
