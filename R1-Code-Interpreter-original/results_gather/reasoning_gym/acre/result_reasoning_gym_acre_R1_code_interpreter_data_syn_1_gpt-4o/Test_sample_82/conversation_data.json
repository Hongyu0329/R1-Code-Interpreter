  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal cube, green metal cube → on\nred metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen metal cube, blue rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can be inferred.\n\n1. **Red Metal Cube:**\n   - When the red metal cube is present, the detector turns on (both when alone and with the green metal cube).\n   - This suggests that the red metal cube is a blicket.\n\n2. **Green Metal Cube:**\n   - When the green metal cube is alone, the detector is off.\n   - When combined with the red metal cube, the detector is on, but this is likely due to the presence of the red metal cube.\n\n3. **Blue Rubber Cube:**\n   - When the blue rubber cube is present, the detector turns on (even when alone).\n   - This suggests that the blue rubber cube is a blicket.\n\n4. **Blue Metal Cube:**\n   - When the blue metal cube is combined with the purple metal cube, the detector is on.\n   - However, the blue rubber cylinder combined with the purple metal cube results in the detector being off, suggesting that the purple metal cube is not a blicket.\n\n5. **Blue Rubber Cylinder:**\n   - When combined with the purple metal cube, the detector is off.\n   - This suggests that the blue rubber cylinder is not a blicket.\n\n6. **Purple Metal Cube:**\n   - As mentioned, when combined with the blue rubber cylinder, the detector is off, indicating it is not a blicket.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: **green metal cube, blue rubber cylinder**.\n\n- The green metal cube alone results in the detector being off.\n- The blue rubber cylinder, when combined with the purple metal cube, also results in the detector being off.\n\nSince neither the green metal cube nor the blue rubber cylinder has been shown to activate the detector in previous experiments, we can conclude that the combination of these two objects will not activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
