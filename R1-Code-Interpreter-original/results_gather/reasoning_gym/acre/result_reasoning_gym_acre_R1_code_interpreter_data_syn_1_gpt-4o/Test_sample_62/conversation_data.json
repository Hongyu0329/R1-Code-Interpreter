  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nyellow rubber sphere, cyan rubber cube → on\ncyan rubber cube → off\nyellow rubber sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder, red rubber cylinder, red metal cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\nred metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder, blue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n### Observations from Previous Results:\n1. **yellow rubber sphere, cyan rubber cube → on**\n2. **cyan rubber cube → off**\n3. **yellow rubber sphere → on**\n4. **red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → off**\n5. **blue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder, red rubber cylinder, red metal cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on**\n6. **red metal cylinder, yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, red rubber cylinder → off**\n\n### Analysis:\n- The **yellow rubber sphere** seems to be a strong candidate for being a blicket since it consistently turns the detector on when present (observations 1 and 3).\n- The **cyan rubber cube** alone does not activate the detector (observation 2).\n- The combination of **red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder** consistently results in the detector being off (observations 4 and 6).\n- The presence of the **blue metal cube** and **purple rubber cylinder** in observation 5 results in the detector being on, suggesting that one or both of these objects might be blickets.\n\n### New Test Case:\n- **red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder, blue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder**\n\nThe new test case includes the combination of objects that previously resulted in the detector being off (red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder) and also includes the blue metal cube and purple rubber cylinder, which were part of the combination that turned the detector on in observation 5.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the blue metal cube and purple rubber cylinder were part of the combination that turned the detector on in observation 5, and they are present in the new test case, it is likely that the detector will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
