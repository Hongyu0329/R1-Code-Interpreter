  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\ngray rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube, blue metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine whether the detector light will turn on or off for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Gray Rubber Cube**: The detector turns on when this object is present, suggesting it might be a blicket.\n2. **Purple Rubber Cube**: The detector turns off when this object is present alone, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n3. **Gray Rubber Cube + Purple Rubber Cube**: The detector turns on, reinforcing the idea that the gray rubber cube is a blicket.\n4. **Blue Rubber Cylinder, Blue Metal Cylinder, Brown Metal Cube, Green Metal Cylinder**: The detector turns on with this combination, but it's unclear which specific object(s) are blickets.\n5. **Gray Metal Cube + Red Rubber Cube**: The detector turns off, suggesting neither is a blicket.\n6. **Green Metal Cylinder, Brown Metal Cube, Gray Metal Cube, Red Rubber Cube**: The detector turns off, reinforcing that these objects are not blickets.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: **Gray Metal Cube, Red Rubber Cube, Blue Metal Cylinder**.\n\n- From previous results, the gray metal cube and red rubber cube together result in the detector being off.\n- The blue metal cylinder was part of a combination that turned the detector on, but it was not tested alone, so we cannot definitively say it is a blicket.\n\nGiven the presence of the gray metal cube and red rubber cube, which previously resulted in the detector being off, and the lack of conclusive evidence that the blue metal cylinder is a blicket, the most likely outcome is that the detector will stay off.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
