  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder → on\nbrown metal cylinder → off\ngreen metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal sphere → on\nblue metal sphere, gray rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\ngray metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"gray metal cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\nLet's break down the previous results:\n\n1. \"gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder → on\": This suggests that either the gray metal cylinder or the brown metal cylinder (or both) can activate the detector.\n\n2. \"gray metal cylinder → on\": This indicates that the gray metal cylinder alone is sufficient to activate the detector.\n\n3. \"brown metal cylinder → off\": This suggests that the brown metal cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n\n4. \"green metal cube → on\": This indicates that the green metal cube alone can activate the detector.\n\n5. \"green metal cube, blue metal sphere → on\": This suggests that the green metal cube is likely the activating object, as it was already known to activate the detector on its own.\n\n6. \"blue metal sphere, gray rubber cylinder → off\": This suggests that neither the blue metal sphere nor the gray rubber cylinder can activate the detector.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that the gray metal cylinder is a blicket, as it consistently activates the detector when present.\n\nNow, let's apply this understanding to the new test case:\n\n- \"gray metal cylinder\": Based on the previous results, the gray metal cylinder alone is known to activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"gray metal cylinder\" is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
