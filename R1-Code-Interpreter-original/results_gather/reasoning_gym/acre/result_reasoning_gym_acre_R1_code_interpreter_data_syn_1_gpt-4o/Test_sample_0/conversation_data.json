  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\ngray rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nred rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Analyze the previous results:**\n   - \"gray rubber cube\" results in \"on.\"\n   - \"purple rubber cube\" results in \"off.\"\n   - \"gray rubber cube, purple rubber cube\" results in \"on.\"\n   - \"blue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder\" results in \"on.\"\n   - \"gray metal cube, red rubber cube\" results in \"off.\"\n   - \"green metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube\" results in \"off.\"\n\n2. **Identify potential patterns:**\n   - The \"gray rubber cube\" seems to be a blicket since it consistently results in \"on\" when present.\n   - The \"purple rubber cube\" seems to be non-blicket since it results in \"off\" when alone.\n   - The \"red rubber cube\" appears in combinations that result in \"off,\" suggesting it might not be a blicket.\n\n3. **Evaluate the new test case:**\n   - The new test case is \"red rubber cube.\" In previous results, the \"red rubber cube\" was part of combinations that resulted in \"off.\"\n   - There is no evidence from the previous results that the \"red rubber cube\" can activate the detector on its own.\n\nBased on the analysis, the \"red rubber cube\" does not appear to be a blicket, as it has only been associated with \"off\" results in previous experiments.\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
