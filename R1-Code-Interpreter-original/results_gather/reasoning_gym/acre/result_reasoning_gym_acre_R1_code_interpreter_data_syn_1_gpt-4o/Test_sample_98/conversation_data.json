  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal sphere, purple metal cylinder, yellow rubber sphere → off\npurple metal cylinder → off\ngreen metal cube, blue rubber cube, purple metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Gray Rubber Cylinder**: \n   - Alone, it turns the detector on.\n   - With a green rubber cylinder, it still turns the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the gray rubber cylinder is a blicket.\n\n2. **Green Rubber Cylinder**:\n   - Alone, it does not turn the detector on.\n   - With a gray rubber cylinder, the detector is on, but this is likely due to the gray rubber cylinder.\n   - This suggests that the green rubber cylinder is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Cyan Metal Sphere, Purple Metal Cylinder, Yellow Rubber Sphere**:\n   - This combination does not turn the detector on.\n   - The purple metal cylinder alone also does not turn the detector on.\n   - This suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n\n4. **Green Metal Cube, Blue Rubber Cube, Purple Metal Cylinder**:\n   - This combination turns the detector on.\n   - The purple metal cylinder alone does not turn the detector on, so it is not a blicket.\n   - The blue rubber cube is part of a combination that turns the detector on, but it is not clear if it is a blicket.\n   - The green metal cube is part of a combination that turns the detector on, suggesting it might be a blicket.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: **Green Rubber Cylinder, Blue Rubber Cube, Green Metal Cube**.\n\n- **Green Rubber Cylinder**: Previously determined not to be a blicket.\n- **Blue Rubber Cube**: Part of a combination that turned the detector on, but not enough evidence to conclude it is a blicket.\n- **Green Metal Cube**: Part of a combination that turned the detector on, suggesting it might be a blicket.\n\nGiven the evidence, the green metal cube is likely a blicket, which would cause the detector to turn on. The presence of the green rubber cylinder and blue rubber cube does not negate this, as they do not have a known negative effect.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is likely to be \"on\".\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
