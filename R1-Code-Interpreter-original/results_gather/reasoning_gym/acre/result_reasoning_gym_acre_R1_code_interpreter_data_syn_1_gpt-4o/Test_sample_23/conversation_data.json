  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nblue rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off\nbrown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cylinder, green rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The cyan metal cylinder consistently causes the detector to turn on, regardless of other objects present.\n   - The blue rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - The brown rubber sphere consistently causes the detector to turn on, even when combined with other objects.\n   - The brown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, and cyan metal cube combination does not activate the detector.\n\n2. **Analyze the New Test Case:**\n   - The new test case involves a blue rubber cylinder and a green rubber sphere.\n   - From the previous results, the blue rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n   - The green rubber sphere was part of a combination that did not activate the detector.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since neither the blue rubber cylinder nor the green rubber sphere has been shown to activate the detector in previous experiments, and there is no evidence of them activating the detector when combined, we can conclude that the detector will likely stay off.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case is:\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
