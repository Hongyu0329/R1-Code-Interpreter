    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red rubber sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - The \"red metal sphere\" alone turns the detector on.\n   - The \"purple metal sphere\" alone does not turn the detector on.\n   - The combination of \"red metal sphere\" and \"purple metal sphere\" turns the detector on, suggesting that the \"red metal sphere\" is a blicket.\n   - The combination of \"blue metal sphere,\" \"purple metal cube,\" and \"green metal cylinder\" does not turn the detector on, indicating none of these are blickets.\n   - The combination of \"red rubber cylinder,\" \"red rubber sphere,\" and \"purple metal cube\" turns the detector on. This suggests that either the \"red rubber cylinder\" or the \"red rubber sphere\" is a blicket, or both.\n   - The combination of \"cyan rubber cube,\" \"red rubber cylinder,\" and \"red rubber sphere\" also turns the detector on, reinforcing the possibility that the \"red rubber cylinder\" or the \"red rubber sphere\" is a blicket.\n\n2. **Inference:**\n   - The \"red rubber sphere\" appears in two combinations that turn the detector on. This suggests that the \"red rubber sphere\" might be a blicket.\n   - Since the \"red rubber sphere\" is present in both combinations that result in the detector turning on, it is likely that the \"red rubber sphere\" itself is a blicket.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the \"red rubber sphere\" will likely cause the detector to activate.\n\n<<<on>>>"
