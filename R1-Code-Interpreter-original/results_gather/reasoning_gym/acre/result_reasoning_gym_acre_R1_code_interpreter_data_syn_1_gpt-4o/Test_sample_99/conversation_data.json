  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal sphere, purple metal cylinder, yellow rubber sphere → off\npurple metal cylinder → off\ngreen metal cube, blue rubber cube, purple metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cylinder, gray rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n### Observations from Previous Results:\n1. **Gray Rubber Cylinder:**\n   - Alone: On\n   - With Green Rubber Cylinder: On\n\n2. **Green Rubber Cylinder:**\n   - Alone: Off\n   - With Gray Rubber Cylinder: On\n\n3. **Cyan Metal Sphere, Purple Metal Cylinder, Yellow Rubber Sphere:**\n   - All together: Off\n\n4. **Purple Metal Cylinder:**\n   - Alone: Off\n   - With Green Metal Cube and Blue Rubber Cube: On\n\n5. **Green Metal Cube, Blue Rubber Cube, Purple Metal Cylinder:**\n   - Together: On\n\n### Analysis:\n- The **Gray Rubber Cylinder** seems to be a blicket because it turns the detector on both alone and in combination with the Green Rubber Cylinder.\n- The **Green Rubber Cylinder** alone does not activate the detector, but when combined with the Gray Rubber Cylinder, the detector turns on. This suggests that the Gray Rubber Cylinder is the activating object in this combination.\n- The **Purple Metal Cylinder** does not activate the detector alone, but it does when combined with other objects (Green Metal Cube and Blue Rubber Cube), indicating that it is not a blicket by itself.\n- The combination of **Green Metal Cube, Blue Rubber Cube, and Purple Metal Cylinder** activates the detector, suggesting that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n\n### Conclusion for New Test Case:\n- The new test case involves the **Green Rubber Cylinder** and the **Gray Rubber Cylinder**.\n- Since the Gray Rubber Cylinder is a blicket (as it activates the detector both alone and in combination with the Green Rubber Cylinder), the presence of the Gray Rubber Cylinder in the new test case will cause the detector to turn on.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
