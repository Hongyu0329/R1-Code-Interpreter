    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow rubber sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - \"green metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\"\n   - \"green metal cylinder → on\"\n   - \"red metal sphere → off\"\n   - \"yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off\"\n   - \"green metal sphere → off\"\n   - \"yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\"\n\n2. **Observations:**\n   - The \"green metal cylinder\" seems to be a blicket since it causes the detector to turn on both when alone and in combination with the \"red metal sphere.\"\n   - The \"red metal sphere\" alone does not activate the detector, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n   - The \"yellow metal sphere\" and \"green metal sphere\" do not activate the detector when combined or alone, suggesting they are not blickets.\n   - The combination \"yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere\" activates the detector, indicating that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n\n3. **Inference for the New Test Case:**\n   - The \"yellow rubber sphere\" is part of a combination that activated the detector. However, without additional evidence, we cannot conclusively determine if it alone is a blicket.\n   - Since the \"yellow rubber sphere\" was part of a combination that turned the detector on, but we lack evidence of it activating the detector alone, the status is \"undetermined.\"\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow rubber sphere\" is:\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
