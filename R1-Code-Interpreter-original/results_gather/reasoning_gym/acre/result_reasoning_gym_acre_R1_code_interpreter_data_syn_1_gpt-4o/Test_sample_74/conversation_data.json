  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\ngray rubber cube → on\ngray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\nbrown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cube, brown rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **brown metal cube → off**: The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **gray rubber cube → on**: The gray rubber cube alone activates the detector.\n   - **gray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on**: The presence of the gray rubber cube activates the detector, even with the brown metal cube.\n   - **blue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off**: None of these objects activate the detector.\n   - **brown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on**: The brown rubber cube activates the detector, even with the blue rubber cylinder.\n   - **green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off**: Neither of these objects activate the detector.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification:**\n   - The gray rubber cube is a blicket since it activates the detector.\n   - The brown rubber cube is also a blicket since it activates the detector when combined with the blue rubber cylinder, which is known to not activate the detector on its own.\n\n3. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - **brown metal cube, brown rubber cube**: The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector. However, the brown rubber cube is a blicket and activates the detector.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the presence of the brown rubber cube in the new test case will cause the detector to activate.\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
