  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nyellow rubber cylinder → off\nyellow metal sphere → on\nyellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nblue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube, blue metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Identify Objects and Outcomes:**\n   - **Yellow rubber cylinder**: off\n   - **Yellow metal sphere**: on\n   - **Yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder**: on\n   - **Yellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube**: off\n   - **Blue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube**: on\n   - **Green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube**: off\n\n2. **Analyze Patterns:**\n   - The presence of the **yellow metal sphere** seems to turn the detector on, as seen in the second and third examples.\n   - The presence of the **blue metal sphere** also seems to turn the detector on, as seen in the fifth example.\n   - The combination of **yellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube** results in the detector being off, as seen in the fourth and sixth examples.\n\n3. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - **Green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube, blue metal sphere**\n\n   The new test case includes the **blue metal sphere**, which in the previous example (fifth) caused the detector to turn on. This suggests that the presence of the blue metal sphere is a strong indicator that the detector will turn on.\n\nBased on this analysis, the presence of the blue metal sphere in the new test case suggests that the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
