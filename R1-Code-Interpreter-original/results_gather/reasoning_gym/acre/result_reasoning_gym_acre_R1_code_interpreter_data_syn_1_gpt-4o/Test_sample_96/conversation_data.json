  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal sphere, purple metal cylinder, yellow rubber sphere → off\npurple metal cylinder → off\ngreen metal cube, blue rubber cube, purple metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - \"gray rubber cylinder\" → on\n   - \"gray rubber cylinder, green rubber cylinder\" → on\n   - \"green rubber cylinder\" → off\n   - \"cyan metal sphere, purple metal cylinder, yellow rubber sphere\" → off\n   - \"purple metal cylinder\" → off\n   - \"green metal cube, blue rubber cube, purple metal cylinder\" → on\n\n2. **Observations:**\n   - The \"gray rubber cylinder\" seems to be a blicket since it consistently turns the detector on.\n   - The \"green rubber cylinder\" alone does not activate the detector, but when combined with the \"gray rubber cylinder,\" the detector turns on, suggesting the \"gray rubber cylinder\" is the activating object.\n   - The \"purple metal cylinder\" does not activate the detector, as seen in two examples.\n   - The \"green metal cube\" and \"blue rubber cube\" together with the \"purple metal cylinder\" activate the detector, suggesting that either the \"green metal cube\" or the \"blue rubber cube\" is a blicket.\n\n3. **New Test Case: \"blue rubber cube\"**\n   - The \"blue rubber cube\" was part of a combination that activated the detector in a previous experiment. However, it was combined with other objects, so we cannot definitively conclude that it is a blicket on its own.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the \"blue rubber cube\" was part of a combination that turned the detector on, but there is no evidence that it can do so independently, the status of the detector light for the \"blue rubber cube\" alone is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
