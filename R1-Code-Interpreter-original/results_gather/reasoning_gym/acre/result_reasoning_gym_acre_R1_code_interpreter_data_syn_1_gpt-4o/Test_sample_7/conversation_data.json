  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber sphere → off\nblue metal sphere, red rubber sphere → on\nblue metal sphere → on\nred metal sphere, brown rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, brown rubber sphere, red metal sphere → on\nyellow rubber sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nred rubber sphere, brown rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **red rubber sphere → off**: A single red rubber sphere does not activate the detector.\n   - **blue metal sphere, red rubber sphere → on**: The presence of a blue metal sphere with a red rubber sphere activates the detector.\n   - **blue metal sphere → on**: A single blue metal sphere activates the detector.\n   - **red metal sphere, brown rubber sphere → off**: A combination of a red metal sphere and a brown rubber sphere does not activate the detector.\n   - **gray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, brown rubber sphere, red metal sphere → on**: This combination activates the detector.\n   - **yellow rubber sphere → on**: A single yellow rubber sphere activates the detector.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification:**\n   - The blue metal sphere seems to be a strong candidate for being a blicket since it activates the detector both alone and in combination with a red rubber sphere.\n   - The yellow rubber sphere also activates the detector on its own, suggesting it might be a blicket.\n   - The red rubber sphere alone does not activate the detector, and neither does the combination of a red metal sphere and a brown rubber sphere.\n\n3. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - **red rubber sphere, brown rubber sphere**: \n     - The red rubber sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n     - The brown rubber sphere, when combined with a red metal sphere, does not activate the detector.\n     - There is no evidence from previous results that either the red rubber sphere or the brown rubber sphere can activate the detector.\n\nBased on the analysis, the new combination of a red rubber sphere and a brown rubber sphere does not include any object that has been shown to activate the detector in previous experiments. Therefore, the detector light status for this new test case is likely to be \"off\".\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
