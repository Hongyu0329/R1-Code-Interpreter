  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal sphere, yellow metal cube → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nbrown metal sphere → on\nbrown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\ncyan metal sphere, gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere → on\npurple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nred rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the detector light status for the new test case \"red rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\nLet's break down the previous results:\n\n1. **brown metal sphere, yellow metal cube → on**\n2. **yellow metal cube → off**\n3. **brown metal sphere → on**\n4. **brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off**\n5. **cyan metal sphere, gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere → on**\n6. **purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off**\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer the following:\n\n- The \"brown metal sphere\" seems to be a blicket because it consistently causes the detector to turn on (examples 1 and 3).\n- The \"yellow metal cube\" does not seem to be a blicket on its own (example 2).\n- The \"red rubber cube\" appears in examples 4 and 6, both of which result in the detector staying off. This suggests that the \"red rubber cube\" is not a blicket.\n\nGiven that the \"red rubber cube\" has consistently been associated with the detector staying off in previous experiments, we can conclude that the detector light will stay off for the new test case \"red rubber cube.\"\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
