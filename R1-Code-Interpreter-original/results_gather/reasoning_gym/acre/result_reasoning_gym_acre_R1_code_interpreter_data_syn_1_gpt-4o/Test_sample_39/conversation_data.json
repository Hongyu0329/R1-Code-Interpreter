  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\ngreen metal cylinder → on\nred metal sphere → off\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off\ngreen metal sphere → off\nyellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere, red metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **green metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on**: The presence of the green metal cylinder seems to activate the detector.\n   - **green metal cylinder → on**: Confirms that the green metal cylinder alone can activate the detector.\n   - **red metal sphere → off**: The red metal sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off**: Neither the yellow metal sphere nor the green metal sphere activates the detector.\n   - **green metal sphere → off**: Confirms that the green metal sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n   - **yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on**: The combination of these objects activates the detector, but it's unclear which specific object(s) are responsible.\n\n2. **New Test Case Analysis:**\n   - **yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere, red metal sphere**: \n     - From previous results, the yellow metal sphere and green metal sphere together do not activate the detector.\n     - The red metal sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n     - There is no evidence that any combination of these three objects has previously activated the detector.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the objects in the new test case have been shown to activate the detector in previous experiments. Therefore, the detector light status for the new test case is likely to be \"off.\"\n\n<<<off>>>"
