  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nred metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cube, red metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"cyan metal cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\nLet's break down the previous results:\n\n1. \"cyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on\"\n2. \"cyan metal cylinder → on\"\n3. \"yellow metal cube → off\"\n4. \"red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off\"\n5. \"cyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off\"\n6. \"green metal cube, red metal cylinder → on\"\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The \"cyan metal cylinder\" alone causes the detector to turn on, as seen in the second result.\n- The \"yellow metal cube\" alone does not activate the detector, as seen in the third result.\n- The presence of the \"cyan metal cylinder\" in the first result also leads to the detector being on, supporting the conclusion that the \"cyan metal cylinder\" is a blicket.\n- Other combinations without the \"cyan metal cylinder\" do not activate the detector, suggesting that the \"cyan metal cylinder\" is a key factor in turning the detector on.\n\nGiven this analysis, the new test case \"cyan metal cylinder\" should cause the detector to turn on, as it has been shown to do so in previous experiments.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"cyan metal cylinder\" is:\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
