  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nred metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cube, red metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, yellow metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or causal relationships.\n\n1. **Cyan Metal Cylinder**: \n   - When tested alone, it turns the detector on.\n   - When combined with a yellow metal cube, it also turns the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the cyan metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\n2. **Yellow Metal Cube**:\n   - When tested alone, it does not turn the detector on.\n   - When combined with a cyan metal cylinder, it turns the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the yellow metal cube is not a blicket.\n\n3. **Red Metal Cylinder**:\n   - When combined with a green metal cube, it turns the detector on.\n   - When combined with other non-blicket objects, it does not turn the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the red metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\n4. **Green Metal Cube**:\n   - When combined with a red metal cylinder, it turns the detector on.\n   - This suggests that the green metal cube is a blicket.\n\n5. **Cyan Rubber Cylinder, Green Rubber Cube, Gray Rubber Cube**:\n   - These objects, when combined with other non-blicket objects, do not turn the detector on.\n   - This suggests that these objects are not blickets.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: \n- Cyan Rubber Cylinder\n- Green Rubber Cube\n- Red Metal Cylinder\n- Gray Rubber Cube\n- Yellow Metal Cube\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- The red metal cylinder is a blicket.\n- The presence of a blicket (red metal cylinder) in the combination suggests that the detector will turn on.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is \"on\".\n\n<<<on>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
