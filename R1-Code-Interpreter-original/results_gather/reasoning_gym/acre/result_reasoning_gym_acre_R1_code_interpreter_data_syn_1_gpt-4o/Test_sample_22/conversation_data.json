  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nblue rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off\nbrown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cylinder, cyan metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results and identify any patterns or rules that can help us predict the outcome.\n\n1. **Previous Results Analysis:**\n   - **Cyan metal cylinder**: on\n   - **Blue rubber cylinder**: off\n   - **Cyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder**: on\n   - **Brown rubber sphere**: on\n   - **Brown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube**: off\n   - **Brown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube**: on\n\n2. **Observations:**\n   - The cyan metal cylinder consistently causes the detector to turn on, even when combined with the blue rubber cylinder, which by itself turns the detector off.\n   - The brown rubber sphere also consistently causes the detector to turn on.\n   - The cyan metal cube, when combined with other objects, results in the detector staying off.\n\n3. **New Test Case:**\n   - **Blue rubber cylinder, cyan metal cube**\n\n4. **Reasoning:**\n   - The blue rubber cylinder alone results in the detector being off.\n   - The cyan metal cube, when combined with other objects, has resulted in the detector being off.\n   - There is no evidence from the previous results that either the blue rubber cylinder or the cyan metal cube can turn the detector on when combined.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the new combination of objects (blue rubber cylinder, cyan metal cube) is likely to result in the detector staying off, as neither object has shown the ability to activate the detector in previous experiments.\n\n<<<off>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments.
