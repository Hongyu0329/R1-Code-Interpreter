  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cylinder → on\nblue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube, blue metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. The blue metal cylinder alone causes the detector to turn on.\n2. The blue metal cylinder combined with the gray rubber cylinder also causes the detector to turn on, indicating that the blue metal cylinder is likely a blicket.\n3. The cyan metal cube and brown rubber cube together cause the detector to turn on, but the brown rubber cube combined with the cyan rubber cube does not, suggesting that the cyan metal cube is likely a blicket.\n4. The brown rubber cube and cyan rubber cube together do not activate the detector, indicating neither is a blicket.\n\nIn the new test case, we have:\n- Brown rubber cube: previously shown not to activate the detector.\n- Cyan rubber cube: previously shown not to activate the detector.\n- Blue metal cylinder: previously shown to activate the detector.\n\nSince the blue metal cylinder is present in the new test case and it has been shown to activate the detector in previous experiments, we can conclude that the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
