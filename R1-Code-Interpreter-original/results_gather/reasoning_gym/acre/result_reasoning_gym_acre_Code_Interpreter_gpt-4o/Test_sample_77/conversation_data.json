  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal sphere → on\npurple metal sphere → off\nred metal sphere, purple metal sphere → on\nblue metal sphere, purple metal cube, green metal cylinder → off\nred rubber cylinder, red rubber sphere, purple metal cube → on\ncyan rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, red rubber sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nred rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red rubber sphere,\" we can analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. \"red metal sphere → on\" suggests that the red metal sphere is a blicket.\n2. \"purple metal sphere → off\" suggests that the purple metal sphere is not a blicket.\n3. \"red metal sphere, purple metal sphere → on\" confirms that the red metal sphere is a blicket, as it activates the detector even when combined with a non-blicket.\n4. \"blue metal sphere, purple metal cube, green metal cylinder → off\" suggests that none of these objects are blickets.\n5. \"red rubber cylinder, red rubber sphere, purple metal cube → on\" suggests that either the red rubber cylinder or the red rubber sphere is a blicket, as the purple metal cube is not a blicket.\n6. \"cyan rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, red rubber sphere → on\" suggests that either the red rubber cylinder or the red rubber sphere is a blicket, as the cyan rubber cube is not a blicket.\n\nFrom observations 5 and 6, we can infer that the red rubber sphere is likely a blicket, as it appears in both combinations that activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case \"red rubber sphere,\" the detector light status is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
