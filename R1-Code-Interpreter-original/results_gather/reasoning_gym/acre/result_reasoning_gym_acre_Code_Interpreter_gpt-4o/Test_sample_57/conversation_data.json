  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nyellow rubber cylinder → off\nyellow metal sphere → on\nyellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nblue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nblue metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue metal sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. yellow rubber cylinder → off\n2. yellow metal sphere → on\n3. yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → on\n4. yellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\n5. blue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → on\n6. green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → off\n\nFrom these results, we can observe the following:\n\n- The yellow metal sphere is a blicket because it causes the detector to turn on (example 2).\n- The blue metal sphere is part of a combination that turns the detector on (example 5), but it is not clear if it is a blicket on its own since it is combined with other objects.\n- The yellow rubber cylinder does not activate the detector on its own (example 1) but does not prevent activation when combined with a blicket (example 3).\n- The yellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, and green rubber cube do not activate the detector (examples 4 and 6).\n\nSince the blue metal sphere is part of a combination that turns the detector on (example 5), and there is no evidence that it is not a blicket, we can conclude that the blue metal sphere is likely a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"blue metal sphere\" is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
