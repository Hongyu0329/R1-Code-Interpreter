  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nbrown metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\npurple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > Based on the previous experimental results, we can observe the following:\n\n1. The brown metal cube alone causes the detector to turn on, as seen in the example \"brown metal cube → on\".\n2. The gray rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector, as seen in \"gray rubber cylinder → off\".\n3. The green rubber cube and red rubber cylinder together do not activate the detector, as seen in \"green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\".\n4. The combination of green metal cube and blue metal cylinder activates the detector, as seen in \"green metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\".\n5. The combination of purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, and green rubber cube activates the detector, as seen in \"purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\".\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that the brown metal cube is a blicket, as it alone can activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case \"brown metal cube\", the detector light status is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
