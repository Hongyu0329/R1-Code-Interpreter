  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber sphere → off\nblue metal sphere, red rubber sphere → on\nblue metal sphere → on\nred metal sphere, brown rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, brown rubber sphere, red metal sphere → on\nyellow rubber sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case with a cyan rubber cube, let's analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **red rubber sphere → off**: The red rubber sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n2. **blue metal sphere, red rubber sphere → on**: The combination activates the detector, suggesting the blue metal sphere might be a blicket.\n3. **blue metal sphere → on**: Confirms that the blue metal sphere is a blicket.\n4. **red metal sphere, brown rubber sphere → off**: Neither the red metal sphere nor the brown rubber sphere is a blicket.\n5. **gray metal sphere, cyan rubber cube, brown rubber sphere, red metal sphere → on**: The presence of the cyan rubber cube in this combination results in activation, but it is not conclusive on its own since other objects are present.\n6. **yellow rubber sphere → on**: The yellow rubber sphere is a blicket.\n\nFor the new test case with only a cyan rubber cube, we have insufficient evidence to determine if it is a blicket. The only instance where the cyan rubber cube was present also included other objects, making it unclear if the cube alone can activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the cyan rubber cube is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
