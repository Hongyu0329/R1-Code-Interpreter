  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nred metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cube, red metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > Based on the previous experimental results, we can observe the following:\n\n1. The combination of a cyan metal cylinder and a yellow metal cube turns the detector on.\n2. A cyan metal cylinder alone also turns the detector on.\n3. A yellow metal cube alone does not turn the detector on.\n4. A red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, and green rubber cube together do not turn the detector on.\n5. A combination of a cyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, and gray rubber cube does not turn the detector on.\n6. A green metal cube and red metal cylinder together turn the detector on.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that the cyan metal cylinder is a blicket, as it consistently causes the detector to turn on when present.\n\nGiven the new test case of a cyan metal cylinder, the detector light status will be on.\n\nFinal answer: <<<on>>>"
