  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\ngreen metal cylinder → on\nred metal sphere → off\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off\ngreen metal sphere → off\nyellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere, red metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **green metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on**\n2. **green metal cylinder → on**\n3. **red metal sphere → off**\n4. **yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off**\n5. **green metal sphere → off**\n6. **yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on**\n\nFrom these results, we can make the following observations:\n\n- The **green metal cylinder** seems to be a blicket because it causes the detector to turn on both when alone and in combination with the red metal sphere.\n- The **red metal sphere** is not a blicket, as it does not activate the detector when alone.\n- The **yellow metal sphere** does not activate the detector when combined with the green metal sphere, but it does activate the detector when combined with the yellow rubber sphere and brown rubber cylinder. This suggests that the yellow metal sphere might not be a blicket on its own.\n- The **green metal sphere** does not activate the detector when alone or in combination with the yellow metal sphere.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case:\n\n- **yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere, red metal sphere**\n\nBased on the previous observations:\n- The **red metal sphere** is not a blicket.\n- The **green metal sphere** is not a blicket.\n- The **yellow metal sphere** might not be a blicket on its own, as it did not activate the detector in combination with the green metal sphere.\n\nSince none of the objects in the new test case have been shown to activate the detector on their own or in combination with each other, the detector light status is likely to be off.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<off>>>"
