  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nblue rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off\nbrown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue rubber cylinder,\" we can analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. \"cyan metal cylinder\" → on\n2. \"blue rubber cylinder\" → off\n3. \"cyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder\" → on\n4. \"brown rubber sphere\" → on\n5. \"brown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube\" → off\n6. \"brown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube\" → on\n\nFrom the previous results, we can see that the \"blue rubber cylinder\" alone was tested and resulted in the detector light being off. Therefore, we can conclude that the detector light will stay off for the new test case \"blue rubber cylinder.\"\n\n<<<off>>>"
