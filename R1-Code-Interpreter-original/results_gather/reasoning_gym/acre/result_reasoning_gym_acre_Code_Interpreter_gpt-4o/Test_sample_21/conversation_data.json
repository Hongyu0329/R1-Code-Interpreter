  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nblue rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off\nbrown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"green rubber sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **Cyan metal cylinder** → on\n2. **Blue rubber cylinder** → off\n3. **Cyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder** → on\n4. **Brown rubber sphere** → on\n5. **Brown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube** → off\n6. **Brown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube** → on\n\nFrom these results, we can infer the following:\n\n- The cyan metal cylinder is likely a blicket since it activates the detector both alone and in combination with the blue rubber cylinder.\n- The brown rubber sphere is likely a blicket since it activates the detector both alone and in combination with the brown rubber cube.\n- The blue rubber cylinder and brown rubber cube are likely not blickets since they do not activate the detector when combined with other non-blicket objects.\n- The green rubber sphere does not activate the detector when combined with other non-blicket objects (brown rubber cube and cyan metal cube).\n\nGiven that the green rubber sphere was part of a combination that did not activate the detector, and there is no evidence of it activating the detector in any other combination, we can conclude that the green rubber sphere alone will not activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"green rubber sphere\" is off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
