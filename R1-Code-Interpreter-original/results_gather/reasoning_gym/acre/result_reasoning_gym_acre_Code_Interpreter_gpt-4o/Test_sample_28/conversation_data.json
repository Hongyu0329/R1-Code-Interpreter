  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan rubber cylinder → off\npurple rubber sphere, cyan rubber cylinder → on\npurple rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber cube, red metal sphere → off\nbrown metal cylinder → on\nbrown metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > Based on the previous experimental results, we can observe the following:\n\n1. The brown metal cylinder alone causes the detector to activate (on).\n2. The brown metal cylinder combined with the red metal sphere also causes the detector to activate (on).\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the brown metal cylinder is a blicket, as it consistently causes the detector to activate regardless of the presence of other objects.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case with just the brown metal cylinder, the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
