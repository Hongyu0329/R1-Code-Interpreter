  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off\nblue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off\nyellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **blue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on**\n2. **purple rubber cube → off**\n3. **blue rubber cube → on**\n4. **blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off**\n5. **blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off**\n6. **yellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on**\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n\n- The **blue rubber cube** seems to be a blicket because it consistently causes the detector to turn on (examples 1 and 3).\n- The **purple rubber cube** alone does not activate the detector (example 2).\n- The presence of the **blue rubber cube** in combination with other objects (example 1) results in the detector turning on.\n- The combinations without the **blue rubber cube** (examples 4 and 5) result in the detector staying off.\n- The **yellow rubber cube** in combination with other objects (example 6) results in the detector turning on, but this is not relevant to the new test case.\n\nIn the new test case, the combination includes the **blue rubber cube**, which has been shown to activate the detector in previous examples.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
