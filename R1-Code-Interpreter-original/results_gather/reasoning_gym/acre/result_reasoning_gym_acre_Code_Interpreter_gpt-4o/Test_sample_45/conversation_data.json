  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cylinder → off\npurple metal cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\npurple metal cube → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, cyan rubber cube → on\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\npurple metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > The previous experimental results show that when a purple metal cube is placed on the detector, the light turns on. This is evident from the example:\n\n- purple metal cube → on\n\nTherefore, for the new test case with a purple metal cube, the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
