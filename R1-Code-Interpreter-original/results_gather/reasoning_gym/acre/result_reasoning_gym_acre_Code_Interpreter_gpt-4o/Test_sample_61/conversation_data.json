  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nyellow rubber sphere, cyan rubber cube → on\ncyan rubber cube → off\nyellow rubber sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder, red rubber cylinder, red metal cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\nred rubber cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red rubber cylinder,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. yellow rubber sphere, cyan rubber cube → on\n2. cyan rubber cube → off\n3. yellow rubber sphere → on\n4. red metal cylinder, red rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → off\n5. blue metal cube, purple rubber cylinder, red rubber cylinder, red metal cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n6. red metal cylinder, yellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nFrom the results:\n- The \"yellow rubber sphere\" seems to be a blicket since it causes the detector to turn on in both cases it appears (1 and 3).\n- The \"cyan rubber cube\" alone does not activate the detector (2).\n- The \"red rubber cylinder\" appears in both an \"off\" (4, 6) and an \"on\" (5) scenario, but in the \"on\" scenario, it is combined with other objects, making it unclear if it is a blicket.\n- The \"red metal cylinder\" appears in both \"off\" (4, 6) and \"on\" (5) scenarios, similar to the \"red rubber cylinder.\"\n- The \"yellow metal sphere\" appears in \"off\" scenarios (4, 6).\n- The \"yellow rubber cylinder\" appears in \"off\" scenarios (4, 6).\n- The \"blue metal cube\" and \"purple rubber cylinder\" appear in an \"on\" scenario (5).\n\nThe \"red rubber cylinder\" alone has not been tested, but it appears in both \"off\" and \"on\" scenarios. However, in the \"on\" scenario, it is combined with other objects, making it undetermined if it is a blicket.\n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence, the status of the detector light for the \"red rubber cylinder\" alone is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
