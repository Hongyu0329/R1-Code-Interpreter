  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber cylinder → off\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on\nblue metal cube → off\nyellow metal cube → off\ngray metal sphere, red metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > Based on the previous experimental results, we can observe the following:\n\n1. The red rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n2. The brown rubber sphere activates the detector, both alone and in combination with the red rubber cylinder.\n3. The blue metal cube and yellow metal cube do not activate the detector.\n4. The combination of a gray metal sphere and a red metal cube activates the detector.\n\nFor the new test case, we have a yellow metal cube. From the previous results, we know that a yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the yellow metal cube is off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
