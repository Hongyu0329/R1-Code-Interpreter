  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off\nblue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off\nyellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **blue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on**\n2. **purple rubber cube → off**\n3. **blue rubber cube → on**\n4. **blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off**\n5. **blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off**\n6. **yellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on**\n\nFrom the results, we can observe the following:\n\n- The blue rubber cube seems to be a blicket since it consistently causes the detector to turn on.\n- The purple rubber cube alone does not activate the detector.\n- The yellow rubber cube, when combined with other objects, results in the detector turning on.\n\nIn the sixth example, the yellow rubber cube is part of a combination that turns the detector on. However, it is not clear if the yellow rubber cube alone is responsible for activating the detector, as it was tested with other objects.\n\nSince there is no direct evidence from the previous results that the yellow rubber cube alone can activate the detector, the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow rubber cube\" is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
