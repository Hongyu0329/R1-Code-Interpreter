  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal sphere → off\nblue metal cube → on\nblue metal cube, cyan metal sphere → on\ngray metal cube, cyan metal cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, cyan metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"cyan metal cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **cyan metal sphere → off**: The cyan metal sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n2. **blue metal cube → on**: The blue metal cube alone activates the detector.\n3. **blue metal cube, cyan metal sphere → on**: The combination of a blue metal cube and a cyan metal sphere activates the detector. The blue metal cube is likely the activating object.\n4. **gray metal cube, cyan metal cube, cyan metal cylinder → on**: This combination activates the detector. The presence of a cube (possibly the gray metal cube) might be significant.\n5. **cyan metal cube → off**: The cyan metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n6. **red rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, cyan metal cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector, suggesting that none of these objects are blickets.\n\nFrom the results, the cyan metal cube alone has been tested and resulted in the detector being off. Therefore, for the new test case \"cyan metal cube,\" the detector light status is off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
