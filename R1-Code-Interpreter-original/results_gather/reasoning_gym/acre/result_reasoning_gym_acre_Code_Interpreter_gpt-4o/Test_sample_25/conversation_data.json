  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cube → off\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nyellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\ngray metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"gray metal cylinder,\" we can analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. The \"gray rubber cylinder\" alone causes the detector to turn on.\n2. The \"gray rubber cylinder\" combined with the \"green metal cube\" also causes the detector to turn on.\n3. The \"gray metal cylinder\" combined with the \"purple rubber cube\" causes the detector to turn on.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer that the \"gray metal cylinder\" is likely a blicket, as it causes the detector to turn on when combined with the \"purple rubber cube.\"\n\nTherefore, for the new test case \"gray metal cylinder,\" the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
