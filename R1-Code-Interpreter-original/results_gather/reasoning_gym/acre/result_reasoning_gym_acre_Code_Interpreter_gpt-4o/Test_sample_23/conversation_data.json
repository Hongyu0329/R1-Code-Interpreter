  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nblue rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off\nbrown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cylinder, green rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **Cyan metal cylinder → on**: The cyan metal cylinder is a blicket.\n2. **Blue rubber cylinder → off**: The blue rubber cylinder is not a blicket.\n3. **Cyan metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the cyan metal cylinder causes the detector to turn on, confirming it as a blicket.\n4. **Brown rubber sphere → on**: The brown rubber sphere is a blicket.\n5. **Brown rubber cube, green rubber sphere, cyan metal cube → off**: None of these objects are blickets.\n6. **Brown rubber sphere, brown rubber cube → on**: The brown rubber sphere is a blicket, while the brown rubber cube is not.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case:\n\n- **Blue rubber cylinder**: Previously shown to be not a blicket.\n- **Green rubber sphere**: Previously shown to be not a blicket.\n\nSince both objects in the new test case are not blickets, the detector light will stay off.\n\nThe detector light status is off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
