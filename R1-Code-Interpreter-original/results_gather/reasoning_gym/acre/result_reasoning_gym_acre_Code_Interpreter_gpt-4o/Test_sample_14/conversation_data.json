  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal sphere → off\nblue metal cube → on\nblue metal cube, cyan metal sphere → on\ngray metal cube, cyan metal cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube → off\nred rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, cyan metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal cube, red rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **cyan metal sphere → off**: The cyan metal sphere alone does not activate the detector.\n2. **blue metal cube → on**: The blue metal cube alone activates the detector.\n3. **blue metal cube, cyan metal sphere → on**: The presence of the blue metal cube activates the detector, even with the cyan metal sphere.\n4. **gray metal cube, cyan metal cube, cyan metal cylinder → on**: The combination activates the detector, but it's unclear which object(s) are responsible.\n5. **cyan metal cube → off**: The cyan metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n6. **red rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, cyan metal cube → off**: This combination does not activate the detector.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case:\n\n- **cyan metal cube, red rubber cube**: \n  - From previous results, the cyan metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n  - The red rubber cube was part of a combination that did not activate the detector.\n\nBased on the evidence, neither the cyan metal cube nor the red rubber cube has been shown to activate the detector. Therefore, the detector light will stay off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
