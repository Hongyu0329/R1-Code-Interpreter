  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nbrown metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\npurple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, green metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the detector light status for the new test case, let's analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. brown metal cube, gray rubber cylinder → on\n2. gray rubber cylinder → off\n3. brown metal cube → on\n4. green metal cube, blue metal cylinder → on\n5. purple metal cube, blue metal cylinder, green rubber cube → on\n6. green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder → off\n\nFrom these results, we can infer the following:\n\n- The brown metal cube seems to be a blicket, as it consistently causes the detector to turn on (examples 1 and 3).\n- The gray rubber cylinder is not a blicket, as it does not activate the detector on its own (example 2).\n- The green metal cube might be a blicket, as it is part of a combination that turns the detector on (example 4).\n- The blue metal cylinder might be a blicket, as it is part of combinations that turn the detector on (examples 4 and 5).\n- The green rubber cube and red rubber cylinder are not blickets, as they do not activate the detector on their own (example 6).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the new test case: green rubber cube, red rubber cylinder, green metal cube.\n\n- The green rubber cube and red rubber cylinder are not blickets, as established in example 6.\n- The green metal cube might be a blicket, as it was part of a combination that turned the detector on in example 4.\n\nSince the green metal cube is potentially a blicket, and the other objects do not interfere with its ability to activate the detector, we can conclude that the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
