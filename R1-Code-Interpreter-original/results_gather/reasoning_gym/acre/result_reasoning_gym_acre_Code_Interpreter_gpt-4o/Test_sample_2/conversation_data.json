  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\ngray rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube, blue metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **Gray rubber cube**: Activates the detector (on).\n2. **Purple rubber cube**: Does not activate the detector (off).\n3. **Gray rubber cube, purple rubber cube**: Activates the detector (on). This suggests that the gray rubber cube is a blicket, as it activates the detector even when combined with a non-blicket.\n4. **Blue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder**: Activates the detector (on). At least one of these objects is a blicket.\n5. **Gray metal cube, red rubber cube**: Does not activate the detector (off). Neither of these objects is a blicket.\n6. **Green metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube**: Does not activate the detector (off). None of these objects is a blicket.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case:\n\n- **Gray metal cube**: Previously shown not to be a blicket.\n- **Red rubber cube**: Previously shown not to be a blicket.\n- **Blue metal cylinder**: Part of a combination that activated the detector (on). This suggests that the blue metal cylinder is a blicket.\n\nSince the blue metal cylinder is likely a blicket, it should activate the detector in the new test case.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
