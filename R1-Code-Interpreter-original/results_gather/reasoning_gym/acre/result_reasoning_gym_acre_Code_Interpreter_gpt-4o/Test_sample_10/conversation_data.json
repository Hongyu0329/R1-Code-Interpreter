  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → off\nblue metal cylinder → on\nblue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on\ncyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **gray rubber cylinder → off**: The gray rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n2. **blue metal cylinder → on**: The blue metal cylinder alone activates the detector.\n3. **blue metal cylinder, gray rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the blue metal cylinder activates the detector, even with the gray rubber cylinder.\n4. **cyan metal cube, brown rubber cube → on**: The cyan metal cube activates the detector, even with the brown rubber cube.\n5. **brown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube → off**: Neither the brown rubber cube nor the cyan rubber cube activates the detector.\n6. **cyan rubber cube, brown rubber cube → off**: Neither the cyan rubber cube nor the brown rubber cube activates the detector.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- The blue metal cylinder and the cyan metal cube are likely blickets, as they activate the detector.\n- The gray rubber cylinder, brown rubber cube, and cyan rubber cube do not activate the detector on their own.\n\nFor the new test case:\n- **brown rubber cube, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cube**: The presence of the cyan metal cube, which is a blicket, should activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
