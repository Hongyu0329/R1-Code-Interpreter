  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\nyellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on\nyellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube, cyan rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the detector light status for the new test case, let's analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **brown metal cube → off**: The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n2. **yellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on**: The presence of the yellow metal cylinder activates the detector, even with the brown metal cube.\n3. **yellow metal cylinder → on**: The yellow metal cylinder alone activates the detector.\n4. **cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off**: None of these objects activate the detector.\n5. **cyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on**: The presence of the cyan rubber cylinder activates the detector.\n6. **green rubber cube → off**: The green rubber cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the new test case: **green rubber cube, cyan rubber cube**.\n\n- The green rubber cube alone does not activate the detector (as seen in result 6).\n- The cyan rubber cube alone does not activate the detector (as seen in result 4).\n\nSince neither the green rubber cube nor the cyan rubber cube has been shown to activate the detector in previous experiments, and there is no evidence of a combination effect between these two specific objects, we can conclude that the detector light will stay off.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
