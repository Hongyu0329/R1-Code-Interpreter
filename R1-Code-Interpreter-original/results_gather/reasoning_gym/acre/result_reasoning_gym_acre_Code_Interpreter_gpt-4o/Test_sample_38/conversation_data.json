  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\ngreen metal cylinder → on\nred metal sphere → off\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off\ngreen metal sphere → off\nyellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere, green metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **green metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on**\n2. **green metal cylinder → on**\n3. **red metal sphere → off**\n4. **yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off**\n5. **green metal sphere → off**\n6. **yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on**\n\nFrom these results, we can infer:\n\n- The **green metal cylinder** is a blicket because it causes the detector to turn on both when alone and in combination with the red metal sphere.\n- The **red metal sphere** is not a blicket because it does not activate the detector when alone.\n- The **green metal sphere** is not a blicket because it does not activate the detector when alone or in combination with the yellow metal sphere.\n- The **yellow metal sphere** is not a blicket because it does not activate the detector when combined with the green metal sphere, but it does activate the detector when combined with the yellow rubber sphere and brown rubber cylinder, suggesting the presence of another blicket in that combination.\n- The **yellow rubber sphere** and/or **brown rubber cylinder** could be blickets, but we cannot determine which one from the given data.\n\nFor the new test case:\n- **yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere, green metal cylinder**\n\nSince the green metal cylinder is a blicket and is present in the new test case, it will activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
