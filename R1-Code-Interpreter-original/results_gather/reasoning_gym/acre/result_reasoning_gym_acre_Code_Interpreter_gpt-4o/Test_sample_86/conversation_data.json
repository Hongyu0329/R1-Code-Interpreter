  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nblue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off\nblue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off\nyellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, yellow rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **Blue rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on**\n2. **Purple rubber cube → off**\n3. **Blue rubber cube → on**\n4. **Blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, blue metal cube → off**\n5. **Blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder → off**\n6. **Yellow rubber cube, gray metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder → on**\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n\n- The blue rubber cube seems to be a blicket since it consistently causes the detector to turn on when present (examples 1 and 3).\n- The purple rubber cube is not a blicket since it does not activate the detector on its own (example 2).\n- The yellow rubber cube might be a blicket since it causes the detector to turn on in example 6, but it is not conclusive without further evidence.\n- The blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, and green metal cylinder do not seem to be blickets since their combinations do not activate the detector (examples 4 and 5).\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case:\n\n- **Blue metal cube, blue metal cylinder, blue rubber cylinder, green metal cylinder, yellow rubber cube**\n\nThe blue rubber cube is not present, but the yellow rubber cube is present. Since the yellow rubber cube was part of a combination that turned the detector on in example 6, and there is no evidence that any of the other objects in the new test case are blickets, it is likely that the yellow rubber cube is a blicket.\n\nTherefore, the detector light will likely turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
