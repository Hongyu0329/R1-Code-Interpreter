  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal sphere, purple metal cylinder, yellow rubber sphere → off\npurple metal cylinder → off\ngreen metal cube, blue rubber cube, purple metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. The \"gray rubber cylinder\" alone turns the detector on.\n2. The combination of \"gray rubber cylinder\" and \"green rubber cylinder\" also turns the detector on.\n3. The \"green rubber cylinder\" alone does not turn the detector on.\n4. The combination of \"cyan metal sphere,\" \"purple metal cylinder,\" and \"yellow rubber sphere\" does not turn the detector on.\n5. The \"purple metal cylinder\" alone does not turn the detector on.\n6. The combination of \"green metal cube,\" \"blue rubber cube,\" and \"purple metal cylinder\" turns the detector on.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- The \"gray rubber cylinder\" is likely a blicket since it turns the detector on by itself.\n- The \"green rubber cylinder\" is not a blicket since it does not turn the detector on by itself.\n- The \"purple metal cylinder\" is not a blicket since it does not turn the detector on by itself.\n- The \"blue rubber cube\" is part of a combination that turns the detector on, but it is not clear if it is a blicket by itself.\n\nSince the \"blue rubber cube\" was part of a combination that turned the detector on, but there is no evidence that it can turn the detector on by itself, the status of the detector light for the \"blue rubber cube\" alone is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
