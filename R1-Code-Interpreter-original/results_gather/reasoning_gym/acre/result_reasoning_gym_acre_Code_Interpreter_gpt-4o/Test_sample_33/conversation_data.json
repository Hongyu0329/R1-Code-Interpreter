  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal sphere, gray rubber sphere → on\ngray rubber sphere → off\ngray metal sphere → on\nred metal cylinder, brown rubber cube, yellow metal cube, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow rubber cylinder, yellow metal cube → off\nbrown rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngray metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > Based on the previous experimental results, we can analyze the following:\n\n1. The combination \"gray metal sphere, gray rubber sphere\" results in the detector turning on.\n2. The \"gray rubber sphere\" alone results in the detector staying off.\n3. The \"gray metal sphere\" alone results in the detector turning on.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that the \"gray metal sphere\" is a blicket, as it consistently causes the detector to activate when present.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case \"gray metal sphere,\" the detector light status is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
