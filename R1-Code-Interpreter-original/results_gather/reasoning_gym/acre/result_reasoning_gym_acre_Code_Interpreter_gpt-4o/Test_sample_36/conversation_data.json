  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\ngreen metal cylinder → on\nred metal sphere → off\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off\ngreen metal sphere → off\nyellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow rubber sphere,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. \"green metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\"\n2. \"green metal cylinder → on\"\n3. \"red metal sphere → off\"\n4. \"yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off\"\n5. \"green metal sphere → off\"\n6. \"yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\"\n\nFrom these observations:\n- The \"green metal cylinder\" seems to be a blicket since it activates the detector both alone and in combination with the \"red metal sphere.\"\n- The \"red metal sphere\" does not activate the detector on its own, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n- The \"yellow metal sphere\" and \"green metal sphere\" do not activate the detector, suggesting they are not blickets.\n- The \"yellow rubber sphere\" is part of a combination that activates the detector, but it is not clear if it is a blicket on its own, as it was tested with other objects.\n\nSince the \"yellow rubber sphere\" was only tested in combination with other objects and not alone, there is insufficient evidence to determine if it is a blicket by itself.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the \"yellow rubber sphere\" is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
