  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\nyellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on\nyellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal cylinder\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > Based on the previous experimental results, we can observe the following:\n\n1. The yellow metal cylinder alone causes the detector to turn on, as seen in the example \"yellow metal cylinder → on\".\n\nGiven this information, the new test case \"yellow metal cylinder\" will cause the detector light to turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
