  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ncyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on\ncyan metal cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nred metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cube, red metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"green rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **cyan metal cylinder, yellow metal cube → on**\n2. **cyan metal cylinder → on**\n3. **yellow metal cube → off**\n4. **red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube, green rubber cube → off**\n5. **cyan rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, gray rubber cube → off**\n6. **green metal cube, red metal cylinder → on**\n\nFrom these results, we can infer:\n\n- The \"cyan metal cylinder\" is a blicket because it activates the detector on its own (example 2).\n- The \"yellow metal cube\" is not a blicket because it does not activate the detector on its own (example 3).\n- The \"red metal cylinder\" is a blicket because it activates the detector when combined with the \"green metal cube\" (example 6), and it does not deactivate the detector when combined with other non-blickets (example 4 and 5).\n- The \"green rubber cube\" is not a blicket because it does not activate the detector in examples 4 and 5.\n\nGiven that the \"green rubber cube\" is not a blicket, the detector light will stay off for the new test case.\n\nFinal answer: <<<off>>>"
