  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cube → off\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nyellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow rubber cube,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **green metal cube** → off\n2. **gray rubber cylinder** → on\n3. **gray rubber cylinder, green metal cube** → on\n4. **green rubber cylinder, purple rubber cube** → off\n5. **yellow rubber cube, green metal cylinder, gray metal cylinder** → on\n6. **gray metal cylinder, purple rubber cube** → on\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n\n- The **gray rubber cylinder** seems to be a blicket since it activates the detector both alone and in combination with the green metal cube.\n- The **gray metal cylinder** also seems to be a blicket since it activates the detector in combination with the purple rubber cube.\n- The **yellow rubber cube** was part of a combination that activated the detector, but it was with other objects, so we cannot determine if it is a blicket on its own.\n\nSince the yellow rubber cube has only been observed in combination with other objects and not alone, there is insufficient evidence to determine if it will activate the detector by itself.\n\nTherefore, the status of the detector light for the new test case \"yellow rubber cube\" is undetermined.\n\n<<<undetermined>>>"
