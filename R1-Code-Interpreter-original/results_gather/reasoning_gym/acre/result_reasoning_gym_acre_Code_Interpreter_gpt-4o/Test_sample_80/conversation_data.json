  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal cube, green metal cube → on\nred metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nblue rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"blue rubber cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. red metal cube, green metal cube → on\n2. red metal cube → on\n3. green metal cube → off\n4. blue rubber cube → on\n5. blue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\n6. blue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\n\nFrom the previous results, we can see that:\n\n- The \"red metal cube\" alone can activate the detector (example 2).\n- The \"green metal cube\" alone does not activate the detector (example 3).\n- The \"blue rubber cube\" alone can activate the detector (example 4).\n\nSince the \"blue rubber cube\" alone has been shown to activate the detector in example 4, we can conclude that the detector light will turn on for the new test case \"blue rubber cube.\"\n\n<<<on>>>"
