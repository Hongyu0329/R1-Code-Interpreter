  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\ngray rubber cube → on\ngray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\nbrown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cube, brown rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"brown metal cube, brown rubber cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **brown metal cube → off**: The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n2. **gray rubber cube → on**: The gray rubber cube alone activates the detector.\n3. **gray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on**: The presence of the gray rubber cube activates the detector, even with the brown metal cube.\n4. **blue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off**: None of these objects activate the detector.\n5. **brown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on**: The presence of the brown rubber cube activates the detector, even with the blue rubber cylinder.\n6. **green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off**: None of these objects activate the detector.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer:\n- The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n- The brown rubber cube alone can activate the detector (as seen in the combination with the blue rubber cylinder).\n\nGiven the new test case \"brown metal cube, brown rubber cube,\" the presence of the brown rubber cube, which has been shown to activate the detector, suggests that the detector light will turn on.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is:\n\n<<<on>>>"
