  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred rubber cylinder → off\nbrown rubber sphere → on\nbrown rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder → on\nblue metal cube → off\nyellow metal cube → off\ngray metal sphere, red metal cube → on\n\nNew test case:\nyellow metal cube, red metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. The red rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector (off).\n2. The brown rubber sphere alone activates the detector (on).\n3. The combination of the brown rubber sphere and the red rubber cylinder activates the detector (on), indicating that the brown rubber sphere is likely the activating object.\n4. The blue metal cube alone does not activate the detector (off).\n5. The yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector (off).\n6. The combination of the gray metal sphere and the red metal cube activates the detector (on), indicating that either the gray metal sphere or the red metal cube is an activating object.\n\nFor the new test case, we have a yellow metal cube and a red metal cube. From the previous results, we know:\n\n- The yellow metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n- The red metal cube, when combined with the gray metal sphere, activates the detector.\n\nSince the red metal cube is part of a combination that activates the detector, it is likely that the red metal cube is an activating object. Therefore, the presence of the red metal cube in the new test case suggests that the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
