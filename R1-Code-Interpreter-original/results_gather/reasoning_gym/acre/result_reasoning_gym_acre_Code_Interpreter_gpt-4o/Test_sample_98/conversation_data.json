  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cylinder → on\ngray rubber cylinder, green rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder → off\ncyan metal sphere, purple metal cylinder, yellow rubber sphere → off\npurple metal cylinder → off\ngreen metal cube, blue rubber cube, purple metal cylinder → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **Gray rubber cylinder → on**: The gray rubber cylinder is a blicket.\n2. **Gray rubber cylinder, green rubber cylinder → on**: The gray rubber cylinder is likely the blicket, as the green rubber cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n3. **Green rubber cylinder → off**: The green rubber cylinder is not a blicket.\n4. **Cyan metal sphere, purple metal cylinder, yellow rubber sphere → off**: None of these objects are blickets.\n5. **Purple metal cylinder → off**: The purple metal cylinder is not a blicket.\n6. **Green metal cube, blue rubber cube, purple metal cylinder → on**: The green metal cube or the blue rubber cube is likely a blicket, as the purple metal cylinder alone does not activate the detector.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case:\n\n- **Green rubber cylinder**: Previously shown to be off.\n- **Blue rubber cube**: In combination with the green metal cube, it turned the detector on.\n- **Green metal cube**: In combination with the blue rubber cube, it turned the detector on.\n\nSince the combination of the green metal cube and the blue rubber cube previously turned the detector on, and the green rubber cylinder is known to be off, the presence of the green metal cube and blue rubber cube suggests that the detector will turn on.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
