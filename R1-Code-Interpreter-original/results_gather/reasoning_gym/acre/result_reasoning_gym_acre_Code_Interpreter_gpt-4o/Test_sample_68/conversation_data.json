  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal sphere, yellow metal cube → on\nyellow metal cube → off\nbrown metal sphere → on\nbrown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\ncyan metal sphere, gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere → on\npurple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nred rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red rubber cube,\" we can analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. \"brown metal sphere, yellow metal cube → on\"\n2. \"yellow metal cube → off\"\n3. \"brown metal sphere → on\"\n4. \"brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\"\n5. \"cyan metal sphere, gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder, purple rubber sphere → on\"\n6. \"purple rubber sphere, red rubber cube → off\"\n\nFrom the results, we can observe the following:\n\n- The \"brown metal sphere\" seems to be a blicket, as it consistently causes the detector to turn on.\n- The \"yellow metal cube\" alone does not activate the detector.\n- The \"red rubber cube\" appears in two experiments (4 and 6) where the detector stays off, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n- The \"purple rubber sphere\" also appears in experiments where the detector stays off, suggesting it is not a blicket.\n\nGiven that the \"red rubber cube\" has been tested in two experiments and the detector stayed off both times, we can conclude that the \"red rubber cube\" alone will not activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case \"red rubber cube\" is off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
