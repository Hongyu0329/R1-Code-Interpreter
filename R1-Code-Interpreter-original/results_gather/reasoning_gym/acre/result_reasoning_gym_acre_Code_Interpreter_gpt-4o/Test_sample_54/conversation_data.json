  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cylinder → on\nbrown metal cylinder → off\ngreen metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube, blue metal sphere → on\nblue metal sphere, gray rubber cylinder → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown metal cylinder, green metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. gray metal cylinder, brown metal cylinder → on\n2. gray metal cylinder → on\n3. brown metal cylinder → off\n4. green metal cube → on\n5. green metal cube, blue metal sphere → on\n6. blue metal sphere, gray rubber cylinder → off\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer the following:\n\n- The gray metal cylinder is a blicket because it activates the detector both alone and in combination with the brown metal cylinder.\n- The brown metal cylinder is not a blicket because it does not activate the detector on its own.\n- The green metal cube is a blicket because it activates the detector both alone and in combination with the blue metal sphere.\n- The blue metal sphere is not a blicket because it does not activate the detector when combined with the gray rubber cylinder.\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case: brown metal cylinder, green metal cube.\n\n- The brown metal cylinder is not a blicket.\n- The green metal cube is a blicket.\n\nSince the green metal cube is a blicket and it is present in the new test case, the detector light will turn on.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
