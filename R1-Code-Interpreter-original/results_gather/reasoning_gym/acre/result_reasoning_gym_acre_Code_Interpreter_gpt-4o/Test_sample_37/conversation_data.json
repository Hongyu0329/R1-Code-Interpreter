  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngreen metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on\ngreen metal cylinder → on\nred metal sphere → off\nyellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off\ngreen metal sphere → off\nyellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on\n\nNew test case:\ngreen metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"green metal sphere,\" we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **green metal cylinder, red metal sphere → on**: The detector turns on with this combination.\n2. **green metal cylinder → on**: The detector turns on with just the green metal cylinder.\n3. **red metal sphere → off**: The detector stays off with just the red metal sphere.\n4. **yellow metal sphere, green metal sphere → off**: The detector stays off with this combination.\n5. **green metal sphere → off**: The detector stays off with just the green metal sphere.\n6. **yellow rubber sphere, brown rubber cylinder, yellow metal sphere → on**: The detector turns on with this combination.\n\nFrom the results, we can see that the \"green metal sphere\" alone has been tested and the detector stayed off. Therefore, for the new test case \"green metal sphere,\" the detector light status is off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
