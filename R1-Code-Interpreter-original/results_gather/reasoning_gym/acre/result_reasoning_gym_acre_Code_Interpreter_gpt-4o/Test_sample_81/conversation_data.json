  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal cube, green metal cube → on\nred metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nred metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > Based on the previous experimental results, we can observe the following:\n\n1. The red metal cube alone causes the detector to turn on.\n2. The green metal cube alone does not cause the detector to turn on.\n3. The blue rubber cube alone causes the detector to turn on.\n4. The blue metal cube and purple metal cube together cause the detector to turn on.\n5. The blue rubber cylinder and purple metal cube together do not cause the detector to turn on.\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that the red metal cube is a blicket, as it consistently causes the detector to turn on when present.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case with the red metal cube, the detector light will turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
