  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nred metal cube, green metal cube → on\nred metal cube → on\ngreen metal cube → off\nblue rubber cube → on\nblue metal cube, purple metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen metal cube, blue rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **red metal cube, green metal cube → on**: The presence of the red metal cube or the combination of both might be causing the detector to turn on.\n2. **red metal cube → on**: The red metal cube alone is sufficient to activate the detector.\n3. **green metal cube → off**: The green metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n4. **blue rubber cube → on**: The blue rubber cube alone is sufficient to activate the detector.\n5. **blue metal cube, purple metal cube → on**: The presence of the blue metal cube or the combination of both might be causing the detector to turn on.\n6. **blue rubber cylinder, purple metal cube → off**: Neither the blue rubber cylinder nor the purple metal cube alone or in combination activates the detector.\n\nFor the new test case:\n- **green metal cube, blue rubber cube**\n\nFrom the previous results, we know:\n- The green metal cube alone does not activate the detector.\n- The blue rubber cube alone activates the detector.\n\nSince the blue rubber cube is known to activate the detector, the presence of the blue rubber cube in the new test case should cause the detector to turn on.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
