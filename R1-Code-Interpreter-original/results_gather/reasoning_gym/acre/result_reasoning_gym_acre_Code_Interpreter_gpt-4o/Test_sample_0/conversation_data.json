  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray rubber cube → on\npurple rubber cube → off\ngray rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder → on\ngray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\ngreen metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nred rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"red rubber cube,\" we can analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. \"gray rubber cube → on\" suggests that the gray rubber cube is a blicket.\n2. \"purple rubber cube → off\" suggests that the purple rubber cube is not a blicket.\n3. \"gray rubber cube, purple rubber cube → on\" supports the idea that the gray rubber cube is a blicket, as it activates the detector even when combined with a non-blicket.\n4. \"blue rubber cylinder, blue metal cylinder, brown metal cube, green metal cylinder → on\" suggests that at least one of these objects is a blicket.\n5. \"gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\" suggests that neither the gray metal cube nor the red rubber cube is a blicket.\n6. \"green metal cylinder, brown metal cube, gray metal cube, red rubber cube → off\" supports the idea that none of these objects are blickets.\n\nFrom the results, the red rubber cube has been tested in two different combinations, and in both cases, the detector stayed off. This suggests that the red rubber cube is not a blicket.\n\nTherefore, for the new test case \"red rubber cube,\" the detector light will stay off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
