    "\nassistant > Based on the previous experimental results, we can analyze the behavior of the detector with respect to the cyan metal sphere:\n\n1. The cyan metal sphere alone resulted in the detector being off.\n2. In the combination of the blue metal cube and the cyan metal sphere, the detector was on. However, since the blue metal cube alone also caused the detector to be on, the cyan metal sphere likely did not contribute to activating the detector.\n3. In the combination of the gray metal cube, cyan metal cube, and cyan metal cylinder, the detector was on. However, the presence of the cyan metal sphere is not relevant here.\n4. The cyan metal cube alone resulted in the detector being off.\n5. In the combination of the red rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, and cyan metal cube, the detector was off. The cyan metal sphere is not involved in this case.\n\nFrom these observations, the cyan metal sphere alone has consistently resulted in the detector being off. Therefore, for the new test case with the cyan metal sphere, the detector light status is off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
