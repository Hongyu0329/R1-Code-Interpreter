  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\ngray rubber cube → on\ngray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on\nblue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\nbrown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\nbrown rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case \"brown rubber cube,\" let's analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. brown metal cube → off\n2. gray rubber cube → on\n3. gray rubber cube, brown metal cube → on\n4. blue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\n5. brown rubber cube, blue rubber cylinder → on\n6. green rubber cylinder, red rubber cube → off\n\nFrom these results, we can make the following observations:\n\n- The gray rubber cube seems to be a blicket since it causes the detector to turn on in both cases it appears (2 and 3).\n- The brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector (1), but when combined with the gray rubber cube, the detector turns on (3). This suggests that the gray rubber cube is the activating object in that combination.\n- The combination of blue rubber cylinder, blue rubber cube, green rubber cylinder, and red rubber cube does not activate the detector (4).\n- The brown rubber cube, when combined with the blue rubber cylinder, activates the detector (5). This suggests that the brown rubber cube might be a blicket.\n- The green rubber cylinder and red rubber cube together do not activate the detector (6).\n\nGiven that the brown rubber cube, when combined with the blue rubber cylinder, causes the detector to turn on, it is likely that the brown rubber cube is a blicket. Therefore, for the new test case \"brown rubber cube,\" the detector light will likely turn on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
