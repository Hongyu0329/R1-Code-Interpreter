  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nbrown metal cube → off\nyellow metal cylinder, brown metal cube → on\nyellow metal cylinder → on\ncyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder, green rubber cube → off\ncyan rubber cylinder, cyan rubber cube, cyan metal cylinder → on\ngreen rubber cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > Based on the previous experimental results, we can observe the following:\n\n1. A brown metal cube alone does not activate the detector (off).\n2. A yellow metal cylinder activates the detector, whether alone or with a brown metal cube (on).\n3. A cyan rubber cube and a green rubber cube do not activate the detector (off).\n4. A cyan rubber cylinder, when combined with other cyan objects, activates the detector (on).\n5. A green rubber cube alone does not activate the detector (off).\n\nThe new test case involves a green rubber cube. From the previous results, we know that a green rubber cube alone does not activate the detector.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is off.\n\n<<<off>>>"
