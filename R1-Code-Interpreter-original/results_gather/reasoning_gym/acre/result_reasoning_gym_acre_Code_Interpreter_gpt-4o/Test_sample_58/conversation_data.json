  "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\nyellow rubber cylinder → off\nyellow metal sphere → on\nyellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder → on\nyellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube → off\nblue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → on\ngreen rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ngreen rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube, blue metal sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "\nassistant > To determine the status of the detector light for the new test case, we need to analyze the previous experimental results:\n\n1. **yellow rubber cylinder** → off\n2. **yellow metal sphere** → on\n3. **yellow metal sphere, yellow rubber cylinder** → on\n4. **yellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube** → off\n5. **blue metal sphere, purple metal cube, red metal cylinder, green rubber cube, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube** → on\n6. **green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube** → off\n\nFrom these results, we can infer:\n- The **yellow metal sphere** is a blicket because it causes the detector to turn on by itself (example 2).\n- The **blue metal sphere** is likely a blicket because it causes the detector to turn on in combination with other objects (example 5).\n- The **yellow rubber cylinder** is not a blicket because it does not activate the detector by itself (example 1) and does not prevent activation when combined with a blicket (example 3).\n- The combination of **yellow metal cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube** does not activate the detector (example 4).\n- The combination of **green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube** does not activate the detector (example 6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the new test case:\n- **green rubber cube, red metal cylinder, purple rubber cube, yellow metal cube, blue metal sphere**\n\nThe presence of the **blue metal sphere** in the new test case suggests that the detector will turn on, as it is likely a blicket based on example 5.\n\nTherefore, the detector light status for the new test case is on.\n\n<<<on>>>"
