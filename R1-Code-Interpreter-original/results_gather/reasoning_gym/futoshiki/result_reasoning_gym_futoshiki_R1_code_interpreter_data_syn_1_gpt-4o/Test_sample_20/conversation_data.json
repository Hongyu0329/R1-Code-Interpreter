    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 6 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a 6x6 grid with some numbers already filled in and some inequality constraints.\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - Each row and column must contain the numbers 1 to 6 exactly once.\n   - The inequality constraints must be satisfied.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to try filling in the grid.\n   - Check if the current number placement is valid by ensuring it doesn't violate any constraints.\n   - If a placement is valid, proceed to the next cell.\n   - If a placement leads to a dead end, backtrack and try a different number.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to solve the puzzle.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(6):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check inequality constraints\n    # Horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if grid[row][col - 1] < num and (row, col - 1, '>') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row][col - 1] > num and (row, col - 1, '<') in constraints:\n            return False\n    if col < 5 and grid[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if grid[row][col + 1] < num and (row, col, '>') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row][col + 1] > num and (row, col, '<') in constraints:\n            return False\n    \n    # Vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and grid[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if grid[row - 1][col] < num and (row - 1, col, '∨') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row - 1][col] > num and (row - 1, col, '∧') in constraints:\n            return False\n    if row < 5 and grid[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if grid[row + 1][col] < num and (row, col, '∨') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row + 1][col] > num and (row, col, '∧') in constraints:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(6):\n        for col in range(6):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 7):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    [1, 0, 2, 0, 5, 6],\n    [0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n    [0, 1, 6, 0, 3, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 6, 2],\n    [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints: (row, col, type)\nconstraints = {\n    (1, 4, '>'),\n    (1, 4, '∨')\n}\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(' '.join(str(num) for num in row))\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the grid while respecting the constraints.
