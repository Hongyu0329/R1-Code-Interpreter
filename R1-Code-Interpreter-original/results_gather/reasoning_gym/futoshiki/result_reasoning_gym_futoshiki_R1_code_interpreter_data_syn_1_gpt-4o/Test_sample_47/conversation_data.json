    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also satisfying the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. The first row has a 4 in the first column and a 2 in the fourth column, with a greater-than constraint between the second and third columns.\n2. The second row has a greater-than constraint between the first and second columns, a less-than constraint between the second and third columns, and a greater-than constraint between the third and fourth columns.\n3. The third row has a greater-than constraint between the fourth and fifth columns.\n4. The fourth row has a less-than constraint between the second and third columns and a less-than constraint between the fourth and fifth columns.\n5. The fifth row has a 2 in the first column and a 3 in the third column.\n\nAdditionally, there are vertical constraints:\n- Between the first and second rows, the second column has a greater-than constraint.\n- Between the second and third rows, the second column has a less-than constraint.\n- Between the second and third rows, the fourth column has a greater-than constraint.\n- Between the third and fourth rows, the third column has a less-than constraint.\n\nTo solve this, we can use a backtracking algorithm to try different combinations of numbers while respecting the constraints. Let's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, constraints):\n    for (r1, c1, r2, c2, op) in constraints:\n        if op == '>' and not (grid[r1][c1] > grid[r2][c2]):\n            return False\n        if op == '<' and not (grid[r1][c1] < grid[r2][c2]):\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki():\n    # Initial grid with known values\n    grid = [\n        [4, 0, 0, 2, 0],\n        [0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [2, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Constraints: (row1, col1, row2, col2, operator)\n    constraints = [\n        (0, 1, 0, 2, '>'),\n        (1, 0, 1, 1, '>'),\n        (1, 1, 1, 2, '<'),\n        (1, 2, 1, 3, '>'),\n        (2, 3, 2, 4, '>'),\n        (3, 1, 3, 2, '<'),\n        (3, 3, 3, 4, '<'),\n        (0, 1, 1, 1, '>'),\n        (1, 1, 2, 1, '<'),\n        (1, 3, 2, 3, '>'),\n        (2, 2, 3, 2, '<')\n    ]\n    \n    # Try all permutations for each row\n    for perm1 in permutations(range(1, 6)):\n        if perm1[0] == 4 and perm1[3] == 2:\n            grid[0] = list(perm1)\n            for perm2 in permutations(range(1, 6)):\n                if perm2[2] == 5:\n                    grid[1] = list(perm2)\n                    for perm3 in permutations(range(1, 6)):\n                        grid[2] = list(perm3)\n                        for perm4 in permutations(range(1, 6)):\n                            grid[3] = list(perm4)\n                            for perm5 in permutations(range(1, 6)):\n                                if perm5[0] == 2 and perm5[2] == 3:\n                                    grid[4] = list(perm5)\n                                    if is_valid(grid, constraints):\n                                        for row in grid:\n                                            print(row)\n                                        return\n\nsolve_futoshiki()\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to fill the grid by trying all permutations of numbers 1 to 5 for each row, while checking if the constraints are satisfied.

    "The output indicates that the solution found does not satisfy the Futoshiki puzzle constraints, particularly the uniqueness constraint in each row and column.

    "The timeout error suggests that the backtracking algorithm is taking too long to find a solution. This can happen if the algorithm is not efficiently pruning the search space or if there are too many possibilities to explore.\n\nTo improve the efficiency, we can add more checks to prune the search space early.
