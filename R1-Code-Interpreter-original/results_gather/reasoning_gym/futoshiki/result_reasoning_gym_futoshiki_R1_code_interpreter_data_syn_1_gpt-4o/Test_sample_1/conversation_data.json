    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's break down the problem and solve it step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - The numbers in each row and column must be unique.\n   - The inequality symbols dictate the relative size of the numbers in adjacent cells.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**:\n   - We have some numbers already filled in the grid.\n   - We need to fill in the blanks while respecting the constraints.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to try filling in the numbers.\n   - Check for validity at each step by ensuring no duplicates in rows/columns and respecting the inequality constraints.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to solve the puzzle:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(8):\n        if board[row][i] == num or board[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check inequality constraints\n    if row > 0 and board[row-1][col] != 0:\n        if constraints[row-1][col] == '∧' and not (board[row-1][col] < num):\n            return False\n        if constraints[row-1][col] == '∨' and not (board[row-1][col] > num):\n            return False\n    if col > 0 and board[row][col-1] != 0:\n        if constraints[row][col-1] == '<' and not (board[row][col-1] < num):\n            return False\n        if constraints[row][col-1] == '>' and not (board[row][col-1] > num):\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(board, row=0, col=0):\n    if row == 8:\n        return True\n    if col == 8:\n        return solve_futoshiki(board, row + 1, 0)\n    if board[row][col] != 0:\n        return solve_futoshiki(board, row, col + 1)\n    \n    for num in range(1, 9):\n        if is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n            board[row][col] = num\n            if solve_futoshiki(board, row, col + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n    return False\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n    [7, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1],\n    [2, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 6],\n    [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 8, 4, 5, 7, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints setup\nconstraints = [\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '<', '>', '', ''],\n    ['∧', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['∨', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(board)\n\n# Print the solved board\nfor row in board:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the blanks while respecting the constraints.
