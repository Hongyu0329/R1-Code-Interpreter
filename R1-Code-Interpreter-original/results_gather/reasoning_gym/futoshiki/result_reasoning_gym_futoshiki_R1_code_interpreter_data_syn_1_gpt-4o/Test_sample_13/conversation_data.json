    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 6 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also satisfying the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. The first row has a constraint that the third cell is greater than the fourth cell.\n2. The second row has a constraint that the second cell is greater than the third cell.\n3. The third row has a constraint that the second cell is greater than the third cell and the fifth cell is greater than the sixth cell.\n4. The fourth row has constraints that the first cell is less than the second cell, the fourth cell is less than the fifth cell, and the fifth cell is less than the sixth cell.\n5. The fifth row has a constraint that the sixth cell is greater than the fifth cell.\n6. The sixth row has constraints that the first cell is greater than the second cell, the second cell is less than the third cell, and the fifth cell is less than the sixth cell.\n\nWe will use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid while checking the constraints.

    "It seems there is still an issue with the constraints or the logic in the backtracking algorithm. Let's take a step back and ensure that the constraints are correctly defined and that the algorithm is correctly implemented.\n\nThe constraints need to be carefully checked, especially the vertical constraints, which might have been misinterpreted. Let's redefine the constraints and ensure that the backtracking algorithm is correctly implemented.\n\nHere's a revised version of the code:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num, constraints):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(6):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n\n    # Check constraints\n    for (r1, c1, r2, c2, op) in constraints:\n        if (r1 == row and c1 == col) or (r2 == row and c2 == col):\n            val1 = grid[r1][c1] if grid[r1][c1] != 0 else num\n            val2 = grid[r2][c2] if grid[r2][c2] != 0 else num\n            if op == '>' and not (val1 > val2):\n                return False\n            if op == '<' and not (val1 < val2):\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid, constraints, row=0, col=0):\n    if row == 6:\n        return grid\n\n    if col == 6:\n        return solve_futoshiki(grid, constraints, row + 1, 0)\n\n    if grid[row][col] != 0:\n        return solve_futoshiki(grid, constraints, row, col + 1)\n\n    for num in range(1, 7):\n        if is_valid(grid, row, col, num, constraints):\n            grid[row][col] = num\n            if solve_futoshiki(grid, constraints, row, col + 1):\n                return grid\n            grid[row][col] = 0\n\n    return None\n\n# Initial grid with known values\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4],\n    [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n    [5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints: (row1, col1, row2, col2, operator)\nconstraints = [\n    (0, 2, 0, 3, '>'),\n    (1, 1, 1, 2, '>'),\n    (2, 1, 2, 2, '>'),\n    (2, 4, 2, 5, '>'),\n    (3, 0, 3, 1, '<'),\n    (3, 3, 3, 4, '<'),\n    (3, 4, 3, 5, '<'),\n    (4, 5, 4, 4, '>'),\n    (5, 0, 5, 1, '>'),\n    (5, 1, 5, 2, '<'),\n    (5, 4, 5, 5, '<'),\n    (0, 0, 1, 0, 'v'),\n    (1, 2, 2, 2, 'v'),\n    (2, 5, 3, 5, 'v'),\n    (3, 1, 4, 1, 'v'),\n    (4, 5, 5, 5, 'v')\n]\n\n# Convert vertical constraints to horizontal ones\nvertical_constraints = [\n    (0, 0, 1, 0, '<'),\n    (1, 2, 2, 2, '<'),\n    (2, 5, 3, 5, '<'),\n    (3, 1, 4, 1, '<'),\n    (4, 5, 5, 5, '<')\n]\n\n# Add vertical constraints to the main constraints list\nconstraints.extend(vertical_constraints)\n\nsolution = solve_futoshiki(grid, constraints)\nif solution:\n    for row in solution:\n        print(row)\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see if it finds a solution."

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the following 6x6 Futoshiki puzzle:\n\n_   _   _ > _   3   4\n    ∨                \n_   _   5   _   _   _\n        ∨           ∧\n5   2   _   _   _   3\n        ∨   ∨        \n_ < 6   _   2 < _ < _\n                    ∨\n_   4   _   _   _   2\n                     \n_ > _ < _   _   2 < _\n\nEnsure your answer follows the same format as the puzzle above, just replace blanks (_) with the correct value for the cell and put the answer in triple angle brackets, like this <<<answer to the puzzle>>>.\nUse < and > for horizontal constraints.
