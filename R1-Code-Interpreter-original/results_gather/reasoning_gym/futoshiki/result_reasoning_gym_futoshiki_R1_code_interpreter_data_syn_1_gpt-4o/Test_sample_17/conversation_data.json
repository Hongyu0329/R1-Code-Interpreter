    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. The second row has a constraint that the third column number is greater than the fourth column number.\n2. The third row has a constraint that the third column number is less than the fourth column number.\n3. The numbers in the third row are partially filled: 4, 1, _, _.\n4. The fourth row has a number 4 in the third column.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start filling in the numbers while ensuring that all conditions are met.\n\nLet's use a Python script to solve this puzzle by trying different combinations and checking the constraints.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define the constraints\ndef check_constraints(grid):\n    # Check row and column uniqueness\n    for i in range(4):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 4:\n            return False\n        if len(set([grid[j][i] for j in range(4)])) != 4:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check inequality constraints\n    if not (grid[1][2] > grid[1][3]):  # Second row, third column > fourth column\n        return False\n    if not (grid[2][2] < grid[2][3]):  # Third row, third column < fourth column\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Pre-filled numbers\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 1],\n    [4, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 0]\n]\n\n# Try permutations for the empty cells\nfor perm in permutations(range(1, 5)):\n    grid[0] = list(perm)\n    for perm2 in permutations(range(1, 5)):\n        grid[3] = list(perm2)\n        if check_constraints(grid):\n            print(grid)\n            break\n```\n\nThe code will try different permutations for the first and fourth rows and check if they satisfy all the constraints. Let's execute the code to find the solution."
