    "To solve the 6x6 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 6 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nThe constraints are:\n- Horizontal: 5 > 1, 5 > _\n- Vertical: 6 ∨ _, _ ∧ _, _ ∧ _, _ ∧ _, _ ∨ 3\n\nLet's break down the problem and solve it step by step.
