    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given by the <, >, ∧, and ∨ symbols.\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n- Horizontal constraints: \n  - Row 2: 6 < _ > _\n  - Row 4: 2 < _\n  - Row 5: 5 < 7\n  - Row 7: _ < 2\n  - Row 8: 4 > _\n\n- Vertical constraints:\n  - Column 3: 5 ∧ _\n  - Column 4: 6 ∧ _\n  - Column 5: 1 ∧ _\n  - Column 6: 2 ∧ _\n  - Column 7: 4 ∧ _\n\nTo solve this, we can use a backtracking algorithm that tries to fill in the grid while checking the constraints at each step. If a constraint is violated, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different number.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(8):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n\n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if (grid[row][col - 1] < num and (row, col - 1, '<') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row][col - 1] > num and (row, col - 1, '>') in constraints):\n            return False\n    if col < 7 and grid[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if (grid[row][col + 1] < num and (row, col, '<') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row][col + 1] > num and (row, col, '>') in constraints):\n            return False\n\n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and grid[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if (grid[row - 1][col] < num and (row - 1, col, '∧') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row - 1][col] > num and (row - 1, col, '∨') in constraints):\n            return False\n    if row < 7 and grid[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if (grid[row + 1][col] < num and (row, col, '∧') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row + 1][col] > num and (row, col, '∨') in constraints):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(8):\n        for col in range(8):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 9):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 5, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7],\n    [0, 0, 0, 6, 1, 0, 7, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n    [5, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],\n    [0, 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 0, 2],\n    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 4, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints in the form (row, col, type)\nconstraints = {\n    (1, 4, '<'), (1, 5, '>'), (3, 3, '<'), (4, 0, '<'), (6, 6, '<'), (7, 6, '>'),\n    (0, 2, '∧'), (1, 2, '∧'), (2, 3, '∧'), (3, 3, '∧'), (4, 4, '∧'), (5, 4, '∧'),\n    (6, 5, '∧'), (7, 5, '∧')\n}\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\nfor row in grid:\n    print('   '.join(str(num) if num != 0 else '_' for num in row))\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the grid while respecting the constraints.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the following 8x8 Futoshiki puzzle:\n\n3   5   _   _   _   7   _   _\n                             \n_   2   5   _   6 < _ > _   7\n            ∧                \n_   _   _   6   1   _   7   _\n        ∧                    \n_   _   _   2 < _   _   8   _\n                             \n5 < 7   _   _   _   2   _   _\n            ∧                \n_   _   6   _   4   _ < _   2\n    ∧                        \n8   _   _   _   _   _   2   3\n    ∧                        \n_   _   _   _   3   6   4 > _\n\nEnsure your answer follows the same format as the puzzle above, just replace blanks (_) with the correct value for the cell and put the answer in triple angle brackets, like this <<<answer to the puzzle>>>.\nUse < and > for horizontal constraints. Use ∧ and ∨ for vertical constraints.\nRemember, in Futoshiki each row and column must contain each number from 1 to 8 exactly once.",
