    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints provided.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. The grid is 5x5, and we have some numbers and inequalities already given.\n2. The inequalities are:\n   - Row 1: No inequalities.\n   - Row 2: Column 3 > Column 4 > Column 5.\n   - Row 3: Column 1 > Column 2.\n   - Row 4: Column 1 > Column 2.\n   - Row 5: Column 4 > Column 5.\n3. Vertical inequalities:\n   - Column 1: Row 1 ∧ Row 2, Row 3 ∧ Row 4.\n   - Column 5: Row 2 ∧ Row 3.\n\nWe will use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid while respecting these constraints. Let's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(5):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal inequalities\n    if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if grid[row][col - 1] < num and (row, col - 1, row, col) in inequalities:\n            return False\n        if grid[row][col - 1] > num and (row, col, row, col - 1) in inequalities:\n            return False\n    \n    if col < 4 and grid[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if grid[row][col + 1] < num and (row, col + 1, row, col) in inequalities:\n            return False\n        if grid[row][col + 1] > num and (row, col, row, col + 1) in inequalities:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check vertical inequalities\n    if row > 0 and grid[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if grid[row - 1][col] < num and (row - 1, col, row, col) in inequalities:\n            return False\n        if grid[row - 1][col] > num and (row, col, row - 1, col) in inequalities:\n            return False\n    \n    if row < 4 and grid[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if grid[row + 1][col] < num and (row + 1, col, row, col) in inequalities:\n            return False\n        if grid[row + 1][col] > num and (row, col, row + 1, col) in inequalities:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(5):\n        for col in range(5):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 6):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 3, 2, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Inequalities (row1, col1, row2, col2) means grid[row1][col1] > grid[row2][col2]\ninequalities = {\n    (1, 2, 1, 3), (1, 3, 1, 4),\n    (2, 0, 2, 1),\n    (3, 0, 3, 1),\n    (4, 3, 4, 4),\n    (0, 0, 1, 0), (2, 0, 3, 0),\n    (1, 4, 2, 4)\n}\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the grid while respecting the constraints.
