    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 5 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. The first row has numbers 5, _, 2, _, 4.\n2. The second row has numbers 2, _, _, 1, and the constraint 1 < _.\n3. The third row has numbers 4, _, 3, _, _, and a vertical constraint ∧ below the third column.\n4. The fourth row is completely empty, but the third column has a vertical constraint ∧ above it.\n5. The fifth row has numbers _, _, 4, 5, _.\n\nThe constraints are:\n- Row 2, column 4 must be less than column 5.\n- Row 3, column 3 must be greater than row 4, column 3.\n\nLet's use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid while respecting these constraints.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, constraints):\n    # Check all rows and columns for unique numbers\n    for i in range(5):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 5 or len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 5:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check constraints\n    for (r1, c1, r2, c2, op) in constraints:\n        if op == '<' and not (grid[r1][c1] < grid[r2][c2]):\n            return False\n        if op == '>' and not (grid[r1][c1] > grid[r2][c2]):\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki():\n    # Initial grid with known values\n    grid = [\n        [5, 0, 2, 0, 4],\n        [2, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n        [4, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 4, 5, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Constraints: (row1, col1, row2, col2, operator)\n    constraints = [\n        (1, 3, 1, 4, '<'),  # 1 < _\n        (2, 2, 3, 2, '>')   # 3 ∧ _\n    ]\n    \n    # Try all permutations for each row\n    for perm1 in permutations([1, 3]):\n        grid[0][1], grid[0][3] = perm1\n        for perm2 in permutations([3, 4, 5]):\n            grid[1][1], grid[1][2], grid[1][4] = perm2\n            for perm3 in permutations([1, 2, 5]):\n                grid[2][1], grid[2][3], grid[2][4] = perm3\n                for perm4 in permutations([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]):\n                    grid[3] = list(perm4)\n                    for perm5 in permutations([1, 2, 3]):\n                        grid[4][0], grid[4][1], grid[4][4] = perm5\n                        if is_valid(grid, constraints):\n                            return grid\n\nsolution = solve_futoshiki()\nfor row in solution:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThe code will attempt to fill the grid by trying all permutations of numbers 1 to 5 for each row, while checking if the grid is valid according to the constraints.
