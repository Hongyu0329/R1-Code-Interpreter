    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 6 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints provided.\n\nThe given puzzle is:\n\n```\n_   _   _   _   _   3\n                     \n_   _   1   _   _   _\n                     \n_   _   6   3   _   _\n                     \n_   2   _   _ > 3 > _\n                     \n1   _   4   _   _   5\n                     \n4   _   _   _   6   _\n```\n\nWith the constraints:\n- Row 4: Column 5 > Column 6\n- Row 4: Column 4 > Column 5\n\nTo solve this, we can use a backtracking algorithm that tries to fill the grid while checking the constraints at each step. If a constraint is violated, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different number.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(6):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n\n    # Check the constraints\n    if row == 3 and col == 4 and grid[row][5] != 0 and not (num > grid[row][5]):\n        return False\n    if row == 3 and col == 3 and grid[row][4] != 0 and not (num > grid[row][4]):\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(6):\n        for col in range(6):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 7):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 6, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 4, 0, 0, 5],\n    [4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the grid while respecting the constraints.
