    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 9 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given in the puzzle. The constraints are either horizontal (using < or >) or vertical (using ∧ or ∨).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this puzzle:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints**: We have both horizontal and vertical constraints that need to be respected. These constraints will guide the placement of numbers in the grid.\n\n2. **Use a backtracking algorithm**: This is a common approach for solving constraint satisfaction problems like Futoshiki. We will try to fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, backtracking whenever we encounter a conflict with the constraints.\n\n3. **Check constraints**: For each number placed, we need to check:\n   - The number is not repeated in the current row or column.\n   - The number satisfies all the inequality constraints with its neighbors.\n\n4. **Iterate until the grid is filled**: Continue placing numbers and backtracking as necessary until the entire grid is filled correctly.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to solve the puzzle.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(9):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if grid[row][col - 1] < num and (row, col - 1, '>') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row][col - 1] > num and (row, col - 1, '<') in constraints:\n            return False\n    if col < 8 and grid[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if grid[row][col + 1] < num and (row, col, '>') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row][col + 1] > num and (row, col, '<') in constraints:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and grid[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if grid[row - 1][col] < num and (row - 1, col, '∨') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row - 1][col] > num and (row - 1, col, '∧') in constraints:\n            return False\n    if row < 8 and grid[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if grid[row + 1][col] < num and (row, col, '∨') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row + 1][col] > num and (row, col, '∧') in constraints:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(9):\n        for col in range(9):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 10):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing blanks\ngrid = [\n    [0, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0],\n    [2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3],\n    [4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n    [8, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 6, 2, 7],\n    [0, 7, 0, 1, 5, 6, 0, 0, 4],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 9, 8],\n    [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n    [9, 6, 0, 7, 0, 2, 8, 5, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints: (row, col, type)\nconstraints = {\n    (0, 7, '>'), (3, 7, '>'), (4, 5, '<'), (6, 3, '<')\n}\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the grid while respecting the constraints.
