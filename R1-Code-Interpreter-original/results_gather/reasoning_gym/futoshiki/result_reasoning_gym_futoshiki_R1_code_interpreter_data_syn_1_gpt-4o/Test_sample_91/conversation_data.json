    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also satisfying the given inequality constraints.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. The first row has a 4 in the first column and a 'greater than' constraint between the second and third columns.\n2. The second row has two 'greater than' constraints between the first and second columns, and between the second and third columns.\n3. The third row has a '3' in the third column and a 'greater than' constraint between the third and fourth columns.\n4. The fourth row has no initial numbers or constraints.\n\nWe will use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid while respecting the constraints. Let's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, constraints):\n    # Check all rows and columns for unique numbers\n    for i in range(4):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 4 or len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 4:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check all constraints\n    for (r1, c1, r2, c2, op) in constraints:\n        if op == '>' and not (grid[r1][c1] > grid[r2][c2]):\n            return False\n        if op == '<' and not (grid[r1][c1] < grid[r2][c2]):\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki():\n    # Initial grid with known values\n    grid = [\n        [4, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 3, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Constraints: (row1, col1, row2, col2, operator)\n    constraints = [\n        (0, 1, 0, 2, '>'),\n        (1, 0, 1, 1, '>'),\n        (1, 1, 1, 2, '>'),\n        (2, 2, 2, 3, '>')\n    ]\n    \n    # Try all permutations of numbers 1 to 4 for each row\n    for perm1 in permutations(range(1, 5)):\n        grid[0][1:] = perm1[1:]\n        for perm2 in permutations(range(1, 5)):\n            grid[1] = list(perm2)\n            for perm3 in permutations(range(1, 5)):\n                grid[2][0] = perm3[0]\n                grid[2][1] = perm3[1]\n                grid[2][3] = perm3[3]\n                for perm4 in permutations(range(1, 5)):\n                    grid[3] = list(perm4)\n                    if is_valid(grid, constraints):\n                        return grid\n\nsolution = solve_futoshiki()\nfor row in solution:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by trying all permutations of numbers 1 to 4 for each row, while checking if the grid satisfies all constraints. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a solution to the Futoshiki puzzle.
