    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 7 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints and solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - Horizontal constraints: \n     - Row 1: _ < _ > _   _   2   _   3\n     - Row 3: _   _   _   6   3 < _   _\n     - Row 5: 4 > _   _   _   _   _   6\n     - Row 6: _   _   _   5 < _   6   1\n   - Vertical constraints:\n     - Column 4: 2 ∨ 6\n     - Column 7: 3 ∨ 6 ∧ 1\n\n2. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have some numbers already placed in the grid:\n     - Row 2: _   1   _   2   _   _   _\n     - Row 4: _   6   4   _   _   2   _\n     - Row 7: 5   _   2   _   6   _   _\n\n3. **Solving Strategy:**\n   - Use the constraints to deduce possible numbers for each cell.\n   - Ensure each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 7.\n   - Respect the inequality constraints while filling the grid.\n\nLet's implement a Python script to solve this puzzle using backtracking and constraint satisfaction.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(7):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if (row == 0 and col == 1 and grid[row][col - 1] >= num) or \\\n           (row == 0 and col == 2 and grid[row][col - 1] <= num) or \\\n           (row == 2 and col == 5 and grid[row][col - 1] >= num) or \\\n           (row == 4 and col == 1 and grid[row][col - 1] <= num) or \\\n           (row == 5 and col == 4 and grid[row][col - 1] >= num):\n            return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and grid[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if (col == 3 and row == 1 and grid[row - 1][col] >= num) or \\\n           (col == 6 and row == 2 and grid[row - 1][col] >= num) or \\\n           (col == 6 and row == 5 and grid[row - 1][col] <= num):\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(7):\n        for col in range(7):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 8):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3],\n    [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 6, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 6, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0],\n    [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6],\n    [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 6, 1],\n    [5, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the grid while respecting the constraints.
