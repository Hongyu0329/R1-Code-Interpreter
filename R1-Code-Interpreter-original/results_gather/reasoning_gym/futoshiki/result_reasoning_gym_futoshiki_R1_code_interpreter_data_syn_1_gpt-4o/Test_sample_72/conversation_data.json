    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 4 exactly once. Additionally, we must respect any inequality constraints that are present in the puzzle. However, the puzzle provided does not include any inequality constraints, so we will solve it as a standard Latin square.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have a 4x4 grid with some numbers already filled in.\n2. The numbers 1 to 4 must appear exactly once in each row and column.\n3. We will use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid, checking for validity at each step.\n\nHere's the initial grid:\n\n```\n1   _   _   _\n_   _   3   _\n3   _   _   _\n_   1   2   _\n```\n\nWe will write a Python script to solve this puzzle using backtracking.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row\n    if num in grid[row]:\n        return False\n    # Check if num is not in the current column\n    for r in range(4):\n        if grid[r][col] == num:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(4):\n        for col in range(4):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:  # Empty cell\n                for num in range(1, 5):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0  # Backtrack\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 3, 0],\n    [3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 2, 0]\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\nprint(grid)\n```\n\nThis code will fill in the grid with the correct numbers, respecting the rules of Futoshiki. Let's execute the code to get the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a solution to the Futoshiki puzzle. Now, let's format the solution in the same format as the original puzzle, replacing the blanks with the correct values:\n\n```\n1   3   4   2\n2   4   3   1\n3   2   1   4\n4   1   2   3\n```\n\nThis solution satisfies the conditions of the puzzle, with each number from 1 to 4 appearing exactly once in each row and column. There were no inequality constraints to consider in this particular puzzle.\n\n<<<\n1   3   4   2\n2   4   3   1\n3   2   1   4\n4   1   2   3\n>>>"
