    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nThe puzzle is given as:\n\n```\n_   _   _   _\n             \n_   _   2   _\n∧   ∧        \n_   4   _   _\n             \n_   _   3   2\n```\n\nThe constraints are:\n- The second row has two vertical constraints: both cells in the first and second columns must be greater than the cells directly below them.\n- The third row has no additional constraints.\n- The fourth row is partially filled with numbers 3 and 2.\n\nLet's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Start by filling in the known numbers and respecting the constraints.\n2. Use a backtracking algorithm to try different combinations and check if they satisfy the constraints.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid):\n    # Check rows and columns for unique numbers\n    for i in range(4):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 4 or len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 4:\n            return False\n    # Check inequality constraints\n    if not (grid[1][0] > grid[2][0] and grid[1][1] > grid[2][1]):\n        return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki():\n    # Initial grid with known values\n    grid = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 2, 0],\n        [0, 4, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 3, 2]\n    ]\n    \n    # Possible numbers to fill in\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    \n    # Try all permutations for each row\n    for perm1 in permutations(numbers):\n        grid[0] = list(perm1)\n        for perm2 in permutations(numbers):\n            grid[1][0], grid[1][1], grid[1][3] = perm2[0], perm2[1], perm2[3]\n            for perm3 in permutations(numbers):\n                grid[2][0], grid[2][2], grid[2][3] = perm3[0], perm3[2], perm3[3]\n                for perm4 in permutations(numbers):\n                    grid[3][0], grid[3][1] = perm4[0], perm4[1]\n                    if is_valid(grid):\n                        return grid\n\nsolution = solve_futoshiki()\nfor row in solution:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution to the puzzle.",
