    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also satisfying the inequality constraints.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. The first row has a constraint that the last number is greater than the second last.\n2. The second row has a fixed number 1 in the second column.\n3. The third row has a fixed number 2 in the third column and 4 in the fourth column.\n4. The fourth row has a fixed number 2 in the first column and 1 in the third column, with a constraint that the second number is less than the third.\n5. The fifth row has a constraint that the first number is greater than the second, and the last number is greater than the second last.\n\nWe will use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid while respecting these constraints.
