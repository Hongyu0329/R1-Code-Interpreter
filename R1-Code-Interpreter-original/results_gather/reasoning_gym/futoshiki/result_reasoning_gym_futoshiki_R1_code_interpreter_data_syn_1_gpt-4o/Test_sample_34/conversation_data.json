    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also satisfying the given inequality constraints.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. The second column has a '2' in the second row.\n2. The third column has a '3' in the fourth row.\n3. There are inequalities between some cells:\n   - Row 1, Column 2 is greater than Row 2, Column 2.\n   - Row 2, Column 3 is less than Row 3, Column 3.\n   - Row 3, Column 1 is less than Row 2, Column 1.\n   - Row 3, Column 4 is greater than Row 3, Column 3.\n   - Row 4, Column 3 is greater than Row 4, Column 4.\n\nWe will use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid while respecting these constraints.
