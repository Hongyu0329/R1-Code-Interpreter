    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also satisfying the inequality constraints. The constraints are given as either horizontal (>) or vertical (∧, ∨) inequalities.\n\nThe approach to solve this puzzle involves:\n1. Setting up the grid with the given numbers and constraints.\n2.
