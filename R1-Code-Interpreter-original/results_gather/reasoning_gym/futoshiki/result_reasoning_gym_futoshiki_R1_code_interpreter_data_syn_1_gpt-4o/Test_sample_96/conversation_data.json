    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. The first row has a constraint: 3 < 5.\n2. The second row has a vertical constraint: the first column is less than the second column.\n3. The third row has a constraint: the second column is less than the third column.\n4. The fourth row is partially filled: 1 and 5 are already placed.\n5. The fifth row has a constraint: the fourth column is greater than the fifth column.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid. The algorithm will try to place numbers in the grid, backtracking whenever a constraint is violated.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, constraints):\n    for (r1, c1, r2, c2, op) in constraints:\n        if op == '<' and not (grid[r1][c1] < grid[r2][c2]):\n            return False\n        if op == '>' and not (grid[r1][c1] > grid[r2][c2]):\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki():\n    # Initial grid with known values\n    grid = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 5, 4],\n        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Constraints: (row1, col1, row2, col2, operator)\n    constraints = [\n        (0, 3, 0, 4, '<'),\n        (1, 0, 1, 1, '<'),\n        (2, 1, 2, 2, '<'),\n        (4, 3, 4, 4, '>')\n    ]\n\n    # Try all permutations of numbers 1 to 5 for each row\n    for perm1 in permutations(range(1, 6)):\n        grid[0] = list(perm1)\n        if not is_valid(grid, constraints):\n            continue\n        for perm2 in permutations(range(1, 6)):\n            grid[1] = list(perm2)\n            if not is_valid(grid, constraints):\n                continue\n            for perm3 in permutations(range(1, 6)):\n                grid[2] = list(perm3)\n                if not is_valid(grid, constraints):\n                    continue\n                for perm5 in permutations(range(1, 6)):\n                    grid[4] = list(perm5)\n                    if not is_valid(grid, constraints):\n                        continue\n                    # Check columns\n                    if all(len(set(col)) == 5 for col in zip(*grid)):\n                        # Check if the grid is valid with all constraints\n                        if is_valid(grid, constraints):\n                            return grid\n\nsolution = solve_futoshiki()\nfor row in solution:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by trying all permutations of numbers 1 to 5 for each row, checking the constraints, and ensuring each column contains unique numbers.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the following 5x5 Futoshiki puzzle:\n\n_   _   _   3 < 5\n                ∨\n_   _   _   _   _\n∨                \n2   _ < _   _   _\n    ∨            \n_   1   _   5   4\n                 \n1   _   _   _ > _\n\nEnsure your answer follows the same format as the puzzle above, just replace blanks (_) with the correct value for the cell and put the answer in triple angle brackets, like this <<<answer to the puzzle>>>.\nUse < and > for horizontal constraints. Use ∧ and ∨ for vertical constraints.\nRemember, in Futoshiki each row and column must contain each number from 1 to 5 exactly once.",
