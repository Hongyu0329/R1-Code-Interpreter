    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also satisfying the inequality constraints given in the puzzle. The constraints are either horizontal (using < or >) or vertical (using ∧ or ∨).\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and constraints**: We start by noting the numbers already filled in the grid and the inequality constraints between the cells.\n\n2. **Apply constraints**: Use the constraints to limit the possible values for each cell. For example, if a cell has a constraint that it must be greater than its neighbor, it cannot be 1, and if it must be less than its neighbor, it cannot be 8.\n\n3. **Use logic and deduction**: Use logical reasoning to deduce the values of the cells. This involves checking the constraints and the numbers already filled in the row and column.\n\n4. **Backtracking**: If a logical deduction leads to a contradiction, backtrack and try a different possibility.\n\n5. **Iterate until solved**: Continue applying these steps until the puzzle is solved.\n\nLet's implement this logic using Python to solve the puzzle:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, constraints):\n    # Check all rows and columns for unique numbers\n    for i in range(8):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 8 or len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 8:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check all constraints\n    for (x1, y1, x2, y2, op) in constraints:\n        if op == '<' and not (grid[x1][y1] < grid[x2][y2]):\n            return False\n        if op == '>' and not (grid[x1][y1] > grid[x2][y2]):\n            return False\n        if op == '∧' and not (grid[x1][y1] < grid[x2][y2]):\n            return False\n        if op == '∨' and not (grid[x1][y1] > grid[x2][y2]):\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki():\n    # Initial grid with given numbers\n    grid = [\n        [1, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n        [2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n        [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 1, 0, 8],\n        [0, 0, 6, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 5],\n        [3, 6, 0, 0, 4, 7, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Constraints in the form (x1, y1, x2, y2, op)\n    constraints = [\n        (0, 2, 0, 3, '<'), (1, 2, 1, 3, '>'), (1, 4, 1, 5, '>'),\n        (2, 0, 1, 0, '∧'), (2, 4, 2, 5, '∧'), (2, 5, 2, 6, '∨'),\n        (3, 1, 2, 1, '∧'), (3, 2, 3, 3, '>'), (3, 5, 3, 6, '<'),\n        (4, 2, 3, 2, '∧'), (5, 3, 4, 3, '∨'), (5, 6, 5, 7, '>'),\n        (6, 1, 5, 1, '∧'), (6, 7, 6, 6, '>'), (7, 1, 7, 2, '<')\n    ]\n    \n    # Try all permutations of numbers 1 to 8 for each row\n    for perm in permutations(range(1, 9)):\n        grid[0] = [1, 4, 5] + list(perm[:5])\n        grid[1] = [2] + list(perm[5:8]) + [7] + list(perm[8:])\n        grid[2] = [4] + list(perm[8:11]) + [6, 7] + list(perm[11:])\n        grid[3] = list(perm[11:14]) + [4] + list(perm[14:16]) + [1, 8]\n        grid[4] = list(perm[16:18]) + [6, 2] + list(perm[18:20]) + [3] + list(perm[20:])\n        grid[5] = list(perm[20:23]) + [3] + list(perm[23:])\n        grid[6] = list(perm[23:27]) + [8] + list(perm[27:29]) + [5]\n        grid[7] = [3, 6] + list(perm[29:31]) + [4, 7] + list(perm[31:])\n        \n        if is_valid(grid, constraints):\n            for row in grid:\n                print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n            return\n\nsolve_futoshiki()\n```\n\nThis code attempts to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by generating permutations of numbers 1 to 8 for each row and checking if they satisfy the constraints.
