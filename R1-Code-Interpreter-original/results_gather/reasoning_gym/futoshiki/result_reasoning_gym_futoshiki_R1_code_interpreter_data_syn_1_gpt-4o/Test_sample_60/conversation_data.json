    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 7 exactly once, while also satisfying the inequality constraints given in the puzzle. The constraints are either horizontal (using < or >) or vertical (using ∧ or ∨).\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints**: \n   - Horizontal constraints: \n     - Row 1: Column 6 < Column 7\n     - Row 3: Column 3 < Column 4\n     - Row 4: Column 3 < Column 4\n     - Row 6: Column 4 > Column 5\n     - Row 7: Column 1 < Column 2, Column 6 < Column 7\n   - Vertical constraints:\n     - Column 1: Row 2 ∧ Row 3\n     - Column 3: Row 3 ∨ Row 4\n\n2. **Fill in the known numbers**: \n   - Row 1: Column 3 is 5\n   - Row 2: Column 4 is 1\n   - Row 3: Column 2 is 1, Column 7 is 2\n   - Row 4: Column 3 is 1, Column 5 is 2, Column 7 is 4\n   - Row 5: Column 7 is 1\n   - Row 6: Column 5 is 5\n   - Row 7: Column 5 is 7\n\n3. **Use constraints to deduce the remaining numbers**: \n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to try different combinations of numbers while respecting the constraints.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, constraints):\n    for (r1, c1, r2, c2, op) in constraints:\n        if op == '<' and not (grid[r1][c1] < grid[r2][c2]):\n            return False\n        if op == '>' and not (grid[r1][c1] > grid[r2][c2]):\n            return False\n        if op == '∧' and not (grid[r1][c1] < grid[r2][c2]):\n            return False\n        if op == '∨' and not (grid[r1][c1] > grid[r2][c2]):\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki():\n    # Initial grid with known values\n    grid = [\n        [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n        [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 4],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Constraints (r1, c1, r2, c2, op)\n    constraints = [\n        (0, 5, 0, 6, '<'),\n        (2, 2, 2, 3, '<'),\n        (3, 2, 3, 3, '<'),\n        (5, 3, 5, 4, '>'),\n        (6, 0, 6, 1, '<'),\n        (6, 5, 6, 6, '<'),\n        (1, 0, 2, 0, '∧'),\n        (2, 2, 3, 2, '∨')\n    ]\n\n    # Try permutations for each row\n    for perm1 in permutations(range(1, 8)):\n        if perm1[2] != 5:\n            continue\n        grid[0] = list(perm1)\n        for perm2 in permutations(range(1, 8)):\n            if perm2[3] != 1:\n                continue\n            grid[1] = list(perm2)\n            for perm3 in permutations(range(1, 8)):\n                if perm3[1] != 1 or perm3[6] != 2:\n                    continue\n                grid[2] = list(perm3)\n                for perm4 in permutations(range(1, 8)):\n                    if perm4[2] != 1 or perm4[4] != 2 or perm4[6] != 4:\n                        continue\n                    grid[3] = list(perm4)\n                    for perm5 in permutations(range(1, 8)):\n                        if perm5[6] != 1:\n                            continue\n                        grid[4] = list(perm5)\n                        for perm6 in permutations(range(1, 8)):\n                            if perm6[4] != 5:\n                                continue\n                            grid[5] = list(perm6)\n                            for perm7 in permutations(range(1, 8)):\n                                if perm7[4] != 7:\n                                    continue\n                                grid[6] = list(perm7)\n                                if is_valid(grid, constraints):\n                                    return grid\n\nsolution = solve_futoshiki()\nfor row in solution:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by trying all permutations of numbers 1 to 7 for each row, while respecting the given constraints.
