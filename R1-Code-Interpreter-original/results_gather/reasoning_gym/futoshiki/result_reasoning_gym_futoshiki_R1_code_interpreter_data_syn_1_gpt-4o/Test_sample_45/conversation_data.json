    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 6 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints provided.\n\nLet's break down the constraints and the given numbers:\n\n1. The numbers already filled in are:\n   - Row 1: 6, 2\n   - Row 2: 6, 2, 4\n   - Row 5: 5, 3, 6\n   - Row 6: 5, 3\n\n2.
