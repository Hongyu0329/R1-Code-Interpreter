Let's take a step back and ensure that the algorithm is correctly implemented.\n\n1. **Backtracking Logic**: The algorithm should try placing each number from 1 to 8 in each empty cell, checking if the placement is valid according to the constraints. If a valid placement is found, it should recursively attempt to solve the rest of the grid. If no valid placement is found, it should backtrack.\n\n2. **Constraint Checking**: Ensure that constraints are checked correctly, especially when dealing with unfilled cells.\n\nLet's refine the code once more, ensuring that the logic is correctly implemented:\n\n```python\n# Initial grid with known values and constraints\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 7, 0, 0],\n    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 1],\n    [0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 1, 0, 7],\n    [4, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints\nhorizontal_constraints = [\n    [None, None, None, None, '<', None, None],\n    [None, None, '>', None, None, '<', None],\n    ['>', '>', None, None, None, '>', None],\n    [None, '>', None, None, '>', '>', None],\n    [None, None, None, '>', None, None, '<'],\n    ['>', '<', None, None, '<', None, '<'],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None, None]\n]\n\nvertical_constraints = [\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    ['∨', None, None, None, '∨', None, '∨', None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    ['∧', '∧', '∧', None, None, '∨', None, None],\n    [None, '∨', None, None, None, None, '∧', None],\n    ['∧', None, None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, '∨', None, None, '∧', '∧', None, None]\n]\n\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check row and column uniqueness\n    for i in range(8):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n\n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and horizontal_constraints[row][col - 1]:\n        if horizontal_constraints[row][col - 1] == '<' and grid[row][col - 1] != 0 and not (grid[row][col - 1] < num):\n            return False\n        if horizontal_constraints[row][col - 1] == '>' and grid[row][col - 1] != 0 and not (grid[row][col - 1] > num):\n            return False\n    if col < 7 and horizontal_constraints[row][col]:\n        if horizontal_constraints[row][col] == '<' and grid[row][col + 1] != 0 and not (num < grid[row][col + 1]):\n            return False\n        if horizontal_constraints[row][col] == '>' and grid[row][col + 1] != 0 and not (num > grid[row][col + 1]):\n            return False\n\n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and vertical_constraints[row - 1][col]:\n        if vertical_constraints[row - 1][col] == '∧' and grid[row - 1][col] != 0 and not (grid[row - 1][col] > num):\n            return False\n        if vertical_constraints[row - 1][col] == '∨' and grid[row - 1][col] != 0 and not (grid[row - 1][col] < num):\n            return False\n    if row < 7 and vertical_constraints[row][col]:\n        if vertical_constraints[row][col] == '∧' and grid[row + 1][col] != 0 and not (num > grid[row + 1][col]):\n            return False\n        if vertical_constraints[row][col] == '∨' and grid[row + 1][col] != 0 and not (num < grid[row + 1][col]):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve(grid):\n    for row in range(8):\n        for col in range(8):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 9):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\nsolve(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly solve the puzzle by ensuring constraints are only applied when both cells involved are filled. Let's execute this refined code."
