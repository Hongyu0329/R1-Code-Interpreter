    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 6 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints. The given puzzle is:\n\n```\n_   _   6   _   1   2\n                     \n6   _   _   _   3   _\n                     \n_   6   _   _   _   _\n                     \n_   _   _   _   2   5\n            ∨        \n1   2   3   _   _   _\n                     \n_   _   2   3   5   _\n```\n\nThe only inequality constraint given is a vertical one between the fourth and fifth rows in the fifth column, indicating that the number in the fourth row, fifth column must be less than the number in the fifth row, fifth column.\n\nLet's solve this step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints:**\n   - The number in the fourth row, fifth column must be less than the number in the fifth row, fifth column.\n\n2. **Fill in the known numbers:**\n   - The third column of the first row is 6.\n   - The fifth column of the first row is 1.\n   - The sixth column of the first row is 2.\n   - The first column of the second row is 6.\n   - The fifth column of the second row is 3.\n   - The second column of the third row is 6.\n   - The fifth column of the fourth row is 2.\n   - The sixth column of the fourth row is 5.\n   - The first column of the fifth row is 1.\n   - The second column of the fifth row is 2.\n   - The third column of the fifth row is 3.\n   - The third column of the sixth row is 2.\n   - The fourth column of the sixth row is 3.\n   - The fifth column of the sixth row is 5.\n\n3. **Use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the rest of the grid:**\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(6):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(6):\n        for col in range(6):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 7):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 2],\n    [6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n    [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5],\n    [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 3, 5, 0]\n]\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution to the puzzle.",
