    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 7 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints provided. The constraints are given as '>' or '<' between cells horizontally and '∧' or '∨' vertically.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this puzzle:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and constraints**: We have some numbers already filled in the grid, and we have inequality constraints between some cells.\n\n2. **Apply constraints**: Use the constraints to limit the possible numbers that can go into each cell. For example, if a cell must be greater than its neighbor, it cannot be 1, and if it must be less than its neighbor, it cannot be 7.\n\n3. **Use logic and deduction**: Start filling in the cells by using logical deduction based on the constraints and the numbers already filled in.\n\n4. **Backtracking**: If you reach a point where no number can be placed in a cell without violating the constraints, backtrack and try a different number in a previous cell.\n\n5. **Check for completion**: Ensure that each row and column contains all numbers from 1 to 7 exactly once, and all constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet's implement a Python script to solve this puzzle using backtracking and constraint satisfaction:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(7):\n        if board[row][i] == num or board[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n\n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and board[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if (board[row][col - 1] < num and constraints[row][col - 1] == '>') or \\\n           (board[row][col - 1] > num and constraints[row][col - 1] == '<'):\n            return False\n    if col < 6 and board[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if (board[row][col + 1] < num and constraints[row][col] == '<') or \\\n           (board[row][col + 1] > num and constraints[row][col] == '>'):\n            return False\n\n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and board[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if (board[row - 1][col] < num and constraints[row - 1][col] == '∨') or \\\n           (board[row - 1][col] > num and constraints[row - 1][col] == '∧'):\n            return False\n    if row < 6 and board[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if (board[row + 1][col] < num and constraints[row][col] == '∧') or \\\n           (board[row + 1][col] > num and constraints[row][col] == '∨'):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(board, row=0, col=0):\n    if row == 7:\n        return True\n    if col == 7:\n        return solve_futoshiki(board, row + 1, 0)\n    if board[row][col] != 0:\n        return solve_futoshiki(board, row, col + 1)\n\n    for num in range(1, 8):\n        if is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n            board[row][col] = num\n            if solve_futoshiki(board, row, col + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n    [4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 6, 0],\n    [7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n    [6, 4, 0, 3, 7, 2, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 5, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints setup\nconstraints = [\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '>', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(board)\n\nfor row in board:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle using backtracking and constraint satisfaction.
