    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. The first row has a constraint: the second cell is less than the third cell.\n2. The second row has two constraints: the first cell is less than the second cell, and the second cell is greater than the third cell.\n3. The third row has a constraint: the first cell is greater than the second cell.\n4. The fourth row has no horizontal constraints.\n5. The first column has a constraint: the second cell is greater than the third cell.\n6. The third column has a constraint: the second cell is greater than the third cell.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can use a backtracking algorithm to try different combinations of numbers in the grid, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid):\n    # Check all rows and columns for unique numbers\n    for i in range(4):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 4:\n            return False\n        if len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 4:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if not (grid[0][1] < grid[0][2]):\n        return False\n    if not (grid[1][0] < grid[1][1] > grid[1][2]):\n        return False\n    if not (grid[2][0] > grid[2][1]):\n        return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if not (grid[1][0] > grid[2][0]):\n        return False\n    if not (grid[1][2] > grid[2][2]):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki():\n    # Generate all permutations of numbers 1 to 4\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    for perm in permutations(numbers):\n        grid = [list(perm) for _ in range(4)]\n        for perm2 in permutations(numbers):\n            grid[1] = list(perm2)\n            for perm3 in permutations(numbers):\n                grid[2] = list(perm3)\n                for perm4 in permutations(numbers):\n                    grid[3] = list(perm4)\n                    if is_valid(grid):\n                        return grid\n\nsolution = solve_futoshiki()\nfor row in solution:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to fill the grid with numbers 1 to 4, checking each configuration against the constraints.

    "The error indicates that the `solve_futoshiki` function returned `None`, meaning it didn't find a valid solution. This suggests that the constraints or the logic in the code might not be correctly implemented.
