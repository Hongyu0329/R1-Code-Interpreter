    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 7 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's break down the constraints and fill in the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a 7x7 grid with some numbers already filled in and several inequality constraints. The goal is to fill in the blanks with numbers 1 to 7 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, and all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis**:\n   - The constraints are given as inequalities between adjacent cells. For example, a < b means the value in cell a must be less than the value in cell b.\n   - We need to ensure that these constraints are respected while filling in the numbers.\n\n3. **Solving Strategy**:\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to try filling in the numbers.\n   - Check if the current number placement satisfies all constraints.\n   - If a placement leads to a conflict, backtrack and try a different number.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to solve the puzzle.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(7):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if grid[row][col - 1] < num and (row, col - 1, '<') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row][col - 1] > num and (row, col - 1, '>') in constraints:\n            return False\n    if col < 6 and grid[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if grid[row][col + 1] < num and (row, col, '<') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row][col + 1] > num and (row, col, '>') in constraints:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and grid[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if grid[row - 1][col] < num and (row - 1, col, '∧') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row - 1][col] > num and (row - 1, col, '∨') in constraints:\n            return False\n    if row < 6 and grid[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if grid[row + 1][col] < num and (row, col, '∧') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row + 1][col] > num and (row, col, '∨') in constraints:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(7):\n        for col in range(7):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 8):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    [3, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n    [2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 4],\n    [0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 6, 7],\n    [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 2, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints as tuples (row, col, type)\nconstraints = {\n    (0, 5, '<'), (1, 5, '<'), (3, 0, '<'), (3, 1, '<'), (3, 3, '<'), (4, 4, '<'),\n    (5, 2, '<'), (6, 2, '>'), (1, 4, '∧'), (1, 6, '∧'), (2, 1, '∧'), (2, 2, '∧'),\n    (4, 1, '∧'), (5, 1, '∧')\n}\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(' '.join(str(num) if num != 0 else '_' for num in row))\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the solution to the Futoshiki puzzle.",
    "It seems there was an issue with the code execution, possibly due to an error in the logic or constraints handling.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the following 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle:\n\n3   _   5   2   _   _ < _\n                         \n2   _   _   6   _ < _   4\n                ∧       ∧\n_   2   _   3   _   6   7\n    ∧   ∧                \n_ < 4 < _   _ < _   _   _\n                        ∨\n6   _   _   _   5 < _   _\n    ∧                    \n_   _ < _   _   _   1   _\n                         \n_   _   4 > _   3   2   _\n\nEnsure your answer follows the same format as the puzzle above, just replace blanks (_) with the correct value for the cell and put the answer in triple angle brackets, like this <<<answer to the puzzle>>>.\nUse < and > for horizontal constraints. Use ∧ and ∨ for vertical constraints.\nRemember, in Futoshiki each row and column must contain each number from 1 to 7 exactly once.",
