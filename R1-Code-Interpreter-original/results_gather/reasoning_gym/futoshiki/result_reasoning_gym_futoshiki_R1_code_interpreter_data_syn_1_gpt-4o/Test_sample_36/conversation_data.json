    "The code is still not solving the puzzle, which suggests that there might be a deeper issue with the logic or constraints checking. Let's carefully review the logic and constraints to ensure they are correctly implemented.\n\n1. **Constraints Checking**: Ensure that the constraints are correctly applied in the `is_valid` function. The logic for checking the constraints should be carefully reviewed to ensure it correctly interprets the inequality symbols.\n\n2. **Backtracking Logic**: Ensure that the backtracking logic correctly attempts to fill in the grid and backtracks when a number cannot be placed.\n\nLet's refine the code to address these issues and attempt to solve the puzzle again.\n\n```python\n# Initial grid setup with given numbers and constraints\ngrid = [\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0],\n    [9, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6],\n    [0, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 2],\n    [0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0],\n    [0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 9, 2, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 2, 9, 6, 0, 0, 7],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1],\n    [0, 0, 7, 8, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints\nhorizontal_constraints = [\n    [None, None, None, None, '>', None, None, '>', None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, '<', '>', None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, '>', None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, '>', None, None, None],\n    [None, '>', None, None, None, '<', None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, '<', '<', None, None, None, None],\n    [None, '>', '<', None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, '<', None, '>', None]\n]\n\nvertical_constraints = [\n    [None, '∧', None, None, None, None, None, '∧', None],\n    [None, None, None, '∧', None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, '∧', None],\n    ['∨', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, '∨'],\n    [None, None, None, None, '∧', None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, '∧', '∨', None, '∨', None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, '∧', None, None, '∧', None, None, None]\n]\n\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check row and column uniqueness\n    for i in range(9):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and horizontal_constraints[row][col - 1] == '>' and grid[row][col - 1] <= num:\n        return False\n    if col < 8 and horizontal_constraints[row][col] == '<' and grid[row][col + 1] != 0 and grid[row][col + 1] <= num:\n        return False\n    if col > 0 and horizontal_constraints[row][col - 1] == '<' and grid[row][col - 1] != 0 and grid[row][col - 1] >= num:\n        return False\n    if col < 8 and horizontal_constraints[row][col] == '>' and grid[row][col + 1] != 0 and grid[row][col + 1] >= num:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and vertical_constraints[row - 1][col] == '∧' and grid[row - 1][col] <= num:\n        return False\n    if row < 8 and vertical_constraints[row][col] == '∨' and grid[row + 1][col] != 0 and grid[row + 1][col] <= num:\n        return False\n    if row > 0 and vertical_constraints[row - 1][col] == '∨' and grid[row - 1][col] != 0 and grid[row - 1][col] >= num:\n        return False\n    if row < 8 and vertical_constraints[row][col] == '∧' and grid[row + 1][col] != 0 and grid[row + 1][col] >= num:\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(9):\n        for col in range(9):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 10):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code block includes the grid and constraints definitions, ensuring they are available for the solving function.
