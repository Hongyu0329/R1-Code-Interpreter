    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also satisfying the inequality constraints.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. The third column of the first row is 2.\n2. The second row has a vertical constraint where the third column is less than the third column of the third row.\n3. The second row has a horizontal constraint where the second column is greater than the third column.\n4. The third row has a horizontal constraint where the second column is less than the third column.\n5. The fourth row has a vertical constraint where the third column is less than the third column of the third row.\n6. The fourth row has a horizontal constraint where the first column is greater than the second column and the third column is greater than the fourth column.\n\nWe will use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid while respecting these constraints. Let's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid):\n    # Check all rows and columns contain unique numbers\n    for i in range(4):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 4 or len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 4:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check the constraints\n    if not (grid[0][2] == 2):\n        return False\n    if not (grid[1][2] < grid[2][2]):\n        return False\n    if not (grid[1][1] > grid[1][2]):\n        return False\n    if not (grid[2][1] < grid[2][2]):\n        return False\n    if not (grid[2][2] > grid[3][2]):\n        return False\n    if not (grid[3][0] > grid[3][1]):\n        return False\n    if not (grid[3][2] > grid[3][3]):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki():\n    # Generate all permutations of numbers 1 to 4\n    numbers = list(range(1, 5))\n    for perm in permutations(numbers):\n        grid = [list(perm) for _ in range(4)]\n        for perm2 in permutations(numbers):\n            grid[1] = list(perm2)\n            for perm3 in permutations(numbers):\n                grid[2] = list(perm3)\n                for perm4 in permutations(numbers):\n                    grid[3] = list(perm4)\n                    if is_valid(grid):\n                        return grid\n\nsolution = solve_futoshiki()\nfor row in solution:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to fill the grid with permutations of numbers 1 to 4 and check if the grid satisfies all the constraints. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a solution to the Futoshiki puzzle. Let's format the solution according to the puzzle's layout and constraints:\n\n```\n1   3   2   4\n            ∨\n2   4 > 1   3\n             \n3   1 < 4   2\n            ∨\n4 > 2   3 > 1\n```\n\nThis solution satisfies all the given constraints and ensures that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 4 exactly once. \n\nHere is the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\n1   3   2   4\n            ∨\n2   4 > 1   3\n             \n3   1 < 4   2\n            ∨\n4 > 2   3 > 1\n>>>"
