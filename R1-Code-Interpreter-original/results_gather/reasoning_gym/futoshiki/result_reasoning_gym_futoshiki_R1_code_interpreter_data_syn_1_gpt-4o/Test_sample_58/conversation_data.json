    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. The number in the first row, fourth column is 3, and the fifth column is 4.\n2. The number in the second row, first column is 5, and the fourth column is 4.\n3. The number in the third row, third column is 3.\n4. The number in the fourth row, second column is 5, and the fifth column is 1.\n5. The number in the fifth row, fifth column is 2.\n\nInequality constraints:\n- Second row, first column (5) is greater than the third row, first column.\n- Third row, fourth column is greater than the fourth row, fourth column.\n\nWe will use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid while respecting these constraints. Let's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(5):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check inequality constraints\n    if row == 1 and col == 0 and not (num > grid[2][0]):\n        return False\n    if row == 2 and col == 3 and not (num > grid[3][3]):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(5):\n        for col in range(5):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 6):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with given numbers and 0 for blanks\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 3, 4],\n    [5, 0, 0, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 5, 0, 0, 1],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\nprint(grid)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the grid while respecting the constraints.
