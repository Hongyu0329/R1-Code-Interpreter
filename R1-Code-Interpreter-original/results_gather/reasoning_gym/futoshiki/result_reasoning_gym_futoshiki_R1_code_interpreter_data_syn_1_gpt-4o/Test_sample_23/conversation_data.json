    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also satisfying the given inequality constraints.\n\nThe puzzle is represented as follows:\n\n```\n_   _   3   2\n             \n_ < _   _   _\n        ∨    \n_   2   _   3\n             \n_   1   _   _\n```\n\nThe constraints are:\n- The first row has numbers 3 and 2 in the third and fourth columns, respectively.\n- The second row has a '<' constraint between the first and second columns.\n- The third row has a '∨' constraint between the second and third rows in the second column.\n- The third row has numbers 2 and 3 in the second and fourth columns, respectively.\n- The fourth row has a number 1 in the second column.\n\nLet's solve this step by step:\n\n1. **Row 1**: We have numbers 3 and 2 in the third and fourth columns. The remaining numbers are 1 and 4. Since there are no constraints affecting these positions, we can place them in the first and second columns.\n\n2. **Row 2**: The '<' constraint between the first and second columns means the number in the first column must be less than the number in the second column. The possible numbers for this row are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since 3 and 2 are already used in the first row, and 2 is used in the third row, the only numbers left for the first column are 1 and 4. If we place 1 in the first column, we can place 4 in the second column to satisfy the '<' constraint.\n\n3. **Row 3**: We have numbers 2 and 3 in the second and fourth columns. The '∨' constraint between the second and third rows in the second column means the number in the third row, second column must be greater than the number in the second row, second column. Since the second row, second column is 4, the third row, second column must be 2, which is already given. The remaining numbers for this row are 1 and 4. Since 1 is already used in the fourth row, we place 4 in the first column and 1 in the third column.\n\n4. **Row 4**: We have a number 1 in the second column. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 4. Since 2 and 3 are already used in the third row, we place 4 in the first column, 2 in the third column, and 3 in the fourth column.\n\nNow, let's verify the solution by checking all constraints and ensuring each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 4.\n\n```python\n# Define the initial puzzle with constraints\npuzzle = [\n    [0, 0, 3, 2],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 3],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Define the constraints\nconstraints = {\n    'horizontal': [(1, 0, 1)],  # (row, col1, col2) for '<' constraint\n    'vertical': [(1, 1, 2)]     # (col, row1, row2) for '∨' constraint\n}\n\n# Function to check if a number can be placed in a given position\ndef is_valid(puzzle, row, col, num):\n    # Check row and column uniqueness\n    for i in range(4):\n        if puzzle[row][i] == num or puzzle[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    for (r, c1, c2) in constraints['horizontal']:\n        if r == row:\n            if c1 == col and puzzle[row][c2] != 0 and num >= puzzle[row][c2]:\n                return False\n            if c2 == col and puzzle[row][c1] != 0 and num <= puzzle[row][c1]:\n                return False\n    # Check vertical constraints\n    for (c, r1, r2) in constraints['vertical']:\n        if c == col:\n            if r1 == row and puzzle[r2][col] != 0 and num >= puzzle[r2][col]:\n                return False\n            if r2 == row and puzzle[r1][col] != 0 and num <= puzzle[r1][col]:\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Function to solve the puzzle using backtracking\ndef solve(puzzle):\n    for row in range(4):\n        for col in range(4):\n            if puzzle[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 5):\n                    if is_valid(puzzle, row, col, num):\n                        puzzle[row][col] = num\n                        if solve(puzzle):\n                            return True\n                        puzzle[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nsolve(puzzle)\n\n# Print the solved puzzle\nfor row in puzzle:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the solution.",

    "I apologize for the repeated issues. Let's take a different approach to ensure the constraints and backtracking are correctly implemented. I will manually solve the puzzle step by step, considering the constraints, and then verify the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Row 1**: We have numbers 3 and 2 in the third and fourth columns. The remaining numbers are 1 and 4. Since there are no constraints affecting these positions, we can place them in the first and second columns. Let's try placing 1 in the first column and 4 in the second column.\n\n2. **Row 2**: The '<' constraint between the first and second columns means the number in the first column must be less than the number in the second column. The possible numbers for this row are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since 3 and 2 are already used in the first row, and 2 is used in the third row, the only numbers left for the first column are 1 and 4. If we place 1 in the first column, we can place 4 in the second column to satisfy the '<' constraint.\n\n3. **Row 3**: We have numbers 2 and 3 in the second and fourth columns. The '∨' constraint between the second and third rows in the second column means the number in the third row, second column must be greater than the number in the second row, second column. Since the second row, second column is 4, the third row, second column must be 2, which is already given. The remaining numbers for this row are 1 and 4. Since 1 is already used in the fourth row, we place 4 in the first column and 1 in the third column.\n\n4. **Row 4**: We have a number 1 in the second column. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 4. Since 2 and 3 are already used in the third row, we place 4 in the first column, 2 in the third column, and 3 in the fourth column.\n\nNow, let's verify the solution by checking all constraints and ensuring each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 4.\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n```\n1   4   3   2\n             \n2 < 4   1   3\n        ∨    \n4   2   1   3\n             \n3   1   2   4\n```\n\nLet's format this solution in the required format:\n\n<<<\n1   4   3   2\n             \n2 < 4   1   3\n        ∨    \n4   2   1   3\n             \n3   1   2   4\n>>>"
