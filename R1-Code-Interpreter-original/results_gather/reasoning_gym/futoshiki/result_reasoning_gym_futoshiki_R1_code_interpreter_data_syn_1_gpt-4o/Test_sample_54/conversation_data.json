    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also respecting the given inequality constraints.\n\nThe puzzle is given as:\n\n```\n_ > _   _ > _\n             \n_   3   _   4\n             \n_   4   3   2\n             \n_   _   _   _\n```\n\nThe constraints are:\n- The first cell in the first row is greater than the second cell.\n- The third cell in the first row is greater than the fourth cell.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this puzzle:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints**: \n   - Row 1: The first cell is greater than the second, and the third cell is greater than the fourth.\n   - Row 2: The second cell is 3, and the fourth cell is 4.\n   - Row 3: The second cell is 4, the third cell is 3, and the fourth cell is 2.\n\n2. **Fill in the known values**:\n   - Row 2: _ 3 _ 4\n   - Row 3: _ 4 3 2\n\n3. **Use the constraints to deduce the possible values for the remaining cells**.\n\nLet's write a Python script to solve this puzzle by trying different combinations and checking the constraints.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define the constraints\ndef check_constraints(grid):\n    # Row 1 constraints\n    if not (grid[0][0] > grid[0][1] and grid[0][2] > grid[0][3]):\n        return False\n    # Row 2 and Row 3 are already filled correctly\n    # Check if each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 4\n    for i in range(4):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 4 or len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 4:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Known values\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0],  # Row 1\n    [0, 3, 0, 4],  # Row 2\n    [0, 4, 3, 2],  # Row 3\n    [0, 0, 0, 0]   # Row 4\n]\n\n# Try all permutations for the unknown rows\nfor perm1 in permutations([1, 2, 3, 4]):\n    if perm1[1] == 3 or perm1[3] == 4:\n        continue\n    grid[0] = list(perm1)\n    \n    for perm4 in permutations([1, 2, 3, 4]):\n        if perm4[1] == 4 or perm4[2] == 3 or perm4[3] == 2:\n            continue\n        grid[3] = list(perm4)\n        \n        if check_constraints(grid):\n            for row in grid:\n                print(row)\n            break\n```\n\nThe code will try different permutations for the unknown rows and check if they satisfy the constraints. Let's execute the code to find the solution."

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
