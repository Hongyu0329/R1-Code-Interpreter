    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 7 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n- Horizontal constraints: `<` and `>`\n- Vertical constraints: `∧` and `∨`\n\nThe given puzzle is:\n\n```\n_   _   5   _   4 < _   _\n∧       ∧   ∨   ∧        \n_ < _   _   _ < _   6   4\n∧           ∧            \n7   _   _   _   _ < 4   _\n                    ∨    \n_   2   _   _   7   1   _\n        ∧                \n_   _   _ > _   3   _   _\n                         \n_   1   3   2   _   _   _\n∧                        \n6   4   _ < _ > 1   _   _\n```\n\nTo solve this puzzle, we can use a backtracking algorithm that tries to fill in the grid while respecting the constraints. If a conflict arises, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different number.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check row and column uniqueness\n    for i in range(7):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if grid[row][col - 1] < num and (row, col - 1, '<') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row][col - 1] > num and (row, col - 1, '>') in constraints:\n            return False\n    if col < 6 and grid[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if grid[row][col + 1] < num and (row, col, '<') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row][col + 1] > num and (row, col, '>') in constraints:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and grid[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if grid[row - 1][col] < num and (row - 1, col, '∧') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row - 1][col] > num and (row - 1, col, '∨') in constraints:\n            return False\n    if row < 6 and grid[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if grid[row + 1][col] < num and (row, col, '∧') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row + 1][col] > num and (row, col, '∨') in constraints:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(7):\n        for col in range(7):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 8):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4],\n    [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 0, 7, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [6, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints as tuples (row, col, type)\nconstraints = {\n    (0, 4, '<'), (1, 1, '<'), (1, 4, '<'), (2, 5, '<'), (3, 5, '<'), (4, 3, '>'), (5, 2, '<'), (5, 4, '>'),\n    (0, 0, '∧'), (0, 2, '∧'), (0, 4, '∧'), (1, 0, '∧'), (2, 4, '∧'), (3, 1, '∧')\n}\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print('   '.join(str(num) for num in row))\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle using backtracking and print the completed grid.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the following 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle:\n\n_   _   5   _   4 < _   _\n∧       ∧   ∨   ∧        \n_ < _   _   _ < _   6   4\n∧           ∧            \n7   _   _   _   _ < 4   _\n                    ∨    \n_   2   _   _   7   1   _\n        ∧                \n_   _   _ > _   3   _   _\n                         \n_   1   3   2   _   _   _\n∧                        \n6   4   _ < _ > 1   _   _\n\nEnsure your answer follows the same format as the puzzle above, just replace blanks (_) with the correct value for the cell and put the answer in triple angle brackets, like this <<<answer to the puzzle>>>.\nUse < and > for horizontal constraints. Use ∧ and ∨ for vertical constraints.\nRemember, in Futoshiki each row and column must contain each number from 1 to 7 exactly once.",
