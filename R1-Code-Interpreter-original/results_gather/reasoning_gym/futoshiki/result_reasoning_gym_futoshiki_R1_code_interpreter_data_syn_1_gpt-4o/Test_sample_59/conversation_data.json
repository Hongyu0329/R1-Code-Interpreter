    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints.\n\nThe given puzzle is:\n\n```\n1   3   _ > _\n             \n_   _   _   _\n             \n2   _   _   _\n             \n_   _   3   _\n```\n\nThe constraints are:\n- The third cell in the first row is greater than the fourth cell in the first row.\n\nLet's start by filling in the grid step by step, considering the constraints and the rules of Futoshiki.\n\n1. **First Row**: We have `1` and `3` already placed. The remaining numbers are `2` and `4`. Since the third cell must be greater than the fourth cell, the third cell must be `4` and the fourth cell must be `2`.\n\n2. **Second Row**: We need to place `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`. Since there are no constraints, we can try different combinations. Let's start with `4` in the first cell, `2` in the second cell, `1` in the third cell, and `3` in the fourth cell.\n\n3. **Third Row**: We have `2` already placed. The remaining numbers are `1`, `3`, and `4`. Let's place `1` in the second cell, `4` in the third cell, and `3` in the fourth cell.\n\n4. **Fourth Row**: We have `3` already placed. The remaining numbers are `1`, `2`, and `4`. Let's place `4` in the first cell, `1` in the second cell, and `2` in the fourth cell.\n\nNow, let's verify if this arrangement satisfies all the constraints and rules. If it does, we have our solution. If not, we will need to adjust the numbers.\n\nLet's write a Python script to check the solution:\n\n```python\ndef check_futoshiki(grid):\n    # Check rows and columns for unique numbers\n    for i in range(4):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 4 or len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 4:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check the inequality constraint\n    if not (grid[0][2] > grid[0][3]):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Proposed solution\ngrid = [\n    [1, 3, 4, 2],\n    [4, 2, 1, 3],\n    [2, 1, 4, 3],\n    [4, 1, 3, 2]\n]\n\nprint(check_futoshiki(grid))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify if the proposed solution is correct.",
    "The proposed solution did not satisfy all the constraints. Let's re-evaluate the grid and constraints to find a correct solution.\n\nGiven the constraints and the rules of Futoshiki, let's try a different approach to fill the grid:\n\n1. **First Row**: We have `1` and `3` already placed. The remaining numbers are `2` and `4`. Since the third cell must be greater than the fourth cell, the third cell must be `4` and the fourth cell must be `2`.\n\n2. **Second Row**: We need to place `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`. Let's try placing `2` in the first cell, `4` in the second cell, `3` in the third cell, and `1` in the fourth cell.\n\n3. **Third Row**: We have `2` already placed. The remaining numbers are `1`, `3`, and `4`. Let's place `3` in the second cell, `1` in the third cell, and `4` in the fourth cell.\n\n4. **Fourth Row**: We have `3` already placed. The remaining numbers are `1`, `2`, and `4`. Let's place `4` in the first cell, `2` in the second cell, and `1` in the fourth cell.\n\nLet's check this new arrangement with a Python script:\n\n```python\ndef check_futoshiki(grid):\n    # Check rows and columns for unique numbers\n    for i in range(4):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 4 or len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 4:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check the inequality constraint\n    if not (grid[0][2] > grid[0][3]):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# New proposed solution\ngrid = [\n    [1, 3, 4, 2],\n    [2, 4, 3, 1],\n    [2, 3, 1, 4],\n    [4, 2, 3, 1]\n]\n\nprint(check_futoshiki(grid))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify if the new proposed solution is correct.",
