    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 6 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also satisfying the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. Each row and column must contain the numbers 1 to 6 without repetition.\n2. The inequalities must be respected:\n   - Row 1: 2 < _ and _ < 5\n   - Row 2: _ > _ and 4 > _\n   - Row 3: _ < 4 and _ < 6\n   - Row 4: 5 > 2 and 2 < _ and _ < _\n   - Row 5: _ < _ and _ ∧ _ and _ ∨ _\n   - Row 6: 4 > _\n\nWe will use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid while checking the constraints. Let's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(6):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check inequalities\n    if row == 0:\n        if col == 2 and not (num > grid[row][col + 1]):\n            return False\n        if col == 4 and not (num < grid[row][col - 1]):\n            return False\n    if row == 1:\n        if col == 1 and not (num > grid[row][col + 1]):\n            return False\n        if col == 4 and not (num > grid[row][col + 1]):\n            return False\n    if row == 2:\n        if col == 0 and not (num < grid[row][col + 1]):\n            return False\n        if col == 1 and not (num < grid[row][col + 1]):\n            return False\n    if row == 3:\n        if col == 2 and not (num > grid[row][col + 1]):\n            return False\n        if col == 3 and not (num < grid[row][col + 1]):\n            return False\n    if row == 4:\n        if col == 1 and not (num < grid[row][col + 1]):\n            return False\n    if row == 5:\n        if col == 0 and not (num > grid[row][col + 1]):\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(6):\n        for col in range(6):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 7):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 5],\n    [0, 5, 0, 0, 4, 0],\n    [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6],\n    [0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0],\n    [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution to the puzzle.",
