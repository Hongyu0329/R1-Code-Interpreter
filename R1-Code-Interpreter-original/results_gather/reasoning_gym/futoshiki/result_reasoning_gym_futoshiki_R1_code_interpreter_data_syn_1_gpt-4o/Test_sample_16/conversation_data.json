    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given in the puzzle. The constraints are represented by '<', '>', '∧', and '∨', which indicate the relative size of the numbers in adjacent cells.\n\nThe approach to solving this puzzle involves:\n1. Setting up the grid with the given numbers and constraints.\n2. Using a backtracking algorithm to try filling in the numbers while respecting the constraints.\n3.
