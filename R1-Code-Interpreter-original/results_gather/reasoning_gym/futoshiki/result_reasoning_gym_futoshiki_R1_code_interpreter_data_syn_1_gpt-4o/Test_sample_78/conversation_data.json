    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 7 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints and the given numbers:\n\n1. The grid has some numbers already filled in, and we need to fill in the blanks.\n2. The inequalities between cells must be respected. For example, if a cell has a '<' to its right, the number in the cell must be less than the number in the cell to its right.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can use a backtracking algorithm to try different combinations of numbers, ensuring that each row and column contains unique numbers and that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Initial grid with constraints\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4],\n    [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n    [7, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n    [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n    [0, 7, 4, 0, 6, 0, 0],\n    [0, 3, 0, 5, 2, 0, 7]\n]\n\n# Inequality constraints\nhorizontal_constraints = [\n    [None, None, '<', None, '<', None],\n    [None, '>', '<', None, None, None],\n    [None, '>', None, None, None, None],\n    [None, '>', None, '>', '>', None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, '>', None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None]\n]\n\nvertical_constraints = [\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    ['∨', None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None, None]\n]\n\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check row and column uniqueness\n    for i in range(7):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and horizontal_constraints[row][col - 1] == '<' and grid[row][col - 1] != 0 and grid[row][col - 1] >= num:\n        return False\n    if col > 0 and horizontal_constraints[row][col - 1] == '>' and grid[row][col - 1] != 0 and grid[row][col - 1] <= num:\n        return False\n    if col < 6 and horizontal_constraints[row][col] == '<' and grid[row][col + 1] != 0 and grid[row][col + 1] <= num:\n        return False\n    if col < 6 and horizontal_constraints[row][col] == '>' and grid[row][col + 1] != 0 and grid[row][col + 1] >= num:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and vertical_constraints[row - 1][col] == '∧' and grid[row - 1][col] != 0 and grid[row - 1][col] >= num:\n        return False\n    if row > 0 and vertical_constraints[row - 1][col] == '∨' and grid[row - 1][col] != 0 and grid[row - 1][col] <= num:\n        return False\n    if row < 6 and vertical_constraints[row][col] == '∧' and grid[row + 1][col] != 0 and grid[row + 1][col] <= num:\n        return False\n    if row < 6 and vertical_constraints[row][col] == '∨' and grid[row + 1][col] != 0 and grid[row + 1][col] >= num:\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve(grid):\n    for row in range(7):\n        for col in range(7):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 8):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\nsolve(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the grid while respecting the constraints.

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the following 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle:\n\n_   _   _   1   _ < _   4\n                         \n2   _   _   _ > _ < _   5\n                ∧        \n7   _ > 3   _   _   _   2\n∨                        \n_   _ > _   4   _ > 5 > _\n                         \n_   _   _   _   5   _   _\n                         \n_   7   4   _   6 > _   _\n                         \n_   3   _   5   2   _   7\n\nEnsure your answer follows the same format as the puzzle above, just replace blanks (_) with the correct value for the cell and put the answer in triple angle brackets, like this <<<answer to the puzzle>>>.\nUse < and > for horizontal constraints. Use ∧ and ∨ for vertical constraints.\nRemember, in Futoshiki each row and column must contain each number from 1 to 7 exactly once.",
