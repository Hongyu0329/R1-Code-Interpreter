    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 7 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. Horizontal constraints: \n   - Row 1: _ > _   3   _   5   _   _\n   - Row 4: 2   _   6 > _ > 1   7   _\n   - Row 5: 5   _ > 1   6   _   _ < 7\n   - Row 6: _ < _   7   _   _   _   2\n\n2.
