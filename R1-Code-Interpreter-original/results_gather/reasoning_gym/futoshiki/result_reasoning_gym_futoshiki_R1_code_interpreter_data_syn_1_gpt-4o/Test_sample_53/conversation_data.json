    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 5 exactly once, while also respecting any inequality constraints. The given puzzle is:\n\n```\n5   _   1   _   _\n                 \n1   _   _   _   2\n                 \n_   3   _   _   _\n                 \n_   _   3   _   _\n                 \n_   2   5   _   1\n```\n\nThere are no explicit inequality constraints given in the problem, so we will assume that the puzzle only needs to satisfy the row and column uniqueness constraints.\n\nTo solve this, we can use a backtracking algorithm, which is a common approach for solving constraint satisfaction problems like Futoshiki. The algorithm will try to fill in the grid by placing numbers 1 to 5 in each cell, checking for conflicts, and backtracking if a conflict is found.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row\n    if num in board[row]:\n        return False\n    # Check if num is not in the current column\n    for r in range(5):\n        if board[r][col] == num:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(board):\n    for row in range(5):\n        for col in range(5):\n            if board[row][col] == 0:  # Empty cell\n                for num in range(1, 6):\n                    if is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n                        board[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(board):\n                            return True\n                        board[row][col] = 0  # Backtrack\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [5, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n    [0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 5, 0, 1]\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(board)\nfor row in board:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the blanks with numbers 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears only once per row and column. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
