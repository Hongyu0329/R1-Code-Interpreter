    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also satisfying the inequality constraints given in the puzzle. The constraints are either horizontal (using < or >) or vertical (using ∧ or ∨).\n\nLet's break down the problem and solve it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and constraints**: \n   - We have some numbers already filled in the grid.\n   - We have inequality constraints between some cells.\n\n2. **Apply constraints and fill in the grid**:\n   - Use the constraints to limit the possible values for each cell.\n   - Use logical deduction to fill in the cells, ensuring that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 8.\n\n3. **Check for consistency**:\n   - Ensure that all constraints are satisfied after filling in the numbers.\n   - Verify that each row and column contains unique numbers.\n\nLet's implement a Python script to solve this puzzle using a backtracking algorithm, which is a common approach for solving constraint satisfaction problems like Futoshiki.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(8):\n        if board[row][i] == num or board[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n\n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and board[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if board[row][col - 1] < num and '<' in constraints[row][col - 1]:\n            return False\n        if board[row][col - 1] > num and '>' in constraints[row][col - 1]:\n            return False\n    if col < 7 and board[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if board[row][col + 1] < num and '>' in constraints[row][col]:\n            return False\n        if board[row][col + 1] > num and '<' in constraints[row][col]:\n            return False\n\n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and board[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if board[row - 1][col] < num and '∧' in constraints[row - 1][col]:\n            return False\n        if board[row - 1][col] > num and '∨' in constraints[row - 1][col]:\n            return False\n    if row < 7 and board[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if board[row + 1][col] < num and '∨' in constraints[row][col]:\n            return False\n        if board[row + 1][col] > num and '∧' in constraints[row][col]:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(board):\n    for row in range(8):\n        for col in range(8):\n            if board[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 9):\n                    if is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n                        board[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(board):\n                            return True\n                        board[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial board setup with 0 representing empty cells\nboard = [\n    [0, 2, 1, 0, 5, 7, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n    [4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 7, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n    [0, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n    [6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 7, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints for the puzzle\nconstraints = [\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '<', '', ''],\n    ['∧', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '<', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '<', ''],\n    ['∧', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '<', '', '', '', '']\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(board)\n\n# Print the solved board\nfor row in board:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the solution to the Futoshiki puzzle.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the following 8x8 Futoshiki puzzle:\n\n_   2   1   _   5   7   _   _\n            ∨                \n_   1   _   _   _   3 < _   _\n    ∧                   ∨   ∧\n4   _   5   _   _   _   _   _\n                            ∨\n_   7   4   6   _   _ < _   5\n                ∧            \n_   3   7   _   _   _   1 < _\n                ∨            \n_   _   _   2   _   _   5   _\n    ∧                        \n6   _   _   _   2   4   _   _\n            ∨                \n_   _   _   _ < 4   1   7   _\n\nEnsure your answer follows the same format as the puzzle above, just replace blanks (_) with the correct value for the cell and put the answer in triple angle brackets, like this <<<answer to the puzzle>>>.\nUse < and > for horizontal constraints. Use ∧ and ∨ for vertical constraints.\nRemember, in Futoshiki each row and column must contain each number from 1 to 8 exactly once.",
