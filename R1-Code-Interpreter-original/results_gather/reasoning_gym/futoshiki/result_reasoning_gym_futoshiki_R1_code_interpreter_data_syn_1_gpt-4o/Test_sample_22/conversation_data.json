    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. The second row has a constraint where the third cell is greater than the fourth cell.\n2. The third row has constraints where the first cell is less than the second cell, and the third cell is greater than the fourth cell.\n3. The fourth row has constraints where the first cell is greater than the second cell, and the fourth cell is greater than the fifth cell.\n4. The vertical constraints are:\n   - The first column has a constraint where the first cell is greater than the second cell.\n   - The second column has a constraint where the second cell is less than the third cell.\n   - The third column has a constraint where the second cell is greater than the third cell.\n   - The fourth column has a constraint where the third cell is greater than the fourth cell.\n   - The fifth column has a constraint where the third cell is greater than the fourth cell.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid. Let's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(5):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n\n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] != 0 and grid[row][col - 1] > num:\n        return False\n    if col < 4 and grid[row][col + 1] != 0 and grid[row][col + 1] < num:\n        return False\n\n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and grid[row - 1][col] != 0 and grid[row - 1][col] > num:\n        return False\n    if row < 4 and grid[row + 1][col] != 0 and grid[row + 1][col] < num:\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(5):\n        for col in range(5):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 6):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with constraints\ngrid = [\n    [0, 4, 2, 0, 0],\n    [3, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution to the puzzle.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the following 5x5 Futoshiki puzzle:\n\n_   4   2   _   _\n    ∨            \n3   _   _ > _   _\n∨   ∧       ∧    \n_   _   _   _   _\n        ∨   ∨    \n_ > 2   _   _ > _\n                 \n_   5   _   _   _\n\nEnsure your answer follows the same format as the puzzle above, just replace blanks (_) with the correct value for the cell and put the answer in triple angle brackets, like this <<<answer to the puzzle>>>.\nUse < and > for horizontal constraints. Use ∧ and ∨ for vertical constraints.\nRemember, in Futoshiki each row and column must contain each number from 1 to 5 exactly once.",
