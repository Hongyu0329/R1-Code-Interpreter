    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also satisfying the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. The first row has a constraint: 3 < _ > _.\n2. The second row has constraints: _ > _ and _ < _.\n3. The third row has constraints: _ > _ < _.\n4.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the following 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle:\n\n_   3 < _ > _\n∧   ∨   ∨    \n_ > _   _   _\n        ∨    \n_   _ > _ < _\n∧            \n_   1   _   _\n\nEnsure your answer follows the same format as the puzzle above, just replace blanks (_) with the correct value for the cell and put the answer in triple angle brackets, like this <<<answer to the puzzle>>>.\nUse < and > for horizontal constraints. Use ∧ and ∨ for vertical constraints.\nRemember, in Futoshiki each row and column must contain each number from 1 to 4 exactly once.",
