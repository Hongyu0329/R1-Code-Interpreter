    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 6, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. Horizontal constraints:\n   - Row 1: _ > _ and 3 < _ < 5\n   - Row 2: _ < 6 and _ < 1\n   - Row 3: _ > 1 and 5 > _ < 4\n   - Row 4: 3 < _ > _ < 6\n   - Row 6: _ > _ < _\n\n2. Vertical constraints:\n   - Column 1: _ ∧ _ ∨ _\n   - Column 3: _ ∧ _ ∨ _\n   - Column 6: _ ∧ _ ∨ _\n\nTo solve this, we can use a backtracking algorithm that tries to fill the grid while respecting the constraints.
