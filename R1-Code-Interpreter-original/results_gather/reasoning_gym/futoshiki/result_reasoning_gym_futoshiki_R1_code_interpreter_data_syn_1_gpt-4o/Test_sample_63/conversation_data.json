    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n- Horizontal constraints: \n  - Row 7, Column 6 > Column 7\n  - Row 8, Column 3 > Column 4\n  - Row 8, Column 4 > Column 5\n  - Row 9, Column 1 > Column 2\n- Vertical constraints:\n  - Column 1, Row 2 ∧ Row 3\n  - Column 5, Row 3 ∨ Row 4\n  - Column 6, Row 5 ∧ Row 6\n  - Column 1, Row 7 ∧ Row 8\n  - Column 8, Row 7 ∧ Row 8\n\nTo solve this, we can use a backtracking algorithm that tries to fill the grid while checking the constraints at each step. If a constraint is violated, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different number.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(8):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n\n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col < 7 and grid[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if grid[row][col + 1] < num:\n            return False\n    if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if grid[row][col - 1] > num:\n            return False\n\n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row < 7 and grid[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if grid[row + 1][col] < num:\n            return False\n    if row > 0 and grid[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if grid[row - 1][col] > num:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(8):\n        for col in range(8):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 9):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 3, 0, 7, 0, 1, 8],\n    [0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 0, 4, 1],\n    [2, 5, 1, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3],\n    [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5],\n    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 7, 0, 0],\n    [0, 8, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7]\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the grid while respecting the constraints.
