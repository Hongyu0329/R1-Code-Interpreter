    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given in the puzzle. The constraints are either horizontal (using < or >) or vertical (using ∧ or ∨).\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this puzzle:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and constraints**: We have some numbers already filled in the grid, and we have inequality constraints between some cells.\n\n2. **Use constraints to limit possibilities**: The constraints help us limit the possible numbers that can go into each cell. For example, if a cell has a constraint that it must be less than its neighbor, we know it cannot be 8.\n\n3. **Apply logic and deduction**: Use logical deduction to fill in the cells. Start with cells that have the most constraints or are easiest to deduce.\n\n4. **Backtracking algorithm**: If necessary, use a backtracking algorithm to try different possibilities and backtrack if a contradiction is found.\n\nLet's implement a Python script to solve this puzzle using a backtracking approach. We'll represent the puzzle as a grid and apply the constraints as we fill in the numbers.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(8):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if (grid[row][col - 1] < num and (row, col - 1, '<') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row][col - 1] > num and (row, col - 1, '>') in constraints):\n            return False\n    if col < 7 and grid[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if (grid[row][col + 1] < num and (row, col, '<') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row][col + 1] > num and (row, col, '>') in constraints):\n            return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and grid[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if (grid[row - 1][col] < num and (row - 1, col, '∧') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row - 1][col] > num and (row - 1, col, '∨') in constraints):\n            return False\n    if row < 7 and grid[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if (grid[row + 1][col] < num and (row, col, '∧') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row + 1][col] > num and (row, col, '∨') in constraints):\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(8):\n        for col in range(8):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 9):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 4, 0],\n    [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 4],\n    [8, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],\n    [0, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2],\n    [0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7],\n    [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n    [0, 4, 0, 5, 1, 0, 6, 3],\n    [0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 3, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints in the form (row, col, type)\nconstraints = {\n    (1, 1, '<'), (2, 2, '∧'), (2, 4, '∧'), (3, 6, '>'), (4, 4, '>'),\n    (5, 0, '∨'), (6, 2, '∧'), (6, 6, '>'), (7, 0, '<'), (7, 5, '<')\n}\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(' '.join(str(num) for num in row))\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle using a backtracking algorithm, respecting the constraints provided.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the following 8x8 Futoshiki puzzle:\n\n_   _   _   2   _   1   4   _\n                             \n_   7 < _   _   _   6   _   4\n                             \n8   6   4   _   _   _   2   _\n        ∧       ∧            \n_   _   5   _   8   _   _ > 2\n                             \n_   3   _   8   _ > _   _   7\n∨                            \n3   _   _   _   _   _   _   8\n        ∧                    \n_   4   _   5   1   _   6 > 3\n                             \n_ < _   _   6   7   3 < _   _\n\nEnsure your answer follows the same format as the puzzle above, just replace blanks (_) with the correct value for the cell and put the answer in triple angle brackets, like this <<<answer to the puzzle>>>.\nUse < and > for horizontal constraints. Use ∧ and ∨ for vertical constraints.\nRemember, in Futoshiki each row and column must contain each number from 1 to 8 exactly once.",
