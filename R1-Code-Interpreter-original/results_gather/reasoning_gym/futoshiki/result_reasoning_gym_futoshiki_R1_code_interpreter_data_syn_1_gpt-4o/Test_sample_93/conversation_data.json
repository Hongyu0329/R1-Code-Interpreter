    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also satisfying the given inequality constraints.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. Row 1: _   _   4 > 3   _\n   - The third cell is 4, and the fourth cell is 3.\n   - The first and second cells need to be filled with numbers 1, 2, or 5.\n\n2. Row 2: 1   _   _ > 2   _\n   - The first cell is 1, and the fourth cell is greater than 2.\n   - The second, third, and fifth cells need to be filled with numbers 3, 4, or 5.\n\n3. Row 3: _   2   _   _   4\n   - The second cell is 2, and the fifth cell is 4.\n   - The first, third, and fourth cells need to be filled with numbers 1, 3, or 5.\n\n4. Row 4: _   3   _   _   _\n   - The second cell is 3.\n   - The first, third, fourth, and fifth cells need to be filled with numbers 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n5. Row 5: _   _   _   _   _\n   - All cells need to be filled with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nVertical constraints:\n- Column 3: The third cell in row 2 is greater than the third cell in row 3.\n- Column 5: The fourth cell in row 3 is less than the fourth cell in row 4.\n\nNow, let's use a Python script to solve this puzzle by trying different combinations and checking the constraints.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid):\n    # Check all rows and columns contain unique numbers from 1 to 5\n    for i in range(5):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 5 or len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 5:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if not (grid[0][2] > grid[0][3]):\n        return False\n    if not (grid[1][2] > grid[1][3]):\n        return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if not (grid[1][2] > grid[2][2]):\n        return False\n    if not (grid[2][4] < grid[3][4]):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki():\n    # Possible numbers for each row\n    row1 = [1, 2, 5]\n    row2 = [3, 4, 5]\n    row3 = [1, 3, 5]\n    row4 = [1, 2, 4, 5]\n    row5 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    \n    # Fixed numbers in the grid\n    grid = [\n        [0, 0, 4, 3, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 2, 0],\n        [0, 2, 0, 0, 4],\n        [0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Try all permutations for each row\n    for perm1 in permutations(row1):\n        grid[0][0], grid[0][1], grid[0][4] = perm1\n        for perm2 in permutations(row2):\n            grid[1][1], grid[1][2], grid[1][4] = perm2\n            for perm3 in permutations(row3):\n                grid[2][0], grid[2][2], grid[2][3] = perm3\n                for perm4 in permutations(row4):\n                    grid[3][0], grid[3][2], grid[3][3], grid[3][4] = perm4\n                    for perm5 in permutations(row5):\n                        grid[4] = list(perm5)\n                        if is_valid(grid):\n                            return grid\n\nsolution = solve_futoshiki()\nfor row in solution:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will try all possible permutations for each row, fill the grid, and check if it satisfies all the constraints.
