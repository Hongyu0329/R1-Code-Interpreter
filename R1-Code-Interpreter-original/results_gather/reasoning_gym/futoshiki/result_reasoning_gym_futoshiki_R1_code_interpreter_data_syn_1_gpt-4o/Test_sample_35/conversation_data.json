    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 4 exactly once. Additionally, we must respect any inequality constraints given in the puzzle. In this case, there are no explicit inequality constraints provided, so we will focus on filling the grid according to the standard rules.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the given puzzle:\n\n```\n_   3   _   _\n             \n_   1   4   _\n             \n3   _   _   _\n             \n4   _   _   _\n```\n\nWe can see that some numbers are already filled in. Our task is to fill in the remaining blanks while ensuring that each number from 1 to 4 appears exactly once in each row and column.\n\nTo solve this systematically, we can use a backtracking algorithm. This involves trying to fill in the grid one cell at a time, checking if the current number placement is valid, and backtracking if we reach an invalid state.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row\n    if num in board[row]:\n        return False\n    # Check if num is not in the current column\n    for r in range(4):\n        if board[r][col] == num:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(board):\n    for row in range(4):\n        for col in range(4):\n            if board[row][col] == 0:  # Empty cell\n                for num in range(1, 5):\n                    if is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n                        board[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(board):\n                            return True\n                        board[row][col] = 0  # Backtrack\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 4, 0],\n    [3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [4, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(board)\nprint(board)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the blanks with numbers from 1 to 4, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a solution to the Futoshiki puzzle. Let's format the solution in the same format as the original puzzle, replacing the blanks with the correct values:\n\n```\n1   3   2   4\n             \n2   1   4   3\n             \n3   4   1   2\n             \n4   2   3   1\n```\n\nThis solution respects the rules of Futoshiki, with each number from 1 to 4 appearing exactly once in each row and column. There were no explicit inequality constraints to consider in this puzzle.\n\n<<<\n1   3   2   4\n             \n2   1   4   3\n             \n3   4   1   2\n             \n4   2   3   1\n>>>"
