    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the missing numbers in the grid while respecting the constraints. Each row and column must contain the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, and we must also respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints**: \n   - The given numbers in the grid.\n   - The inequality constraints (e.g., the vertical constraint between the 5th and 6th rows).\n\n2. **Use a backtracking algorithm**: \n   - This is a common approach for solving constraint satisfaction problems like Futoshiki.\n   - We will try to fill in the grid by placing numbers 1 to 8 in the empty cells, ensuring that each number appears only once per row and column and that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\n3. **Implement the solution**: \n   - We will write a Python script to implement the backtracking algorithm and solve the puzzle.\n\nLet's proceed with the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row\n    if num in board[row]:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if num is not in the current column\n    for r in range(8):\n        if board[r][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check inequality constraints\n    # Vertical constraint between row 5 and 6\n    if row == 4 and col == 4 and num <= board[5][4]:\n        return False\n    if row == 5 and col == 4 and num >= board[4][4]:\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(board):\n    for row in range(8):\n        for col in range(8):\n            if board[row][col] == 0:  # Empty cell\n                for num in range(1, 9):\n                    if is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n                        board[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(board):\n                            return True\n                        board[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [8, 7, 4, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n    [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 3],\n    [1, 5, 0, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 5],\n    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4],\n    [4, 0, 5, 7, 6, 0, 0, 2]\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(board)\n\n# Print the solved board\nfor row in board:\n    print('   '.join(str(num) if num != 0 else '_' for num in row))\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
