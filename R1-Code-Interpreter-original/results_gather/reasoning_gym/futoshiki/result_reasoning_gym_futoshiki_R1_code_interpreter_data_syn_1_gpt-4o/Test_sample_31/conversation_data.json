    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 7 exactly once, while also satisfying the inequality constraints given in the puzzle. The constraints are either horizontal (using < or >) or vertical (using ∧ or ∨).\n\nLet's break down the problem and solve it step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - Horizontal constraints: \n     - Row 2: 4 < _ and 3 > _\n     - Row 3: 5 < _ > 1\n     - Row 4: _ < _\n     - Row 5: _ > 5\n     - Row 6: _ > _\n     - Row 7: _ < 6\n   - Vertical constraints:\n     - Column 2: ∧\n     - Column 4: ∧\n     - Column 5: ∨\n     - Column 6: ∨\n     - Column 7: ∧\n\n2. **Initial setup**: \n   - We have some numbers already filled in: \n     - Row 1: 5\n     - Row 2: 4, 3\n     - Row 3: 3, 5, 1, 7\n     - Row 4: 3\n     - Row 5: 1, 5\n     - Row 6: 4\n     - Row 7: 6, 2\n\n3. **Use constraints to fill in the grid**: \n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to try different combinations of numbers while respecting the constraints.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, constraints):\n    # Check all rows and columns for unique numbers\n    for i in range(7):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 7 or len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 7:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    for (r, c1, c2, op) in constraints['horizontal']:\n        if op == '<' and not (grid[r][c1] < grid[r][c2]):\n            return False\n        if op == '>' and not (grid[r][c1] > grid[r][c2]):\n            return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    for (c, r1, r2, op) in constraints['vertical']:\n        if op == '∧' and not (grid[r1][c] < grid[r2][c]):\n            return False\n        if op == '∨' and not (grid[r1][c] > grid[r2][c]):\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki():\n    # Initial grid with known values\n    grid = [\n        [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 1, 7],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],\n        [0, 0, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Constraints\n    constraints = {\n        'horizontal': [\n            (1, 0, 1, '<'), (1, 2, 3, '>'),\n            (2, 3, 4, '<'), (2, 4, 5, '>'),\n            (3, 3, 4, '<'),\n            (4, 1, 2, '>'), (4, 4, 5, '>'),\n            (5, 0, 1, '>'),\n            (6, 1, 2, '<')\n        ],\n        'vertical': [\n            (1, 0, 1, '∧'),\n            (3, 1, 2, '∧'),\n            (4, 2, 3, '∨'),\n            (5, 3, 4, '∨'),\n            (6, 4, 5, '∧')\n        ]\n    }\n    \n    # Try all permutations for each row\n    for perm1 in permutations(range(1, 8)):\n        grid[0] = list(perm1)\n        for perm2 in permutations(range(1, 8)):\n            if perm2[0] == 4 and perm2[3] == 3:\n                grid[1] = list(perm2)\n                for perm3 in permutations(range(1, 8)):\n                    if perm3[1] == 3 and perm3[3] == 5 and perm3[5] == 1 and perm3[6] == 7:\n                        grid[2] = list(perm3)\n                        for perm4 in permutations(range(1, 8)):\n                            if perm4[5] == 3:\n                                grid[3] = list(perm4)\n                                for perm5 in permutations(range(1, 8)):\n                                    if perm5[0] == 1 and perm5[4] == 5:\n                                        grid[4] = list(perm5)\n                                        for perm6 in permutations(range(1, 8)):\n                                            if perm6[6] == 4:\n                                                grid[5] = list(perm6)\n                                                for perm7 in permutations(range(1, 8)):\n                                                    if perm7[2] == 6 and perm7[3] == 2:\n                                                        grid[6] = list(perm7)\n                                                        if is_valid(grid, constraints):\n                                                            for row in grid:\n                                                                print(row)\n                                                            return\n\nsolve_futoshiki()\n```\n\nThe code will attempt to fill the grid by trying all permutations of numbers 1 to 7 for each row, while checking the constraints.
