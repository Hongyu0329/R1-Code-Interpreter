    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 6 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also satisfying the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. Each row and column must contain the numbers 1 to 6 without repetition.\n2. The inequalities must be respected:\n   - Horizontal inequalities: `>` and `<`\n   - Vertical inequalities: `∧` (greater than) and `∨` (less than)\n\nGiven the constraints, we can use a backtracking algorithm to try different combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy all the conditions. If a combination doesn't work, we backtrack and try a different number.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution to the puzzle.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(6):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal inequalities\n    if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if (grid[row][col - 1] > num and inequalities[row][col - 1] == '<') or \\\n           (grid[row][col - 1] < num and inequalities[row][col - 1] == '>'):\n            return False\n    if col < 5 and grid[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if (grid[row][col + 1] > num and inequalities[row][col] == '>') or \\\n           (grid[row][col + 1] < num and inequalities[row][col] == '<'):\n            return False\n    \n    # Check vertical inequalities\n    if row > 0 and grid[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if (grid[row - 1][col] > num and vertical_inequalities[row - 1][col] == '∨') or \\\n           (grid[row - 1][col] < num and vertical_inequalities[row - 1][col] == '∧'):\n            return False\n    if row < 5 and grid[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if (grid[row + 1][col] > num and vertical_inequalities[row][col] == '∧') or \\\n           (grid[row + 1][col] < num and vertical_inequalities[row][col] == '∨'):\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid, row=0, col=0):\n    if row == 6:\n        return True\n    if col == 6:\n        return solve_futoshiki(grid, row + 1, 0)\n    if grid[row][col] != 0:\n        return solve_futoshiki(grid, row, col + 1)\n    \n    for num in range(1, 7):\n        if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n            grid[row][col] = num\n            if solve_futoshiki(grid, row, col + 1):\n                return True\n            grid[row][col] = 0\n    \n    return False\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 3],\n    [4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n]\n\n# Horizontal inequalities\ninequalities = [\n    ['>', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['<', '', '>', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '>', '', '>', '', ''],\n    ['', '<', '', '', '<', ''],\n    ['', '<', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '<', '', '', '']\n]\n\n# Vertical inequalities\nvertical_inequalities = [\n    ['', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['∧', '', '', '', '∨', '∧'],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '∧'],\n    ['', '', '∧', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '∧', '', '∨', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '']\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThe code will solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the grid with numbers from 1 to 6, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once and that all inequality constraints are satisfied.
