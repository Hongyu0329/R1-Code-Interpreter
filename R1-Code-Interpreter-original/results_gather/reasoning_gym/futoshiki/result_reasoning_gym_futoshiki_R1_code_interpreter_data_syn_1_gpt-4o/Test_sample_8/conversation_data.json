    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 7 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given in the puzzle. The constraints are represented by '<', '>', '∧', and '∨', which indicate that one number must be less than or greater than its neighbor.\n\nLet's break down the problem and solve it step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - The '<' and '>' symbols between numbers indicate that the number on the left is less than or greater than the number on the right, respectively.\n   - The '∧' and '∨' symbols between numbers indicate that the number above is less than or greater than the number below, respectively.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**:\n   - We have a 7x7 grid with some numbers already filled in.\n   - We need to fill in the remaining cells while respecting the constraints.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to try filling in the numbers.\n   - Check if the current number placement is valid by ensuring it doesn't violate any constraints or repeat numbers in any row or column.\n   - If a placement is valid, proceed to the next cell; otherwise, backtrack and try a different number.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to solve the puzzle:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(7):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if grid[row][col - 1] < num and (row, col - 1, '<') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row][col - 1] > num and (row, col - 1, '>') in constraints:\n            return False\n    if col < 6 and grid[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if grid[row][col + 1] < num and (row, col, '<') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row][col + 1] > num and (row, col, '>') in constraints:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and grid[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if grid[row - 1][col] < num and (row - 1, col, '∧') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row - 1][col] > num and (row - 1, col, '∨') in constraints:\n            return False\n    if row < 6 and grid[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if grid[row + 1][col] < num and (row, col, '∧') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if grid[row + 1][col] > num and (row, col, '∨') in constraints:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(7):\n        for col in range(7):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 8):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    [0, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n    [7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 6, 0],\n    [4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [2, 0, 6, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints\nconstraints = {\n    (0, 3, '<'),  # Row 1, Col 4 < Row 1, Col 5\n    (4, 2, '∧')   # Row 5, Col 3 ∧ Row 6, Col 3\n}\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the grid while respecting the constraints.

    "It seems there was an issue with the code execution, as the grid remains unsolved. Let's review the code and identify potential problems:\n\n1. **Constraints Representation**: The constraints were not correctly implemented in the `is_valid` function.
