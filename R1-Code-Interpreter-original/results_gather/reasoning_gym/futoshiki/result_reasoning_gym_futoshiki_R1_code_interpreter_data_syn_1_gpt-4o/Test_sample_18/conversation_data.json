    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 7 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nThe constraints are:\n- Horizontal constraints: `<` and `>` symbols between cells.\n- Vertical constraints: `∧` and `∨` symbols between cells.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and constraints**: \n   - We have some numbers already filled in the grid.\n   - We have inequality constraints between some cells.\n\n2. **Apply constraints**: \n   - Use the constraints to limit the possible numbers for each cell.\n   - For example, if a cell has a `<` constraint with its neighbor, the number in the cell must be less than its neighbor.\n\n3. **Use backtracking to fill the grid**:\n   - Start with the first empty cell and try placing a number that satisfies all constraints.\n   - Move to the next cell and repeat the process.\n   - If a conflict arises, backtrack and try a different number.\n\n4. **Check for solution validity**:\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 7.\n   - Ensure all constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet's implement this logic using Python to find the solution to the puzzle.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(7):\n        if board[row][i] == num or board[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and board[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if board[row][col - 1] < num and (row, col - 1, '<') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if board[row][col - 1] > num and (row, col - 1, '>') in constraints:\n            return False\n    if col < 6 and board[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if board[row][col + 1] < num and (row, col, '<') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if board[row][col + 1] > num and (row, col, '>') in constraints:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and board[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if board[row - 1][col] < num and (row - 1, col, '∧') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if board[row - 1][col] > num and (row - 1, col, '∨') in constraints:\n            return False\n    if row < 6 and board[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if board[row + 1][col] < num and (row, col, '∧') in constraints:\n            return False\n        if board[row + 1][col] > num and (row, col, '∨') in constraints:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(board):\n    for row in range(7):\n        for col in range(7):\n            if board[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 8):\n                    if is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n                        board[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(board):\n                            return True\n                        board[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 3],\n    [6, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],\n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints\nconstraints = {\n    (0, 1, '<'), (0, 3, '>'), (0, 5, '>'),\n    (2, 1, '<'), (2, 3, '∧'), (2, 4, '∧'),\n    (3, 2, '∧'), (3, 3, '<'), (3, 4, '∧'), (3, 5, '∨'),\n    (4, 2, '∨'), (4, 3, '<'), (4, 5, '<'), (4, 6, '∨'),\n    (5, 2, '<'), (5, 5, '∨'),\n    (6, 6, '∧')\n}\n\nsolve_futoshiki(board)\n\n# Print the solved board\nfor row in board:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the grid while respecting the constraints.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the following 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle:\n\n_   _ < _   4 > _   _   3\n                         \n6   7   4   _ < _   _   _\n                         \n_   4 < _   _   1   3   _\n                ∧        \n_   _   _   3 < _   5   _\n        ∨   ∧   ∨        \n_   _   2 < _   _   _ < 6\n        ∨       ∧       ∨\n5   _   _ < _   _   _   _\n                ∨       ∧\n1   6   _   _   _   _   _\n\nEnsure your answer follows the same format as the puzzle above, just replace blanks (_) with the correct value for the cell and put the answer in triple angle brackets, like this <<<answer to the puzzle>>>.\nUse < and > for horizontal constraints. Use ∧ and ∨ for vertical constraints.\nRemember, in Futoshiki each row and column must contain each number from 1 to 7 exactly once.",
