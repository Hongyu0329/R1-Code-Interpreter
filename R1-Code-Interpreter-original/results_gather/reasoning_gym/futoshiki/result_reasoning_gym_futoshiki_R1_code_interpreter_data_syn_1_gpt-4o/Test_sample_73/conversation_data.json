    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 8 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also satisfying the given inequality constraints. The constraints are either horizontal (using < or >) or vertical (using ∧ or ∨).\n\nLet's break down the problem and solve it step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: The constraints are given in the form of inequalities between adjacent cells. We need to ensure that these inequalities are satisfied when filling in the numbers.\n\n2. **Use a backtracking algorithm**: This is a common approach for solving constraint satisfaction problems like Futoshiki. We will try to fill in the grid one cell at a time, backtracking whenever we encounter a conflict.\n\n3. **Check constraints**: As we fill in each cell, we need to check that the current number does not violate any of the constraints, including the inequality constraints and the rule that each number must appear exactly once in each row and column.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check row and column uniqueness\n    for i in range(8):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if (grid[row][col - 1] < num and (row, col - 1, '<') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row][col - 1] > num and (row, col - 1, '>') in constraints):\n            return False\n    if col < 7 and grid[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if (grid[row][col + 1] < num and (row, col, '<') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row][col + 1] > num and (row, col, '>') in constraints):\n            return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and grid[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if (grid[row - 1][col] < num and (row - 1, col, '∧') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row - 1][col] > num and (row - 1, col, '∨') in constraints):\n            return False\n    if row < 7 and grid[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if (grid[row + 1][col] < num and (row, col, '∧') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row + 1][col] > num and (row, col, '∨') in constraints):\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid, row=0, col=0):\n    if row == 8:\n        return True\n    if col == 8:\n        return solve_futoshiki(grid, row + 1, 0)\n    if grid[row][col] != 0:\n        return solve_futoshiki(grid, row, col + 1)\n    \n    for num in range(1, 9):\n        if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n            grid[row][col] = num\n            if solve_futoshiki(grid, row, col + 1):\n                return True\n            grid[row][col] = 0\n    \n    return False\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [0, 7, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 7, 0, 0],\n    [2, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 8, 3, 5],\n    [5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4],\n    [0, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0, 7, 8],\n    [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n    [0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints in the form (row, col, type)\nconstraints = {\n    (0, 5, '>'), (0, 6, '>'), (1, 2, '<'), (1, 4, '<'), (3, 4, '<'), (3, 6, '<'),\n    (4, 3, '<'), (5, 3, '<'), (5, 4, '<'), (6, 6, '<'), (7, 2, '>'), (7, 6, '>')\n}\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the grid while respecting the constraints.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the following 8x8 Futoshiki puzzle:\n\n_   7   _   6   _ > _ > 1   _\n            ∧                \n_   _   _ < 8   _ < 7   _   _\n    ∨                        \n2   1   3   _   _   _   5   _\n        ∨               ∨    \n_   _   _   7   _ < 8   3 < 5\n                             \n5   _   _   3 < _   _   _   4\n∧           ∨   ∨            \n_   _   5   _   3   _   7 < 8\n∧   ∧                        \n_   3   _   _   _   _   _   1\n        ∧                    \n_   _   7 > 5   _   1   _ > _\n\nEnsure your answer follows the same format as the puzzle above, just replace blanks (_) with the correct value for the cell and put the answer in triple angle brackets, like this <<<answer to the puzzle>>>.\nUse < and > for horizontal constraints. Use ∧ and ∨ for vertical constraints.\nRemember, in Futoshiki each row and column must contain each number from 1 to 8 exactly once.",
