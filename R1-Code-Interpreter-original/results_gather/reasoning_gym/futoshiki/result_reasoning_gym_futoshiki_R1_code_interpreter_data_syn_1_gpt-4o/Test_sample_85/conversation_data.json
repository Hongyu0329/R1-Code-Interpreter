    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. The second row has a 5 in the last column.\n2. The third row has a 5 in the third column.\n3. The fourth row is partially filled with 2, 3, and 1 in the second, third, and fourth columns, respectively.\n4. The fifth row has a constraint that the third column is greater than 2.\n5. The vertical constraints between the second and third rows indicate that the third column in the second row is greater than the third column in the third row, and the fourth column in the second row is less than the fourth column in the third row.\n6. The vertical constraints between the fourth and fifth rows indicate that the first column in the fourth row is less than the first column in the fifth row, and the third column in the fourth row is less than the third column in the fifth row.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start filling in the grid. Let's use a Python script to help us find the solution by checking all possible combinations that satisfy the constraints.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define the constraints\ndef check_constraints(grid):\n    # Check row and column uniqueness\n    for i in range(5):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 5 or len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 5:\n            return False\n\n    # Check specific cell values\n    if grid[1][4] != 5 or grid[2][2] != 5 or grid[3][1:4] != [2, 3, 1]:\n        return False\n\n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if not (grid[1][2] > grid[2][2] and grid[1][3] < grid[2][3]):\n        return False\n    if not (grid[3][0] < grid[4][0] and grid[3][2] < grid[4][2]):\n        return False\n\n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if not (grid[4][2] > 2):\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Generate all permutations of numbers 1 to 5\nnumbers = list(range(1, 6))\nall_permutations = list(permutations(numbers))\n\n# Try to fill the grid\nfor row1 in all_permutations:\n    for row2 in all_permutations:\n        for row3 in all_permutations:\n            for row4 in all_permutations:\n                for row5 in all_permutations:\n                    grid = [list(row1), list(row2), list(row3), list(row4), list(row5)]\n                    if check_constraints(grid):\n                        for row in grid:\n                            print(row)\n                        break\n                else:\n                    continue\n                break\n            else:\n                continue\n            break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n```\n\nThe code will generate all possible permutations of numbers 1 to 5 for each row and check if they satisfy the constraints. Once a valid solution is found, it will print the grid. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code I provided attempted to brute-force the solution by checking all permutations of numbers for each row, which is computationally expensive and led to a timeout. Instead, let's use a more efficient backtracking approach to solve the puzzle.\n\nBacktracking will allow us to incrementally build the solution and backtrack when a constraint is violated, which is more efficient than checking all permutations.\n\nLet's implement this approach:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(5):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n\n    # Check specific constraints\n    if row == 1 and col == 4 and num != 5:\n        return False\n    if row == 2 and col == 2 and num != 5:\n        return False\n    if row == 3:\n        if col == 1 and num != 2:\n            return False\n        if col == 2 and num != 3:\n            return False\n        if col == 3 and num != 1:\n            return False\n    if row == 4 and col == 2 and num <= 2:\n        return False\n\n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row == 1 and col == 2 and grid[2][2] != 0 and num <= grid[2][2]:\n        return False\n    if row == 1 and col == 3 and grid[2][3] != 0 and num >= grid[2][3]:\n        return False\n    if row == 3 and col == 0 and grid[4][0] != 0 and num >= grid[4][0]:\n        return False\n    if row == 3 and col == 2 and grid[4][2] != 0 and num >= grid[4][2]:\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid, row=0, col=0):\n    if row == 5:\n        return True\n    if col == 5:\n        return solve_futoshiki(grid, row + 1, 0)\n    if grid[row][col] != 0:\n        return solve_futoshiki(grid, row, col + 1)\n\n    for num in range(1, 6):\n        if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n            grid[row][col] = num\n            if solve_futoshiki(grid, row, col + 1):\n                return True\n            grid[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n    [0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 3, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 2, 3]\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code uses backtracking to fill the grid while respecting the constraints. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
