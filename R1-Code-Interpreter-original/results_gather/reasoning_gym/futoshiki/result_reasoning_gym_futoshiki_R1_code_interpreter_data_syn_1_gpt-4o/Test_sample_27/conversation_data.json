    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 5 exactly once, while also respecting any inequality constraints. The given puzzle is:\n\n```\n3   2   _   _   _\n                 \n_   _   _   _   _\n                 \n5   _   3   _   _\n                 \n_   5   _   2   _\n                 \n_   4   1   _   _\n```\n\nThere are no explicit inequality constraints given in the problem, so we will assume there are none for this particular puzzle. \n\nTo solve this, we can use a backtracking algorithm to try filling in the numbers while checking the constraints. Let's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row\n    if num in board[row]:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if num is not in the current column\n    for r in range(5):\n        if board[r][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(board):\n    for row in range(5):\n        for col in range(5):\n            if board[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 6):\n                    if is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n                        board[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(board):\n                            return True\n                        board[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [3, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [5, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 5, 0, 2, 0],\n    [0, 4, 1, 0, 0]\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(board)\n\n# Print the solved board\nfor row in board:\n    print('   '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the blanks with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears only once per row and column. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a solution to the Futoshiki puzzle. The solution is as follows:\n\n```\n3   2   5   1   4\n4   3   2   5   1\n5   1   3   4   2\n1   5   4   2   3\n2   4   1   3   5\n```\n\nThis solution satisfies the conditions of the Futoshiki puzzle, where each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 5 exactly once. Since there were no explicit inequality constraints provided, the solution is valid under the assumption of no additional constraints.\n\n<<<\n3   2   5   1   4\n4   3   2   5   1\n5   1   3   4   2\n1   5   4   2   3\n2   4   1   3   5\n>>>"
