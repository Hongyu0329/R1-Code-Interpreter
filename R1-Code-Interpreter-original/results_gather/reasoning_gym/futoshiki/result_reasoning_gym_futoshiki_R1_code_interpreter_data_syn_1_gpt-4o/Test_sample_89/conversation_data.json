    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. The first row starts with a 2, and the second cell in the first row must be less than the third cell.\n2. The third column in the second row is 4.\n3. The last cell in the third row is 3.\n4. The first cell in the last row must be less than the second cell.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can use a backtracking algorithm to try different combinations and find a valid solution. Let's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid):\n    # Check all rows and columns for unique values\n    for i in range(4):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 4:\n            return False\n        if len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 4:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check the inequality constraints\n    if not (grid[0][1] < grid[0][2]):  # First row, second cell < third cell\n        return False\n    if not (grid[3][0] < grid[3][1]):  # Last row, first cell < second cell\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki():\n    # Initial grid with known values\n    grid = [\n        [2, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 4, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 3],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Possible numbers to fill in\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    \n    # Try all permutations for each row\n    for perm1 in permutations(numbers):\n        grid[0] = [2] + list(perm1[1:])\n        for perm2 in permutations(numbers):\n            grid[1] = list(perm2)\n            grid[1][2] = 4\n            for perm3 in permutations(numbers):\n                grid[2] = list(perm3)\n                grid[2][3] = 3\n                for perm4 in permutations(numbers):\n                    grid[3] = list(perm4)\n                    if is_valid(grid):\n                        return grid\n\nsolution = solve_futoshiki()\nfor row in solution:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution to the puzzle.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a solution to the Futoshiki puzzle. Let's format the solution according to the original puzzle's layout, including the inequality constraints.\n\nThe solution grid is:\n```\n2   1   3   4\n∨            \n1   3   4   2\n             \n4   2   1   3\n             \n3 < 4   2   1\n```\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\n2   1   3   4\n∨            \n1   3   4   2\n             \n4   2   1   3\n             \n3 < 4   2   1\n>>>"
