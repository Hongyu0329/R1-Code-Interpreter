    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. The third row has a constraint: the third cell must be less than the fourth cell.\n2. The fifth row has a constraint: the fifth cell must be less than the fourth cell.\n3.
