    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. The grid is 5x5.\n2. Each row and column must contain numbers 1 to 5.\n3. There are inequality constraints between some cells.\n\nThe constraints are:\n- Row 1: _ < _ > _ < _\n- Row 2: _ < 4 < _ > _\n- Row 3: _ < 3 < _\n- Row 4: _ > 3   4\n- Row 5: 4 > _\n\nVertical constraints:\n- Between Row 1 and Row 2: ∧\n- Between Row 2 and Row 3: ∨\n- Between Row 3 and Row 4: ∨\n- Between Row 4 and Row 5: ∧\n\nTo solve this, we can use a backtracking algorithm that tries to fill the grid while respecting the constraints. Let's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, constraints):\n    # Check all rows and columns for unique numbers\n    for i in range(5):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 5 or len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 5:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    for (r, c1, c2, op) in constraints['horizontal']:\n        if op == '<' and not (grid[r][c1] < grid[r][c2]):\n            return False\n        if op == '>' and not (grid[r][c1] > grid[r][c2]):\n            return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    for (c, r1, r2, op) in constraints['vertical']:\n        if op == '∧' and not (grid[r1][c] < grid[r2][c]):\n            return False\n        if op == '∨' and not (grid[r1][c] > grid[r2][c]):\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki():\n    # Define the constraints\n    constraints = {\n        'horizontal': [\n            (0, 0, 1, '<'), (0, 1, 2, '>'), (0, 2, 3, '<'), (0, 3, 4, '>'),\n            (1, 0, 1, '<'), (1, 1, 2, '<'), (1, 2, 3, '>'),\n            (2, 1, 2, '<'), (2, 2, 3, '<'),\n            (3, 0, 1, '>'),\n            (4, 0, 1, '>')\n        ],\n        'vertical': [\n            (0, 0, 1, '∧'),\n            (1, 1, 2, '∨'),\n            (2, 2, 3, '∨'),\n            (3, 3, 4, '∧')\n        ]\n    }\n    \n    # Try all permutations of numbers 1 to 5 for each row\n    for perm1 in permutations(range(1, 6)):\n        for perm2 in permutations(range(1, 6)):\n            for perm3 in permutations(range(1, 6)):\n                for perm4 in permutations(range(1, 6)):\n                    for perm5 in permutations(range(1, 6)):\n                        grid = [list(perm1), list(perm2), list(perm3), list(perm4), list(perm5)]\n                        if is_valid(grid, constraints):\n                            return grid\n\nsolution = solve_futoshiki()\nfor row in solution:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to solve the Futoshiki puzzle by trying all permutations of numbers 1 to 5 for each row and checking if the grid satisfies all constraints.

    "The timeout error suggests that the current approach of trying all permutations is inefficient for this problem size due to the large number of possibilities.
