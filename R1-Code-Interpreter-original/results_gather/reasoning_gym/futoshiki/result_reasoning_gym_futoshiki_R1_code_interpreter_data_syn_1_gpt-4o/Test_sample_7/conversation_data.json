    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also satisfying the inequality constraints.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. The fourth column has a fixed number 1 in the first row and 3 in the third row.\n2. The first row has a fixed number 4 in the fifth column.\n3. There is a vertical constraint between the first and second rows in the fifth column (∧), meaning the number in the first row must be greater than the number in the second row.\n4. There is a horizontal constraint in the second row between the first and second columns (>), meaning the number in the first column must be greater than the number in the second column.\n5. There is a horizontal constraint in the third row between the second and third columns (>), meaning the number in the second column must be greater than the number in the third column.\n6. There is a vertical constraint between the fourth and fifth rows in the first column (∨), meaning the number in the fourth row must be less than the number in the fifth row.\n7. There is a horizontal constraint in the fourth row between the fourth and fifth columns (>), meaning the number in the fourth column must be greater than the number in the fifth column.\n8. There is a horizontal constraint in the fifth row between the second and third columns (>), meaning the number in the second column must be greater than the number in the third column.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid.
