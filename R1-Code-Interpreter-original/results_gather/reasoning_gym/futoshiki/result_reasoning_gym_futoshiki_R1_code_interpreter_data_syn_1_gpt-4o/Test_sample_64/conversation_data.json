    "To solve the 6x6 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 6 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. Row 1: _ < _   _   2 < 4   _\n2. Row 2: _   _   _   _ > _   _\n3. Row 3: _   4   _   5   _   _\n4. Row 4: _   6   3 > _ < _   _\n5. Row 5: _   _   6   _   3   5\n6. Row 6: _ > _   5   _   _   4\n\nVertical constraints:\n- Between Row 5 and Row 6, column 1: Row 5 < Row 6\n- Between Row 5 and Row 6, column 2: Row 5 < Row 6\n\nTo solve this, we can use a backtracking algorithm that tries to fill the grid while respecting the constraints.
