    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 8 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nThe constraints are:\n- Row 2, Column 2 is greater than Row 2, Column 3.\n- Row 3, Column 8 is greater than Row 4, Column 8.\n\nLet's start by setting up the initial grid and constraints, and then use a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle. We'll use Python to implement this solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(8):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n\n    # Check the inequality constraints\n    if row == 1 and col == 1 and grid[row][col + 1] != 0 and num <= grid[row][col + 1]:\n        return False\n    if row == 2 and col == 7 and grid[row + 1][col] != 0 and num <= grid[row + 1][col]:\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(8):\n        for col in range(8):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 9):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 6, 8],\n    [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 2],\n    [8, 0, 3, 0, 7, 1, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 8, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 0, 7],\n    [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n    [0, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code sets up the initial grid and uses a backtracking algorithm to fill in the numbers while respecting the constraints.
