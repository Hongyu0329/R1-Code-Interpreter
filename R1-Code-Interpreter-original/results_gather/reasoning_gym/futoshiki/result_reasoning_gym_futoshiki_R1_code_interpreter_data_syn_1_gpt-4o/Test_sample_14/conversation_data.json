    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints and the given numbers:\n\n1. The first row has a '1' in the last column.\n2. The third row has '2' in the second column and '4' in the last column.\n3. The fourth row has '1' in the first column and '4' in the third column.\n4. There is a vertical constraint (∧) between the third and fourth rows in the second column, meaning the number in the third row, second column must be greater than the number in the fourth row, second column.\n\nWe will use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid while respecting these constraints. Let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(4):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check the inequality constraints\n    if row == 2 and col == 1 and grid[3][1] != 0 and not (num > grid[3][1]):\n        return False\n    if row == 3 and col == 1 and grid[2][1] != 0 and not (grid[2][1] > num):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(4):\n        for col in range(4):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 5):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 1],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 4],\n    [1, 0, 4, 0]\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\nprint(grid)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to fill the grid while respecting the constraints and print the completed grid. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "It seems there was an issue with the code execution, as the output did not change from the initial grid.
