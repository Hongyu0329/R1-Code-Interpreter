    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 6 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.

    "The error indicates that the `solve_futoshiki` function returned `None`, meaning it didn't find a valid solution. This could be due to the constraints or the way permutations are being applied.
