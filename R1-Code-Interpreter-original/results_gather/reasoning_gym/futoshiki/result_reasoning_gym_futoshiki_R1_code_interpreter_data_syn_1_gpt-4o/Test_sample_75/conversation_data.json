    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also satisfying the inequality constraints.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. The first row has constraints: 5 > _ > _ 3 _\n2. The second row has constraints: _ > _ _ _ _\n3. The third row has constraints: _ _ > 3 _ > _\n4. The fourth row has constraints: _ < _ _ _ _\n5. The fifth row has constraints: _ 1 < _ _ _\n\nVertical constraints:\n- Between the first and second row: ∧ ∧\n- Between the second and third row: ∧\n- Between the third and fourth row: ∨ ∧\n- Between the fourth and fifth row: ∧\n\nTo solve this, we can use a backtracking algorithm that tries to fill the grid while checking the constraints. If a constraint is violated, it backtracks and tries a different number.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(5):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n\n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and grid[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if (grid[row][col - 1] > num and (row, col - 1, '>') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row][col - 1] < num and (row, col - 1, '<') in constraints):\n            return False\n    if col < 4 and grid[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if (grid[row][col + 1] < num and (row, col, '>') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row][col + 1] > num and (row, col, '<') in constraints):\n            return False\n\n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and grid[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if (grid[row - 1][col] > num and (row - 1, col, '∧') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row - 1][col] < num and (row - 1, col, '∨') in constraints):\n            return False\n    if row < 4 and grid[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if (grid[row + 1][col] < num and (row, col, '∧') in constraints) or \\\n           (grid[row + 1][col] > num and (row, col, '∨') in constraints):\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(5):\n        for col in range(5):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 6):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [5, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Constraints in the form (row, col, type)\nconstraints = [\n    (0, 0, '>'), (0, 1, '>'), (0, 3, '>'),\n    (1, 0, '>'),\n    (2, 1, '>'), (2, 3, '>'),\n    (3, 0, '<'),\n    (4, 1, '<'),\n    (0, 0, '∧'), (0, 1, '∧'),\n    (1, 2, '∧'),\n    (2, 0, '∨'), (2, 1, '∧'),\n    (3, 4, '∧')\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\n\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the grid while respecting the constraints.
