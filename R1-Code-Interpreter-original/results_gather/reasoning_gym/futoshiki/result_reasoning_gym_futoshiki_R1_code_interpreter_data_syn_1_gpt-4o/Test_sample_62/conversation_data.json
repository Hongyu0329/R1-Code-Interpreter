    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 8 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nThe constraints are:\n- Horizontal constraints: `<` and `>`\n- Vertical constraints: `∧` and `∨`\n\nThe approach to solve this puzzle involves:\n1. Filling in the grid with numbers from 1 to 8 while respecting the constraints.\n2.
