    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 9 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given in the puzzle. The constraints are represented by '<', '>', '∧', and '∨', which indicate that one number must be less than or greater than its neighbor.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this puzzle:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints**: \n   - Horizontal constraints are given by '<' and '>'.\n   - Vertical constraints are given by '∧' and '∨'.\n\n2. **Fill in the known numbers**: \n   - Start by filling in the numbers that are already provided in the puzzle.\n\n3. **Apply constraints**: \n   - Use the constraints to limit the possible numbers that can go into each cell.\n\n4. **Use backtracking**: \n   - If a cell has multiple possibilities, use backtracking to try each possibility and see if it leads to a solution.\n\n5. **Check for consistency**: \n   - Ensure that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 9.\n\nLet's implement a Python script to solve this puzzle using backtracking and constraint satisfaction.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(9):\n        if board[row][i] == num or board[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n\n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and board[row][col - 1] != 0:\n        if board[row][col - 1] < num and '<' in constraints[row][col - 1]:\n            return False\n        if board[row][col - 1] > num and '>' in constraints[row][col - 1]:\n            return False\n    if col < 8 and board[row][col + 1] != 0:\n        if board[row][col + 1] < num and '>' in constraints[row][col]:\n            return False\n        if board[row][col + 1] > num and '<' in constraints[row][col]:\n            return False\n\n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and board[row - 1][col] != 0:\n        if board[row - 1][col] < num and '∧' in constraints[row - 1][col]:\n            return False\n        if board[row - 1][col] > num and '∨' in constraints[row - 1][col]:\n            return False\n    if row < 8 and board[row + 1][col] != 0:\n        if board[row + 1][col] < num and '∨' in constraints[row][col]:\n            return False\n        if board[row + 1][col] > num and '∧' in constraints[row][col]:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(board):\n    for row in range(9):\n        for col in range(9):\n            if board[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 10):\n                    if is_valid(board, row, col, num):\n                        board[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(board):\n                            return True\n                        board[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [8, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 5, 0],\n    [0, 0, 5, 3, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 6, 4, 3, 2, 0, 0, 5],\n    [0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 1, 9, 6, 4],\n    [7, 9, 0, 0, 1, 4, 5, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 5, 3, 9, 8],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0],\n    [0, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2]\n]\n\n# Constraints setup\nconstraints = [\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '∧', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '∧', '∨', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(board)\n\nfor row in board:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will solve the Futoshiki puzzle by filling in the blanks while respecting the constraints.
