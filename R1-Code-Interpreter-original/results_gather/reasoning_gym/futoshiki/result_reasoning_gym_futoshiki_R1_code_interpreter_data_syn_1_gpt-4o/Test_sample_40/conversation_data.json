    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. The first row has numbers 1 and 2 already placed, and the third and fourth cells are empty.\n2. The second row has a constraint that the first cell is greater than the second cell, and the third cell is 3.\n3. The fourth row has a constraint that the second cell is 4, and the third cell is less than the fourth cell.\n\nWe will use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid while respecting the constraints. Let's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid):\n    # Check all rows and columns for unique numbers\n    for i in range(4):\n        if len(set(grid[i])) != 4 or len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 4:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check inequality constraints\n    if not (grid[0][1] < grid[1][1]):  # 2 < _\n        return False\n    if not (grid[1][0] > grid[1][1]):  # _ > _\n        return False\n    if not (grid[3][2] < grid[3][3]):  # _ < _\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki():\n    # Initial grid with known values\n    grid = [\n        [1, 2, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 3, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 4, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Generate all permutations of numbers 1 to 4\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    perms = list(permutations(numbers))\n    \n    # Try all permutations for each row\n    for perm1 in perms:\n        grid[0][2], grid[0][3] = perm1[2], perm1[3]\n        for perm2 in perms:\n            grid[1][0], grid[1][1], grid[1][3] = perm2[0], perm2[1], perm2[3]\n            for perm3 in perms:\n                grid[2] = list(perm3)\n                for perm4 in perms:\n                    grid[3][0], grid[3][2], grid[3][3] = perm4[0], perm4[2], perm4[3]\n                    if is_valid(grid):\n                        return grid\n\nsolution = solve_futoshiki()\nfor row in solution:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the solution to the puzzle.",
    "The error indicates that the `solve_futoshiki` function returned `None`, which means the function did not find a valid solution. This could be due to an oversight in the permutation application or constraint checking logic. Let's review and adjust the code to ensure it correctly applies permutations and checks constraints.\n\n1. Ensure that the permutations are applied correctly to the grid.\n2.
