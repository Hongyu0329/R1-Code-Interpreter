    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n1. The second row has a '3' in the last column and a '4' in the third column.\n2. The third row has a '4' in the second column and a '1' in the third column, with a vertical constraint indicating that the number below the '1' is greater.\n3. The fourth row has a '4' in the fourth column, with a vertical constraint indicating that the number below it is greater.\n4. The fifth row has a '1' in the first column and a '3' in the third column.\n\nThe constraints are:\n- Row 2, Column 3 (4) is greater than Row 3, Column 3 (1).\n- Row 3, Column 2 (4) is greater than Row 4, Column 2.\n- Row 4, Column 4 (4) is less than Row 5, Column 4.\n\nWe will use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid while respecting these constraints.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef is_valid(grid, constraints):\n    for (r1, c1, r2, c2) in constraints:\n        if not (grid[r1][c1] > grid[r2][c2]):\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki():\n    # Initial grid with known values\n    grid = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 4, 0, 3],\n        [0, 4, 1, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 4, 0],\n        [1, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Constraints: (row1, col1, row2, col2) means grid[row1][col1] > grid[row2][col2]\n    constraints = [\n        (1, 2, 2, 2),  # 4 > 1\n        (2, 1, 3, 1),  # 4 > ?\n        (3, 3, 4, 3)   # 4 < ?\n    ]\n    \n    # Possible numbers to fill in\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    \n    # Try all permutations for each row\n    for perm1 in permutations(numbers):\n        if perm1[2] != 4:  # Row 2, Column 3 must be 4\n            continue\n        if perm1[4] != 3:  # Row 2, Column 5 must be 3\n            continue\n        grid[1] = perm1\n        \n        for perm2 in permutations(numbers):\n            if perm2[1] != 4:  # Row 3, Column 2 must be 4\n                continue\n            if perm2[2] != 1:  # Row 3, Column 3 must be 1\n                continue\n            grid[2] = perm2\n            \n            for perm3 in permutations(numbers):\n                if perm3[3] != 4:  # Row 4, Column 4 must be 4\n                    continue\n                grid[3] = perm3\n                \n                for perm4 in permutations(numbers):\n                    if perm4[0] != 1:  # Row 5, Column 1 must be 1\n                        continue\n                    if perm4[2] != 3:  # Row 5, Column 3 must be 3\n                        continue\n                    grid[4] = perm4\n                    \n                    # Check if the grid satisfies all constraints\n                    if is_valid(grid, constraints):\n                        return grid\n\nsolution = solve_futoshiki()\nfor row in solution:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the solution to the puzzle.",
