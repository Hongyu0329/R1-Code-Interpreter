    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints provided.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. The first row has a '3' in the first column and a '>' constraint between the third and fourth columns.\n2. The second row has a '∨' constraint between the first and second columns.\n3. The third row has a '2' in the second column and a '<' constraint between the second and third columns.\n4. The fourth row has a '∨' constraint between the first and second columns and a '∧' constraint between the second and third columns. It also has a '2' in the third column and a '3' in the fourth column.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start filling in the grid by trial and error, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet's use Python to help us solve this puzzle by checking all possible combinations that satisfy the constraints.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define the constraints\ndef check_constraints(grid):\n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if not (grid[0][2] > grid[0][3]):  # 3rd column > 4th column in the first row\n        return False\n    if not (grid[2][1] < grid[2][2]):  # 2nd column < 3rd column in the third row\n        return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if not (grid[0][0] < grid[1][0]):  # 1st row < 2nd row in the first column\n        return False\n    if not (grid[2][0] < grid[3][0]):  # 3rd row < 4th row in the first column\n        return False\n    if not (grid[3][1] > grid[2][1]):  # 4th row > 3rd row in the second column\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try all permutations for each row\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nfor row1 in permutations(numbers):\n    if row1[0] != 3:  # First row, first column must be 3\n        continue\n    for row2 in permutations(numbers):\n        for row3 in permutations(numbers):\n            if row3[1] != 2:  # Third row, second column must be 2\n                continue\n            for row4 in permutations(numbers):\n                if row4[2] != 2 or row4[3] != 3:  # Fourth row, third column must be 2 and fourth column must be 3\n                    continue\n                # Form the grid\n                grid = [row1, row2, row3, row4]\n                # Check if the grid satisfies all constraints\n                if check_constraints(grid):\n                    for row in grid:\n                        print(row)\n                    break\n```\n\nThe code will output the solution to the Futoshiki puzzle by checking all permutations of numbers 1 to 4 for each row and ensuring that all constraints are satisfied. Let's execute the code to find the solution."
