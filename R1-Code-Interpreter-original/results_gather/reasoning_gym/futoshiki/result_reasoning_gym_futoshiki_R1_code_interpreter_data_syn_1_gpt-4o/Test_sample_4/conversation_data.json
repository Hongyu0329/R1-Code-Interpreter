    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 6 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nThe constraints given are:\n- The first row has a '>' constraint between the third and fourth cells.\n- The third row has a '∧' constraint between the third and fourth cells.\n\nLet's break down the problem and solve it step by step. We will use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid while respecting the constraints.\n\nHere's the initial grid with constraints:\n\n```\n_   _ > _   _   3   1\n                     \n_   _   5   _   _   _\n                     \n_   _   2   _   _   _\n            ∧        \n5   _   3   2   6   _\n                     \n_   _   _   5   1   _\n                     \n4   _   _   _   _   _\n```\n\nWe will use Python to implement the backtracking algorithm to solve this puzzle.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(6):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check inequality constraints\n    if row == 0 and col == 2 and grid[row][col + 1] != 0 and not (num > grid[row][col + 1]):\n        return False\n    if row == 0 and col == 3 and grid[row][col - 1] != 0 and not (grid[row][col - 1] > num):\n        return False\n    if row == 2 and col == 2 and grid[row + 1][col] != 0 and not (num < grid[row + 1][col]):\n        return False\n    if row == 3 and col == 2 and grid[row - 1][col] != 0 and not (grid[row - 1][col] < num):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(6):\n        for col in range(6):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 7):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1],\n    [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n    [5, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 0],\n    [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code will fill in the grid while respecting the constraints and ensuring each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 6 exactly once.
