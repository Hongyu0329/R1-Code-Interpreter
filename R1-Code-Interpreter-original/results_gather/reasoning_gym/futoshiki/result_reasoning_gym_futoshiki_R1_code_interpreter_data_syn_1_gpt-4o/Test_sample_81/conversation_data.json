    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints.\n\nLet's break down the given puzzle:\n\n```\n4   _   _   _\n             \n3   _   _   2\n             \n_   _   _   _\n    ∨   ∧    \n_   _   3   _\n```\n\nThe constraints are:\n- The second column of the third row is greater than the second column of the fourth row (∧).\n- The third column of the third row is less than the third column of the fourth row (∨).\n\nWe will use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid while respecting these constraints. Let's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check if num is not in the current row and column\n    for i in range(4):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check inequality constraints\n    if row == 2 and col == 1 and grid[3][1] != 0 and not (num > grid[3][1]):\n        return False\n    if row == 3 and col == 1 and grid[2][1] != 0 and not (grid[2][1] > num):\n        return False\n    if row == 2 and col == 2 and grid[3][2] != 0 and not (num < grid[3][2]):\n        return False\n    if row == 3 and col == 2 and grid[2][2] != 0 and not (grid[2][2] < num):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid):\n    for row in range(4):\n        for col in range(4):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 5):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid with 0 representing empty cells\ngrid = [\n    [4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [3, 0, 0, 2],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 3, 0]\n]\n\nsolve_futoshiki(grid)\nprint(grid)\n```\n\nThis code will fill in the grid while respecting the Futoshiki rules and constraints. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a solution to the Futoshiki puzzle. Let's format the solution according to the original puzzle layout, replacing the blanks with the correct values and including the inequality constraints.\n\nGiven the solution from the code output:\n\n```\n[[4, 3, 2, 1],\n [3, 1, 4, 2],\n [2, 4, 1, 3],\n [1, 2, 3, 4]]\n```\n\nWe can format it as follows:\n\n```\n4   3   2   1\n             \n3   1   4   2\n             \n2   4   1   3\n    ∨   ∧    \n1   2   3   4\n```\n\nThis solution respects all the Futoshiki rules and constraints. Here is the final answer:\n\n<<<\n4   3   2   1\n             \n3   1   4   2\n             \n2   4   1   3\n    ∨   ∧    \n1   2   3   4\n>>>"
