    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 6, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's break down the constraints and the given numbers:\n\n1. The grid is 6x6.\n2. Each row and column must contain numbers 1 to 6.\n3. There are inequality constraints between some cells.\n\nGiven the constraints, we can use a backtracking algorithm to try different combinations of numbers while respecting the constraints. If a combination doesn't work, we backtrack and try a different number.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Initial grid with constraints\ngrid = [\n    [0, 3, 0, 6, 5, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 6],\n    [0, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n    [0, 5, 6, 3, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Inequality constraints\nhorizontal_constraints = [\n    [None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, '>'],\n    [None, None, None, None, None],\n    ['>', None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None]\n]\n\nvertical_constraints = [\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None],\n    [None, None, None, None, None, None]\n]\n\n# Add vertical constraints\nvertical_constraints[2][5] = '>'\nvertical_constraints[4][1] = '<'\n\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n    # Check row and column uniqueness\n    for i in range(6):\n        if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and horizontal_constraints[row][col - 1]:\n        if horizontal_constraints[row][col - 1] == '>' and not (grid[row][col - 1] > num):\n            return False\n        if horizontal_constraints[row][col - 1] == '<' and not (grid[row][col - 1] < num):\n            return False\n    if col < 5 and horizontal_constraints[row][col]:\n        if horizontal_constraints[row][col] == '>' and not (num > grid[row][col + 1]):\n            return False\n        if horizontal_constraints[row][col] == '<' and not (num < grid[row][col + 1]):\n            return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and vertical_constraints[row - 1][col]:\n        if vertical_constraints[row - 1][col] == '>' and not (grid[row - 1][col] > num):\n            return False\n        if vertical_constraints[row - 1][col] == '<' and not (grid[row - 1][col] < num):\n            return False\n    if row < 5 and vertical_constraints[row][col]:\n        if vertical_constraints[row][col] == '>' and not (num > grid[row + 1][col]):\n            return False\n        if vertical_constraints[row][col] == '<' and not (num < grid[row + 1][col]):\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve(grid):\n    for row in range(6):\n        for col in range(6):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 7):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\nsolve(grid)\n\n# Print the solved grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution to the Futoshiki puzzle.",
