    "\nassistant > To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once.

However, I can solve the puzzle manually by applying logical reasoning and constraints.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have the following initial numbers and constraints:\n     - Row 3: _ 1 _ 5 4\n     - Row 5: 1 _ _ _ _\n     - Column 1: 2 _ _ _ _\n     - Horizontal constraints: (0,3) < (0,4), (2,1) < (2,2), (4,3) > (4,4)\n     - Vertical constraints: (0,3) < (1,3), (1,0) < (2,0), (2,1) < (3,1)\n\n2. **Filling in the grid:**\n   - Start with the given numbers and apply the constraints to deduce the missing numbers.\n\nLet's fill in the grid:\n\n```\n_   _   _   3 < 5\n                ∨\n_   _   _   _   _\n∨                \n2   _ < _   _   _\n    ∨            \n_   1   _   5   4\n                 \n1   _   _   _ > _\n```\n\n- **Row 3**: The numbers 1, 5, and 4 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 2 and 3. Since (2,1) < (2,2), we place 2 in (2,0) and 3 in (2,2).\n- **Row 5**: The number 1 is already placed. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, 4, and 5. Since (4,3) > (4,4), we place 5 in (4,3) and 4 in (4,4). The remaining numbers 2 and 3 can be placed in (4,1) and (4,2) respectively.\n- **Column 1**: The numbers 2 and 1 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 3, 4, and 5. Since (1,0) < (2,0), we place 3 in (1,0) and 4 in (0,0).\n- **Column 2**: The number 1 is already placed. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, 4, and 5. Since (2,1) < (3,1), we place 2 in (2,1) and 3 in (1,1).\n- **Column 3**: The numbers 1 and 5 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 4. We place 2 in (0,2), 3 in (1,2), and 4 in (4,2).\n- **Column 4**: The numbers 3 and 5 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 4. We place 1 in (0,3), 2 in (1,3), and 4 in (2,3).\n- **Column 5**: The numbers 4 and 5 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 3. We place 1 in (0,4), 2 in (1,4), and 3 in (2,4).\n\nThe completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n4   2   1   3 < 5\n                ∨\n3   5   4   2   1\n∨                \n2   3 < 5   1   4\n    ∨            \n5   1   3   5   4\n                 \n1   4   2   5 > 3\n```\n\nLet's format the solution as requested:\n\n```\n<<<\n4   2   1   3 < 5\n                ∨\n3   5   4   2   1\n∨                \n2   3 < 5   1   4\n    ∨            \n5   1   3   5   4\n                 \n1   4   2   5 > 3\n>>>\n```"
