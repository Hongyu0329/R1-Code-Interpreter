    "\nassistant > To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once.

However, I can solve the puzzle manually by applying logical reasoning and constraints.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Row 1**: We have 5, _, 2, _, 4. The missing numbers are 1 and 3. Since 1 cannot be in the second position (as it would violate the constraint in Row 2), it must be in the fourth position. Thus, Row 1 becomes: 5, 3, 2, 1, 4.\n\n2. **Row 2**: We have 2, _, _, 1 < _. The missing numbers are 3, 4, and 5. Since 1 is less than the number in the fifth position, it must be 5. Thus, Row 2 becomes: 2, 5, 4, 1, 3.\n\n3. **Row 3**: We have 4, _, 3, _, _. The missing numbers are 1, 2, and 5. Since 3 is less than the number in the fourth position, it must be 5. Thus, Row 3 becomes: 4, 1, 3, 5, 2.\n\n4. **Row 4**: We have _, _, _, _, _. The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. By checking the columns and constraints, Row 4 becomes: 3, 4, 1, 2, 5.\n\n5. **Row 5**: We have _, _, 4, 5, _. The missing numbers are 1, 2, and 3. By checking the columns and constraints, Row 5 becomes: 1, 2, 4, 5, 3.\n\nThe completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n5   3   2   1   4\n2   5   4   1 < 3\n4   1   3   5   2\n3   4   1   2   5\n1   2   4   5   3\n```\n\nLet's format the answer as requested.\nassistant > Here is the solution to the Futoshiki puzzle:\n\n```\n5   3   2   1   4\n                 \n2   5   4   1 < 3\n                 \n4   1   3   5   2\n            ∧    \n3   4   1   2   5\n                 \n1   2   4   5   3\n```\n\nIn the required format:\n\n<<<\n5   3   2   1   4\n                 \n2   5   4   1 < 3\n                 \n4   1   3   5   2\n            ∧    \n3   4   1   2   5\n                 \n1   2   4   5   3\n>>>"
