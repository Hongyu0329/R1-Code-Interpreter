However, I can solve the puzzle manually by applying logical reasoning and constraints.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Row 1**: _ < _   1   _   _\n   - The third column is 1.\n   - The first two numbers must satisfy the inequality constraint.\n\n2. **Row 2**: _   _   _   _ < 3\n   - The last number must be greater than the fourth number.\n\n3. **Row 3**: 3 > _   _   1   _\n   - The first number is 3.\n   - The fourth number is 1.\n\n4. **Row 4**: _   _ > _   _   _\n   - The second number is greater than the third number.\n\n5. **Row 5**: _   _ > _   _   _\n   - The second number is greater than the third number.\n\n6. **Column 2**: ∧\n   - The first number is greater than the second number.\n\n7. **Column 4**: ∧\n   - The third number is greater than the fourth number.\n\n8. **Column 3**: ∨\n   - The fourth number is less than the fifth number.\n\nBy applying these constraints and ensuring each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 5, we can solve the puzzle. Let's fill in the grid:\n\n```\n2 < 4   1   5   3\n        ∧        \n5   1   4   2 < 3\n                 \n3 > 2   5   1   4\n                 \n4   3 > 2   5   1\n        ∧   ∨    \n1   5 > 3   4   2\n```\n\nThus, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n2 < 4   1   5   3\n        ∧        \n5   1   4   2 < 3\n                 \n3 > 2   5   1   4\n                 \n4   3 > 2   5   1\n        ∧   ∨    \n1   5 > 3   4   2\n>>>"
