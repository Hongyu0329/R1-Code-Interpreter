    "\nassistant > To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom ortools.sat.python import cp_model\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = cp_model.CpModel()\n\n# Define the size of the puzzle\nsize = 4\n\n# Create the variables\ngrid = [[model.NewIntVar(1, size, f'cell_{i}_{j}') for j in range(size)] for i in range(size)]\n\n# Add the constraints for each row and column to have all different values\nfor i in range(size):\n    model.AddAllDifferent([grid[i][j] for j in range(size)])\n    model.AddAllDifferent([grid[j][i] for j in range(size)])\n\n# Add the given numbers\nmodel.Add(grid[0][2] == 3)\nmodel.Add(grid[0][3] == 2)\nmodel.Add(grid[2][1] == 2)\nmodel.Add(grid[2][3] == 3)\nmodel.Add(grid[3][1] == 1)\n\n# Add the inequality constraints\nmodel.Add(grid[1][0] < grid[1][1])\nmodel.Add(grid[1][2] < grid[1][3])\nmodel.Add(grid[1][2] > grid[2][2])\n\n# Create the solver and solve\nsolver = cp_model.CpSolver()\nstatus = solver.Solve(model)\n\n# Extract the solution\nsolution = []\nif status == cp_model.FEASIBLE or status == cp_model.OPTIMAL:\n    for i in range(size):\n        solution.append([solver.Value(grid[i][j]) for j in range(size)])\n\nsolution\nassistant > It seems that the required library for solving the Futoshiki puzzle programmatically is not available in this environment. However, I can solve the puzzle manually.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\nGiven:\n```\n_   _   3   2\n             \n_ < _   _   _\n        ∨    \n_   2   _   3\n             \n_   1   _   _\n```\n\n1. The third row has a 2 in the second column and a 3 in the fourth column. The only numbers left for the first and third columns are 1 and 4. Since the third column must be greater than the second column (2), the third column must be 4, and the first column must be 1.\n\n2. The fourth row has a 1 in the second column. The only numbers left for the first, third, and fourth columns are 2, 3, and 4. Since the fourth column must be greater than the third column, the fourth column must be 4, and the third column must be 3. This leaves 2 for the first column.\n\n3. The first row has a 3 in the third column and a 2 in the fourth column. The only numbers left for the first and second columns are 1 and 4. Since the second column must be greater than the first column, the second column must be 4, and the first column must be 1.\n\n4. The second row has constraints: the first column is less than the second column, and the third column is less than the fourth column. The only numbers left for the first, second, third, and fourth columns are 1, 3, 4, and 1. The only way to satisfy the constraints is to have 1 in the first column, 3 in the second column, 4 in the third column, and 1 in the fourth column.\n\nThe completed puzzle is:\n```\n1   4   3   2\n             \n1 < 3   4   1\n        ∨    \n1   2   4   3\n             \n2   1   3   4\n```\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n<<<\n1   4   3   2\n             \n1 < 3   4   1\n        ∨    \n1   2   4   3\n             \n2   1   3   4\n>>>"
