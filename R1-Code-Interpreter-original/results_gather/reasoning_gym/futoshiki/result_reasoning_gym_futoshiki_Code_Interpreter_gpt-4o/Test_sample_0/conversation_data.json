    "\nassistant > To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once.

However, I can solve the puzzle manually by considering the constraints and logic.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The first cell in the first row is given as 3.\n   - The last cell in the last row is given as 3.\n   - The third cell in the last row is given as 2.\n\n2. **Applying Constraints:**\n   - The first row has a constraint: the third cell is greater than the fourth cell.\n   - The third row has a constraint: the second cell is less than the third cell.\n   - The second column has a constraint: the second cell is greater than the third cell.\n   - The first column has a constraint: the third cell is greater than the fourth cell.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - Start with the known values and apply the constraints to fill in the rest of the grid.\n\nLet's fill in the grid:\n\n```\n3   1   4 > 2\n∨            \n2   3   1   4\n    ∨        \n4   2 < 3   1\n∨   ∧        \n1   4   2   3\n```\n\nNow, let's format the solution as requested:\n\n<<<\n3   1   4 > 2\n∨            \n2   3   1   4\n    ∨        \n4   2 < 3   1\n∨   ∧        \n1   4   2   3\n>>>"
