However, I can solve the puzzle manually by applying logical reasoning and constraints.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have the following initial numbers and constraints:\n     ```\n     _   _   3   2   _\n     ∧                \n     _   _   _ > 4 > 3\n                     ∧\n     _ > _   _   1   _\n     ∧                \n     _ > 3   _   _   _\n                     \n     _   _   1   _ > _\n     ```\n\n2. **Applying Constraints:**\n   - Start by filling in the numbers that are directly constrained by inequalities or given numbers.\n\n3. **Row and Column Constraints:**\n   - Each row and column must contain the numbers 1 to 5 exactly once.\n\nLet's fill in the grid manually:\n\n- **Row 1:** The numbers 3 and 2 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 4, and 5. The constraint `grid[0][0] < grid[1][0]` suggests that `grid[0][0]` could be 1 or 2. Since 2 is already in the row, `grid[0][0]` must be 1. The remaining numbers 4 and 5 can be placed in the remaining cells, considering the constraints.\n\n- **Row 2:** The number 3 is already placed. The constraints `grid[1][2] > grid[1][3] > grid[1][4]` suggest that `grid[1][2]` must be 5, `grid[1][3]` must be 4, and `grid[1][4]` is already 3.\n\n- **Row 3:** The number 1 is already placed. The constraint `grid[2][0] > grid[3][0]` suggests that `grid[2][0]` must be greater than `grid[3][0]`. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, 4, and 5. Considering the constraints, we can fill in the numbers.\n\n- **Row 4:** The number 3 is already placed. The constraint `grid[3][0] > grid[4][0]` suggests that `grid[3][0]` must be greater than `grid[4][0]`. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 5. Considering the constraints, we can fill in the numbers.\n\n- **Row 5:** The number 1 is already placed. The constraint `grid[4][3] > grid[4][4]` suggests that `grid[4][3]` must be greater than `grid[4][4]`. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, 4, and 5. Considering the constraints, we can fill in the numbers.\n\nAfter filling in the numbers, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n1   5   3   2   4\n∧                \n2   4   5 > 4 > 3\n                ∧\n5 > 2   4   1   3\n∧                \n4 > 3   2   5   1\n                 \n3   2   1   4 > 5\n```\n\nLet's format the solution in the required format:\nassistant > Here's the solution to the Futoshiki puzzle:\n\n```\n1   5   3   2   4\n∧                \n2   4   5 > 4 > 3\n                ∧\n5 > 2   4   1   3\n∧                \n4 > 3   2   5   1\n                 \n3   2   1   4 > 5\n```\n\nAnd in the required format:\n\n<<<\n1   5   3   2   4\n∧                \n2   4   5 > 4 > 3\n                ∧\n5 > 2   4   1   3\n∧                \n4 > 3   2   5   1\n                 \n3   2   1   4 > 5\n>>>"
