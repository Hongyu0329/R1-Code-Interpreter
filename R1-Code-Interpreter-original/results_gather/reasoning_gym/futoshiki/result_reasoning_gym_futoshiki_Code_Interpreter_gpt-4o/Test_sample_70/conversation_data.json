    "\nassistant > To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once.

However, I can solve the puzzle manually by considering the constraints and using logical deduction.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Row 0**: We have the numbers 3 and 5 already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 4. Since there is a constraint that the number below 3 in Row 1 must be greater than 3, the number in Row 1, Column 1 must be 4 or 5. Therefore, Row 0, Column 0 must be 2, and Row 0, Column 2 must be 1.\n\n2. **Row 1**: We know that the number in Column 1 must be greater than 3, so it can be 4 or 5. Since Row 0, Column 3 is 5, Row 1, Column 3 must be 4. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 5. Since Row 2, Column 2 is 5, Row 1, Column 2 must be 1. Therefore, Row 1, Column 0 must be 5, and Row 1, Column 4 must be 2.\n\n3. **Row 2**: We have the numbers 2, 5, and 1 already placed. The remaining numbers are 3 and 4. Since there is a constraint that the number in Column 0 must be greater than 2, Row 2, Column 0 must be 4, and Row 2, Column 4 must be 3.\n\n4. **Row 3**: We have the numbers 4 and 2 already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 3, and 5. Since Row 4, Column 0 is 3, Row 3, Column 0 must be 5. Therefore, Row 3, Column 3 must be 1, and Row 3, Column 4 must be 3.\n\n5. **Row 4**: We have the number 3 already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 5. Since Row 3, Column 1 is 4, Row 4, Column 1 must be 5. Therefore, Row 4, Column 2 must be 1, Row 4, Column 3 must be 2, and Row 4, Column 4 must be 4.\n\nNow, let's write down the solution in the required format: \n\n```\n2   3   1   5   4\n5   4   1   2   3\n4 > 2   5   1   3\n5   4   2   1   3\n3   5   1   2   4\n```\n\nThe solution is:\n\n<<<\n2   3   1   5   4\n    ∨\n5   4   1   2   3\n∧\n4 > 2   5   1   3\n\n5   4   2   1   3\n\n3   5   1   2   4\n>>>"
