However, I can guide you through solving the puzzle manually or provide a general approach to solve it.\n\n### General Approach to Solve Futoshiki:\n\n1. **Identify Given Numbers**: Start by filling in the numbers that are already provided in the puzzle.\n\n2. **Apply Inequality Constraints**: Use the inequality constraints to limit the possible values for certain cells. For example, if a cell must be greater than another, it cannot be 1 if the other cell is 6.\n\n3. **Use Deduction**: Look for rows or columns where only one number is missing and fill it in. Use the process of elimination to narrow down possibilities for each cell.\n\n4. **Check for Consistency**: Ensure that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 6.\n\n5. **Iterate**: Repeat the process, using the constraints and deductions, until the puzzle is complete.\n\nLet's try to solve the puzzle manually using this approach. \n\n### Puzzle Layout with Constraints:\n\n```\n_   _   5 > 1   _   4\n                     \n_   2   6   _   _   _\n                ∨   ∧\n5 > _   _   _   _   _\n            ∧        \n_   _   _   _   1   _\n            ∧        \n_   _   1   _   5   _\n                ∨    \n_   _   _   _   3 > _\n```\n\n### Solution:\n\nLet's fill in the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Row 1**: We have 5 and 4. The inequality 5 > 1 suggests that the cell after 5 is 1. The row becomes: `_ _ 5 1 _ 4`.\n\n2. **Row 2**: We have 2 and 6. The inequality suggests that the last two cells are 5 and 3. The row becomes: `_ 2 6 _ 5 3`.\n\n3. **Row 3**: The inequality 5 > _ suggests the first cell is 5. The row becomes: `5 _ _ _ _ _`.\n\n4. **Row 4**: We have 1. The inequality suggests the third cell is 2. The row becomes: `_ _ 2 _ 1 _`.\n\n5. **Row 5**: We have 1 and 5. The row becomes: `_ _ 1 _ 5 _`.\n\n6. **Row 6**: We have 3. The inequality suggests the last cell is 2. The row becomes: `_ _ _ _ 3 2`.\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining numbers while respecting the constraints:\n\n- **Row 1**: `_ _ 5 1 6 4`\n- **Row 2**: `4 2 6 1 5 3`\n- **Row 3**: `5 3 4 2 6 1`\n- **Row 4**: `6 5 2 3 1 4`\n- **Row 5**: `2 4 1 6 5 3`\n- **Row 6**: `3 1 5 4 3 2`\n\nLet's format the solution: \n\n```\n_ _ 5 > 1 6 4\n4 2 6 _ 5 3\n5 > 3 4 2 6 1\n6 5 2 3 1 _\n2 4 1 6 5 _\n3 1 5 4 3 > 2\n```\n\nThis is the solution to the puzzle."
