    "\nassistant > To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 6, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column.

However, I can solve the puzzle manually by applying logical reasoning and constraints step by step.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle manually:\n\n1. Start with the given numbers and constraints:\n   - The numbers given are:\n     - Row 1: _ _ > _ _ 3 1\n     - Row 2: _ _ 5 _ _ _\n     - Row 3: _ _ 2 _ _ _\n     - Row 4: 5 _ 3 2 6 _\n     - Row 5: _ _ _ 5 1 _\n     - Row 6: 4 _ _ _ _ _\n\n2. Apply the constraints:\n   - Row 1: The third cell must be less than the fourth cell.\n   - Column 3: The third cell must be less than the second cell.\n\n3. Fill in the numbers while respecting the constraints and ensuring each number from 1 to 6 appears exactly once in each row and column.\n\nLet's proceed with this approach.\nassistant > Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Row 1**: _ _ > _ _ 3 1\n   - The numbers 3 and 1 are already placed.\n   - The third cell must be less than the fourth cell.\n   - Possible numbers for the remaining cells are 2, 4, 5, 6.\n   - Since the third cell must be less than the fourth, we can try placing 2 in the third cell and 4 in the fourth cell.\n   - This leaves 5 and 6 for the first two cells. We can place 6 in the first cell and 5 in the second cell.\n\n2. **Row 2**: _ _ 5 _ _ _\n   - The number 5 is already placed.\n   - Possible numbers for the remaining cells are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.\n   - We can place 1 in the first cell, 2 in the second cell, 3 in the fourth cell, 4 in the fifth cell, and 6 in the sixth cell.\n\n3. **Row 3**: _ _ 2 _ _ _\n   - The number 2 is already placed.\n   - The third cell must be less than the second cell.\n   - Possible numbers for the remaining cells are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n   - We can place 1 in the first cell, 3 in the second cell, 4 in the fourth cell, 5 in the fifth cell, and 6 in the sixth cell.\n\n4. **Row 4**: 5 _ 3 2 6 _\n   - The numbers 5, 3, 2, and 6 are already placed.\n   - Possible numbers for the remaining cells are 1 and 4.\n   - We can place 1 in the second cell and 4 in the sixth cell.\n\n5. **Row 5**: _ _ _ 5 1 _\n   - The numbers 5 and 1 are already placed.\n   - Possible numbers for the remaining cells are 2, 3, 4, 6.\n   - We can place 2 in the first cell, 3 in the second cell, 4 in the third cell, and 6 in the sixth cell.\n\n6. **Row 6**: 4 _ _ _ _ _\n   - The number 4 is already placed.\n   - Possible numbers for the remaining cells are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6.\n   - We can place 1 in the second cell, 2 in the third cell, 3 in the fourth cell, 5 in the fifth cell, and 6 in the sixth cell.\n\nNow, let's write down the completed puzzle: \n\n```\n6 5 > 2 4 3 1\n1 2 5 3 4 6\n1 3 2 4 5 6\n5 1 3 2 6 4\n2 3 4 5 1 6\n4 1 2 3 5 6\n```\n\nLet's format the answer as requested: \n\n<<<\n6 5 > 2 4 3 1\n1 2 5 3 4 6\n1 3 2 4 5 6\n5 1 3 2 6 4\n2 3 4 5 1 6\n4 1 2 3 5 6\n>>>"
