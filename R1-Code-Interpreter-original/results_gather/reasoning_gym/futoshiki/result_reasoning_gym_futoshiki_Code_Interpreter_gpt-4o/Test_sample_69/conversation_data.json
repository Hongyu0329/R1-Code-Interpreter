However, I can guide you through the process of solving it manually or provide a general approach to solve it programmatically.\n\n### Manual Approach:\n1. **Start with the given numbers**: Fill in the numbers that are already provided in the puzzle.\n2. **Use the inequality constraints**: Apply the constraints to limit the possible numbers for each cell.\n3. **Check rows and columns**: Ensure that each number from 1 to 8 appears exactly once in each row and column.\n4. **Iterate and deduce**: Use logical deduction to fill in the remaining cells, considering the constraints and the numbers already placed.\n\n### General Programmatic Approach:\n1. **Model the problem**: Use a constraint programming approach where each cell is a variable with a domain of numbers from 1 to 8.\n2. **Add constraints**: Include constraints for rows, columns, and the given inequalities.\n3. **Solve the model**: Use a constraint solver to find a solution that satisfies all constraints.\n\nIf you have access to a local Python environment, you can use the `ortools` library to implement the above approach. Let me know if you need further assistance or if you would like to proceed with a different method."
