However, I can guide you through the process of solving it manually or provide a general approach to solve it programmatically.\n\n### Manual Approach:\n1. **Identify Given Numbers**: Start by filling in the numbers that are already provided in the puzzle.\n2. **Apply Inequality Constraints**: Use the inequality constraints to deduce possible numbers for the adjacent cells.\n3. **Use Deduction**: For each row and column, ensure that each number from 1 to 8 appears exactly once. Use this rule to eliminate possibilities.\n4. **Iterate**: Continue filling in numbers by iterating through the grid, applying constraints, and using deduction until the puzzle is complete.\n\n### General Programmatic Approach:\n1. **Model the Problem**: Use a constraint programming approach where each cell is a variable with a domain of 1 to 8.\n2. **Add Constraints**:\n   - All different constraints for each row and column.\n   - Inequality constraints as given in the puzzle.\n3. **Solve the Model**: Use a constraint solver to find a solution that satisfies all constraints.\n\nIf you have access to a local Python environment, you can use libraries like `ortools` to implement the above approach programmatically. Let me know if you need further assistance or a different approach!"
