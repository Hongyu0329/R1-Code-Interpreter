Let's solve the puzzle manually by considering the constraints and filling in the grid step by step.\n\n### Initial Setup:\n```\n_   2   _   _\n        ∧   ∨\n_   _ < _   _\n∨   ∧        \n_   _   _ > 1\n             \n_   _   3   _\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Row 1**: We have a `2` in the second column. The possible numbers for the other cells are `1, 3, 4`. The constraint `2 > cell(1, 1)` implies that `cell(1, 1)` can only be `1`. Thus, the first row becomes:\n   ```\n   1   2   _   _\n   ```\n\n2. **Column 4**: We have a `1` in the third row. The possible numbers for the other cells are `2, 3, 4`. The constraint `cell(2, 3) > cell(2, 2)` implies that `cell(2, 3)` can only be `3` or `4`. Since `cell(3, 3)` is `3`, `cell(2, 3)` must be `4`. Thus, the third column becomes:\n   ```\n   _   _   3   _\n   _   _   _   4\n   _   _   _   1\n   _   _   3   _\n   ```\n\n3. **Row 3**: We have a `1` in the fourth column. The possible numbers for the other cells are `2, 3, 4`. The constraint `cell(2, 3) > cell(2, 2)` implies that `cell(2, 2)` can only be `2` or `3`. Since `cell(3, 2)` is `3`, `cell(2, 2)` must be `2`. Thus, the third row becomes:\n   ```\n   _   _   _   1\n   _   _   2   4\n   _   _   _   1\n   _   _   3   _\n   ```\n\n4. **Row 4**: We have a `3` in the third column. The possible numbers for the other cells are `1, 2, 4`. The constraint `cell(3, 2) < cell(2, 2)` implies that `cell(3, 2)` can only be `1` or `2`. Since `cell(3, 3)` is `3`, `cell(3, 2)` must be `1`. Thus, the fourth row becomes:\n   ```\n   _   _   3   _\n   _   _   _   _\n   _   _   _   _\n   _   _   3   _\n   ```\n\n5. **Complete the Grid**: By filling in the remaining cells while respecting the constraints, we get the final solution:\n   ```\n   1   2   4   3\n   3   4   1   2\n   2   1   3   4\n   4   3   2   1\n   ```\n\n### Final Solution:\n```\n1   2   4   3\n        ∧   ∨\n3   4 < 1   2\n∨   ∧        \n2   1   3 > 4\n             \n4   3   2   1\n```\n\nThus, the solution to the Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   2   4   3\n        ∧   ∨\n3   4 < 1   2\n∨   ∧        \n2   1   3 > 4\n             \n4   3   2   1\n>>>"
