However, I can solve the puzzle manually by applying logical reasoning and constraints.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Row 0**: The numbers 4, 5, 6, and 8 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 7. We need to place them in columns 0, 1, 2, and 4.\n\n2. **Row 1**: The numbers 6, 3, 5, and 2 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 4, 7, and 8. We need to place them in columns 1, 2, 3, and 4. We have a constraint that column 1 is greater than column 2.\n\n3. **Row 2**: The numbers 8, 3, 7, 1, and 4 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 2, 5, and 6. We need to place them in columns 1, 3, and 7.\n\n4. **Row 3**: The numbers 8, 1, and 4 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. We need to place them in columns 0, 1, 5, 6, and 7.\n\n5. **Row 4**: The numbers 1, 5, and 7 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. We need to place them in columns 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6.\n\n6. **Row 5**: The numbers 4 and 8 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. We need to place them in columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Row 6**: The numbers 7 and 2 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
