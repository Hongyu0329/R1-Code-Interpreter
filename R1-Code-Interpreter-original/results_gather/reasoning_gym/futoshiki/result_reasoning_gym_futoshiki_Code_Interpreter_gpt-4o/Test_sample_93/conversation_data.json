    "\nassistant > To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once.

However, I can solve the puzzle manually by applying logical reasoning and constraints.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have the following initial numbers and constraints:\n     ```\n     _   _   4 > 3   _\n                     ∨\n     1   _   _ > 2   _\n                     \n     _   2   _   _   4\n     ∧               ∨\n     _   3   _   _   _\n                     \n     _   _   _   _   _\n     ```\n\n2. **Fill in the known values:**\n   - Place the known values in the grid:\n     ```\n     _   _   4 > 3   _\n                     ∨\n     1   _   _ > 2   _\n                     \n     _   2   _   _   4\n     ∧               ∨\n     _   3   _   _   _\n                     \n     _   _   _   _   _\n     ```\n\n3. **Apply constraints and logic:**\n   - Start filling in the grid by considering the constraints and ensuring each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 5.\n\nLet's fill in the grid manually.\nassistant > Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Row 1:**\n   - We have `4 > 3`, so the only possible numbers for the first two positions are `5` and `2` (since `1` is already in the second row).\n   - The row becomes: `5   2   4 > 3   1`\n\n2. **Row 2:**\n   - We have `1` at the start and `2` at the end.\n   - The only numbers left are `5`, `3`, and `4`, with `3` being less than `4`.\n   - The row becomes: `1   5   3 > 2   4`\n\n3. **Row 3:**\n   - We have `2` and `4` already placed.\n   - The only numbers left are `1`, `3`, and `5`.\n   - The row becomes: `3   2   5   1   4`\n\n4. **Row 4:**\n   - We have `3` already placed.\n   - The only numbers left are `1`, `2`, `4`, and `5`.\n   - The row becomes: `4   3   1   5   2`\n\n5. **Row 5:**\n   - The only numbers left are `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`.\n   - The row becomes: `2   1   3   4   5`\n\nThe completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n5   2   4 > 3   1\n                ∨\n1   5   3 > 2   4\n                 \n3   2   5   1   4\n∧               ∨\n4   3   1   5   2\n                 \n2   1   3   4   5\n```\n\nThus, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n5   2   4 > 3   1\n                ∨\n1   5   3 > 2   4\n                 \n3   2   5   1   4\n∧               ∨\n4   3   1   5   2\n                 \n2   1   3   4   5\n>>>"
