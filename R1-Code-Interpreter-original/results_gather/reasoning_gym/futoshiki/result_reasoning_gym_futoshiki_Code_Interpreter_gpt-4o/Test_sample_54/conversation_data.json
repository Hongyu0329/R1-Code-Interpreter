    "\nassistant > To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once.

Let's solve the puzzle manually by considering the constraints and filling in the grid step by step.\n\n### Given Puzzle:\n```\n_ > _   _ > _\n\n_   3   _   4\n\n_   4   3   2\n\n_   _   _   _\n```\n\n### Constraints:\n1.

Since 3 and 4 are already placed, the only possible configuration is:\n   - Row 2: 1   3   2   4\n\n2. **Row 3**: The number 1 is missing. The only possible configuration is:\n   - Row 3: 1   4   3   2\n\n3. **Column 1**: The numbers 2 and 3 are missing. Since Row 2 and Row 3 are filled, the only possible configuration is:\n   - Column 1: 3   1   4   2\n\n4. **Row 1**: The numbers 2 and 4 are missing. Considering the constraints (_ > _   _ > _), the only possible configuration is:\n   - Row 1: 4   2   3   1\n\n5. **Row 4**: The numbers 2 and 3 are missing. The only possible configuration is:\n   - Row 4: 2   1   4   3\n\n### Final Solution:\n```\n4 > 2   3 > 1\n\n1   3   2   4\n\n1   4   3   2\n\n2   1   4   3\n```\n\nLet's format the solution as requested.\nassistant > The solution to the Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n4 > 2   3 > 1\n\n1   3   2   4\n\n1   4   3   2\n\n2   1   4   3\n```\n\nIn the requested format:\n\n<<<\n4 > 2   3 > 1\n\n1   3   2   4\n\n1   4   3   2\n\n2   1   4   3\n>>>"
