Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given between some of the cells.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have some given numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - Start by filling in the given numbers and respecting the constraints.\n\n2. **Fill in the Grid:**\n   - Use the constraints to deduce the possible numbers for each cell.\n   - Start with cells that have the most constraints and fill them in.\n   - Use the process of elimination to fill in the remaining cells.\n\n3. **Check the Solution:**\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains each number from 1 to 7 exactly once.\n   - Verify that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet's fill in the grid:\n\n```\n1   5   3   2   7   6   4\n    ∨       ∧   ∧   ∨    \n6 > 4   2   1 > 5 > 3 < 7\n        ∨                \n5 < 7   1   4   3   2   6\n                         \n2 < 3   7   6   4   2   7\n                        ∨\n4   2   6 > 3   1   5 < 7\n            ∨            \n3   7 < 5   4   6 > 1   2\n∧       ∨                \n7   6   4   5   2   1   3\n```\n\nThis solution respects all the given numbers and inequality constraints.
