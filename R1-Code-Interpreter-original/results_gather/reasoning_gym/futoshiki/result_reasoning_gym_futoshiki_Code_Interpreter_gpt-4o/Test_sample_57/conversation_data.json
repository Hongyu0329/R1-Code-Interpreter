    "\nassistant > To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom ortools.sat.python import cp_model\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = cp_model.CpModel()\n\n# Define the size of the puzzle\nn = 4\n\n# Create the variables\ngrid = [[model.NewIntVar(1, n, f'grid_{i}_{j}') for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]\n\n# Add the constraints for rows and columns (all different)\nfor i in range(n):\n    model.AddAllDifferent([grid[i][j] for j in range(n)])\n    model.AddAllDifferent([grid[j][i] for j in range(n)])\n\n# Add the inequality constraints\n# Row 1: _   _ < _   _\nmodel.Add(grid[0][1] < grid[0][2])\n\n# Row 2: _ < _ > _   _\nmodel.Add(grid[1][0] < grid[1][1])\nmodel.Add(grid[1][1] > grid[1][2])\n\n# Row 3: 4   _   1   _\nmodel.Add(grid[2][0] == 4)\nmodel.Add(grid[2][2] == 1)\n\n# Column 1: ∨\nmodel.Add(grid[0][0] < grid[1][0])\n\n# Column 2: ∧\nmodel.Add(grid[1][1] > grid[2][1])\n\n# Column 3: ∨\nmodel.Add(grid[1][2] < grid[2][2])\n\n# Create the solver and solve\nsolver = cp_model.CpSolver()\nstatus = solver.Solve(model)\n\n# Extract the solution\nsolution = []\nif status == cp_model.FEASIBLE or status == cp_model.OPTIMAL:\n    for i in range(n):\n        solution.append([solver.Value(grid[i][j]) for j in range(n)])\n\nsolution\nassistant > It seems that the required library for solving the constraint satisfaction problem is not available in this environment. However, I can solve the puzzle manually by considering the constraints and logic.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Row 3**: We know that the third row is `4 _ 1 _`. Since each number from 1 to 4 must appear exactly once in each row, the missing numbers are 2 and 3. We also have a constraint in column 3 (∨), which means the number in row 2, column 3 must be less than the number in row 3, column 3. Therefore, row 3 must be `4 3 1 2`.\n\n2. **Row 2**: The constraints are `_ < _ > _ _`. We know that row 3, column 3 is 1, so row 2, column 3 must be 2. The numbers left for row 2 are 1, 3, and 4. The constraints `_ < _ > _` suggest that the sequence must be 1 < 3 > 2. Therefore, row 2 is `1 3 2 4`.\n\n3. **Row 1**: The constraint is `_ _ < _ _`. The numbers left for row 1 are 2, 3, and 4. The constraint suggests that the sequence must be 2 < 3. Therefore, row 1 is `3 2 4 1`.\n\n4. **Row 4**: The numbers left for row 4 are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since all other rows and columns must contain each number from 1 to 4 exactly once, row 4 is `2 4 3 1`.\n\nNow, let's write the solution in the required format:\n\n```\n3 2 < 4 1\n∨\n1 < 3 > 2 4\n        ∨\n4 3 1 2\n∨ ∧\n2 4 3 1\n```\n\nSo, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n3 2 < 4 1\n∨\n1 < 3 > 2 4\n        ∨\n4 3 1 2\n∨ ∧\n2 4 3 1\n>>>"
