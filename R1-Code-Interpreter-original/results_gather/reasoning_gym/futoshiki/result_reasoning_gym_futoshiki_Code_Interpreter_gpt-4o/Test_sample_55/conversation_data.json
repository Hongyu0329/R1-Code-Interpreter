However, I can solve the puzzle manually by applying logical reasoning and constraints.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have the following initial numbers and constraints:\n     ```\n     _   _   _   _   _\n                     \n     _   _   4   _   3\n                 ∨    \n     _   4   1   _   _\n         ∨           ∨\n     _   _   _   4   _\n                     \n     1   _   3   _   _\n     ```\n\n2. **Apply Constraints:**\n   - From the constraint `4 ∨ _` in the second column, the only possible number for the third row, second column is `5`.\n   - From the constraint `1 ∨ _` in the third column, the only possible number for the fourth row, third column is `5`.\n\n3. **Fill in the Grid:**\n   - Now, let's fill in the grid while respecting the constraints and ensuring each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 5.\n\n4. **Solution:**\n   - After applying logical reasoning and constraints, the solution is:\n     ```\n     5   3   2   1   4\n                     \n     2   1   4   5   3\n                 ∨    \n     3   4   1   2   5\n         ∨           ∨\n     4   5   5   4   1\n                     \n     1   2   3   5   2\n     ```\n\nLet's format the solution in the required format.\nassistant > The solution to the Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n5   3   2   1   4\n                 \n2   1   4   5   3\n            ∨    \n3   4   1   2   5\n    ∨           ∨\n4   5   5   4   1\n                 \n1   2   3   5   2\n```\n\nHowever, I made a mistake in the manual solution.
