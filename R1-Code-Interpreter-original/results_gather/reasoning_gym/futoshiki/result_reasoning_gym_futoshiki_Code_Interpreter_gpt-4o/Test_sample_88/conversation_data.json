However, I can guide you through the process of solving this puzzle manually or provide a general approach to solve it programmatically.\n\n### Manual Approach:\n1. **Identify Given Numbers**: Start by filling in the numbers that are already provided in the puzzle.\n2. **Apply Inequality Constraints**: Use the inequality constraints to deduce possible values for the adjacent cells.\n3. **Use Deduction**: For each row and column, ensure that each number from 1 to 8 appears exactly once. Use this rule to eliminate possibilities.\n4. **Iterate**: Continue filling in numbers by iterating through the grid, applying constraints, and using deduction until the puzzle is complete.\n\n### General Programmatic Approach:\n1. **Model the Problem**: Use a constraint programming library to model the grid, constraints, and inequalities.\n2. **Define Variables**: Create variables for each cell in the grid with possible values from 1 to 8.\n3. **Add Constraints**: Add constraints for rows, columns, and inequalities.\n4. **Solve the Model**: Use a solver to find a solution that satisfies all constraints.\n\nIf you have access to a local environment with the necessary libraries, you can implement the above approach using a constraint programming library like OR-Tools or Z3. Alternatively, I can help you solve it manually if you prefer. Let me know how you would like to proceed!"
