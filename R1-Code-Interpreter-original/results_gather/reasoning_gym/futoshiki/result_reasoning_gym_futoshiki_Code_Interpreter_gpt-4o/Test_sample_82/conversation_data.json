    "\nassistant > To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column.

However, I can solve the puzzle manually by applying logical reasoning and constraints.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\nGiven puzzle:\n```\n_   1   _   _   3\n                 \n_   _   _   3   _\n                 \n_   2   _   _   5\n                 \n3   _   _   1   _\n                 \n_   _   4   5 > _\n```\n\n1. **Row 1**: The numbers 1 and 3 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 2, 4, and 5. Since there are no constraints, we can place them in the remaining positions.\n\n2. **Row 2**: The number 3 is already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 5. We need to ensure that these numbers do not repeat in the columns.\n\n3. **Row 3**: The numbers 2 and 5 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 3, and 4. We need to ensure that these numbers do not repeat in the columns.\n\n4. **Row 4**: The numbers 3 and 1 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 2, 4, and 5. We need to ensure that these numbers do not repeat in the columns.\n\n5. **Row 5**: The numbers 4 and 5 are already placed, and there is a constraint that the number in the last column must be less than the number in the fourth column. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 3.\n\nLet's fill in the grid with these constraints in mind.\nassistant > Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Row 1**: We have 1 and 3 already placed. The remaining numbers are 2, 4, and 5. Since there are no constraints, we can place them in the remaining positions:\n   - Row 1: [2, 1, 5, 4, 3]\n\n2. **Row 2**: We have 3 already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 5. We need to ensure these numbers do not repeat in the columns:\n   - Row 2: [5, 4, 1, 3, 2]\n\n3. **Row 3**: We have 2 and 5 already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 3, and 4. We need to ensure these numbers do not repeat in the columns:\n   - Row 3: [4, 2, 3, 1, 5]\n\n4. **Row 4**: We have 3 and 1 already placed. The remaining numbers are 2, 4, and 5. We need to ensure these numbers do not repeat in the columns:\n   - Row 4: [3, 5, 2, 1, 4]\n\n5. **Row 5**: We have 4 and 5 already placed, and there is a constraint that the number in the last column must be less than the number in the fourth column. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 3:\n   - Row 5: [1, 3, 4, 5, 2]\n\nThe completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n2   1   5   4   3\n5   4   1   3   2\n4   2   3   1   5\n3   5   2   1   4\n1   3   4   5 > 2\n```\n\nThus, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n2   1   5   4   3\n5   4   1   3   2\n4   2   3   1   5\n3   5   2   1   4\n1   3   4   5 > 2\n>>>"
