However, I can guide you through the process of solving it manually or provide a general approach to solve it programmatically.\n\n### Manual Approach:\n1. **Identify Given Numbers**: Start by filling in the numbers that are already provided in the puzzle.\n2. **Apply Inequality Constraints**: Use the inequality constraints to deduce possible values for the empty cells.\n3. **Use Logical Deduction**: For each row and column, ensure that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once. Use this rule to eliminate possibilities for each cell.\n4. **Iterate and Refine**: Continue iterating through the grid, applying constraints and logical deduction until the puzzle is solved.\n\n### Programmatic Approach:\n1. **Model the Problem**: Use a constraint programming library to model the grid, constraints, and variables.\n2. **Define Constraints**: Add constraints for unique numbers in each row and column, and apply the inequality constraints.\n3. **Solve the Model**: Use a solver to find a solution that satisfies all constraints.\n4. **Extract and Format the Solution**: Once a solution is found, format it according to the puzzle's requirements.\n\nIf you have access to a local Python environment, you can use libraries like `ortools` to implement the programmatic approach. Let me know if you need further assistance or a different approach!"
