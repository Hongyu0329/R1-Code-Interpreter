    "Let me solve this Futoshiki puzzle step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're dealing with:\n   - 5x5 grid where each row and column must contain numbers 1-5 exactly once\n   - We have some given numbers and constraints\n   - We need to find a valid solution that satisfies all constraints\n\n2) Let's write a Python program that will:\n   - Represent the puzzle grid\n   - Implement constraint checking\n   - Use backtracking to find a valid solution\n   - Handle both horizontal and vertical constraints\n\nHere's the code to solve it:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n    # Check row\n    if num in grid[row]:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check column\n    if num in [grid[i][col] for i in range(5) if grid[i][col] != 0]:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0 and h_constraints[row][col-1] == '>':\n        if grid[row][col-1] != 0 and not (num < grid[row][col-1]):\n            return False\n    if col > 0 and h_constraints[row][col-1] == '<':\n        if grid[row][col-1] != 0 and not (num > grid[row][col-1]):\n            return False\n    if col < 4 and h_constraints[row][col] == '>':\n        if grid[row][col+1] != 0 and not (num > grid[row][col+1]):\n            return False\n    if col < 4 and h_constraints[row][col] == '<':\n        if grid[row][col+1] != 0 and not (num < grid[row][col+1]):\n            return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0 and v_constraints[row-1][col] == '∨':\n        if grid[row-1][col] != 0 and not (num < grid[row-1][col]):\n            return False\n    if row > 0 and v_constraints[row-1][col] == '∧':\n        if grid[row-1][col] != 0 and not (num > grid[row-1][col]):\n            return False\n    if row < 4 and v_constraints[row][col] == '∨':\n        if grid[row+1][col] != 0 and not (num > grid[row+1][col]):\n            return False\n    if row < 4 and v_constraints[row][col] == '∧':\n        if grid[row+1][col] != 0 and not (num < grid[row+1][col]):\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n    for row in range(5):\n        for col in range(5):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 6):\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, num, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n                        grid[row][col] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initialize the puzzle\ngrid = [\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 3],\n    [0, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 0, 5],\n    [3, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 5, 0]\n]\n\n# Horizontal constraints (> and <)\nh_constraints = [\n    ['', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '>', '']\n]\n\n# Vertical constraints (∧ and ∨)\nv_constraints = [\n    ['', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '']\n]\n\nif solve_futoshiki(grid, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n    for row in grid:\n        print('  '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThe code uses a backtracking algorithm to try different numbers in each empty cell while maintaining the Futoshiki rules and constraints.
