    "Let me solve this Futoshiki puzzle step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're dealing with:\n   - 5x5 grid where each row and column must contain numbers 1-5 exactly once\n   - We have both horizontal (< >) and vertical (∧ ∨) constraints\n   - Some numbers are already given\n\n2) Let's write a Python program to solve this using backtracking:\n   - We'll represent the grid as a 2D array\n   - We'll store constraints separately\n   - We'll implement constraint checking\n   - We'll use backtracking to try different numbers\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n    # Check row\n    if num in grid[row]:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check column\n    if num in [grid[i][col] for i in range(5) if grid[i][col] != 0]:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    for (r, c1, c2, greater) in h_constraints:\n        if r == row:\n            if c1 == col and grid[r][c2] != 0:\n                if greater and not (num > grid[r][c2]):\n                    return False\n                if not greater and not (num < grid[r][c2]):\n                    return False\n            if c2 == col and grid[r][c1] != 0:\n                if greater and not (grid[r][c1] > num):\n                    return False\n                if not greater and not (grid[r][c1] < num):\n                    return False\n\n    # Check vertical constraints\n    for (r1, r2, c, greater) in v_constraints:\n        if c == col:\n            if r1 == row and grid[r2][c] != 0:\n                if greater and not (num > grid[r2][c]):\n                    return False\n                if not greater and not (num < grid[r2][c]):\n                    return False\n            if r2 == row and grid[r1][c] != 0:\n                if greater and not (grid[r1][c] > num):\n                    return False\n                if not greater and not (grid[r1][c] < num):\n                    return False\n                    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 6):\n                    if is_valid(grid, i, j, num, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n                        grid[i][j] = num\n                        if solve_futoshiki(grid, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n                            return True\n                        grid[i][j] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid (0 represents empty cells)\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 3, 2, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 4, 3],\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Horizontal constraints: (row, col1, col2, is_greater)\n# True means col1 > col2, False means col1 < col2\nh_constraints = [\n    (1, 3, 4, True),\n    (2, 0, 1, True),\n    (3, 0, 1, True),\n    (4, 3, 4, True)\n]\n\n# Vertical constraints: (row1, row2, col, is_greater)\n# True means row1 > row2, False means row1 < row2\nv_constraints = [\n    (0, 1, 0, True),\n    (2, 3, 0, True),\n    (1, 2, 4, True)\n]\n\nif solve_futoshiki(grid, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n    for row in grid:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThe code has solved the puzzle.
