    "You're right. I realize now that I need to see the complete puzzle with all inequality constraints (< > ∧ ∨) between adjacent cells. Without these constraints, we're missing crucial information needed to solve the puzzle correctly.\n\nCould you please provide the complete puzzle with all inequality constraints between adjacent cells? The current representation only shows the fixed numbers:\n\n_   2   _   _   _   4\n                     \n6   1   _   _   _   5\n                     \n_   6   _   2   _   _\n                     \n_   _   _   _   1   _\n                     \n_   _   _   3   _   2\n                     \n_   4   6   _   2   _\n\nBut we need to know:\n1. All horizontal constraints (< or >) between adjacent cells in each row\n2. All vertical constraints (∧ or ∨) between adjacent cells in each column\n\nOnce you provide these additional constraints, I can modify the code to include them and find the correct solution. The inequality constraints are essential parts of a Futoshiki puzzle and significantly affect the solution.\n\nPlease share the complete puzzle with all inequality constraints, and I'll update the code accordingly to solve it properly."

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the following 6x6 Futoshiki puzzle:\n\n_   2   _   _   _   4\n                     \n6   1   _   _   _   5\n                     \n_   6   _   2   _   _\n                     \n_   _   _   _   1   _\n                     \n_   _   _   3   _   2\n                     \n_   4   6   _   2   _\n\nEnsure your answer follows the same format as the puzzle above, just replace blanks (_) with the correct value for the cell and put the answer in triple angle brackets, like this <<<answer to the puzzle>>>.\nUse < and > for horizontal constraints. Use ∧ and ∨ for vertical constraints.\nRemember, in Futoshiki each row and column must contain each number from 1 to 6 exactly once.",
