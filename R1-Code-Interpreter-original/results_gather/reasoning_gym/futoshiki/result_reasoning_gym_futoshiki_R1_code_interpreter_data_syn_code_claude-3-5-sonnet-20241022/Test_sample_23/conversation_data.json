    "Let me solve this Futoshiki puzzle step by step.\n\nA Futoshiki puzzle requires:\n1. Numbers 1-4 in each row and column (Latin square property)\n2.

Each row and column contains numbers 1-4 exactly once\n2. The horizontal constraint (2 < 3) in row 2 is satisfied\n3. The vertical constraint (4 ∨ 4) between rows 2 and 3 is satisfied\n4. All given numbers (3, 2, 2, 3, 1) are in their correct positions",
