    "Let me solve this Futoshiki puzzle step by step.\n\nFor a Futoshiki puzzle, we need to:\n1. Fill in numbers 1-8 in each row and column (like Sudoku)\n2. Satisfy all inequality constraints between adjacent cells\n3.

Each row and column contains numbers 1-8\n2. All inequality constraints are satisfied\n3. The initial given numbers are preserved\n\nThe solution appears to be valid and satisfies all the constraints of the Futoshiki puzzle."
