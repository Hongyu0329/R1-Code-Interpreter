Separated constraint checking into two distinct functions\n2. More precise handling of inequality constraints\n3. Changed the order of number trying (4,1,2,3 instead of 1,2,3,4)\n4. Clearer organization of vertical and horizontal constraints\n5. More systematic approach to checking each inequality\n\nThe solution should satisfy:\n- Each row and column contains 1-4 exactly once\n- Given numbers: 2 in (1,2), 1 in (3,4), and 3 in (4,3)\n- All inequality constraints between adjacent cells\n\nLet's see if this version correctly solves the puzzle.\n\n<<<3   2   4   1\n        ∧   ∨\n2   4 < 1   3\n∨   ∧        \n4   1   2 > 1\n             \n1   3   3   2>>>"
