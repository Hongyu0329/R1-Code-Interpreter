    "Let me solve this Futoshiki puzzle step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we have:\n- 6x6 grid where each row and column must contain numbers 1-6 exactly once\n- Some cells are pre-filled\n- There are inequality constraints between cells\n- We need to fill in all blanks while satisfying all constraints\n\n2) Let's write a Python program to solve this using backtracking:\n- We'll represent the grid as a 2D array\n- Track inequality constraints\n- Implement constraint checking\n- Use backtracking to try different numbers\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n    # Check row\n    for x in range(6):\n        if grid[row][x] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check column\n    for x in range(6):\n        if grid[x][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    for (r, c1, c2, greater) in h_constraints:\n        if r == row:\n            if c1 == col and grid[r][c2] != 0:\n                if greater and not (num > grid[r][c2]):\n                    return False\n                if not greater and not (num < grid[r][c2]):\n                    return False\n            if c2 == col and grid[r][c1] != 0:\n                if greater and not (grid[r][c1] > num):\n                    return False\n                if not greater and not (grid[r][c1] < num):\n                    return False\n\n    # Check vertical constraints\n    for (c, r1, r2, greater) in v_constraints:\n        if c == col:\n            if r1 == row and grid[r2][c] != 0:\n                if greater and not (num > grid[r2][c]):\n                    return False\n                if not greater and not (num < grid[r2][c]):\n                    return False\n            if r2 == row and grid[r1][c] != 0:\n                if greater and not (grid[r1][c] > num):\n                    return False\n                if not greater and not (grid[r1][c] < num):\n                    return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef find_empty(grid):\n    for i in range(6):\n        for j in range(6):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                return (i, j)\n    return None\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n    empty = find_empty(grid)\n    if not empty:\n        return True\n    \n    row, col = empty\n    \n    for num in range(1, 7):\n        if is_valid(grid, row, col, num, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n            grid[row][col] = num\n            \n            if solve_futoshiki(grid, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n                return True\n            \n            grid[row][col] = 0\n    \n    return False\n\n# Initial grid (0 represents empty cells)\ngrid = [\n    [1, 0, 2, 0, 5, 6],\n    [0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n    [0, 1, 6, 0, 3, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 6, 2],\n    [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Horizontal constraints (row, col1, col2, is_greater)\n# True means first number is greater than second\nh_constraints = [\n    (1, 3, 4, True)  # 5 > _ in row 2\n]\n\n# Vertical constraints (col, row1, row2, is_greater)\nv_constraints = [\n    (3, 1, 2, True)  # Constraint in column 4\n]\n\nif solve_futoshiki(grid, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n    result = \"\"\n    for i in range(6):\n        if i > 0:\n            result += \"\\n\"\n        for j in range(6):\n            result += str(grid[i][j])\n            if j < 5:\n                result += \"   \"\n            if i == 1 and j == 3:\n                result += \">\"\n    print(result)\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution exists\")\n```\n\nThe code has found a solution.

Each row contains numbers 1-6\n2. Each column contains numbers 1-6\n3. All inequality constraints are satisfied\n4. All pre-filled numbers match the original puzzle\n\nI notice there's an error in this solution as there are duplicate numbers in some columns and the solution doesn't fully satisfy all constraints. Let me modify the code to be more strict with the constraints and run it again.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n    # Check row\n    for x in range(6):\n        if grid[row][x] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check column\n    for x in range(6):\n        if grid[x][col] == num:\n            return False\n            \n    # Additional check for the completed solution\n    if num == grid[row][col]:\n        return True\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    for (r, c1, c2, greater) in h_constraints:\n        if r == row:\n            if c1 == col and grid[r][c2] != 0:\n                if greater and not (num > grid[r][c2]):\n                    return False\n                if not greater and not (num < grid[r][c2]):\n                    return False\n            if c2 == col and grid[r][c1] != 0:\n                if greater and not (grid[r][c1] > num):\n                    return False\n                if not greater and not (grid[r][c1] < num):\n                    return False\n\n    # Check vertical constraints\n    for (c, r1, r2, greater) in v_constraints:\n        if c == col:\n            if r1 == row and grid[r2][c] != 0:\n                if greater and not (num > grid[r2][c]):\n                    return False\n                if not greater and not (num < grid[r2][c]):\n                    return False\n            if r2 == row and grid[r1][c] != 0:\n                if greater and not (grid[r1][c] > num):\n                    return False\n                if not greater and not (grid[r1][c] < num):\n                    return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_futoshiki(grid, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n    empty = find_empty(grid)\n    if not empty:\n        return True\n    \n    row, col = empty\n    \n    for num in range(1, 7):\n        if is_valid(grid, row, col, num, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n            grid[row][col] = num\n            \n            if solve_futoshiki(grid, h_constraints, v_constraints):\n                return True\n            \n            grid[row][col] = 0\n    \n    return False\n\n# Initial grid (0 represents empty cells)\ngrid = [\n    [1, 0, 2, 0, 5, 6],\n    [0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n    [0, 1, 6, 0, 3, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 6, 2],\n    [0, 4, ",
