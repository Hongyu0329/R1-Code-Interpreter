    "Let me solve this Futoshiki puzzle step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're dealing with:\n- 5x5 grid where each row and column must contain numbers 1-5 exactly once\n- Inequality constraints between adjacent cells (horizontal and vertical)\n- Some cells are pre-filled: (3,1), (4,1), (5,3), (2,5)\n\n2) We'll need to:\n- Implement constraint checking for rows, columns, and inequalities\n- Use backtracking to try different combinations\n- Consider the given constraints to reduce search space\n\nLet me write a Python program to solve this:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, num, constraints_h, constraints_v):\n    # Check row\n    for j in range(5):\n        if grid[row][j] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check column\n    for i in range(5):\n        if grid[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check horizontal constraints\n    if col > 0:\n        if constraints_h[row][col-1] == '<' and not (grid[row][col-1] < num if grid[row][col-1] != 0 else True):\n            return False\n        if constraints_h[row][col-1] == '>' and not (grid[row][col-1] > num if grid[row][col-1] != 0 else True):\n            return False\n    if col < 4:\n        if constraints_h[row][col] == '<' and not (num < grid[row][col+1] if grid[row][col+1] != 0 else True):\n            return False\n        if constraints_h[row][col] == '>' and not (num > grid[row][col+1] if grid[row][col+1] != 0 else True):\n            return False\n    \n    # Check vertical constraints\n    if row > 0:\n        if constraints_v[row-1][col] == '∧' and not (grid[row-1][col] < num if grid[row-1][col] != 0 else True):\n            return False\n        if constraints_v[row-1][col] == '∨' and not (grid[row-1][col] > num if grid[row-1][col] != 0 else True):\n            return False\n    if row < 4:\n        if constraints_v[row][col] == '∧' and not (num < grid[row+1][col] if grid[row+1][col] != 0 else True):\n            return False\n        if constraints_v[row][col] == '∨' and not (num > grid[row+1][col] if grid[row+1][col] != 0 else True):\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve(grid, constraints_h, constraints_v):\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 6):\n                    if is_valid(grid, i, j, num, constraints_h, constraints_v):\n                        grid[i][j] = num\n                        if solve(grid, constraints_h, constraints_v):\n                            return True\n                        grid[i][j] = 0\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initialize the grid and constraints\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n    [3, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Horizontal constraints ('<', '>', ' ')\nconstraints_h = [\n    ['<', ' ', ' ', ' '],\n    [' ', ' ', ' ', '<'],\n    ['>', ' ', ' ', ' '],\n    [' ', '>', ' ', ' '],\n    [' ', '>', ' ', ' ']\n]\n\n# Vertical constraints ('∧', '∨', ' ')\nconstraints_v = [\n    [' ', ' ', '∧', ' ', ' '],\n    [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],\n    [' ', ' ', '∧', '∨', ' '],\n    [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']\n]\n\nif solve(grid, constraints_h, constraints_v):\n    result = \"\"\n    for i in range(5):\n        row = \"\"\n        for j in range(5):\n            row += str(grid[i][j])\n            if j < 4:\n                row += \" \" + constraints_h[i][j] + \" \"\n        result += row + \"\\n\"\n        if i < 4:\n            for j in range(5):\n                result += \"    \" if constraints_v[i][j] == ' ' else \" \" + constraints_v[i][j] + \"  \"\n            result += \"\\n\"\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThe code implements a backtracking solution with constraint checking.
