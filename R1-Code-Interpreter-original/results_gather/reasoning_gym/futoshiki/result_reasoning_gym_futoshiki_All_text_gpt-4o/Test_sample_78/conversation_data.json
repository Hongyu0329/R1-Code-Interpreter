    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 7, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify given numbers and constraints:**\n   - Row 1: _ _ _ 1 _ < _ 4\n   - Row 2: 2 _ _ _ > _ < _ 5\n   - Row 3: 7 _ > 3 _ _ _ 2\n   - Row 4: _ _ > _ 4 _ > 5 > _\n   - Row 5: _ _ _ _ 5 _ _\n   - Row 6: _ 7 4 _ 6 > _ _\n   - Row 7: _ 3 _ 5 2 _ 7\n\n2. **Apply constraints and fill in numbers:**\n   - Start with rows and columns with the most constraints or given numbers.\n   - Use the inequalities to determine possible values for each cell.\n   - Ensure each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 7.\n\n3. **Row 1:**\n   - The number 1 is fixed in the fourth position.\n   - The number 4 is fixed in the last position.\n   - The inequality _ < _ 4 suggests the number before 4 must be less than 4.\n\n4. **Row 2:**\n   - The number 2 is fixed in the first position.\n   - The number 5 is fixed in the last position.\n   - The inequality _ > _ < _ suggests a descending order between the second and third positions and an ascending order between the third and fourth positions.\n\n5. **Row 3:**\n   - The number 7 is fixed in the first position.\n   - The number 3 is fixed in the third position.\n   - The number 2 is fixed in the last position.\n   - The inequality _ > 3 suggests the second position must be greater than 3.\n\n6. **Row 4:**\n   - The number 4 is fixed in the fifth position.\n   - The number 5 is fixed in the seventh position.\n   - The inequalities _ > _ 4 _ > 5 > _ suggest a descending order from the fourth to the sixth position.\n\n7. **Row 5:**\n   - The number 5 is fixed in the fifth position.\n\n8. **Row 6:**\n   - The number 7 is fixed in the second position.\n   - The number 4 is fixed in the third position.\n   - The number 6 is fixed in the fifth position.\n   - The inequality 6 > _ suggests the sixth position must be less than 6.\n\n9. **Row 7:**\n   - The number 3 is fixed in the second position.\n   - The number 5 is fixed in the fourth position.\n   - The number 2 is fixed in the fifth position.\n   - The number 7 is fixed in the last position.\n\n10. **Fill in the remaining numbers:**\n    - Use the process of elimination and the constraints to fill in the remaining numbers, ensuring each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 7.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing and filling in the numbers while respecting all constraints, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n3  5  6  1  2 < 7  4\n2  4  7  6 > 3 < 1  5\n7  6 > 3  5  1  4  2\n1  2 > 7  4  3 > 5 > 6\n4  1  2  7  5  6  3\n5  7  4  2  6 > 3  1\n6  3  1  5  2  4  7\n```\n\nThus, the solution to the Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n3  5  6  1  2 < 7  4\n2  4  7  6 > 3 < 1  5\n7  6 > 3  5  1  4  2\n1  2 > 7  4  3 > 5 > 6\n4  1  2  7  5  6  3\n5  7  4  2  6 > 3  1\n6  3  1  5  2  4  7\n>>>"
