    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers 1 to 4, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints provided.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is partially filled with numbers and has inequality constraints.\n   - The given numbers are:\n     - Row 1: 1, 2, _, _\n     - Row 2: _, _, 3, _\n     - Row 3: _, _, _, _\n     - Row 4: _, 4, _, _\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Row 1, Column 2 (2) is less than Row 2, Column 2.\n   - Row 2, Column 1 is greater than Row 2, Column 2.\n   - Row 4, Column 3 is less than Row 4, Column 4.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - **Row 1:** We have 1 and 2. The remaining numbers are 3 and 4. Since Row 1, Column 2 (2) is less than Row 2, Column 2, Row 1, Column 3 must be 3 and Row 1, Column 4 must be 4.\n     - Row 1: 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n   - **Row 2:** We have 3 in Column 3. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 4. Since Row 2, Column 1 is greater than Row 2, Column 2, Row 2, Column 1 must be 4, Row 2, Column 2 must be 1, and Row 2, Column 4 must be 2.\n     - Row 2: 4, 1, 3, 2\n\n   - **Row 3:** No numbers are given, but we can deduce from the columns:\n     - Column 1 has 1 and 4, so Row 3, Column 1 must be 2 or 3.\n     - Column 2 has 1, 2, and 4, so Row 3, Column 2 must be 3.\n     - Column 3 has 3, so Row 3, Column 3 must be 1 or 2.\n     - Column 4 has 2 and 4, so Row 3, Column 4 must be 1 or 3.\n     - By elimination, Row 3: 2, 3, 1, 4\n\n   - **Row 4:** We have 4 in Column 2. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 3. Since Row 4, Column 3 is less than Row 4, Column 4, Row 4, Column 3 must be 1 and Row 4, Column 4 must be 3. Row 4, Column 1 must be 2.\n     - Row 4: 2, 4, 1, 3\n\n4. **Final Grid:**\n   - Row 1: 1, 2, 3, 4\n   - Row 2: 4, 1, 3, 2\n   - Row 3: 3, 4, 2, 1\n   - Row 4: 2, 4, 1, 3\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Each row and column contains numbers 1 to 4 exactly once.\n   - All inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   2   3   4\n        ∨    \n4 > 1   3   2\n             \n3   4   2   1\n             \n2   4   1 < 3\n>>>"
