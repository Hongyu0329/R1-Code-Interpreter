    "To solve the 5x5 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5 with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The constraints are:\n     - Row 1: 5th cell is greater than 4th cell.\n     - Row 5: 1st cell is greater than 2nd cell, and 5th cell is greater than 4th cell.\n     - Column 1: 2nd cell is greater than 1st cell.\n     - Column 4: 5th cell is greater than 4th cell.\n\n2. **Given Numbers:**\n   - Row 2, Column 2: 1\n   - Row 3, Column 3: 2\n   - Row 3, Column 4: 4\n   - Row 4, Column 1: 2\n   - Row 4, Column 3: 1\n   - Row 4, Column 4: 3\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - **Row 4 Analysis:**\n     - The numbers 2, 1, and 3 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 4 and 5.\n     - Since there are no constraints affecting these positions, place 4 in Column 2 and 5 in Column 5.\n\n   - **Row 3 Analysis:**\n     - The numbers 2 and 4 are placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 3, and 5.\n     - Column 2 already has 1, so place 3 in Column 2 and 5 in Column 5.\n\n   - **Row 2 Analysis:**\n     - The number 1 is placed. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n     - Column 3 already has 2, so place 3 in Column 3.\n     - Column 4 must be less than Column 5, so place 4 in Column 4 and 5 in Column 5.\n     - Place 2 in Column 1.\n\n   - **Row 5 Analysis:**\n     - The constraints are: 1st cell > 2nd cell, and 5th cell > 4th cell.\n     - The remaining numbers are 1, 3, 4, and 5.\n     - Place 3 in Column 2 (since 1st cell must be greater).\n     - Place 1 in Column 1.\n     - Place 4 in Column 4 and 5 in Column 5 (since 5th cell must be greater).\n     - Place 2 in Column 3.\n\n   - **Row 1 Analysis:**\n     - The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n     - The constraint is that the 5th cell is greater than the 4th cell.\n     - Place 1 in Column 1, 3 in Column 2, 5 in Column 3, 2 in Column 4, and 4 in Column 5.\n\n4. **Final Grid:**\n   - Row 1: 1, 3, 5, 2, 4\n   - Row 2: 2, 1, 3, 4, 5\n   - Row 3: 4, 3, 2, 4, 5\n   - Row 4: 2, 4, 1, 3, 5\n   - Row 5: 1, 3, 2, 4, 5\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure all numbers 1 to 5 are present.\n   - Verify all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   3   5   2 < 4\n∧                \n2   1   3   4   5\n                 \n4   3   2   4   5\n                 \n2   4   1   3   5\n    ∨            \n1 > 3   2   4 < 5\n>>>"
