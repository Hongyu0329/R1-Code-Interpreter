    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5 with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The constraints are:\n     - Row 1: No constraints.\n     - Row 2: Column 1 is less than Column 2.\n     - Row 3: Column 1 is greater than Column 2.\n     - Row 4: No constraints.\n     - Row 5: No constraints.\n   - Vertical constraints:\n     - Column 1: Row 2 is greater than Row 3.\n\n2. **Fill in the given numbers:**\n   - Row 1: _ 3 _ 5 _\n   - Row 2: _ _ _ _ _\n   - Row 3: _ > 2 5 1 _\n   - Row 4: _ 4 2 _ _\n   - Row 5: 3 _ _ _ _\n\n3. **Analyze constraints and fill in the numbers:**\n   - **Row 3:** The numbers 2, 5, and 1 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 3 and 4. Since Column 1 is greater than Column 2, and Column 2 is 2, Column 1 must be 4. Thus, Column 5 must be 3.\n     - Row 3: 4 > 2 5 1 3\n   - **Row 4:** The numbers 4 and 2 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 3, and 5. Since Column 3 is 2, Column 1 cannot be 2. Column 1 must be 1, Column 4 must be 3, and Column 5 must be 5.\n     - Row 4: 1 4 2 3 5\n   - **Row 5:** The number 3 is already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 5. Since Column 1 is 3, Column 2 must be 1, Column 3 must be 4, Column 4 must be 2, and Column 5 must be 5.\n     - Row 5: 3 1 4 2 5\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are needed. Since Column 1 is less than Column 2, and Column 1 cannot be 3, Column 1 must be 2, Column 2 must be 4, Column 3 must be 1, Column 4 must be 3, and Column 5 must be 5.\n     - Row 2: 2 4 1 3 5\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are needed. Since Column 2 is 3, Column 1 must be 1, Column 3 must be 4, Column 4 is 5, and Column 5 must be 2.\n     - Row 1: 1 3 4 5 2\n\n4. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure they contain the numbers 1 to 5 exactly once.\n   - Ensure all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final solution to the puzzle is:\n\n```\n1 3 4 5 2\n2 4 1 3 5\n4 > 2 5 1 3\n1 4 2 3 5\n3 1 4 2 5\n```\n\nThe answer in the required format is:\n\n<<<\n1 3 4 5 2\n∨\n2 4 1 3 5\n∧\n4 > 2 5 1 3\n1 4 2 3 5\n3 1 4 2 5\n>>>"
