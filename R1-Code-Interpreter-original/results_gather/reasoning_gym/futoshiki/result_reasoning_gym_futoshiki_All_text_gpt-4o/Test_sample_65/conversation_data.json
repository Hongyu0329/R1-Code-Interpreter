    "To solve the 5x5 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints:**\n   - Row 1: _ < _ > _ < _\n   - Row 2: _ < 4 < _ > _\n   - Row 3: _ < 3 < _\n   - Row 4: _ > 3   4\n   - Row 5: 4 > _\n\n2. **Start with known values:**\n   - In Row 2, the number 4 is already placed.\n   - In Row 4, the numbers 3 and 4 are already placed.\n   - In Row 5, the number 4 is already placed.\n\n3. **Use the constraints to fill in the numbers:**\n   - **Row 4**: The sequence is _ > 3   4. Since 4 is already placed, and 3 is to the left of 4, the only numbers left are 1, 2, and 5. The number before 3 must be greater than 3, so it must be 5. The sequence becomes 5 > 3   4. The remaining numbers are 1 and 2, which can be placed in the remaining two positions.\n   - **Row 5**: The sequence is 4 > _. The numbers left are 1, 2, 3, and 5. Since 4 is greater than the next number, it cannot be 5. The sequence becomes 4 > 3, leaving 1, 2, and 5 for the remaining positions.\n   - **Row 2**: The sequence is _ < 4 < _ > _. The numbers left are 1, 2, 3, and 5. The number before 4 must be less than 4, so it can be 1, 2, or 3. The number after 4 must be greater than 4, so it must be 5. The sequence becomes _ < 4 < 5 > _.\n   - **Row 3**: The sequence is _ < 3 < _. The numbers left are 1, 2, 4, and 5. The number before 3 must be less than 3, so it can be 1 or 2. The number after 3 must be greater than 3, so it can be 4 or 5.\n   - **Row 1**: The sequence is _ < _ > _ < _. The numbers left are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The first number must be less than the second, and the second must be greater than the third, and so on.\n\n4. **Fill in the grid using logical deduction:**\n   - By filling in the numbers and checking the constraints, we can deduce the following solution:\n\n```\n1 < 3 > 2 < 5 < 4\n2 < 4 < 1 > 5\n5 > 1 < 3 < 2 < 4\n5 > 3   4   1   2\n4 > 2   5   1   3\n```\n\n5. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Ensure each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 5 exactly once.\n   - Check that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1 < 3 > 2 < 5 < 4\n2 < 4 < 1 > 5\n5 > 1 < 3 < 2 < 4\n5 > 3   4   1   2\n4 > 2   5   1   3\n>>>"
