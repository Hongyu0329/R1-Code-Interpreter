    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. We must also respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5.\n   - We have some initial numbers and inequality constraints.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - Row 1: _ _ 4 > 3 _\n   - Row 2: 1 _ _ > 2 _\n   - Row 3: _ 2 _ _ 4\n   - Row 4: _ 3 _ _ _\n   - Row 5: _ _ _ _ _\n\n3. **Vertical Constraints:**\n   - Between Row 1 and Row 2: Column 4 has a constraint (Row 1, Col 4) > (Row 2, Col 4).\n   - Between Row 3 and Row 4: Column 1 has a constraint (Row 3, Col 1) ∧ (Row 4, Col 1).\n   - Between Row 3 and Row 4: Column 5 has a constraint (Row 3, Col 5) ∨ (Row 4, Col 5).\n\n4. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:** We have 4 > 3, so the third column is 4 and the fourth column is 3. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 5. We need to place them in columns 1, 2, and 5.\n   - **Row 2:** Starts with 1 and has a constraint _ > 2. The remaining numbers are 3, 4, and 5. The 2 must be in column 4, so the number in column 3 must be greater than 2, which can only be 3, 4, or 5.\n   - **Row 3:** Ends with 4, and has a 2 in column 2. The remaining numbers are 1, 3, and 5.\n   - **Row 4:** Starts with 3. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n   - **Row 5:** All numbers are missing, so we need to place 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n5. **Using Constraints:**\n   - **Row 1:** Since 4 > 3, and we have 1, 2, 5 left, we can try placing them. The only possible configuration is 5, 2, 4, 3, 1.\n   - **Row 2:** With 1 _ _ > 2 _, and knowing 2 is in column 4, we can place 5 in column 3 and 3 in column 5, resulting in 1, 4, 5, 2, 3.\n   - **Row 3:** With _ 2 _ _ 4, and knowing 1, 3, 5 are left, we can place 3 in column 3, 1 in column 1, and 5 in column 4, resulting in 1, 2, 3, 5, 4.\n   - **Row 4:** With _ 3 _ _ _, and knowing 1, 2, 4, 5 are left, we can place 2 in column 1 (due to the constraint with Row 3), 4 in column 3, 5 in column 4, and 1 in column 5, resulting in 2, 3, 4, 5, 1.\n   - **Row 5:** With all numbers missing, we can place 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, ensuring no repetition in columns, resulting in 4, 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\n6. **Final Grid:**\n   - Row 1: 5, 2, 4, 3, 1\n   - Row 2: 1, 4, 5, 2, 3\n   - Row 3: 1, 2, 3, 5, 4\n   - Row 4: 2, 3, 4, 5, 1\n   - Row 5: 4, 1, 2, 3, 5\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n5   2   4 > 3   1\n                ∨\n1   4   5 > 2   3\n                 \n1   2   3   5   4\n∧               ∨\n2   3   4   5   1\n                 \n4   1   2   3   5\n>>>"
