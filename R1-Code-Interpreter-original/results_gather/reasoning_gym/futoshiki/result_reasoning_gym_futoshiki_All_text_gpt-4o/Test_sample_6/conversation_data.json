    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Given Numbers and Constraints:**\n   - The puzzle provides some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 9.\n   - The inequality constraints must be satisfied.\n\n2. **Start with Rows and Columns with Most Information:**\n   - Row 1 has several numbers and constraints. We can start by filling in the missing numbers while respecting the constraints.\n   - Similarly, Row 3 and Row 5 have several numbers and constraints.\n\n3. **Use Constraints to Narrow Down Possibilities:**\n   - For example, in Row 1, the constraint 5 < 9 helps us determine the order of numbers.\n   - In Row 3, the constraint _ < 9 helps us determine the possible values for the blank space.\n\n4. **Fill in the Blanks Using Logic:**\n   - Use the constraints to deduce the possible values for each blank space.\n   - Ensure that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row and column.\n\n5. **Check for Consistency:**\n   - After filling in the numbers, check each row, column, and constraint to ensure consistency.\n   - Adjust any numbers that do not satisfy the constraints.\n\n6. **Iterate and Refine:**\n   - If any inconsistencies are found, backtrack and try different possibilities.\n   - Continue refining until the puzzle is solved.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n8   5 < 9   6 > 4 > 7 > 1   2   3\n                                 \n1 < 4   2   5   7   8 > 3   9 > 6\n                ∨                \n7   1   3 < 8   6   9 > 2 > 4   5\n                                ∨\n2   6 > 1   4 > 5   6   7   3   9\n            ∨           ∨       ∧\n3   7   4 > 2 < 9   1   5   6   8\n                        ∧        \n5   8   9   2   8   3   6   4   7\n∨       ∧                        \n6   3   7   1   4 < 8   9 > 5   2\n∨   ∧                            \n4   9   6 > 3 > 2   5   7 > 1   8\n    ∨                            \n9   2   5   7   1   2   4 > 8   3\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n8   5 < 9   6 > 4 > 7 > 1   2   3\n1 < 4   2   5   7   8 > 3   9 > 6\n7   1   3 < 8   6   9 > 2 > 4   5\n2   6 > 1   4 > 5   6   7   3   9\n3   7   4 > 2 < 9   1   5   6   8\n5   8   9   2   8   3   6   4   7\n6   3   7   1   4 < 8   9 > 5   2\n4   9   6 > 3 > 2   5   7 > 1   8\n9   2   5   7   1   2   4 > 8   3\n>>>"
