    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   _   _ < _   _\n   ∨            \n   _ < _ > _   _\n               ∨\n   4   _   1   _\n   ∨   ∧        \n   _   _   _   _\n   ```\n\n2. **Analyze the third row:**\n   - The third row is `4 _ 1 _`. Since 4 and 1 are already placed, the remaining numbers to place are 2 and 3.\n   - The vertical constraint ∧ between the second and third rows in the second column indicates that the number in the second row, second column must be greater than the number in the third row, second column.\n   - Therefore, the third row, second column must be 2, and the second row, second column must be 3.\n\n3. **Fill in the third row:**\n   - The third row becomes `4 2 1 3`.\n\n4. **Analyze the second row:**\n   - The second row is `_ < _ > _ _`. We know the second column is 3.\n   - The inequality `_ < _` in the first two columns suggests the first column must be less than the second column. Therefore, the first column must be 2.\n   - The inequality `_ > _` in the second and third columns suggests the third column must be less than the second column. Therefore, the third column must be 1.\n   - The remaining number for the fourth column is 4.\n\n5. **Fill in the second row:**\n   - The second row becomes `2 3 1 4`.\n\n6. **Analyze the first row:**\n   - The first row is `_ _ < _ _`. We know the third column must be less than the fourth column.\n   - The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 must be placed in the first row. The third column must be less than the fourth column, so the third column must be 3 and the fourth column must be 4.\n   - The remaining numbers for the first and second columns are 1 and 2. The vertical constraint ∨ between the first and second rows in the first column indicates that the number in the first row, first column must be less than the number in the second row, first column.\n   - Therefore, the first row, first column must be 1, and the first row, second column must be 2.\n\n7. **Fill in the first row:**\n   - The first row becomes `1 2 3 4`.\n\n8. **Analyze the fourth row:**\n   - The fourth row is `_ _ _ _`. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 must be placed in the fourth row.\n   - The vertical constraint ∨ between the third and fourth rows in the fourth column indicates that the number in the fourth row, fourth column must be less than the number in the third row, fourth column.\n   - Therefore, the fourth row, fourth column must be 2.\n   - The remaining numbers for the first, second, and third columns are 3, 4, and 1, respectively.\n\n9. **Fill in the fourth row:**\n   - The fourth row becomes `3 4 2 1`.\n\n10. **Final Solution:**\n    ```\n    1 2 3 4\n    2 3 1 4\n    4 2 1 3\n    3 4 2 1\n    ```\n\nThe completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   2 < 3   4\n∨            \n2 < 3 > 1   4\n            ∨\n4   2   1   3\n∨   ∧        \n3   4   2   1\n>>>"
