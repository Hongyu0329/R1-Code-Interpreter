    "To solve the 6x6 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 6, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 6x6, and we have some numbers and inequality constraints already provided.\n   - The constraints are either horizontal (using < or >) or vertical (using ∧ or ∨).\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - **Row 1:** Starts with 4, followed by a blank, then 1. The third cell must be less than the fourth cell.\n   - **Row 2:** The second cell is less than 5, and the fourth cell is less than the fifth, which is less than the sixth.\n   - **Row 3:** The fourth cell is 4, which is greater than the third cell, and the fifth cell is 1.\n   - **Row 4:** The fourth cell is less than 5, which is followed by 4.\n   - **Row 5:** Starts with 1, followed by a blank, then two blanks, then 6, and ends with 3. The third cell is less than the fourth.\n   - **Row 6:** The third cell is 3, and the fifth cell is less than the sixth.\n\n3. **Applying Constraints:**\n   - **Row 1:** The sequence starts with 4 and 1. The only numbers left are 2, 3, 5, and 6. The third cell must be less than the fourth, so possible sequences are 4, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6 or 4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6.\n   - **Row 2:** The sequence must satisfy the constraints: _ < 5, _ < _, and _ < _. Possible numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.\n   - **Row 3:** The sequence must satisfy the constraints: _ < 4 > 1. Possible numbers are 2, 3, 5, 6.\n   - **Row 4:** The sequence must satisfy the constraints: _ < 5, 4. Possible numbers are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n   - **Row 5:** The sequence must satisfy the constraints: 1, _, _, 6, 3. Possible numbers are 2, 4, 5.\n   - **Row 6:** The sequence must satisfy the constraints: _, _, 3, _, _, _. Possible numbers are 1, 2, 4, 5, 6.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - By iteratively filling in the numbers while respecting the constraints and ensuring each number appears once per row and column, we can solve the puzzle.\n\n5. **Final Solution:**\n   - After careful analysis and filling in the numbers, the completed grid is:\n\n```\n4   2   1 < 3   5   6\n                     \n3 < 5   6   2 < 4 < 1\n                     \n6   5   2   4 > 1   3\n                     \n2   3   6 < 5   4   1\n                ∧    \n1 < 4   5   6   2   3\n            ∨        \n5   6   3   1 < 2   4\n```\n\nThus, the answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n4   2   1 < 3   5   6\n                     \n3 < 5   6   2 < 4 < 1\n                     \n6   5   2   4 > 1   3\n                     \n2   3   6 < 5   4   1\n                ∧    \n1 < 4   5   6   2   3\n            ∨        \n5   6   3   1 < 2   4\n>>>"
