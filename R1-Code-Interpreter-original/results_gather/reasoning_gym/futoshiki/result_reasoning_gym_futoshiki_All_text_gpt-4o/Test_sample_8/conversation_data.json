    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 through 7 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is partially filled with numbers and has inequality constraints.\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 7.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - The inequality constraints are:\n     - Row 1: 4 < _\n     - Row 5: 6 ∨ _\n   - These constraints must be respected while filling in the numbers.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers given are 6, 4, and 2. The constraint 4 < _ suggests that the number after 4 must be greater than 4. Possible numbers for the blanks are 1, 3, 5, and 7.\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers given are 7 and 1. Possible numbers for the blanks are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n   - **Row 3:** The numbers given are 2, 4, and 6. Possible numbers for the blanks are 1, 3, 5, and 7.\n   - **Row 4:** The numbers given are 4, 2, and 1. Possible numbers for the blanks are 3, 5, 6, and 7.\n   - **Row 5:** The numbers given are 2, 6, and 3. The constraint 6 ∨ _ suggests that the number below 6 must be greater than 6. Possible numbers for the blanks are 1, 4, 5, and 7.\n   - **Row 6:** The numbers given are 1, 3, and 7. Possible numbers for the blanks are 2, 4, 5, and 6.\n   - **Row 7:** The numbers given are 3 and 6. Possible numbers for the blanks are 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - Use the constraints and the requirement of unique numbers in each row and column to fill in the blanks.\n   - Start with rows or columns with the most numbers filled in, as they provide more constraints.\n   - Use the process of elimination to determine the possible numbers for each blank.\n   - Ensure that the inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\n5. **Final Solution:**\n   - After filling in the grid while respecting all constraints, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n1   6   4 < 5   7   3   2\n                         \n7   3   5   6   1   2   4\n                         \n5   2   7   1   4   6   3\n                         \n4   7   2   3   5   1   6\n                         \n2   5   6   4   3   7   1\n        ∨                \n6   1   3   7   2   4   5\n                         \n3   4   1   2   6   5   7\n```\n\nThus, the answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   6   4 < 5   7   3   2\n                         \n7   3   5   6   1   2   4\n                         \n5   2   7   1   4   6   3\n                         \n4   7   2   3   5   1   6\n                         \n2   5   6   4   3   7   1\n        ∨                \n6   1   3   7   2   4   5\n                         \n3   4   1   2   6   5   7\n>>>"
