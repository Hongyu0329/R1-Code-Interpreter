    "To solve the 6x6 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 6, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 6x6 with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The constraints are:\n     - Row 1: _ < _   _   2 < 4   _\n     - Row 2: _   _   _   _ > _   _\n     - Row 3: _   4   _   5   _   _\n     - Row 4: _   6   3 > _ < _   _\n     - Row 5: _   _   6   _   3   5\n     - Row 6: _ > _   5   _   _   4\n     - Column constraints:\n       - Between rows 5 and 6, columns 1 and 2: ∨\n       - Between rows 5 and 6, columns 3 and 4: ∨\n\n2. **Analyze Constraints:**\n   - Start with the given numbers and apply the constraints.\n   - Row 1: The number 2 is less than 4, so the only possible numbers for the first two cells are 1 and 3.\n   - Row 3: The number 4 is fixed in the second column, and 5 is fixed in the fourth column.\n   - Row 4: The number 6 is fixed in the second column, and 3 is fixed in the third column. The number after 3 must be greater, and the number after that must be smaller.\n   - Row 5: The number 6 is fixed in the third column, 3 in the fifth column, and 5 in the sixth column.\n   - Row 6: The number 5 is fixed in the third column, and 4 in the sixth column. The first number must be greater than the second.\n\n3. **Fill in the Grid:**\n   - Use the constraints to deduce the possible numbers for each cell.\n   - Start with rows or columns with the most constraints or fixed numbers.\n   - Ensure each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 6.\n\n4. **Iterate and Adjust:**\n   - If a contradiction arises, backtrack and try different numbers.\n   - Use the process of elimination and logical deduction to fill in the grid.\n\n5. **Final Solution:**\n   - After filling in the grid while respecting all constraints, the solution is:\n\n```\n1 < 3   6   2 < 4   5\n2   5   4   3 > 1   6\n6   4   1   5   2   3\n5   6   3 > 1 < 2   4\n4   2   6   1   3   5\n3 > 1   5   6   4   2\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1 < 3   6   2 < 4   5\n2   5   4   3 > 1   6\n6   4   1   5   2   3\n5   6   3 > 1 < 2   4\n4   2   6   1   3   5\n3 > 1   5   6   4   2\n>>>"
