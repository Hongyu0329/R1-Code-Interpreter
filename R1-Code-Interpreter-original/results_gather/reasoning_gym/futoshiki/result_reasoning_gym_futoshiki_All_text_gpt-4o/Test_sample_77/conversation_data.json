    "To solve the 6x6 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 6 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 6x6 with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The numbers given are: \n     - Row 1: 5, 1, 4\n     - Row 2: 2, 6\n     - Row 4: 1\n     - Row 5: 1, 5\n     - Row 6: 3\n\n2. **Inequality Constraints:**\n   - Row 1: 5 > 1\n   - Row 2: Column 5 > Column 6\n   - Row 3: 5 > Column 1\n   - Row 4: Column 3 > Column 2\n   - Row 5: Column 3 > Column 2\n   - Row 6: 3 > Column 6\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - **Row 1:** We have 5, 1, and 4. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 6. The constraint 5 > 1 is already satisfied.\n   - **Row 2:** We have 2 and 6. The remaining numbers are 1, 3, 4, and 5. The constraint Column 5 > Column 6 needs to be satisfied.\n   - **Row 3:** We have the constraint 5 > Column 1. The numbers to place are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n   - **Row 4:** We have 1. The constraint Column 3 > Column 2 needs to be satisfied. The numbers to place are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n   - **Row 5:** We have 1 and 5. The constraint Column 3 > Column 2 needs to be satisfied. The numbers to place are 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n   - **Row 6:** We have 3. The constraint 3 > Column 6 needs to be satisfied. The numbers to place are 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:** Place 6 in the first column, 3 in the fourth column, and 2 in the sixth column.\n   - **Row 2:** Place 5 in the third column, 3 in the fourth column, 4 in the fifth column, and 1 in the sixth column.\n   - **Row 3:** Place 4 in the first column, 3 in the second column, 2 in the third column, 6 in the fourth column, and 1 in the fifth column.\n   - **Row 4:** Place 5 in the second column, 6 in the third column, 3 in the fourth column, 2 in the fifth column, and 4 in the sixth column.\n   - **Row 5:** Place 4 in the second column, 3 in the third column, 6 in the fourth column, and 2 in the sixth column.\n   - **Row 6:** Place 5 in the first column, 4 in the second column, 6 in the third column, 1 in the fourth column, and 2 in the sixth column.\n\n5. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure all rows and columns contain numbers 1 to 6.\n   - Verify all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n6   3   5 > 1   2   4\n_   2   6   3   4 > 1\n5 > 4   3   2   6   1\n_   5   6   3   1   2\n_   4   1   6   5   3\n_   5   4   1   3 > 2\n```\n\nThus, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n6   3   5 > 1   2   4\n_   2   6   3   4 > 1\n5 > 4   3   2   6   1\n_   5   6   3   1   2\n_   4   1   6   5   3\n_   5   4   1   3 > 2\n>>>"
