    "To solve the 8x8 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The grid is partially filled with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 8.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Horizontal constraints: \n     - Row 2: 7 < _\n     - Row 4: _ > 2\n     - Row 5: _ > _\n     - Row 8: _ < _ and 3 < _\n   - Vertical constraints:\n     - Column 3: ∧\n     - Column 5: ∧\n     - Column 6: ∧\n     - Column 1: ∨\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Filling**:\n   - Start with rows or columns that have the most numbers filled in or have constraints that can be easily satisfied.\n   - Use the process of elimination to determine which numbers can fit in each blank space, considering both the numbers already in the row/column and the inequality constraints.\n\n4. **Iterative Solving**:\n   - For each blank cell, list possible numbers that can fit based on the current state of the row and column.\n   - Use the inequality constraints to further narrow down possibilities.\n   - Fill in numbers where there is only one possibility.\n   - Repeat the process, updating possibilities as more numbers are filled in.\n\n5. **Checking**:\n   - After filling in the grid, ensure that all rows and columns contain unique numbers from 1 to 8.\n   - Verify that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n5   3   7   2   6   1   4   8\n                             \n1   7 < 2   3   5   6   8   4\n                             \n8   6   4   7   1   9   2   5\n        ∧       ∧            \n6   1   5   4   8   7   3 > 2\n                             \n2   3   9   8   4 > 5   1   7\n∨                            \n3   5   1   6   2   4   7   8\n        ∧                    \n7   4   8   5   1   2   6 > 3\n                             \n4 < 2   3   6   7   3 < 5   1\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n5   3   7   2   6   1   4   8\n                             \n1   7 < 2   3   5   6   8   4\n                             \n8   6   4   7   1   9   2   5\n        ∧       ∧            \n6   1   5   4   8   7   3 > 2\n                             \n2   3   9   8   4 > 5   1   7\n∨                            \n3   5   1   6   2   4   7   8\n        ∧                    \n7   4   8   5   1   2   6 > 3\n                             \n4 < 2   3   6   7   3 < 5   1\n>>>"
