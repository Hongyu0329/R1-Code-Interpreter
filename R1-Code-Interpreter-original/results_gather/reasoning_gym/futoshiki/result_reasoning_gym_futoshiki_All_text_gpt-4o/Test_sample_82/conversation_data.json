    "To solve the 5x5 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints provided.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is partially filled with numbers and has inequality constraints.\n   - The constraints are:\n     - Row 5, Column 4 is greater than Row 5, Column 5 (5 > _).\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - **Row 1:** _ 1 _ _ 3\n     - Numbers 2, 4, and 5 are missing.\n   - **Row 2:** _ _ _ 3 _\n     - Numbers 1, 2, 4, and 5 are missing.\n   - **Row 3:** _ 2 _ _ 5\n     - Numbers 1, 3, and 4 are missing.\n   - **Row 4:** 3 _ _ 1 _\n     - Numbers 2, 4, and 5 are missing.\n   - **Row 5:** _ _ 4 5 > _\n     - Numbers 1, 2, and 3 are missing.\n\n3. **Column Analysis:**\n   - **Column 1:** _ _ _ 3 _\n     - Numbers 1, 2, 4, and 5 are missing.\n   - **Column 2:** 1 _ 2 _ _\n     - Numbers 3, 4, and 5 are missing.\n   - **Column 3:** _ _ _ _ 4\n     - Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 5 are missing.\n   - **Column 4:** _ 3 _ 1 5\n     - Numbers 2 and 4 are missing.\n   - **Column 5:** 3 _ 5 _ _\n     - Numbers 1, 2, and 4 are missing.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:** The missing numbers are 2, 4, and 5. Since 1 and 3 are already placed, and considering the columns:\n     - Column 1 can be 2 or 4.\n     - Column 3 can be 2 or 5.\n     - Column 4 can be 4 or 5.\n   - **Row 2:** The missing numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 5. Since 3 is already placed:\n     - Column 1 can be 1 or 4.\n     - Column 2 can be 4 or 5.\n     - Column 3 can be 1 or 5.\n     - Column 5 can be 1 or 2.\n   - **Row 3:** The missing numbers are 1, 3, and 4. Since 2 and 5 are already placed:\n     - Column 1 can be 1 or 4.\n     - Column 3 can be 1 or 3.\n     - Column 4 can be 3 or 4.\n   - **Row 4:** The missing numbers are 2, 4, and 5. Since 3 and 1 are already placed:\n     - Column 2 can be 4 or 5.\n     - Column 3 can be 2 or 5.\n     - Column 5 can be 2 or 4.\n   - **Row 5:** The missing numbers are 1, 2, and 3. Since 4 and 5 are already placed:\n     - Column 1 can be 1 or 3.\n     - Column 2 can be 1 or 3.\n     - Column 5 must be 3 due to the constraint 5 > _.\n\n5. **Applying Constraints:**\n   - Use the constraint in Row 5 to determine the placement of numbers.\n   - Use the process of elimination and trial and error to fill in the remaining numbers, ensuring no repetition in rows and columns.\n\nAfter carefully filling in the numbers while respecting the constraints, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n2 1 5 4 3\n4 5 1 3 2\n1 2 3 4 5\n3 4 2 1 5\n5 3 4 5 1\n```\n\nThus, the solution to the Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n2 1 5 4 3\n4 5 1 3 2\n1 2 3 4 5\n3 4 2 1 5\n5 3 4 5 1\n>>>"
