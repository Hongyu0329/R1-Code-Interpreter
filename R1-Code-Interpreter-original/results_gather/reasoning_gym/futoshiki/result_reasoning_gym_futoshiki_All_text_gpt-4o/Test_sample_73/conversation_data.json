    "To solve the 8x8 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 8, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols '>' and '<' for horizontal constraints, and '∧' and '∨' for vertical constraints.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is partially filled with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - We need to fill in the blanks while respecting these constraints.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - Horizontal constraints (e.g., _ > 1) mean the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.\n   - Vertical constraints (e.g., ∧) mean the number above is greater than the number below.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - Start with rows or columns that have the most numbers filled in or have the most constraints, as these provide more information.\n   - Use the constraints to deduce possible numbers for each blank space.\n   - Ensure that each number from 1 to 8 appears exactly once in each row and column.\n\n4. **Iterative Process:**\n   - Use a process of elimination to determine which numbers can fit in each blank space.\n   - Check each row and column to ensure no duplicates.\n   - Adjust numbers as necessary to satisfy all constraints.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - After filling in the grid, verify that all constraints are satisfied.\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains all numbers from 1 to 8 without repetition.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n4   7   5   6   2 > 3 > 1   8\n            ∧                \n6   5   1 < 8   4 < 7   2   3\n    ∨                        \n2   1   3   4   7   8   5   6\n        ∨               ∨    \n8   6   4   7   1 < 8   3 < 5\n                             \n5   8   2   3 < 6   1   4   7\n∧           ∨   ∨            \n7   4   5   2   3   6   7 < 8\n∧   ∧                        \n3   3   6   5   8   4   2   1\n        ∧                    \n1   2   7 > 5   3   1   6 > 4\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n4   7   5   6   2 > 3 > 1   8\n            ∧                \n6   5   1 < 8   4 < 7   2   3\n    ∨                        \n2   1   3   4   7   8   5   6\n        ∨               ∨    \n8   6   4   7   1 < 8   3 < 5\n                             \n5   8   2   3 < 6   1   4   7\n∧           ∨   ∨            \n7   4   5   2   3   6   7 < 8\n∧   ∧                        \n3   3   6   5   8   4   2   1\n        ∧                    \n1   2   7 > 5   3   1   6 > 4\n>>>"
