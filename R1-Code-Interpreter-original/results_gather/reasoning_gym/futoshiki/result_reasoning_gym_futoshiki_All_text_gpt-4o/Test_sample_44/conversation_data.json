    "To solve the 6x6 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 6, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols '>' and '<' for horizontal constraints, and '∧' and '∨' for vertical constraints.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify given numbers and constraints:**\n   - Row 2: _ < 4 _ > _ 3 2\n   - Row 3: 4 _ > 5 _ > _ _\n   - Row 4: _ _ < 3 _ 4 < _\n   - Row 5: _ 2 < _ 1 _ _\n   - Row 6: _ _ _ < _ _ 1\n\n2. **Apply constraints:**\n   - Start with the given numbers and apply the constraints to deduce possible numbers for each cell.\n   - Use the inequalities to limit the possibilities for each cell.\n\n3. **Fill in the grid:**\n   - Use logical deduction to fill in the numbers, ensuring each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 6.\n   - Continuously check the constraints to ensure they are satisfied.\n\n4. **Iterate and adjust:**\n   - If a contradiction arises, backtrack and try different numbers.\n   - Continue this process until the grid is completely and correctly filled.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing and filling in the grid, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n```\n1 5 > 6 4 2 3\n              \n5 < 4 1 > 6 3 2\n∧           ∨ ∧\n4 6 > 5 2 > 1 3\n            ∧\n2 1 < 3 5 4 < 6\n  ∧     ∨      \n3 2 < 4 1 6 5\n              \n6 3 2 < 5 4 1\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1 5 > 6 4 2 3\n              \n5 < 4 1 > 6 3 2\n∧           ∨ ∧\n4 6 > 5 2 > 1 3\n            ∧\n2 1 < 3 5 4 < 6\n  ∧     ∨      \n3 2 < 4 1 6 5\n              \n6 3 2 < 5 4 1\n>>>"
