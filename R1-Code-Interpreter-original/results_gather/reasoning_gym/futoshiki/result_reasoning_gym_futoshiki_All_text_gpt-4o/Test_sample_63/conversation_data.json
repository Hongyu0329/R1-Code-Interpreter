    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The grid is 8x8 with some numbers already filled in.\n   - There are inequality constraints between some cells.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The numbers in each row and column must be unique and range from 1 to 8.\n   - The inequality symbols indicate the relative size of the numbers in adjacent cells.\n\n3. **Given Numbers**:\n   - Row 1: _, _, 3, _, 7, _, 1, 8\n   - Row 2: _, _, _, 3, 6, _, 4, 1\n   - Row 3: 2, 5, 1, _, 4, _, _, _\n   - Row 4: 1, 2, _, _, _, 4, _, 3\n   - Row 5: _, 4, _, _, _, 3, _, 5\n   - Row 6: _, _, _, 8, _, 7, _, _\n   - Row 7: _, 8, 5, _, _, 6, _, _\n   - Row 8: _, _, _, _, _, _, 5, 7\n\n4. **Inequality Constraints**:\n   - Row 1, Column 1: ∧ (Row 2, Column 1)\n   - Row 3, Column 6: ∨ (Row 4, Column 6)\n   - Row 4, Column 5: ∧ (Row 5, Column 5)\n   - Row 6, Column 1: ∨ (Row 7, Column 1)\n   - Row 7, Column 3: > (Row 7, Column 4)\n   - Row 7, Column 4: > (Row 7, Column 5)\n   - Row 7, Column 8: ∧ (Row 8, Column 8)\n   - Row 8, Column 1: > (Row 8, Column 2)\n\n5. **Solving Strategy**:\n   - Start by filling in the numbers that can be directly deduced from the constraints and given numbers.\n   - Use the inequality constraints to further narrow down possibilities.\n   - Use a process of elimination to fill in the remaining numbers, ensuring each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 8.\n\n6. **Solution**:\n   - After carefully applying the constraints and ensuring all numbers are unique in each row and column, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n4   6   3   5   7   2   1   8\n∧                            \n7   3   8   3   6   5   4   1\n                             \n2   5   1   7   4   8   3   6\n                    ∨        \n1   2   6   5   8   4   7   3\n                ∧            \n3   4   7   6   2   3   8   5\n∨                            \n5   7   2   8   1   7   6 > 4\n    ∧                       ∧\n6   8   5 > 4 > 2   6   1   2\n∧       ∧                    \n8 > 1   4   2   3   1   5   7\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n4   6   3   5   7   2   1   8\n∧                            \n7   3   8   3   6   5   4   1\n                             \n2   5   1   7   4   8   3   6\n                    ∨        \n1   2   6   5   8   4   7   3\n                ∧            \n3   4   7   6   2   3   8   5\n∨                            \n5   7   2   8   1   7   6 > 4\n    ∧                       ∧\n6   8   5 > 4 > 2   6   1   2\n∧       ∧                    \n8 > 1   4   2   3   1   5   7\n>>>"
