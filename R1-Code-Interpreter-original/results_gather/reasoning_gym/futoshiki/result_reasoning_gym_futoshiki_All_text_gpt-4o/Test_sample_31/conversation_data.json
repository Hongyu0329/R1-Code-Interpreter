    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 7, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify given numbers and constraints:**\n   - The grid has some numbers already filled in: 5 in the first row, 4 in the second row, 3 and 5 in the third row, 1 in the fifth row, and 6 and 2 in the last row.\n   - There are inequality constraints between some cells, both horizontally and vertically.\n\n2. **Apply constraints and fill in numbers:**\n   - Start with rows or columns with the most constraints or given numbers, as they provide more information.\n   - Use the constraints to determine possible numbers for each cell, ensuring no repetition in rows and columns.\n\n3. **Iterate and adjust:**\n   - As you fill in numbers, continuously check against the constraints and adjust as necessary.\n   - If a contradiction arises, backtrack and try a different approach.\n\n4. **Ensure all constraints are satisfied:**\n   - After filling in the grid, verify that all inequality constraints are satisfied and that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 7.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n_   5   _   _   _   _   _\n            ∧           ∨\n4 < _   _   3 > _   _   _\n                        ∧\n_   3   _   5 < _ > 1   7\n    ∧                    \n_   _   _   _ < _   3   _\n    ∨           ∨        \n1   _ > _   _   5 > _   _\n        ∧                \n_ > _   _   _   _   _   4\n                    ∨   ∧\n_   _ < 6   2   _   _ < _\n```\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is:\n\n```\n3   5   2   7   6   1   4\n            ∧           ∨\n4 < 7   1   3 > 2   6   5\n                        ∧\n6   3   4   5 < 7 > 1   7\n    ∧                    \n5   2   7   1 < 4   3   6\n    ∨           ∨        \n1   6 > 5   4   5 > 7   2\n        ∧                \n7 > 4   3   6   1   2   4\n                    ∨   ∧\n2   1 < 6   2   3   5 < 7\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<3 5 2 7 6 1 4\n4 7 1 3 2 6 5\n6 3 4 5 7 1 7\n5 2 7 1 4 3 6\n1 6 5 4 5 7 2\n7 4 3 6 1 2 4\n2 1 6 2 3 5 7>>>"
