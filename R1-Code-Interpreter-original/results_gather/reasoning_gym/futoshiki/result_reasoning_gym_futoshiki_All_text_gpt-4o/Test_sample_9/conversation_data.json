    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 7, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have a partially filled grid with some numbers already placed.\n   - We have inequality constraints between some cells.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - The constraints guide us on the relative size of numbers in adjacent cells.\n   - For example, if a cell has a '<' to the right, the number in the left cell must be smaller than the number in the right cell.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - Start by filling in the numbers that are already given.\n   - Use the constraints to deduce possible numbers for the empty cells.\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 7.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Begin with rows or columns that have the most numbers filled in or have the most constraints.\n   - Use process of elimination to determine possible numbers for each cell.\n   - Check each row and column to ensure no duplicates and that all constraints are satisfied.\n\n5. **Iterative Process:**\n   - As you fill in more numbers, revisit previous assumptions and constraints.\n   - Adjust numbers as necessary to maintain the integrity of the puzzle.\n\n6. **Final Check:**\n   - Once the grid is filled, verify that all rows and columns contain numbers 1 to 7.\n   - Ensure all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nBy following these steps, we can solve the puzzle. Here is the completed grid:\n\n```\n1   6   5   3   4 < 7   2\n∧       ∧   ∨   ∧        \n2 < 3   7   1 < 5   6   4\n∧           ∧            \n7   5   6   2   1 < 4   3\n                    ∨    \n3   2   4   6   7   1   5\n        ∧                \n5   7   2 > 4   3   6   1\n                         \n4   1   3   2   5   7   6\n∧                        \n6   4   1 < 7 > 1   5   7\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   6   5   3   4 < 7   2\n∧       ∧   ∨   ∧        \n2 < 3   7   1 < 5   6   4\n∧           ∧            \n7   5   6   2   1 < 4   3\n                    ∨    \n3   2   4   6   7   1   5\n        ∧                \n5   7   2 > 4   3   6   1\n                         \n4   1   3   2   5   7   6\n∧                        \n6   4   1 < 7 > 1   5   7\n>>>"
