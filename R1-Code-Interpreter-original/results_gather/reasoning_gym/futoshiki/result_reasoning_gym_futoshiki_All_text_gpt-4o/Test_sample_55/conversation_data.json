    "To solve the 5x5 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints provided.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5 with some numbers and inequality constraints already given.\n   - The constraints are:\n     - Row 2, Column 4 (R2C4) is greater than Row 3, Column 4 (R3C4).\n     - Row 3, Column 2 (R3C2) is greater than Row 4, Column 2 (R4C2).\n     - Row 3, Column 5 (R3C5) is greater than Row 4, Column 5 (R4C5).\n\n2. **Given Numbers:**\n   - R2C3 = 4, R2C5 = 3\n   - R3C2 = 4, R3C3 = 1\n   - R4C4 = 4\n   - R5C1 = 1, R5C3 = 3\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - **Row 1:** No numbers or constraints are given, so we will fill this row later.\n   - **Row 2:** We have 4 in C3 and 3 in C5. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 5. Since R2C4 > R3C4, R2C4 cannot be 1. Thus, R2C4 must be 5, and R2C1 and R2C2 must be 1 and 2 in some order.\n   - **Row 3:** We have 4 in C2 and 1 in C3. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 5. Since R3C4 < R2C4, R3C4 cannot be 5. Since R3C5 > R4C5, R3C5 cannot be 1. Thus, R3C4 must be 2, R3C5 must be 5, and R3C1 must be 3.\n   - **Row 4:** We have 4 in C4. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 5. Since R4C2 < R3C2, R4C2 cannot be 4. Since R4C5 < R3C5, R4C5 cannot be 5. Thus, R4C2 must be 3, R4C5 must be 1, and R4C1 and R4C3 must be 2 and 5 in some order.\n   - **Row 5:** We have 1 in C1 and 3 in C3. The remaining numbers are 2, 4, and 5. Since there are no constraints, we can fill these in any order that satisfies the row and column uniqueness.\n\n4. **Finalizing the Solution:**\n   - **Row 1:** Fill in the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in a way that satisfies the column constraints.\n   - **Row 2:** R2C1 = 1, R2C2 = 2, R2C4 = 5.\n   - **Row 3:** R3C1 = 3, R3C4 = 2, R3C5 = 5.\n   - **Row 4:** R4C1 = 2, R4C2 = 3, R4C3 = 5, R4C5 = 1.\n   - **Row 5:** R5C2 = 5, R5C4 = 2, R5C5 = 4.\n\n5. **Check Constraints:**\n   - Ensure all rows and columns contain unique numbers from 1 to 5.\n   - Verify all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n1   2   5   3   4\n                 \n5   1   4   2   3\n            ∨    \n3   4   1   2   5\n    ∨           ∨\n2   3   5   4   1\n                 \n1   5   3   2   4\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   2   5   3   4\n                 \n5   1   4   2   3\n            ∨    \n3   4   1   2   5\n    ∨           ∨\n2   3   5   4   1\n                 \n1   5   3   2   4\n>>>"
