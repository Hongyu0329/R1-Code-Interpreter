    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 4x4 with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The given numbers are:\n     - Row 1, Column 1: 2\n     - Row 2, Column 3: 4\n     - Row 3, Column 4: 3\n\n2. **Inequality Constraints:**\n   - Row 1, Column 1 is less than Row 2, Column 1 (2 < _).\n   - Row 4, Column 1 is less than Row 4, Column 2 (_ < _).\n\n3. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:** We have 2 in the first column. The remaining numbers to place are 1, 3, and 4. Since Row 1, Column 1 is less than Row 2, Column 1, we cannot place 1 in Row 1, Column 1. Therefore, Row 1, Column 2 can be 1, 3, or 4.\n   - **Row 2:** We have 4 in the third column. The remaining numbers to place are 1, 2, and 3. Since Row 1, Column 1 is less than Row 2, Column 1, Row 2, Column 1 can be 3 or 4.\n   - **Row 3:** We have 3 in the fourth column. The remaining numbers to place are 1, 2, and 4.\n   - **Row 4:** We have the constraint that Row 4, Column 1 is less than Row 4, Column 2. The numbers to place are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n4. **Solving the Puzzle:**\n   - **Row 1:** Since Row 1, Column 1 is 2, and it must be less than Row 2, Column 1, Row 2, Column 1 must be 3 or 4. Therefore, Row 1, Column 2 can be 1, 3, or 4. However, since Row 1, Column 3 must be less than Row 2, Column 3 (which is 4), Row 1, Column 3 must be 1 or 3. This means Row 1, Column 2 must be 4.\n   - **Row 2:** With 4 in Column 3, Row 2, Column 1 must be 3 (since it must be greater than 2 in Row 1, Column 1). This leaves 1 for Row 2, Column 2.\n   - **Row 3:** With 3 in Column 4, Row 3, Column 1 can be 1, 2, or 4. Since Row 3, Column 3 must be less than Row 4, Column 3, Row 3, Column 3 must be 1 or 2. This means Row 3, Column 1 must be 4.\n   - **Row 4:** With the constraint that Row 4, Column 1 is less than Row 4, Column 2, Row 4, Column 1 must be 1, and Row 4, Column 2 must be 2.\n\n5. **Final Grid:**\n   - Row 1: 2, 4, 1, 3\n   - Row 2: 3, 1, 4, 2\n   - Row 3: 4, 2, 1, 3\n   - Row 4: 1, 3, 2, 4\n\nThe completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n2   4   1   3\n∨            \n3   1   4   2\n             \n4   2   1   3\n             \n1 < 3   2   4\n```\n\nThus, the answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n2   4   1   3\n∨            \n3   1   4   2\n             \n4   2   1   3\n             \n1 < 3   2   4\n>>>"
