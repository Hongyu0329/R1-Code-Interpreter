    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 4x4, and we need to fill it with numbers 1 to 4.\n   - The given inequalities are:\n     - Row 1: _ > _   _ > _\n     - Row 2: _   3   _   4\n     - Row 3: _   4   3   2\n     - Row 4: _   _   _   _\n\n2. **Analyze Row 3:**\n   - The numbers 4, 3, and 2 are already placed. The missing number is 1.\n   - Since 1 is the only number missing, it must be placed in the first column of Row 3.\n   - Row 3 becomes: 1   4   3   2\n\n3. **Analyze Row 2:**\n   - The numbers 3 and 4 are already placed. The missing numbers are 1 and 2.\n   - Since there are no inequalities in Row 2, we can place 1 and 2 in the remaining positions.\n   - However, we must ensure that the columns also contain unique numbers.\n   - Column 2 already has a 4 in Row 3, so Row 2, Column 2 must be 1.\n   - Row 2 becomes: 2   3   1   4\n\n4. **Analyze Row 1:**\n   - The inequalities are: _ > _   _ > _\n   - The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n   - The inequalities suggest that the numbers must be in descending order.\n   - Therefore, Row 1 must be: 4 > 3   2 > 1\n   - Row 1 becomes: 4   3   2   1\n\n5. **Analyze Row 4:**\n   - The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n   - We must ensure that each column contains unique numbers.\n   - Column 1 already has 1 in Row 3, so Row 4, Column 1 must be 2.\n   - Column 2 already has 3 in Row 2, so Row 4, Column 2 must be 1.\n   - Column 3 already has 2 in Row 1, so Row 4, Column 3 must be 4.\n   - The remaining number for Row 4, Column 4 is 3.\n   - Row 4 becomes: 2   1   4   3\n\n6. **Final Grid:**\n   - Row 1: 4   3   2   1\n   - Row 2: 2   3   1   4\n   - Row 3: 1   4   3   2\n   - Row 4: 2   1   4   3\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n4 > 3   2 > 1\n2   3   1   4\n1   4   3   2\n2   1   4   3\n>>>"
