    "To solve the 5x5 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 5 exactly once. Additionally, we must respect any inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is partially filled with numbers and has some inequality constraints.\n   - The given numbers are:\n     - Row 1: 3, 2, _, _, _\n     - Row 3: 5, _, 3, _, _\n     - Row 4: _, 5, _, 2, _\n     - Row 5: _, 4, 1, _, _\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - There are no explicit inequality constraints provided in the problem statement, so we assume there are none.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - **Row 1:** We have 3 and 2. The remaining numbers are 1, 4, and 5. Since there are no constraints, we can try different combinations.\n   - **Row 2:** All numbers are missing. We need to place 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n   - **Row 3:** We have 5 and 3. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 4.\n   - **Row 4:** We have 5 and 2. The remaining numbers are 1, 3, and 4.\n   - **Row 5:** We have 4 and 1. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 5.\n\n4. **Column Constraints:**\n   - **Column 1:** We have 3, 5, and need 1, 2, 4.\n   - **Column 2:** We have 2, 5, 4, and need 1, 3.\n   - **Column 3:** We have 3, 1, and need 2, 4, 5.\n   - **Column 4:** We have 2, and need 1, 3, 4, 5.\n   - **Column 5:** We have 2, and need 1, 3, 4, 5.\n\n5. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - By trial and error, ensuring each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 5, we fill the grid.\n\n6. **Final Solution:**\n   - Row 1: 3, 2, 5, 1, 4\n   - Row 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 2\n   - Row 3: 5, 1, 3, 4, 2\n   - Row 4: 4, 5, 2, 2, 3\n   - Row 5: 2, 4, 1, 3, 5\n\nThe completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n3 2 5 1 4\n1 3 4 5 2\n5 1 3 4 2\n4 5 2 2 3\n2 4 1 3 5\n```\n\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the solution as Row 4 has two 2s. Let's correct this:\n\n- Row 4 should be: 4, 5, 2, 3, 1\n\nThe corrected solution is:\n\n```\n3 2 5 1 4\n1 3 4 5 2\n5 1 3 4 2\n4 5 2 3 1\n2 4 1 3 5\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n3 2 5 1 4\n1 3 4 5 2\n5 1 3 4 2\n4 5 2 3 1\n2 4 1 3 5\n>>>"
