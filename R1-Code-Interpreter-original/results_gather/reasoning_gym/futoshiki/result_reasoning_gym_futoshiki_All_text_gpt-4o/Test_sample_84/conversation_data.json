    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and constraints:**\n   - The grid has some numbers already filled in, and there are inequality constraints between some cells.\n   - The constraints are either horizontal (<, >) or vertical (∧, ∨).\n\n2. **Start with the given numbers:**\n   - Use the numbers already filled in to determine possible values for the empty cells in the same row or column.\n\n3. **Apply the inequality constraints:**\n   - Use the constraints to further narrow down the possibilities for each cell.\n   - For example, if a cell must be less than another, it cannot be 9 if the other cell is not filled yet.\n\n4. **Use process of elimination:**\n   - For each row and column, determine which numbers are missing and try to place them in the empty cells, respecting the constraints.\n\n5. **Iterate and refine:**\n   - As you fill in more numbers, revisit previous decisions to ensure they still hold.\n   - Adjust as necessary if a contradiction arises.\n\n6. **Check for consistency:**\n   - Ensure that all rows and columns contain unique numbers from 1 to 9.\n   - Verify that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nFollowing these steps, we can fill in the grid:\n\n```\n1 < 7   8   5   9   3   6   2   4\n        ∨                   ∧    \n2 < 6   9   4   1   8   5 < 9   7\n                            ∨    \n7   2   3   8   5   9   4   1   6\n                ∨                \n5   4   6 > 7   2   1 < 8   3 < 9\n                                 \n3   8 > 2   4   6   9   7   5   1\n                                ∨\n9   5 < 7   3   1   6   8 < 7   2\n                                 \n4 > 5   9   6   8   7 > 2 > 1   3\n                                 \n6 < 3   1   2 < 7   4   9   8   5\n                ∨                \n8   1   5 < 9   4   2   3   4   8\n```\n\nThe final solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1 < 7   8   5   9   3   6   2   4\n        ∨                   ∧    \n2 < 6   9   4   1   8   5 < 9   7\n                            ∨    \n7   2   3   8   5   9   4   1   6\n                ∨                \n5   4   6 > 7   2   1 < 8   3 < 9\n                                 \n3   8 > 2   4   6   9   7   5   1\n                                ∨\n9   5 < 7   3   1   6   8 < 7   2\n                                 \n4 > 5   9   6   8   7 > 2 > 1   3\n                                 \n6 < 3   1   2 < 7   4   9   8   5\n                ∨                \n8   1   5 < 9   4   2   3   4   8\n>>>"
