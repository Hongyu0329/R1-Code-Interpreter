    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers 1 to 4 such that each number appears exactly once in each row and column, while also respecting the inequality constraints provided.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 4x4 with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The given numbers are:\n     - Row 2, Column 3: 2\n     - Row 3, Column 2: 4\n     - Row 4, Column 3: 3\n     - Row 4, Column 4: 2\n   - The inequality constraints are:\n     - Row 2, Column 1 > Row 3, Column 1\n     - Row 2, Column 2 > Row 3, Column 2\n\n2. **Analyze the Constraints:**\n   - The constraints in the second column imply that Row 2, Column 2 must be greater than 4 (Row 3, Column 2), which is not possible since 4 is the maximum number. Therefore, Row 2, Column 2 must be 3, and Row 3, Column 2 is 4.\n   - The constraints in the first column imply that Row 2, Column 1 must be greater than Row 3, Column 1. Since Row 3, Column 1 cannot be 4 (as 4 is in Row 3, Column 2), Row 3, Column 1 must be 1, and Row 2, Column 1 must be 2.\n\n3. **Fill in the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers must be 1, 2, 3, 4. Since there are no constraints, we can place them in any order.\n   - **Row 2:** We have 2 in Column 1, 3 in Column 2, and 2 in Column 3. The only number left for Column 4 is 1.\n   - **Row 3:** We have 1 in Column 1, 4 in Column 2. The numbers left are 2 and 3. Since Column 3 already has 3, Row 3, Column 3 must be 2, and Row 3, Column 4 must be 3.\n   - **Row 4:** We have 3 in Column 3, 2 in Column 4. The numbers left are 1 and 4. Since Column 1 already has 1, Row 4, Column 1 must be 4, and Row 4, Column 2 must be 1.\n\n4. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure they contain numbers 1 to 4 exactly once.\n   - Ensure all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n1   2   3   4\n             \n2   3   2   1\n∧   ∧        \n1   4   2   3\n             \n4   1   3   2\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1 2 3 4\n2 3 2 1\n1 4 2 3\n4 1 3 2\n>>>"
