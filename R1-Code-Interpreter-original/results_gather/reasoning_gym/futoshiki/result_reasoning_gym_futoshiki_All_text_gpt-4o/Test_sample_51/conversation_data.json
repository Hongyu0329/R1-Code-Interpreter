    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 7, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 7x7 with some numbers and inequality constraints already provided.\n   - We need to fill in the blanks while respecting the constraints.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - The constraints are given as inequalities between adjacent cells, either horizontally or vertically.\n   - For example, in the first row, the constraint is `_ ∨ 3`, meaning the number above 3 must be less than 3.\n\n3. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - Each row and column must contain the numbers 1 to 7 without repetition.\n   - We can use the given numbers and constraints to deduce the possible numbers for each blank cell.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Start with rows or columns with the most numbers filled in or with the most constraints.\n   - Use the constraints to limit the possibilities for each blank cell.\n   - Use logical deduction to fill in the numbers, ensuring no repetition in rows and columns.\n\n5. **Iterative Process:**\n   - After filling in some numbers, re-evaluate the constraints and possibilities for the remaining blanks.\n   - Continue this process iteratively until the grid is completely filled.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - Once the grid is filled, verify that all constraints are satisfied and that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 7 exactly once.\n\nFollowing this methodical approach, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n1   3   5   7   4   2   6\n∨                        \n5   6   4 > 1   3   7 > 2\n∨                        \n7   1   3 > 5   2 < 6   4\n                ∧        \n3 > 1   6   2   5   4   7\n        ∨       ∧       ∨\n2   7 > 1   5   6 > 3   4\n∧                   ∧    \n4   2   3   6   7   5   1\n∨                   ∨   ∧\n6   5   2   4   6   1 < 3\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   3   5   7   4   2   6\n∨                        \n5   6   4 > 1   3   7 > 2\n∨                        \n7   1   3 > 5   2 < 6   4\n                ∧        \n3 > 1   6   2   5   4   7\n        ∨       ∧       ∨\n2   7 > 1   5   6 > 3   4\n∧                   ∧    \n4   2   3   6   7   5   1\n∨                   ∨   ∧\n6   5   2   4   6   1 < 3\n>>>"
