    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 8, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols ∧, ∨, <, and >.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have some numbers already filled in the grid, and we need to fill in the blanks.\n   - The constraints are given by the inequality symbols between some cells.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - The constraints guide us on the relative size of numbers in adjacent cells.\n   - For example, if a cell has a ∧ above it, the number in that cell must be greater than the number in the cell above it.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - Start by filling in the numbers that are directly constrained by inequalities and already filled numbers.\n   - Use the process of elimination to determine which numbers can fit in each blank cell, considering the constraints and the requirement that each number from 1 to 8 must appear exactly once in each row and column.\n\n4. **Iterative Solving:**\n   - Use logical deduction to fill in the cells one by one.\n   - If a cell has only one possible number that can fit, fill it in.\n   - Continue this process, updating possibilities for each cell as numbers are filled in.\n\n5. **Checking:**\n   - After filling in the grid, ensure that all constraints are satisfied.\n   - Verify that each row and column contains all numbers from 1 to 8 without repetition.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n1   2   3   6   4   7   5   8\n∧                           ∨\n5   7   4   2   3   8   6   1\n∨                            \n3   6   8   7   1 > 2 < 4   5\n                             \n4   1   7   5   6   7 < 8   2\n                            ∧\n8   5   2   4   7   3   1   6\n                            ∧\n6   3   5   8 > 1   4 < 7   9\n        ∨                    \n7   4   1   6   5   2 > 3   8\n        ∧                    \n2   8   6   3   9   5   3   7\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   2   3   6   4   7   5   8\n∧                           ∨\n5   7   4   2   3   8   6   1\n∨                            \n3   6   8   7   1 > 2 < 4   5\n                             \n4   1   7   5   6   7 < 8   2\n                            ∧\n8   5   2   4   7   3   1   6\n                            ∧\n6   3   5   8 > 1   4 < 7   9\n        ∨                    \n7   4   1   6   5   2 > 3   8\n        ∧                    \n2   8   6   3   9   5   3   7\n>>>"
