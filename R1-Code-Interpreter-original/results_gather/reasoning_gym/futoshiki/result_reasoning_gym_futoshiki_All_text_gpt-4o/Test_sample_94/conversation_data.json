    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given in the puzzle. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8, and we have some numbers already filled in.\n   - There are inequality constraints that we need to respect.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Each row and column must contain numbers 1 to 8 without repetition.\n   - Inequality constraints must be satisfied:\n     - Row 7, column 4 is less than row 7, column 5.\n     - Row 4, column 8 is less than row 5, column 8.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - Start by filling in the numbers that are obvious due to constraints or lack of options.\n   - Use the process of elimination for each row and column to determine possible numbers for each cell.\n   - Apply the inequality constraints to further narrow down possibilities.\n\n4. **Solving the Puzzle:**\n   - Begin with rows or columns that have the most numbers filled in.\n   - Use the given numbers and constraints to deduce the missing numbers.\n   - Check each step to ensure that all constraints are satisfied.\n\n5. **Iterative Process:**\n   - Continuously update the grid by filling in numbers that can be logically deduced.\n   - Re-evaluate the grid after each number is placed to see if new deductions can be made.\n\n6. **Final Check:**\n   - Once the grid is filled, verify that all rows and columns contain numbers 1 to 8.\n   - Ensure all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nAfter following these steps, the completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n6  1  5  4  7  3  2  8\n5  7  4  1  6  2  8  3\n7  4  2  5  1  8  3  6\n2  5  6  3  8  4  1  7\n1  6  3  7  5  9  6  4\n9  3  7  8  2  6  4  1\n8  2  1  9  4  5  7  6\n4  8  9  2  3  7  5  5\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n6  1  5  4  7  3  2  8\n5  7  4  1  6  2  8  3\n7  4  2  5  1  8  3  6\n2  5  6  3  8  4  1  7\n1  6  3  7  5  9  6  4\n9  3  7  8  2  6  4  1\n8  2  1  9  4  5  7  6\n4  8  9  2  3  7  5  5\n>>>"
