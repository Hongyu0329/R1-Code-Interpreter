    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 7 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 7x7, and we have some numbers and inequality constraints already provided.\n   - We need to fill in the blanks while respecting these constraints.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - The constraints are given as inequalities between adjacent cells, either horizontally or vertically.\n   - For example, in the second row, we have \"6 > _ > 4 > _ 1 _\", which means the numbers must decrease from left to right.\n\n3. **Filling Known Values:**\n   - Start by filling in the numbers that are already given in the puzzle.\n   - Use the constraints to deduce possible values for the blanks.\n\n4. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - Each row and column must contain the numbers 1 to 7 exactly once.\n   - Use this rule to eliminate possibilities for each blank cell.\n\n5. **Iterative Solving:**\n   - Use a process of elimination and logical deduction to fill in the blanks.\n   - Check each row and column for missing numbers and use the constraints to determine their positions.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - After filling in all the blanks, verify that all constraints are satisfied.\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 7 exactly once.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n4   1   5   3   7   6   2\n    ∧   ∧           ∨   ∧\n7   6 > 2 > 4 > 5   1   3\n                ∧   ∧   ∨\n1   2   3   7 < 6   4   5\n                        ∨\n5 > 7 > 6 > 1   2   7   3\n∨   ∧           ∧   ∨   ∧\n3   5 > 4   2   3   6   1\n    ∨           ∨        \n6   3   7   4   1 < 5   2\n                         \n2   4 < 1   5   2   3   7\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n4   1   5   3   7   6   2\n    ∧   ∧           ∨   ∧\n7   6 > 2 > 4 > 5   1   3\n                ∧   ∧   ∨\n1   2   3   7 < 6   4   5\n                        ∨\n5 > 7 > 6 > 1   2   7   3\n∨   ∧           ∧   ∨   ∧\n3   5 > 4   2   3   6   1\n    ∨           ∨        \n6   3   7   4   1 < 5   2\n                         \n2   4 < 1   5   2   3   7\n>>>"
