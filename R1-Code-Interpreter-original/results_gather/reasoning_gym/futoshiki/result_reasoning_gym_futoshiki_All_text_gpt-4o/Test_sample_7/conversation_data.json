    "To solve the 5x5 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints provided.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5 with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The given numbers are:\n     - Row 1: _ _ _ 1 4\n     - Row 2: _ > _ 3 _ _\n     - Row 3: _ _ > 1 _ 3\n     - Row 4: _ _ _ _ > 2\n     - Row 5: _ _ > _ _ _\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Row 2, Column 1 is greater than Row 2, Column 2.\n   - Row 3, Column 2 is greater than Row 3, Column 3.\n   - Row 4, Column 4 is greater than Row 4, Column 5.\n   - Row 5, Column 3 is greater than Row 5, Column 4.\n   - Row 1, Column 5 is greater than Row 2, Column 5.\n   - Row 4, Column 1 is greater than Row 5, Column 1.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers 1 and 4 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 5. Since there are no constraints affecting these positions directly, we can try different combinations. However, we must ensure that the column constraints are respected.\n   - **Row 2:** The number 3 is placed in the third column. The first column must be greater than the second column. The fifth column must be less than the first row's fifth column.\n   - **Row 3:** The number 1 is placed in the third column, and 3 is in the fifth column. The second column must be greater than the third column.\n   - **Row 4:** The fifth column must be less than the fourth column.\n   - **Row 5:** The third column must be greater than the fourth column. The first column must be less than the fourth row's first column.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers 2, 3, and 5 can be placed in the first three columns. After testing combinations, we find that 5, 2, 3, 1, 4 works.\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers 1, 2, 4, and 5 need to be placed. Considering the constraints, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1 works.\n   - **Row 3:** The numbers 2, 4, and 5 need to be placed. Considering the constraints, 5, 4, 1, 2, 3 works.\n   - **Row 4:** The numbers 1, 3, 4, and 5 need to be placed. Considering the constraints, 3, 1, 5, 4, 2 works.\n   - **Row 5:** The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 need to be placed. Considering the constraints, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1 works.\n\n5. **Final Grid:**\n   - Row 1: 5 2 3 1 4\n   - Row 2: 4 5 3 2 1\n   - Row 3: 5 4 1 2 3\n   - Row 4: 3 1 5 4 2\n   - Row 5: 2 3 4 5 1\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n5 2 3 1 4\n  >     ∧\n4 > 5 3 2 1\n         \n5 4 > 1 2 3\n         \n3 1 5 4 > 2\n∨       ∨\n2 3 > 4 5 1\n>>>"
