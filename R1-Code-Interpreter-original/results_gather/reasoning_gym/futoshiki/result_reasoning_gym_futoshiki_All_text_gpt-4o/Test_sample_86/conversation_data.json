    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols '>', '<', '∧', and '∨'.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Given Numbers and Constraints:**\n   - The grid has some numbers already filled in, which will help us deduce the missing numbers.\n   - Inequality constraints are given between some cells, indicating that one number must be greater or less than its neighbor.\n\n2. **Apply Constraints:**\n   - Use the inequality constraints to limit the possible values for each cell.\n   - For example, if a cell has a '>' constraint with its neighbor, the number in that cell must be greater than the number in the neighboring cell.\n\n3. **Use Deduction:**\n   - Start with rows, columns, or cells with the most constraints or given numbers, as these will be easier to fill.\n   - Use the process of elimination to determine which numbers can fit in each cell, considering both the row and column constraints.\n\n4. **Iterate and Refine:**\n   - As you fill in more numbers, revisit previous deductions to see if new information allows you to fill in more cells.\n   - Ensure that each step respects the Futoshiki rules and constraints.\n\n5. **Check for Consistency:**\n   - After filling in the grid, verify that all rows and columns contain each number from 1 to 9 exactly once.\n   - Ensure all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n5   4   8   1   7 > 3   6   2   9\n                                 \n9   1   6   2   3   7   5   8   4\n        ∨                        \n2   6   7   5   1   4   9   3   8\n            ∨           ∨        \n7   2   1   4   8   5   3   6   9\n                        ∧        \n3   8   5   9   6   2   4   5 < 7\n∧                                \n6   9   3   8   4   1   1   7   5\n                            ∨    \n1   7   4   6   5   9   2 > 4   3\n                                 \n4   5   2   5   9   6 > 7   1   8\n        ∨                        \n8   3   9   7   2   8   1   9   6\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n5   4   8   1   7 > 3   6   2   9\n                                 \n9   1   6   2   3   7   5   8   4\n        ∨                        \n2   6   7   5   1   4   9   3   8\n            ∨           ∨        \n7   2   1   4   8   5   3   6   9\n                        ∧        \n3   8   5   9   6   2   4   5 < 7\n∧                                \n6   9   3   8   4   1   1   7   5\n                            ∨    \n1   7   4   6   5   9   2 > 4   3\n                                 \n4   5   2   5   9   6 > 7   1   8\n        ∨                        \n8   3   9   7   2   8   1   9   6\n>>>"
