    "To solve the 8x8 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - We have some numbers already filled in the grid.\n   - We have inequality constraints between some cells.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis**:\n   - The constraints are given as inequalities between adjacent cells, either horizontally or vertically.\n   - For example, in the first row, the last two cells have a constraint \"7 > 2\", meaning the cell with 7 must be greater than the cell with 2.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - Start by filling in the numbers that are already given.\n   - Use the constraints to deduce possible numbers for the empty cells.\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 8.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Filling**:\n   - **Row 1**: We have numbers 5, 3, 7, and 2. Use the constraints to fill in the rest.\n   - **Row 2**: We have numbers 4, 7, 1, and 3. Fill in the rest considering the constraints.\n   - **Row 3**: We have numbers 3, 7, 2, and 4. Fill in the rest.\n   - **Row 4**: We have a constraint \"7 > _ < _ > 1\". Use this to fill in the numbers.\n   - **Row 5**: We have numbers 1, 3, and 6. Fill in the rest.\n   - **Row 6**: We have numbers 8, 2, 4, 3, and 5. Fill in the rest.\n   - **Row 7**: We have numbers 2, 5, and 1. Fill in the rest.\n   - **Row 8**: This row is completely empty, so use the constraints from other rows and columns to fill it.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - After filling in the grid, verify that all rows and columns contain numbers 1 to 8 exactly once.\n   - Check that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nBy following these steps, we can solve the puzzle. Here is the completed puzzle:\n\n```\n6   8   5   3   4   1   7 > 2\n                        ∨    \n2   4   7   1   5   6   8   3\n                             \n3   1   6   7   8   5   2 < 4\n    ∧                        \n5   7 > 4 < 2   6 > 1   8   3\n                             \n8   2   1   5   3   7   6   4\n                        ∨    \n7   6   3   8   2   4   3   5\n∨                            \n4   3   2   6   7   5   8   1\n            ∨                \n1   5   8   4   6   2   3   7\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n6   8   5   3   4   1   7 > 2\n                        ∨    \n2   4   7   1   5   6   8   3\n                             \n3   1   6   7   8   5   2 < 4\n    ∧                        \n5   7 > 4 < 2   6 > 1   8   3\n                             \n8   2   1   5   3   7   6   4\n                        ∨    \n7   6   3   8   2   4   3   5\n∨                            \n4   3   2   6   7   5   8   1\n            ∨                \n1   5   8   4   6   2   3   7\n>>>"
