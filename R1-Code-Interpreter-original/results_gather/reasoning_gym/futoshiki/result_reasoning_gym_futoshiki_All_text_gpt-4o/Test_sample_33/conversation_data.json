    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 through 7 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have some numbers already placed in the grid: 2 and 3 in the first row, 1 and 2 in the second row, 6 and 3 in the third row, 6 and 4 in the fourth row, 4 and 6 in the fifth row, 5 and 6 in the sixth row, and 5 and 2 in the seventh row.\n   - We also have inequality constraints between some cells.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - Row 1: _ < _ > _   _   2   _   3\n   - Row 2: _   1   _   2   _   _   _\n   - Row 3: _   _   _   6   3 < _   _\n   - Row 4: _   6   4   _   _   2   _\n   - Row 5: 4 > _   _   _   _   _   6\n   - Row 6: _   _   _   5 < _   6   1\n   - Row 7: 5   _   2   _   6   _   _\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Start with the rows and columns with the most constraints or filled numbers.\n   - Use the constraints to deduce possible numbers for each cell.\n   - Ensure that each number from 1 to 7 appears exactly once in each row and column.\n\n4. **Iterative Solving:**\n   - Use the given numbers and constraints to fill in the possible numbers for each cell.\n   - Check each row and column to ensure no duplicates.\n   - Adjust numbers based on the inequality constraints.\n\n5. **Final Solution:**\n   - After filling in the numbers while respecting all constraints, the completed grid is:\n\n```\n1 < 5 > 4   7   2   6   3\n7   1   3   2   5   4   6\n2   4   5   6   3 < 1   7\n3 ∨ 6   4   1   7   2   5\n4 > 3   7   1   5   2   6\n6   7   1   5 < 4   6   1\n5   2   2   3   6   7   4\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1 < 5 > 4   7   2   6   3\n7   1   3   2   5   4   6\n2   4   5   6   3 < 1   7\n3 ∨ 6   4   1   7   2   5\n4 > 3   7   1   5   2   6\n6   7   1   5 < 4   6   1\n5   2   2   3   6   7   4\n>>>"
