    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   _   _   3   2\n               \n   _ < _   _   _\n           ∨    \n   _   2   _   3\n               \n   _   1   _   _\n   ```\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - The third column of the first row is 3, and the fourth column is 2.\n   - The second row has a horizontal constraint: the first cell is less than the second cell.\n   - The third row has a vertical constraint: the second cell is greater than the cell below it.\n   - The third row has the second column as 2 and the fourth column as 3.\n   - The fourth row has the second column as 1.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:** We have 3 and 2 in the third and fourth columns, respectively. The remaining numbers for this row are 1 and 4. Since there are no constraints affecting these two numbers, we can place them in the first and second columns in any order. Let's try placing 1 in the first column and 4 in the second column.\n     ```\n     1   4   3   2\n     ```\n\n   - **Row 2:** We have a constraint that the first cell is less than the second cell. The possible numbers for this row are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since 3 and 2 are already used in the first row, we can use 1 and 4. The only way to satisfy the constraint is to place 1 in the first column and 4 in the second column. The remaining numbers are 2 and 3, which can be placed in the third and fourth columns, respectively.\n     ```\n     1 < 4   2   3\n     ```\n\n   - **Row 3:** We have 2 in the second column and 3 in the fourth column. The remaining numbers are 1 and 4. The vertical constraint indicates that the second cell (2) is greater than the cell below it, which is 1. Therefore, we place 1 in the second column of the fourth row. The remaining numbers for the third row are 1 and 4, which can be placed in the first and third columns, respectively.\n     ```\n     4   2   1   3\n     ```\n\n   - **Row 4:** We have 1 in the second column. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 4. Since 3 is already used in the third column, we can place 2 in the first column and 4 in the third column.\n     ```\n     2   1   4   3\n     ```\n\n4. **Final Grid:**\n   ```\n   1   4   3   2\n   1 < 4   2   3\n   4   2   1   3\n   2   1   4   3\n   ```\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 4 exactly once.\n   - All inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<1 4 3 2\n1 < 4 2 3\n4 2 1 3\n2 1 4 3>>>"
