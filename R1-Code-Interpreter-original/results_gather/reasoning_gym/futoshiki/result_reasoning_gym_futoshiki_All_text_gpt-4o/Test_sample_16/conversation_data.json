    "To solve the 8x8 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 8 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - We have some numbers already filled in the grid. These numbers will help us determine the placement of other numbers.\n   - The inequality symbols provide additional constraints that must be satisfied.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis**:\n   - The symbols < and > between two cells indicate that the number on the left (or above) is less than (or greater than) the number on the right (or below).\n   - The symbols ∧ and ∨ indicate vertical constraints where the number above is greater (∧) or less (∨) than the number below.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Filling**:\n   - Start with rows or columns that have the most numbers filled in or have the most constraints, as these will provide more information.\n   - Use the constraints to deduce possible numbers for each blank cell.\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 8.\n\n4. **Iterative Process**:\n   - Fill in numbers that are certain based on the constraints and the numbers already placed.\n   - Use a process of elimination for cells with multiple possibilities, considering the constraints.\n   - Continuously check for consistency with the constraints and the rule of unique numbers in each row and column.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - Once all cells are filled, verify that all constraints are satisfied.\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains all numbers from 1 to 8 without repetition.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n2   1   4 < 7   6   8   5   3\n    ∧   ∨                   ∧\n6   5   3   4   1   2   8 < 7\n                    ∨        \n3   4   6   1   8   5   7 > 2\n                    ∨   ∧   ∨\n5   8 < 7   3   2   6   1   4\n            ∨                \n7   3   2   5   4   1   3   6\n    ∧       ∨       ∧        \n1   6 < 8   2 < 3   7   4   5\n                        ∧    \n8 > 7 < 1   5 < 4 > 2   6   3\n                             \n4   2   5   6 > 3   7   1   8\n```\n\nThus, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n2   1   4 < 7   6   8   5   3\n    ∧   ∨                   ∧\n6   5   3   4   1   2   8 < 7\n                    ∨        \n3   4   6   1   8   5   7 > 2\n                    ∨   ∧   ∨\n5   8 < 7   3   2   6   1   4\n            ∨                \n7   3   2   5   4   1   3   6\n    ∧       ∨       ∧        \n1   6 < 8   2 < 3   7   4   5\n                        ∧    \n8 > 7 < 1   5 < 4 > 2   6   3\n                             \n4   2   5   6 > 3   7   1   8\n>>>"
