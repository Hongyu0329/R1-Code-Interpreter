    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is a 4x4 matrix with some numbers already filled in and some inequality constraints.\n   - The given numbers are:\n     - Row 1, Column 4: 1\n     - Row 3, Column 2: 2\n     - Row 3, Column 4: 4\n     - Row 4, Column 1: 1\n     - Row 4, Column 3: 4\n   - The inequality constraint is:\n     - Row 3, Column 2 (2) is greater than Row 4, Column 2.\n\n2. **Analyze Constraints:**\n   - The constraint in Row 3, Column 2 (2) > Row 4, Column 2 implies that Row 4, Column 2 must be 1, since it's the only number less than 2 that hasn't been used in Row 4.\n\n3. **Fill in Known Values:**\n   - Row 4, Column 2: 1 (from the constraint analysis)\n   - Now Row 4 has numbers 1, 4, and 1. The only number missing is 3, which must go in Row 4, Column 4.\n\n4. **Complete Row 4:**\n   - Row 4: 1, 3, 4, 2\n\n5. **Complete Row 3:**\n   - Row 3 has numbers 2 and 4. The missing numbers are 1 and 3.\n   - Since Row 3, Column 1 must be less than Row 3, Column 2 (2), it must be 1.\n   - Therefore, Row 3, Column 3 must be 3.\n\n6. **Complete Row 3:**\n   - Row 3: 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n7. **Complete Row 1:**\n   - Row 1 has only one number, 1, in Column 4.\n   - The missing numbers are 2, 3, and 4.\n   - Since Row 1, Column 1 must be less than Row 1, Column 2, and Row 1, Column 2 must be less than Row 1, Column 3, the only possible order is 2, 3, 4.\n\n8. **Complete Row 1:**\n   - Row 1: 2, 3, 4, 1\n\n9. **Complete Row 2:**\n   - Row 2 is missing all numbers.\n   - The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n   - Since Row 2, Column 1 must be less than Row 2, Column 2, and Row 2, Column 2 must be less than Row 2, Column 3, the only possible order is 3, 4, 1, 2.\n\n10. **Complete Row 2:**\n    - Row 2: 3, 4, 1, 2\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n2   3   4   1\n             \n3   4   1   2\n             \n1   2   3   4\n    ∧        \n1   3   4   2\n```\n\nThus, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<2 3 4 1\n3 4 1 2\n1 2 3 4\n1 3 4 2>>>"
