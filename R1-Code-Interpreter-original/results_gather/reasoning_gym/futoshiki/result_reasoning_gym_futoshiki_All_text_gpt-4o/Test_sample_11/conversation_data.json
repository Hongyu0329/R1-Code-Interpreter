    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also satisfying the inequality constraints given.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 4x4, and we need to fill it with numbers 1 to 4.\n   - The given constraints are:\n     - Row 1: _ 3 < _ > _\n     - Row 2: _ > _ _ _\n     - Row 3: _ _ > _ < _\n     - Row 4: _ 1 _ _\n\n2. **Analyze Constraints:**\n   - Row 1: The second cell is 3. The first cell must be less than the third cell, and the third cell must be greater than the fourth cell.\n   - Row 2: The first cell must be greater than the second cell.\n   - Row 3: The second cell must be greater than the third cell, and the third cell must be less than the fourth cell.\n   - Row 4: The second cell is 1.\n\n3. **Fill in the Known Values:**\n   - Place 3 in the second cell of the first row.\n   - Place 1 in the second cell of the fourth row.\n\n4. **Use Constraints to Deduce Values:**\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - The sequence is _ 3 < _ > _.\n     - Possible numbers for the first cell are 1, 2, or 4.\n     - The third cell must be greater than 3, so it can only be 4.\n     - The fourth cell must be less than the third cell, so it can be 1 or 2.\n     - If the first cell is 1, the sequence becomes 1 3 < 4 > 2, which satisfies all constraints.\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - The sequence is _ > _ _ _.\n     - The first cell must be greater than the second cell.\n     - Possible numbers for the first cell are 2, 3, or 4.\n     - If the first cell is 4, the sequence becomes 4 > 3 1 2, which satisfies all constraints.\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - The sequence is _ _ > _ < _.\n     - The second cell must be greater than the third cell, and the third cell must be less than the fourth cell.\n     - Possible numbers for the second cell are 2, 3, or 4.\n     - If the second cell is 2, the sequence becomes 3 2 > 1 < 4, which satisfies all constraints.\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - The sequence is _ 1 _ _.\n     - The second cell is 1.\n     - Possible numbers for the first cell are 2, 3, or 4.\n     - If the first cell is 2, the sequence becomes 2 1 4 3, which satisfies all constraints.\n\n5. **Verify Columns:**\n   - Ensure each column contains numbers 1 to 4 exactly once.\n   - Column 1: 1, 4, 3, 2\n   - Column 2: 3, 2, 2, 1\n   - Column 3: 4, 1, 1, 4\n   - Column 4: 2, 3, 4, 3\n\n6. **Final Solution:**\n   - The completed grid is:\n     ```\n     1 3 4 2\n     4 2 1 3\n     3 2 1 4\n     2 1 4 3\n     ```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1 3 < 4 > 2\n∧   ∨   ∨    \n4 > 2   1   3\n        ∨    \n3   2 > 1 < 4\n∧            \n2   1   4   3\n>>>"
