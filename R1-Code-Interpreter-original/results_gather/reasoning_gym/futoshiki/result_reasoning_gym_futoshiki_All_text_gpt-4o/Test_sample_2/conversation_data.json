    "To solve the 8x8 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given by the symbols >, <, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and constraints:**\n   - The grid has some numbers already filled in, and there are inequality constraints between some cells.\n   - The constraints are either horizontal (>, <) or vertical (∧, ∨).\n\n2. **Start with the rows and columns with the most information:**\n   - Row 3 has the numbers 7, 8, and 2 already placed, and a constraint 2 > _.\n   - Row 4 has the numbers 7, 1, 4, and 6, with constraints 4 ∧ and 6 > _.\n   - Row 5 has the numbers 6 and 5, with constraints _ < 5 and 5 > 2.\n   - Row 6 has the number 8, with constraints 8 > 2 and _ ∨.\n   - Row 7 has the numbers 4, 8, 3, 6, and 2, with constraints 4 > _ and _ > 3.\n   - Row 8 has the number 3, with constraints 3 > 1.\n\n3. **Use the constraints to deduce possible numbers:**\n   - For Row 3, since 2 > _, the number in the next cell must be less than 2.\n   - For Row 4, since 4 ∧, the number above 4 in Row 3 must be less than 4.\n   - For Row 5, since _ < 5, the number before 5 must be less than 5.\n   - For Row 6, since 8 > 2, the number after 8 must be less than 8.\n   - For Row 7, since 4 > _, the number after 4 must be less than 4.\n   - For Row 8, since 3 > 1, the number after 3 must be less than 3.\n\n4. **Fill in the numbers while respecting the constraints:**\n   - Start filling in the numbers in rows and columns with the most constraints and given numbers.\n   - Use the process of elimination to determine which numbers can fit in each cell.\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once.\n\n5. **Check the solution:**\n   - Verify that all rows and columns contain the numbers 1 to 8.\n   - Ensure all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing and filling in the grid, the completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n1   2   6   3   7 > 5   8   4\n                ∨            \n5   4   5   2   1   8 > 6   7\n                    ∨        \n7   3   1   8   2 > 4   5   6\n    ∧           ∧   ∧       ∨\n6   7   2   1   4   6   3 > 8\n                ∧            \n3   6   4   7 < 5   1 > 2   5\n                    ∧        \n8 > 2   7   5   6   3   4   1\n                    ∨       ∨\n4 > 5   8   6   1 > 3   6   2\n∧                            \n2   1   3   4   3   7 > 1   5\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   2   6   3   7 > 5   8   4\n                ∨            \n5   4   5   2   1   8 > 6   7\n                    ∨        \n7   3   1   8   2 > 4   5   6\n    ∧           ∧   ∧       ∨\n6   7   2   1   4   6   3 > 8\n                ∧            \n3   6   4   7 < 5   1 > 2   5\n                    ∧        \n8 > 2   7   5   6   3   4   1\n                    ∨       ∨\n4 > 5   8   6   1 > 3   6   2\n∧                            \n2   1   3   4   3   7 > 1   5\n>>>"
