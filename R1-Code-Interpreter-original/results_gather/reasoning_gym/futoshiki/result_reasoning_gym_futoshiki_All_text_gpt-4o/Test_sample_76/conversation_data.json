    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 5 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5 with some numbers already filled in.\n   - There are inequality constraints between some cells.\n\n2. **Given Numbers:**\n   - Row 1: 5 _ 2 _ 4\n   - Row 2: 2 _ _ 1 < _\n   - Row 3: 4 _ 3 _ _\n   - Row 4: _ _ _ _ _\n   - Row 5: _ _ 4 5 _\n\n3. **Inequality Constraints:**\n   - Row 2, Column 4 < Column 5\n   - Row 3, Column 3 ∧ Column 4\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers 5, 2, and 4 are already placed. The missing numbers are 1 and 3. Since there are no constraints affecting Row 1, we can place 1 and 3 in the remaining positions.\n     - Possible placements: 5 1 2 3 4 or 5 3 2 1 4. However, placing 1 in the second position and 3 in the fourth position satisfies the constraints in other rows and columns better.\n\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers 2 and 1 are already placed. The missing numbers are 3, 4, and 5. The constraint 1 < _ indicates that the number in the last column must be greater than 1. Therefore, it can be 3, 4, or 5. However, since 4 is already in Column 5 (Row 5), the only possible number for Column 5 in Row 2 is 5. This leaves 3 and 4 for the remaining positions.\n     - Possible placements: 2 4 5 1 3.\n\n   - **Row 3:** The numbers 4 and 3 are already placed. The missing numbers are 1, 2, and 5. The constraint 3 ∧ _ indicates that the number in Column 4 must be greater than 3. Therefore, it can be 4 or 5. However, since 4 is already in Row 3, the only possible number for Column 4 in Row 3 is 5. This leaves 1 and 2 for the remaining positions.\n     - Possible placements: 4 1 3 5 2.\n\n   - **Row 4:** All numbers are missing. We need to place 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. By checking the columns, we can deduce the following:\n     - Column 1: 5, 2, 4 are already used, so possible numbers are 1, 3.\n     - Column 2: 1, 2, 4 are already used, so possible numbers are 3, 5.\n     - Column 3: 2, 3, 4 are already used, so possible numbers are 1, 5.\n     - Column 4: 1, 3, 5 are already used, so possible numbers are 2, 4.\n     - Column 5: 4, 5 are already used, so possible numbers are 1, 2, 3.\n     - By trial and error, we find the correct placement: 3 5 1 2 4.\n\n   - **Row 5:** The numbers 4 and 5 are already placed. The missing numbers are 1, 2, and 3. By checking the columns, we can deduce the following:\n     - Column 1: 5, 2, 4, 3 are already used, so the only possible number is 1.\n     - Column 2: 1, 2, 4, 5 are already used, so the only possible number is 3.\n     - Column 3: 2, 3, 4, 5 are already used, so the only possible number is 1.\n     - Column 4: 1, 3, 5, 2 are already used, so the only possible number is 4.\n     - Column 5: 4, 5, 1, 3 are already used, so the only possible number is 2.\n     - Correct placement: 1 3 4 5 2.\n\n5. **Final Solution:**\n   - Row 1: 5 1 2 3 4\n   - Row 2: 2 4 5 1 3\n   - Row 3: 4 1 3 5 2\n   - Row 4: 3 5 1 2 4\n   - Row 5: 1 3 4 5 2\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n5 1 2 3 4\n2 4 5 1 3\n4 1 3 5 2\n3 5 1 2 4\n1 3 4 5 2\n>>>"
