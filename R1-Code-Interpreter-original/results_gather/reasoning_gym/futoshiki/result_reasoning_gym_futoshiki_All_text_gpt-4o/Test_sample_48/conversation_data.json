    "To solve the 6x6 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 6, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and constraints:**\n   - Row 1: _   _ > _   3 < _ < 5\n   - Row 2: _   _ < 6   _   1   _\n   - Row 3: _ > 1   _   5 > _   4\n   - Row 4: _   3 < _ > _ < 6   _\n   - Row 5: 4   _   _   _   _   _\n   - Row 6: _   _ > _ < _   _   _\n\n   Vertical constraints:\n   - Between Row 2 and Row 3, columns 1, 4, and 6 have ∧ constraints.\n   - Between Row 3 and Row 4, column 6 has a ∨ constraint.\n   - Between Row 4 and Row 5, columns 3 and 5 have ∨ constraints.\n\n2. **Start filling in the grid using constraints:**\n   - Row 1: The number 3 is given, and it must be less than the number to its right, which is less than 5. Therefore, the sequence must be 3, 4, 5.\n   - Row 2: The number 6 is given, and it must be greater than the number to its left. The number 1 is also given.\n   - Row 3: The number 1 is given, and it must be less than the number to its right. The number 5 is given, and it must be greater than the number to its right, which is less than 4.\n   - Row 4: The number 3 is given, and it must be less than the number to its right, which is greater than the number to its right, which is less than 6.\n   - Row 5: The number 4 is given.\n   - Row 6: The number to the right of the first blank must be greater than the first blank, and the number to the right of the third blank must be less than the third blank.\n\n3. **Use logical deduction to fill in the blanks:**\n   - Row 1: The sequence is 2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5.\n   - Row 2: The sequence is 5, 2, 6, 4, 1, 3.\n   - Row 3: The sequence is 6, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4.\n   - Row 4: The sequence is 2, 3, 5, 1, 4, 6.\n   - Row 5: The sequence is 4, 6, 2, 3, 5, 1.\n   - Row 6: The sequence is 3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 4.\n\n4. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure they contain numbers 1 to 6 without repetition.\n   - Ensure all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final solution to the puzzle is:\n\n```\n2   1 > 4   3 < 6 < 5\n5   2 < 6   4   1   3\n6 > 1   3   5 > 2   4\n2   3 < 5 > 1 < 6   4\n4   6   2   3   5   1\n3   5 > 1 < 6   2   4\n```\n\nThus, the answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n2   1 > 4   3 < 6 < 5\n5   2 < 6   4   1   3\n6 > 1   3   5 > 2   4\n2   3 < 5 > 1 < 6   4\n4   6   2   3   5   1\n3   5 > 1 < 6   2   4\n>>>"
