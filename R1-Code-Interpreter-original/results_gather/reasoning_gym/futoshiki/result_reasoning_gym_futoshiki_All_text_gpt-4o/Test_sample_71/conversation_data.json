    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The grid is 9x9 with some numbers already filled in.\n   - Inequality constraints are given between some cells.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis**:\n   - Horizontal constraints (< and >) indicate that the number on the left is less than or greater than the number on the right, respectively.\n   - Vertical constraints (∧ and ∨) indicate that the number above is greater than or less than the number below, respectively.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - Start by filling in the numbers that are directly affected by the constraints and the given numbers.\n   - Use the constraints to deduce possible numbers for each blank cell.\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 9.\n\n4. **Iterative Solving**:\n   - Use logical deduction to fill in the cells step by step.\n   - If a cell has only one possible number due to constraints, fill it in.\n   - Continuously check rows, columns, and constraints to narrow down possibilities.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - After filling in the grid, verify that all constraints are satisfied.\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n7   4 < 8   9 > 1 < 6   5 > 2 < 3\n            ∨   ∧   ∧           ∨\n5 > 3   2 < 7   6 < 8   4   9   1\n∨       ∧                        \n4 < 6   7   5   9   7   2   1   3\n                                ∧\n3   9   1 < 2   5   4   7 < 8   6\n                            ∨    \n2   1 < 4   3   8   5 < 9   7   6\n                ∨       ∨        \n9   7 > 6   1   2   3   5 > 3   4\n                                 \n6   8   5   4   7 > 3 < 2   1   9\n∧           ∧       ∨       ∧   ∨\n1   5   9 > 6   4   8   3   7   2\n                        ∧        \n8   2   3   5   1   6   4 > 9 < 8\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n7   4 < 8   9 > 1 < 6   5 > 2 < 3\n            ∨   ∧   ∧           ∨\n5 > 3   2 < 7   6 < 8   4   9   1\n∨       ∧                        \n4 < 6   7   5   9   7   2   1   3\n                                ∧\n3   9   1 < 2   5   4   7 < 8   6\n                            ∨    \n2   1 < 4   3   8   5 < 9   7   6\n                ∨       ∨        \n9   7 > 6   1   2   3   5 > 3   4\n                                 \n6   8   5   4   7 > 3 < 2   1   9\n∧           ∧       ∨       ∧   ∨\n1   5   9 > 6   4   8   3   7   2\n                        ∧        \n8   2   3   5   1   6   4 > 9 < 8\n>>>"
