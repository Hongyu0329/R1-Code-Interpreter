    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols ∧ (greater than) and ∨ (less than).\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5 with some numbers already filled in and some inequality constraints.\n   - The constraints are:\n     - Row 1, Column 4 (3) is less than Row 2, Column 4.\n     - Row 2, Column 1 (5) is greater than Row 3, Column 1.\n   - The numbers already filled in are:\n     - Row 1: _, _, _, 3, 4\n     - Row 2: 5, _, _, 4, _\n     - Row 3: _, _, 3, _, _\n     - Row 4: _, 5, _, _, 1\n     - Row 5: _, _, _, _, 2\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers 3 and 4 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 5. Since there are no constraints affecting these directly, we will consider other rows first.\n   - **Row 2:** The number 5 is already placed in the first column, and 4 is in the fourth column. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 3. The constraint indicates that the number in the fourth column of Row 2 must be greater than 3 (from Row 1), so it must be 4 or 5. Since 4 is already there, the number in Row 2, Column 4 must be 5, but 5 is already in Column 1. Therefore, the number in Row 2, Column 4 must be 4, which is already there. This means Row 2, Column 5 must be 3.\n   - **Row 3:** The number 3 is already placed in the third column. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 5. The constraint from Row 2, Column 1 (5) indicates that Row 3, Column 1 must be less than 5, so it can be 1, 2, or 4.\n   - **Row 4:** The numbers 5 and 1 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 4. There are no direct constraints affecting these, so we will consider other rows first.\n   - **Row 5:** The number 2 is already placed in the fifth column. The remaining numbers are 1, 3, 4, and 5. There are no direct constraints affecting these, so we will consider other rows first.\n\n3. **Filling in the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:** Since 3 and 4 are already placed, and there are no constraints, we can try placing 1, 2, and 5 in the remaining positions. After checking the columns, we find:\n     - Row 1, Column 1: 1\n     - Row 1, Column 2: 2\n     - Row 1, Column 3: 5\n   - **Row 2:** With 5, 4, and 3 already placed, the remaining numbers are 1 and 2. After checking the columns, we find:\n     - Row 2, Column 2: 1\n     - Row 2, Column 3: 2\n   - **Row 3:** With 3 already placed, and considering the constraint from Row 2, Column 1, we find:\n     - Row 3, Column 1: 4\n     - Row 3, Column 2: 1\n     - Row 3, Column 4: 5\n     - Row 3, Column 5: 2\n   - **Row 4:** With 5 and 1 already placed, the remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 4. After checking the columns, we find:\n     - Row 4, Column 3: 4\n     - Row 4, Column 4: 3\n     - Row 4, Column 5: 2\n   - **Row 5:** With 2 already placed, the remaining numbers are 1, 3, 4, and 5. After checking the columns, we find:\n     - Row 5, Column 1: 3\n     - Row 5, Column 2: 4\n     - Row 5, Column 3: 1\n     - Row 5, Column 4: 5\n\n4. **Final Grid:**\n   - Row 1: 1, 2, 5, 3, 4\n   - Row 2: 5, 1, 2, 4, 3\n   - Row 3: 4, 1, 3, 5, 2\n   - Row 4: 2, 5, 4, 3, 1\n   - Row 5: 3, 4, 1, 5, 2\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   2   5   3   4\n                ∨\n5   1   2   4   3\n    ∧            \n4   1   3   5   2\n                 \n2   5   4   3   1\n                 \n3   4   1   5   2\n>>>"
