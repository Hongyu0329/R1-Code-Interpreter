    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 8, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols '>', '<', '∧', and '∨'.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Observations:**\n   - The first row has numbers 2, 4, 5, and 6 already placed, with inequalities between some of the blanks.\n   - The second row has numbers 8 and 2 placed, with a '>' constraint between the second and third cells.\n   - The third row is almost complete, with only one blank.\n   - The fourth row has a '>' constraint at the start and a '<' constraint before the last number 7.\n   - The fifth row has a '<' constraint between the third and fourth cells and a '<' constraint before the last number.\n   - The sixth row has a '<' constraint at the start and a '>' constraint before the last number.\n   - The seventh row has numbers 4, 7, 3, and 5 placed, with a '∨' constraint at the start and a '∨' constraint before the last number.\n   - The eighth row has a '>' constraint between the second and third cells and a '∨' constraint before the last number.\n\n2. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - Start with the third row, which is almost complete: [8, _, 4, 7, _, 3, 6, 2]. The missing number is 1, which must go in the second position.\n   - Use the constraints and the numbers already placed to deduce the missing numbers in each row and column.\n   - For the first row, the missing numbers are 1, 3, and 7. Use the constraints to place them correctly.\n   - For the second row, the missing numbers are 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7. Use the constraints to place them correctly.\n   - Continue this process for each row, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied and each number from 1 to 8 appears exactly once in each row and column.\n\n3. **Checking Constraints:**\n   - After filling in the grid, verify that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 8.\n\nBy following these steps, we can solve the puzzle. Here is the completed grid:\n\n```\n2   1 > 3 < 7   4   8 > 5   6\n                    ∨       ∨\n3   8   2 > 6   1   7   4   5\n    ∨                        \n8   1   4   7   5   3   6   2\n                             \n5 > 1   3   2 < 8 > 4   6   7\n∨               ∨           ∨\n6   7   5 < 4   2   1 < 3   8\n∨               ∧            \n1 < 2   6   5   3   8   7 < 4\n        ∧       ∧   ∧        \n7   4   7   3   6   5   2   1\n∨   ∧                   ∨    \n4   6 > 8   1   7   2   1   5\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n2   1 > 3 < 7   4   8 > 5   6\n                    ∨       ∨\n3   8   2 > 6   1   7   4   5\n    ∨                        \n8   1   4   7   5   3   6   2\n                             \n5 > 1   3   2 < 8 > 4   6   7\n∨               ∨           ∨\n6   7   5 < 4   2   1 < 3   8\n∨               ∧            \n1 < 2   6   5   3   8   7 < 4\n        ∧       ∧   ∧        \n7   4   7   3   6   5   2   1\n∨   ∧                   ∨    \n4   6 > 8   1   7   2   1   5\n>>>"
