    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 4x4 with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The given numbers are:\n     - Second column, first row: 2\n     - Fourth column, third row: 1\n     - Third column, fourth row: 3\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - There are vertical and horizontal inequality constraints:\n     - Second column, first row is greater than second column, second row (2 ∧ _).\n     - Third column, second row is less than third column, third row (_ < _).\n     - Third column, third row is greater than third column, fourth row (_ > 3).\n     - Fourth column, second row is less than fourth column, third row (_ ∨ 1).\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - **Row 1:** We have 2 in the second column. The possible numbers for the first, third, and fourth columns are 1, 3, and 4.\n   - **Row 2:** The second column must be less than 2, so it can be 1. The possible numbers for the first, third, and fourth columns are 3 and 4.\n   - **Row 3:** The fourth column is 1. The third column must be greater than 3, so it must be 4. The possible numbers for the first and second columns are 2 and 3.\n   - **Row 4:** The third column is 3. The possible numbers for the first, second, and fourth columns are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4. The only possible configuration is 1, 2, 4, 3.\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers are 3, 1, 2, 4. The only possible configuration is 3, 1, 2, 4.\n   - **Row 3:** The numbers are 2, 4, 3, 1. The only possible configuration is 2, 4, 3, 1.\n   - **Row 4:** The numbers are 4, 3, 1, 2. The only possible configuration is 4, 3, 1, 2.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure they contain numbers 1 to 4 exactly once.\n   - Verify that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final solution to the puzzle is:\n\n```\n1   2   4   3\n3   1   2   4\n2   4   3   1\n4   3   1   2\n```\n\nThus, the answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   2   4   3\n        ∧   ∨\n3   1 < 2   4\n∨   ∧        \n2   4   3 > 1\n             \n4   3   1   2\n>>>"
