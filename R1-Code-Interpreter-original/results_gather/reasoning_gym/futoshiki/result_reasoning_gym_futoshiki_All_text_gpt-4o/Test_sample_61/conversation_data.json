    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 7, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given between some of the cells.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have a 7x7 grid with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The constraints are either horizontal (using < or >) or vertical (using ∧ or ∨).\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - The given numbers and constraints provide a starting point for filling in the grid.\n   - We need to ensure that the constraints are satisfied while filling in the numbers.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Start with rows or columns that have the most information.\n   - Use the constraints to deduce possible numbers for each cell.\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 7.\n\n4. **Iterative Process:**\n   - Use a process of elimination and logical deduction to fill in the grid.\n   - Check each row and column for missing numbers and use constraints to narrow down possibilities.\n   - Adjust numbers as necessary to satisfy all constraints.\n\n5. **Final Check:**\n   - Once the grid is filled, verify that all constraints are satisfied.\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains all numbers from 1 to 7 without repetition.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing and filling in the grid, the solution to the Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n1   5   3   2   7   4   6\n    ∨       ∧   ∧   ∨    \n2 > 4   6   1 > 5 > 3 < 7\n        ∨                \n5 < 7   2   3   6   1   4\n                         \n6 < 3   1   6   4   2   7\n                        ∨\n4   2   7 > 3   6   5 < 1\n            ∨            \n3   1 < 5   7   2 > 6   4\n∧       ∨                \n7   6   4   5   1   7   3\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   5   3   2   7   4   6\n    ∨       ∧   ∧   ∨    \n2 > 4   6   1 > 5 > 3 < 7\n        ∨                \n5 < 7   2   3   6   1   4\n                         \n6 < 3   1   6   4   2   7\n                        ∨\n4   2   7 > 3   6   5 < 1\n            ∨            \n3   1 < 5   7   2 > 6   4\n∧       ∨                \n7   6   4   5   1   7   3\n>>>"
