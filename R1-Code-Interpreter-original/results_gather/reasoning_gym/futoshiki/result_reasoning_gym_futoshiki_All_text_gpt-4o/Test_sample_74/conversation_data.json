    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and constraints:**\n   - The grid has some numbers already filled in, and there are inequality constraints between some cells.\n   - The constraints are either horizontal (<, >) or vertical (∧, ∨).\n\n2. **Apply the constraints:**\n   - Use the constraints to limit the possible values for each cell.\n   - For example, if a cell has a constraint like _ < 4, then the cell can only contain numbers less than 4 (i.e., 1, 2, or 3).\n\n3. **Use logic to deduce values:**\n   - Start with cells that have the most constraints, as they have fewer possibilities.\n   - Use the process of elimination to determine the possible values for each cell.\n   - If a number is determined for a cell, update the possibilities for the rest of the row and column.\n\n4. **Iterate and refine:**\n   - Continue filling in numbers, using the constraints and the requirement that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row and column.\n   - If you reach a contradiction, backtrack and try a different possibility.\n\n5. **Check the solution:**\n   - Once the grid is filled, verify that all constraints are satisfied and that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 9 exactly once.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n1 < 3   4   2 < 5   7 < 9   8   6\n                    ∧            \n9   4   5 > 3   8   1   6   7 < 2\n∧       ∧       ∧                \n2   6 < 9 > 7   4 > 3 < 5   1   8\n                    ∧            \n8   5   1   4 < 9   7   2   3   6\n        ∧           ∧   ∧   ∨    \n3   7   6   5   6   2   9 > 1   2\n        ∧                        \n5   2   7   1 < 8   6   5 > 4 < 9\n                                 \n4   8 > 2 < 6 > 3   4   9 < 5   7\n        ∧   ∨                   ∨\n7   9 < 8   5 > 2   3 > 1 < 6   3\n                                ∧\n6 < 9   3   8   7   1 < 2 > 7   4\n```\n\nThus, the solution to the Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1 < 3   4   2 < 5   7 < 9   8   6\n                    ∧            \n9   4   5 > 3   8   1   6   7 < 2\n∧       ∧       ∧                \n2   6 < 9 > 7   4 > 3 < 5   1   8\n                    ∧            \n8   5   1   4 < 9   7   2   3   6\n        ∧           ∧   ∧   ∨    \n3   7   6   5   6   2   9 > 1   2\n        ∧                        \n5   2   7   1 < 8   6   5 > 4 < 9\n                                 \n4   8 > 2 < 6 > 3   4   9 < 5   7\n        ∧   ∨                   ∨\n7   9 < 8   5 > 2   3 > 1 < 6   3\n                                ∧\n6 < 9   3   8   7   1 < 2 > 7   4\n>>>"
