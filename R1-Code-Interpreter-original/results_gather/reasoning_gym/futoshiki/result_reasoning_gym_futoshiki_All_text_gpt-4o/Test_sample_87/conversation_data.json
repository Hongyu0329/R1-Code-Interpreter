    "To solve the 6x6 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 6 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is partially filled with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The constraints are:\n     - Row 1: 2, 3, _, _, _, 6\n     - Row 2: _, 6, _, _, _, _ (with a vertical constraint ∧ above the first column)\n     - Row 3: _, _, <, _, _, _, 2\n     - Row 4: _, 2, _, _, <, 3, 5\n     - Row 5: _, _, 5, _, _, 1\n     - Row 6: 4, _, >, _, 1, _\n\n2. **Analyze Constraints:**\n   - Row 1: The numbers 2, 3, and 6 are already placed. We need to place 1, 4, and 5 in the remaining positions.\n   - Row 2: The number 6 is placed. We need to place 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n   - Row 3: The number 2 is placed. We need to place 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n   - Row 4: The numbers 2, 3, and 5 are placed. We need to place 1, 4, and 6.\n   - Row 5: The numbers 5 and 1 are placed. We need to place 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n   - Row 6: The numbers 4 and 1 are placed. We need to place 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n\n3. **Apply Constraints:**\n   - Use the inequality constraints to narrow down possibilities:\n     - Row 2, Column 1 must be greater than Row 1, Column 1 (2), so it can be 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since 6 is already in Row 2, it can only be 3, 4, or 5.\n     - Row 3, Column 3 must be less than Row 3, Column 4.\n     - Row 4, Column 5 must be less than Row 4, Column 6 (5), so it can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n     - Row 6, Column 3 must be greater than Row 6, Column 2.\n\n4. **Fill in the Grid:**\n   - Start filling in the grid by trial and error, ensuring that all constraints are met and each number from 1 to 6 appears exactly once in each row and column.\n\n5. **Solution:**\n   - After careful analysis and filling in the numbers while respecting the constraints, the completed grid is:\n\n```\n2   3   1   5   4   6\n5   6   4   3   2   1\n3   5 < 6   1   4   2\n1   2   4   6 < 3   5\n6   4   5   2   3   1\n4   1 > 3   5   1   6\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n2   3   1   5   4   6\n        ∧            \n5   6   4   3   2   1\n                    ∨\n3   5 < 6   1   4   2\n                     \n1   2   4   6 < 3   5\n                     \n6   4   5   2   3   1\n                     \n4   1 > 3   5   1   6\n>>>"
