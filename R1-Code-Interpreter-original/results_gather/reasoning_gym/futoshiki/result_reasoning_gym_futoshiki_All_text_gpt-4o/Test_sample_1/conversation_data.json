    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The grid is 8x8 with some numbers already filled in.\n   - There are inequality constraints between some cells.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The constraints are given as:\n     - Row 1: No constraints.\n     - Row 2: Column 6 has a constraint with Column 5 (∧).\n     - Row 3: No constraints.\n     - Row 4: Column 1 has a constraint with Column 2 (∧), and Column 8 has a constraint with Column 7 (∨).\n     - Row 5: Column 5 has a constraint with Column 4 (<), and Column 6 has a constraint with Column 7 (>).\n     - Row 6: Column 2 has a constraint with Column 3 (>).\n     - Row 7: Column 1 has a constraint with Column 2 (<), and Column 5 has a constraint with Column 4 (∧).\n     - Row 8: No constraints.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - Start by filling in the numbers that are already given.\n   - Use the constraints to determine the possible numbers for each blank cell.\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 8.\n   - Use the process of elimination and logical deduction to fill in the remaining cells.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Filling**:\n   - Begin with rows or columns that have the most numbers filled in or have constraints that can be easily satisfied.\n   - For each blank cell, consider the numbers that are not yet used in the row and column.\n   - Apply the inequality constraints to further narrow down the possibilities.\n   - Continue this process iteratively, checking each row, column, and constraint until the grid is completely filled.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - After filling in the grid, verify that all rows and columns contain the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once.\n   - Check that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n1   5   7   8   4   3   6   2\n                    ∧        \n6   3   2   6   7   1   3   4\n                             \n7   6   4   5   2   9   8   1\n                             \n2   8   5   1   6   4   9   7\n                    ∧       ∨\n3   7   9   2   3 < 5 > 1   6\n    ∧                        \n5   4 > 1   7   8   2   9   5\n∨                   ∧        \n8 < 9   6   3   1   7   4   3\n                ∧            \n4   2   8   4   5   7   2   8\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   5   7   8   4   3   6   2\n                    ∧        \n6   3   2   6   7   1   3   4\n                             \n7   6   4   5   2   9   8   1\n                             \n2   8   5   1   6   4   9   7\n                    ∧       ∨\n3   7   9   2   3 < 5 > 1   6\n    ∧                        \n5   4 > 1   7   8   2   9   5\n∨                   ∧        \n8 < 9   6   3   1   7   4   3\n                ∧            \n4   2   8   4   5   7   2   8\n>>>"
