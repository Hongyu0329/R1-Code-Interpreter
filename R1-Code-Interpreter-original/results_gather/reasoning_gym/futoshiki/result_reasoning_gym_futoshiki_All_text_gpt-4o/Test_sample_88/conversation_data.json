    "To solve the 8x8 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have some numbers already filled in the grid.\n   - We have inequality constraints (>, <, ∧, ∨) that must be respected.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - The constraints tell us the relative size of numbers in adjacent cells.\n   - For example, if a cell has a '>' to its right, the number in that cell must be greater than the number in the cell to its right.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - Start by filling in the numbers that are obvious due to constraints.\n   - Use the process of elimination for each row and column to determine which numbers can fit in the remaining cells.\n   - Continuously check the constraints to ensure they are satisfied as you fill in numbers.\n\n4. **Iterative Solving:**\n   - After filling in the obvious numbers, use trial and error for the remaining cells.\n   - If a number placement leads to a contradiction (e.g., repeating a number in a row/column or violating a constraint), backtrack and try a different number.\n\n5. **Final Check:**\n   - Once the grid is filled, verify that all rows and columns contain numbers 1 to 8.\n   - Ensure all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n3   2   1   4   5   7   6   8\n            ∨                \n5   1   6   8   7   3 < 4   2\n    ∧                   ∨   ∧\n4   8   5   7   6   2   3   1\n                            ∨\n2   7   4   6   1   8 < 9   5\n                ∧            \n8   3   7   5   4   6   1 < 9\n                ∨            \n1   5   8   2   3   9   5   7\n    ∧                        \n6   4   3   1   2   4   8   9\n            ∨                \n7   6   2   9 < 4   1   7   3\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n3   2   1   4   5   7   6   8\n            ∨                \n5   1   6   8   7   3 < 4   2\n    ∧                   ∨   ∧\n4   8   5   7   6   2   3   1\n                            ∨\n2   7   4   6   1   8 < 9   5\n                ∧            \n8   3   7   5   4   6   1 < 9\n                ∨            \n1   5   8   2   3   9   5   7\n    ∧                        \n6   4   3   1   2   4   8   9\n            ∨                \n7   6   2   9 < 4   1   7   3\n>>>"
