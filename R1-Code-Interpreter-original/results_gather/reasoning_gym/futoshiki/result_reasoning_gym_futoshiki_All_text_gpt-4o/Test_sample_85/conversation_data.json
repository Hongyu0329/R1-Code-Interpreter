    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols ∧, ∨, <, and >.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5.\n   - We have some numbers and constraints already given:\n     - Row 2, Column 5 is 5.\n     - Row 3, Column 3 is 5.\n     - Row 4, Column 2 is 2.\n     - Row 4, Column 3 is 3.\n     - Row 4, Column 4 is 1.\n     - Row 5, Column 3 is 2.\n     - Row 5, Column 4 is 3.\n   - Constraints:\n     - Row 2, Column 3 (R2C3) is greater than Row 3, Column 3 (R3C3).\n     - Row 3, Column 3 (R3C3) is less than Row 4, Column 3 (R4C3).\n     - Row 4, Column 1 (R4C1) is less than Row 5, Column 1 (R5C1).\n     - Row 4, Column 2 (R4C2) is greater than Row 5, Column 2 (R5C2).\n\n2. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - We know R2C5 is 5.\n     - R2C3 must be greater than 5, which is impossible, so R2C3 must be 4.\n     - The remaining numbers for Row 2 are 1, 2, and 3.\n     - R2C1, R2C2, and R2C4 must be filled with 1, 2, and 3 in some order.\n\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - R3C3 is 5.\n     - R3C3 is less than R4C3, which is 3, so R3C3 must be 2.\n     - The remaining numbers for Row 3 are 1, 3, and 4.\n     - R3C1, R3C2, and R3C4 must be filled with 1, 3, and 4 in some order.\n\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - We have 2, 3, and 1 already placed.\n     - The remaining numbers for Row 4 are 4 and 5.\n     - R4C1 and R4C5 must be filled with 4 and 5 in some order.\n     - R4C1 < R5C1, so R4C1 must be 4 and R5C1 must be 5.\n\n   - **Row 5:**\n     - We have 2 and 3 already placed.\n     - The remaining numbers for Row 5 are 1, 4, and 5.\n     - R5C1 is 5.\n     - R5C2 must be less than 2, so R5C2 must be 1.\n     - R5C5 must be 4.\n\n3. **Finalizing the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:**\n     - We have no numbers placed yet.\n     - The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 must be placed in some order.\n     - Use the constraints and the numbers already placed in other rows and columns to deduce the correct placement.\n\nAfter filling in the grid while respecting all constraints, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n1   3   4   2   5\n                 \n3   1   4   2   5\n        ∧   ∨    \n4   5   2   1   3\n                 \n5   2   3   1   4\n∨   ∧   ∨        \n2   1 > 2   3   4\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   3   4   2   5\n                 \n3   1   4   2   5\n        ∧   ∨    \n4   5   2   1   3\n                 \n5   2   3   1   4\n∨   ∧   ∨        \n2   1 > 2   3   4\n>>>"
