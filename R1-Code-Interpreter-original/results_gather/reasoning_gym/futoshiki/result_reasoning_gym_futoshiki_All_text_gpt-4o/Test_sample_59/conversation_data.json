    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 4 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints provided.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n```\n1   3   _ > _\n             \n_   _   _   _\n             \n2   _   _   _\n             \n_   _   3   _\n```\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given numbers and constraints\n\n- The first row has numbers 1 and 3 already placed, with a constraint that the third column must be greater than the fourth column.\n- The third row starts with the number 2.\n- The fourth row has a 3 in the third column.\n\n### Step 2: Fill in the first row\n\n- The first row is `1, 3, _, _` with the constraint `_ > _`.\n- The missing numbers are 2 and 4. Since the third column must be greater than the fourth column, the third column must be 4 and the fourth column must be 2.\n- First row becomes: `1, 3, 4, 2`.\n\n### Step 3: Fill in the third row\n\n- The third row is `2, _, _, _`.\n- The missing numbers are 1, 3, and 4.\n- The fourth column already has a 2, so it cannot be 2. The third column already has a 3, so it cannot be 3.\n- The third row becomes: `2, 1, 4, 3`.\n\n### Step 4: Fill in the fourth row\n\n- The fourth row is `_, _, 3, _`.\n- The missing numbers are 1, 2, and 4.\n- The first column already has a 1, so it cannot be 1. The second column already has a 2, so it cannot be 2.\n- The fourth row becomes: `4, 2, 3, 1`.\n\n### Step 5: Fill in the second row\n\n- The second row is `_, _, _, _`.\n- The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n- The first column already has 1, 2, and 4, so it must be 3.\n- The second column already has 2, 3, and 4, so it must be 1.\n- The third column already has 3, 4, and 1, so it must be 2.\n- The fourth column already has 1, 2, and 3, so it must be 4.\n- The second row becomes: `3, 1, 2, 4`.\n\n### Final Puzzle Solution\n\n```\n1   3   4 > 2\n             \n3   1   2   4\n             \n2   4   1   3\n             \n4   2   3   1\n```\n\nThus, the solution to the Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   3   4 > 2\n             \n3   1   2   4\n             \n2   4   1   3\n             \n4   2   3   1\n>>>"
