    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 7, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols '>', '<', '∧', and '∨'.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify given numbers and constraints:**\n   - The grid has some numbers already filled in: 3, 5, 1, 2, 6, 7.\n   - There are inequality constraints between some cells, both horizontally and vertically.\n\n2. **Start with rows or columns with the most information:**\n   - Row 2 has a '5' and a '3', and ends with a '1'. It also has a '<' constraint before the '5'.\n   - Row 4 has a '2', '6', '1', and '7', with '6 > _ > 1'.\n   - Row 5 has a '5', '1', '6', and ends with '< 7'.\n   - Row 6 has a '7' and ends with '2', with '<' constraints at the start.\n   - Row 7 has a '1' and a '2'.\n\n3. **Use constraints to fill in possible numbers:**\n   - In Row 2, the cell before '5' must be less than 5, and the cell after '3' must be greater than 3.\n   - In Row 4, the cell between '6' and '1' must be '5', as it is the only number that fits the constraint '6 > _ > 1'.\n   - In Row 5, the cell after '1' must be greater than 1 and less than 6, which can only be '4'.\n   - In Row 6, the first cell must be less than the second cell, which is '7', so it must be '6'.\n\n4. **Fill in the remaining cells by elimination:**\n   - Use the process of elimination to fill in the remaining numbers in each row and column, ensuring that each number from 1 to 7 appears exactly once.\n\n5. **Check all constraints:**\n   - After filling in the grid, verify that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n1 > 4   3   6   5   7   2\n                        ∨\n3 < 5   7   3   2   6   1\n                         \n6   2   5   2   1   4   3\n    ∨               ∧    \n2   3   6 > 5 > 1   7   4\n                        ∧\n5   7 > 1   6   4   3 < 7\n        ∧       ∧        \n4 < 6   7   5   3   1   2\n∧               ∧        \n7   1   4   7   6   2   5\n```\n\nThus, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1 > 4   3   6   5   7   2\n                        ∨\n3 < 5   7   3   2   6   1\n                         \n6   2   5   2   1   4   3\n    ∨               ∧    \n2   3   6 > 5 > 1   7   4\n                        ∧\n5   7 > 1   6   4   3 < 7\n        ∧       ∧        \n4 < 6   7   5   3   1   2\n∧               ∧        \n7   1   4   7   6   2   5\n>>>"
