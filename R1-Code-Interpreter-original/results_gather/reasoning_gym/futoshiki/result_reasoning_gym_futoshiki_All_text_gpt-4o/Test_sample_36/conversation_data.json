    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 9 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and constraints:**\n   - The puzzle provides some numbers and inequality constraints between certain cells.\n   - The constraints are either horizontal (<, >) or vertical (∧, ∨).\n\n2. **Start with the given numbers:**\n   - Place the given numbers in their respective positions in the grid.\n\n3. **Apply the constraints:**\n   - Use the inequality constraints to determine possible values for the empty cells.\n   - For example, if a cell has a constraint \">\" with its neighbor, the cell must contain a larger number than its neighbor.\n\n4. **Use logic and elimination:**\n   - For each row and column, determine which numbers are missing and use the constraints to narrow down possibilities.\n   - Use process of elimination to fill in cells where only one number is possible.\n\n5. **Iterate and refine:**\n   - Continue filling in numbers, using constraints and elimination, until the grid is complete.\n   - Check each step to ensure all constraints are satisfied.\n\n6. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Ensure each row and column contains numbers 1 to 9 exactly once.\n   - Verify that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n1   5   6   4   8 > 9   7   2   3\n∧   ∧                   ∧        \n9   7   4   5   2   3 < 1 > 8   6\n            ∧                    \n5   8   3   6   1   4   7   9 > 2\n                ∨           ∧    \n2   6   9   3   4   1 > 5   7   8\n    ∨                           ∨\n3   4   1 > 7   5   2 < 6   8   9\n∨               ∧                \n7   1   5   9 < 6 < 9   2 < 3   4\n                ∧   ∨       ∨   ∨\n8   9 > 2 < 2   9   6   4   5   7\n                                 \n6   3   8   1   7   5   3 < 4 > 1\n                    ∧            \n4 < 2   7   8   3 < 5 < 1   1   5\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   5   6   4   8 > 9   7   2   3\n∧   ∧                   ∧        \n9   7   4   5   2   3 < 1 > 8   6\n            ∧                    \n5   8   3   6   1   4   7   9 > 2\n                ∨           ∧    \n2   6   9   3   4   1 > 5   7   8\n    ∨                           ∨\n3   4   1 > 7   5   2 < 6   8   9\n∨               ∧                \n7   1   5   9 < 6 < 9   2 < 3   4\n                ∧   ∨       ∨   ∨\n8   9 > 2 < 2   9   6   4   5   7\n                                 \n6   3   8   1   7   5   3 < 4 > 1\n                    ∧            \n4 < 2   7   8   3 < 5 < 1   1   5\n>>>"
