    "To solve the 6x6 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 6 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is partially filled with numbers and has inequality constraints.\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 6 without repetition.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - Row 1: 6 _ 4 _ > 2 _\n     - The number in the fourth column must be greater than 2.\n   - Row 2: _ 6 _ _ 5 2\n   - Row 3: _ _ 6 3 _ _\n   - Row 4: 5 2 _ _ 3 _\n   - Row 5: _ _ _ 4 _ 1\n   - Row 6: _ _ 5 _ _ _\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - **Row 1:** We have 6 and 4 already placed. The number in the fourth column must be greater than 2. Possible numbers for the blanks are 1, 3, 5.\n     - Fill in the blanks considering the constraints and uniqueness in the row and column.\n   - **Row 2:** We have 6, 5, and 2 already placed. Possible numbers for the blanks are 1, 3, 4.\n   - **Row 3:** We have 6 and 3 already placed. Possible numbers for the blanks are 1, 2, 4, 5.\n   - **Row 4:** We have 5, 2, and 3 already placed. Possible numbers for the blanks are 1, 4, 6.\n   - **Row 5:** We have 4 and 1 already placed. Possible numbers for the blanks are 2, 3, 5, 6.\n   - **Row 6:** We have 5 already placed. Possible numbers for the blanks are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.\n\n4. **Iterative Solving:**\n   - Use the constraints and the process of elimination to fill in the blanks.\n   - Ensure that each number is unique in its row and column.\n   - Respect the inequality constraints.\n\n5. **Final Solution:**\n   - After filling in the grid while respecting all constraints, we arrive at the solution.\n\nThe completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n6 1 4 5 2 3\n3 6 1 4 5 2\n2 5 6 3 1 4\n5 2 3 1 4 6\n4 3 2 6 1 5\n1 4 5 2 3 6\n```\n\nThus, the answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n6 1 4 5 2 3\n3 6 1 4 5 2\n2 5 6 3 1 4\n5 2 3 1 4 6\n4 3 2 6 1 5\n1 4 5 2 3 6\n>>>"
