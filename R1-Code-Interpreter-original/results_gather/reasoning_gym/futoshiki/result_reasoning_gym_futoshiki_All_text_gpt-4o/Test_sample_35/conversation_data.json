    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 4 exactly once. Additionally, we must respect any inequality constraints given in the puzzle. However, in this case, no explicit inequality constraints are provided, so we will focus on the numbers already placed in the grid and the rules of Futoshiki.\n\nLet's analyze the given puzzle:\n\n```\n_   3   _   _\n             \n_   1   4   _\n             \n3   _   _   _\n             \n4   _   _   _\n```\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Row 1**: The numbers 3 is already placed in the second column. The remaining numbers to place are 1, 2, and 4. Since there are no constraints, we can try different combinations.\n\n2. **Row 2**: The numbers 1 and 4 are already placed in the second and third columns, respectively. The remaining numbers to place are 2 and 3.\n\n3. **Row 3**: The number 3 is already placed in the first column. The remaining numbers to place are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n4. **Row 4**: The number 4 is already placed in the first column. The remaining numbers to place are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n### Solving the Puzzle:\n\n- **Column 1**: We have 3 and 4 already placed in rows 3 and 4, respectively. We need to place 1 and 2 in rows 1 and 2.\n\n- **Column 2**: We have 3 and 1 already placed in rows 1 and 2, respectively. We need to place 2 and 4 in rows 3 and 4.\n\n- **Column 3**: We have 4 already placed in row 2. We need to place 1, 2, and 3 in rows 1, 3, and 4.\n\n- **Column 4**: No numbers are placed yet. We need to place 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nBy filling in the numbers while ensuring each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 4, we can solve the puzzle:\n\n```\n1   3   2   4\n2   1   4   3\n3   4   1   2\n4   2   3   1\n```\n\nThis solution respects the Futoshiki rules and fills in the grid correctly.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   3   2   4\n2   1   4   3\n3   4   1   2\n4   2   3   1\n>>>"
