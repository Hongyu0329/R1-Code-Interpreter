    "To solve the 8x8 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 8 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and constraints:**\n   - The grid has some numbers already filled in: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n   - There are inequality constraints between some cells, both horizontally and vertically.\n\n2. **Apply the constraints:**\n   - Use the given numbers and constraints to deduce the possible values for the empty cells.\n   - For example, if a cell has a constraint like \"3 < _\", the empty cell must be greater than 3.\n\n3. **Use logical deduction:**\n   - Start with rows or columns with the most constraints or given numbers, as they provide more information.\n   - Use the process of elimination to narrow down the possibilities for each cell.\n\n4. **Check for consistency:**\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 8.\n   - Verify that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\n5. **Iterate and refine:**\n   - If a contradiction arises, backtrack and try a different possibility.\n   - Continue refining the solution until all cells are filled correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, we can fill in the grid while respecting all constraints. Here is the completed puzzle:\n\n```\n4   7   1   3   2 < 6   8   5\n    ∨           ∨           ∨\n6   5   8   1 > 2   7 < 5   3\n∨                       ∨    \n3 > 6 > 2 > 5   8   7 > 1   4\n    ∧   ∧   ∧       ∨        \n8   2 > 5   6   3 > 4 > 7   1\n∨       ∨               ∧    \n2   1   3   4   5   1   6   7\n    ∧       ∧           ∨    \n4 < 8   6   7 > 1   3   5 < 2\n∧   ∨                        \n5 > 3 < 7   2   6 < 2   6 < 8\n        ∨       ∧   ∧        \n7   4   4   5   7   8   3   6\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n4   7   1   3   2 < 6   8   5\n    ∨           ∨           ∨\n6   5   8   1 > 2   7 < 5   3\n∨                       ∨    \n3 > 6 > 2 > 5   8   7 > 1   4\n    ∧   ∧   ∧       ∨        \n8   2 > 5   6   3 > 4 > 7   1\n∨       ∨               ∧    \n2   1   3   4   5   1   6   7\n    ∧       ∧           ∨    \n4 < 8   6   7 > 1   3   5 < 2\n∧   ∨                        \n5 > 3 < 7   2   6 < 2   6 < 8\n        ∨       ∧   ∧        \n7   4   4   5   7   8   3   6\n>>>"
