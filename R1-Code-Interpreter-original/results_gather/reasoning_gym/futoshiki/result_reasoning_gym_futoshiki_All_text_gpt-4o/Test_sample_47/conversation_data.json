    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5.\n   - We have some initial numbers: 4 in the first row, first column; 2 in the first row, fourth column; 2 in the last row, first column; 3 in the last row, third column.\n   - There are inequality constraints between some cells.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - Row 1: 4 _ > _ 2 _\n   - Row 2: _ > _ < 5 > _ _\n   - Row 3: _ _ _ > _ _\n   - Row 4: _ _ < _ _ < _\n   - Row 5: 2 _ 3 _ _\n\n3. **Vertical Constraints:**\n   - Between rows 1 and 2: ∧ ∨\n   - Between rows 2 and 3: ∧ ∨ ∧\n   - Between rows 3 and 4: ∨\n   - Between rows 4 and 5: \n\n4. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - **Row 1:** We have 4 and 2. The constraint 4 _ > _ 2 _ suggests the third cell must be 3 or 5. Since 2 is already in the row, the third cell must be 5. The remaining numbers are 1 and 3. The constraint 4 _ > 5 suggests the second cell is 3, and the last cell is 1.\n     - Row 1: 4 3 5 2 1\n\n   - **Row 2:** The constraint _ > _ < 5 > _ _ suggests the first cell must be greater than the second, and the third cell is 5. The constraint 5 > _ suggests the fourth cell is less than 5. The numbers left are 1, 2, 3, 4. The first cell must be 4, the second cell 3, the fourth cell 1, and the last cell 2.\n     - Row 2: 4 3 5 1 2\n\n   - **Row 3:** The constraint _ _ _ > _ _ suggests the fourth cell is greater than the third. The numbers left are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The third cell must be 2, the fourth cell 3, and the remaining cells are 1, 4, 5. The first cell is 1, the second cell is 4, and the last cell is 5.\n     - Row 3: 1 4 2 3 5\n\n   - **Row 4:** The constraint _ _ < _ _ < _ suggests the second cell is less than the third, and the fourth cell is less than the fifth. The numbers left are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The second cell is 1, the third cell is 2, the fourth cell is 3, and the fifth cell is 4. The first cell is 5.\n     - Row 4: 5 1 2 3 4\n\n   - **Row 5:** We have 2 and 3. The numbers left are 1, 4, 5. The constraint 2 _ 3 _ _ suggests the second cell is 1, the fourth cell is 4, and the last cell is 5.\n     - Row 5: 2 1 3 4 5\n\n5. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure all rows and columns contain numbers 1 to 5.\n   - Ensure all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final solution to the puzzle is:\n\n```\n4 3 5 2 1\n4 3 5 1 2\n1 4 2 3 5\n5 1 2 3 4\n2 1 3 4 5\n```\n\nThe formatted answer with constraints is:\n\n<<<\n4 3 > 5 2 1\n          ∧ ∨\n4 > 3 < 5 > 1 2\n∧         ∨ ∧\n1 4 2 > 3 5\n  ∨\n5 1 < 2 3 < 4\n          \n2 1 3 4 5\n>>>"
