    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 through 7 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have a partially filled grid with some numbers already placed.\n   - There are inequality constraints between some cells, indicated by `<`, `>`, `∧`, and `∨`.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - The constraints guide the relative values of adjacent cells. For example, if a cell has a `<` to its right, the number in the left cell must be smaller than the number in the right cell.\n   - Similarly, `∧` indicates the number above is smaller than the number below.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - Start by filling in the numbers that are already given and use the constraints to deduce the possible numbers for the empty cells.\n   - Use the process of elimination to determine which numbers can fit in each cell, considering both the row and column constraints.\n   - Pay special attention to the inequality constraints to further narrow down possibilities.\n\n4. **Iterative Solving:**\n   - Begin with rows or columns with the most numbers filled in, as they provide more information.\n   - Use the constraints to fill in the most obvious numbers first.\n   - Continuously check for any contradictions or violations of the Futoshiki rules.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - After filling in the grid, verify that each row and column contains all numbers from 1 to 7 without repetition.\n   - Ensure all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\n### Solution:\n\nFollowing the above steps, the completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n3   2   5   6   4   1   7\n                         \n4   7   1   5   2   6   3\n                         \n7   6   3   2   5   4   1\n                         \n6   4   2   3   7   2   5\n                         \n5   3   7   1 > 3   4   6\n        ∧                \n2   1   4   7   6   5   3\n                         \n1   5   6   4   3   7   2\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n3   2   5   6   4   1   7\n                         \n4   7   1   5   2   6   3\n                         \n7   6   3   2   5   4   1\n                         \n6   4   2   3   7   2   5\n                         \n5   3   7   1 > 3   4   6\n        ∧                \n2   1   4   7   6   5   3\n                         \n1   5   6   4   3   7   2\n>>>"
