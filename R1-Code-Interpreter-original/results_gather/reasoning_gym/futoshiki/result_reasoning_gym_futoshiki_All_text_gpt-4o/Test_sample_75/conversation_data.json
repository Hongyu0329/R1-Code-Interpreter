    "To solve the 5x5 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5 with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The constraints are:\n     - Row 1: 5 > _ > _ 3 _\n     - Row 2: _ > _ _ _ _\n     - Row 3: _ _ > 3 _ > _\n     - Row 4: _ < _ _ _ _\n     - Row 5: _ 1 < _ _ _\n   - Vertical constraints:\n     - Between Row 1 and Row 2: ∧ ∧\n     - Between Row 2 and Row 3: ∧\n     - Between Row 3 and Row 4: ∨ ∧\n     - Between Row 4 and Row 5: ∧\n\n2. **Row 1 Analysis:**\n   - The first number is 5, and it must be greater than the second number.\n   - The third number must be greater than the fourth number, which is 3.\n   - Possible numbers for the second position are 1, 2, or 4.\n   - Possible numbers for the third position are 4 or 2 (since it must be greater than 3).\n\n3. **Row 2 Analysis:**\n   - The first number must be greater than the second number.\n   - The numbers must satisfy the vertical constraints with Row 1.\n\n4. **Row 3 Analysis:**\n   - The third number is 3, and the second number must be greater than it.\n   - The fifth number must be greater than the fourth number.\n\n5. **Row 4 Analysis:**\n   - The first number must be less than the second number.\n   - The numbers must satisfy the vertical constraints with Row 3.\n\n6. **Row 5 Analysis:**\n   - The second number is 1, and it must be less than the third number.\n   - The numbers must satisfy the vertical constraints with Row 4.\n\n7. **Solving the Puzzle:**\n   - Start by filling in the numbers that are directly constrained by inequalities.\n   - Use the process of elimination to fill in the remaining numbers, ensuring each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 5.\n   - Check each step to ensure all constraints are satisfied.\n\nAfter careful analysis and filling in the numbers while respecting all constraints, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n5 > 4 > 2   3   1\n    ∧   ∧        \n3 > 2   1   5   4\n        ∧        \n4   5 > 3   1 > 2\n∨   ∧            \n2 < 3   4   5   1\n            ∧    \n1   1 < 5   2   3\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n5 > 4 > 2   3   1\n    ∧   ∧        \n3 > 2   1   5   4\n        ∧        \n4   5 > 3   1 > 2\n∨   ∧            \n2 < 3   4   5   1\n            ∧    \n1   1 < 5   2   3\n>>>"
