    "To solve the 5x5 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is partially filled with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The given numbers are:\n     - Row 1: _, _, 4, 5, 3\n     - Row 2: _, 4, _, _, _\n     - Row 3: _, _, < 5, 4, 2\n     - Row 4: _, _, 2, _, _\n     - Row 5: _, _, _, _, < _\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Row 3, Column 3 has a '<' constraint with Column 4, meaning the number in Column 3 must be less than the number in Column 4.\n   - Row 4 has a '∨' constraint between Column 2 and Column 3, meaning the number in Column 2 must be less than the number in Column 3.\n   - Row 5 has a '<' constraint between Column 4 and Column 5, meaning the number in Column 4 must be less than the number in Column 5.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers 4, 5, and 3 are already placed. The missing numbers are 1 and 2. Since there are no constraints affecting Row 1, we can place 1 and 2 in the first two columns.\n   - **Row 2:** The number 4 is already placed. The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 5. We need to ensure that these numbers do not conflict with the numbers in the same columns from other rows.\n   - **Row 3:** The numbers 5, 4, and 2 are already placed. The missing numbers are 1 and 3. The '<' constraint between Column 3 and Column 4 is already satisfied with 5 and 4.\n   - **Row 4:** The number 2 is already placed. The missing numbers are 1, 3, 4, and 5. The '∨' constraint between Column 2 and Column 3 must be satisfied.\n   - **Row 5:** The '<' constraint between Column 4 and Column 5 must be satisfied.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:** Place 1 in Column 1 and 2 in Column 2.\n   - **Row 2:** Place 1 in Column 1, 3 in Column 3, 5 in Column 4, and 2 in Column 5.\n   - **Row 3:** Place 1 in Column 1 and 3 in Column 2.\n   - **Row 4:** Place 3 in Column 1, 1 in Column 2, 4 in Column 4, and 5 in Column 5.\n   - **Row 5:** Place 5 in Column 1, 2 in Column 2, 3 in Column 3, 1 in Column 4, and 4 in Column 5.\n\n5. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure all rows and columns contain numbers 1 to 5 without repetition.\n   - Verify that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n1   2   4   5   3\n                 \n1   4   3   5   2\n                 \n3   1 < 5   4   2\n                 \n3   1   2   4   5\n∨                \n5   2   3   1 < 4\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   2   4   5   3\n                 \n1   4   3   5   2\n                 \n3   1 < 5   4   2\n                 \n3   1   2   4   5\n∨                \n5   2   3   1 < 4\n>>>"
