    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The grid is 8x8, and we have some numbers already filled in.\n   - There are inequality constraints between some cells, indicated by '>' and '∧'.\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis**:\n   - Row 2: The second cell must be greater than the third cell.\n   - Column 3: The third cell must be greater than the fourth cell.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - Start with rows or columns with the most numbers filled in, as they provide more constraints.\n   - Use the given numbers and inequalities to deduce the possible values for each blank cell.\n   - Ensure that each number from 1 to 8 appears exactly once in each row and column.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Filling**:\n   - **Row 1**: Already has 4, 5, 6, 8. Fill in the remaining numbers 1, 2, 3, 7.\n   - **Row 2**: Start with the given numbers and use the '>' constraint to fill in the blanks.\n   - **Row 3**: Use the given numbers and the '∧' constraint to fill in the blanks.\n   - **Row 4 to 8**: Continue filling in the numbers, ensuring each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 8, and respecting the inequality constraints.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - After filling in the grid, verify that all rows and columns contain unique numbers from 1 to 8.\n   - Check that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n1   7   2   4   3   5   6   8\n                             \n6   4 > 1   7   8   3   5   2\n                             \n8   5   3   2   7   1   4   6\n                        ∧    \n3   6   8   1   4   7   2   5\n                             \n2   8   1   6   5   4   3   7\n                             \n4   3   7   5   2   6   8   1\n                             \n5   7   2   3   6   8   1   4\n                             \n7   2   6   8   1   4   7   3\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n1   7   2   4   3   5   6   8\n6   4 > 1   7   8   3   5   2\n8   5   3   2   7   1   4   6\n3   6   8   1   4   7   2   5\n2   8   1   6   5   4   3   7\n4   3   7   5   2   6   8   1\n5   7   2   3   6   8   1   4\n7   2   6   8   1   4   7   3\n>>>"
