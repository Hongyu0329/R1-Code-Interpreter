    "To solve the 6x6 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 6, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints provided.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is partially filled with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The constraints are:\n     - Row 4: Column 5 > Column 6\n     - Row 4: Column 4 > Column 5\n\n2. **Fill in the Known Values:**\n   - Start by filling in the numbers that are already given:\n     ```\n     _   _   _   _   _   3\n     _   _   1   _   _   _\n     _   _   6   3   _   _\n     _   2   _   _ > 3 > _\n     1   _   4   _   _   5\n     4   _   _   _   6   _\n     ```\n\n3. **Analyze Row and Column Constraints:**\n   - Row 1: The number 3 is already placed in the last column.\n   - Row 3: The numbers 6 and 3 are placed in columns 3 and 4, respectively.\n   - Row 4: The number 2 is placed in column 2, and there are constraints between columns 4, 5, and 6.\n   - Row 5: The numbers 1, 4, and 5 are placed in columns 1, 3, and 6, respectively.\n   - Row 6: The numbers 4 and 6 are placed in columns 1 and 5, respectively.\n\n4. **Apply Constraints and Fill in the Blanks:**\n   - Start with rows or columns with the most filled numbers or constraints.\n   - Use the constraints to deduce possible numbers for each blank space.\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 6.\n\n5. **Iterate and Adjust:**\n   - Continuously check each row and column for compliance with the Futoshiki rules.\n   - Adjust numbers as necessary to fit all constraints.\n\n6. **Final Solution:**\n   - After filling in all the numbers while respecting the constraints, the completed puzzle is:\n     ```\n     5   4   2   6   1   3\n     6   3   1   5   4   2\n     2   5   6   3   1   4\n     3   2   5   4   6   1\n     1   6   4   2   3   5\n     4   1   3   5   6   2\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the solution to the Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n5   4   2   6   1   3\n6   3   1   5   4   2\n2   5   6   3   1   4\n3   2   5   4   6   1\n1   6   4   2   3   5\n4   1   3   5   6   2\n>>>"
