    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 4 exactly once. There are no inequality constraints given in this puzzle, so we will focus on the placement of numbers based on the given clues.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is a 4x4 matrix.\n   - The given numbers are:\n     - Row 1: 1, _, _, _\n     - Row 2: _, _, 3, _\n     - Row 3: 3, _, _, _\n     - Row 4: _, 1, 2, _\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - **Row 1**: Starts with 1. The remaining numbers to place are 2, 3, and 4.\n   - **Row 2**: Has a 3 in the third position. The remaining numbers to place are 1, 2, and 4.\n   - **Row 3**: Starts with 3. The remaining numbers to place are 1, 2, and 4.\n   - **Row 4**: Has 1 and 2 in the second and third positions. The remaining numbers to place are 3 and 4.\n\n3. **Column Analysis:**\n   - **Column 1**: Has 1 and 3. The remaining numbers to place are 2 and 4.\n   - **Column 2**: Has 1. The remaining numbers to place are 2, 3, and 4.\n   - **Column 3**: Has 2 and 3. The remaining numbers to place are 1 and 4.\n   - **Column 4**: No numbers given. The numbers to place are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - The first number is 1.\n     - The remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 4. \n     - Since column 3 already has a 3, place 3 in column 4.\n     - Place 2 in column 2 and 4 in column 3.\n     - Result: 1, 2, 4, 3\n\n   - **Row 2**:\n     - The third number is 3.\n     - The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 4.\n     - Since column 1 already has 1, place 1 in column 2.\n     - Place 4 in column 1 and 2 in column 4.\n     - Result: 4, 1, 3, 2\n\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - The first number is 3.\n     - The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 4.\n     - Since column 2 already has 1, place 1 in column 4.\n     - Place 2 in column 2 and 4 in column 3.\n     - Result: 3, 2, 4, 1\n\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - The second number is 1 and the third number is 2.\n     - The remaining numbers are 3 and 4.\n     - Since column 1 already has 3, place 3 in column 4.\n     - Place 4 in column 1.\n     - Result: 4, 1, 2, 3\n\n5. **Final Grid:**\n   - Row 1: 1, 2, 4, 3\n   - Row 2: 4, 1, 3, 2\n   - Row 3: 3, 2, 4, 1\n   - Row 4: 4, 1, 2, 3\n\nThe completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n1 2 4 3\n4 1 3 2\n3 2 4 1\n4 1 2 3\n```\n\nThus, the answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<1 2 4 3\n4 1 3 2\n3 2 4 1\n4 1 2 3>>>"
