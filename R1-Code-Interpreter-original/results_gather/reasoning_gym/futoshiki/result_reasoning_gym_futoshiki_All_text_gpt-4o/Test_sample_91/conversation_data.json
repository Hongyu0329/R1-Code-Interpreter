    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 4x4, and we have some inequality constraints:\n     - Row 1: 4 _ > _ _\n     - Row 2: _ > _ > _ _\n     - Row 3: _ _ 3 > _\n     - Row 4: _ _ _ _\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - Row 1: The first cell is 4, and the second cell must be greater than the third cell.\n   - Row 2: The first cell is greater than the second, which is greater than the third.\n   - Row 3: The third cell is 3, and it is greater than the fourth cell.\n   - Row 2 and Row 3 have vertical constraints: the second cell of Row 2 is greater than the second cell of Row 3, and the third cell of Row 2 is greater than the third cell of Row 3.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:** The first cell is 4. The only possible numbers for the remaining cells are 1, 2, and 3. Since the second cell must be greater than the third, a possible configuration is 4 3 1 2.\n   - **Row 3:** The third cell is 3, and it must be greater than the fourth cell. The only possible numbers for the remaining cells are 1, 2, and 4. A possible configuration is 2 1 3 4.\n   - **Row 2:** The first cell must be greater than the second, which is greater than the third. Considering the vertical constraints with Row 3, a possible configuration is 3 4 2 1.\n   - **Row 4:** The remaining numbers for Row 4 are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since no constraints are given, we can fill it as 1 2 4 3.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure each number from 1 to 4 appears exactly once.\n   - Verify all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final solution to the puzzle is:\n\n```\n4 3 > 1 2\n         \n3 > 4 > 2 1\n    ∧   ∧    \n2 1 3 > 4\n         \n1 2 4 3\n```\n\nThus, the answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n4 3 > 1 2\n         \n3 > 4 > 2 1\n    ∧   ∧    \n2 1 3 > 4\n         \n1 2 4 3\n>>>"
