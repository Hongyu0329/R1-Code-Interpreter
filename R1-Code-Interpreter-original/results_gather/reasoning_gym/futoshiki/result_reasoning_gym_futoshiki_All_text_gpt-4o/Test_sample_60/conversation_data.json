    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 7, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and constraints:**\n   - The grid has some numbers already filled in: 5, 4, 1, 7, 2, 6.\n   - There are inequality constraints between some cells, indicated by <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\n2. **Apply the constraints:**\n   - Start with the given numbers and use the constraints to deduce possible values for the empty cells.\n   - For example, in the first row, the last cell must be greater than the second-to-last cell, which is less than 7.\n\n3. **Use logic and elimination:**\n   - Use the process of elimination to determine which numbers can fit in each cell, considering the constraints and the requirement that each number from 1 to 7 must appear once in each row and column.\n   - For instance, if a row already contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3, the remaining cells in that row can only contain 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n4. **Iterate and refine:**\n   - Continue filling in numbers, iterating through the grid multiple times.\n   - Each time a number is placed, it may help to resolve other cells due to the constraints.\n\n5. **Check for consistency:**\n   - After filling in the grid, ensure that all constraints are satisfied and that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 7 exactly once.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n6   2   5   3   4   1 < 7\n∧                        \n3   7 < 4   1   6   2   5\n                ∧        \n4   1   6 < 5   3   7   2\n        ∨                \n5   3   1 < 6   2   7   4\n                         \n7   4   2   5   3   6   1\n                         \n2   5   7 > 4 < 5   3   6\n    ∧                    \n1 < 6   3   2   7   4 < 5\n```\n\nThus, the solution to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n6   2   5   3   4   1 < 7\n∧                        \n3   7 < 4   1   6   2   5\n                ∧        \n4   1   6 < 5   3   7   2\n        ∨                \n5   3   1 < 6   2   7   4\n                         \n7   4   2   5   3   6   1\n                         \n2   5   7 > 4 < 5   3   6\n    ∧                    \n1 < 6   3   2   7   4 < 5\n>>>"
