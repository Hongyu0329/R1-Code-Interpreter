    "To solve the 5x5 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5 with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The constraints are:\n     - Row 1: 3 < 5\n     - Column 1: 2 is above an unknown number\n     - Column 2: 1 is above an unknown number\n     - Row 5: The last number is greater than the second last number.\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - **Row 1:** _ _ _ 3 < 5\n     - The numbers 3 and 5 are already placed, and 3 < 5 is satisfied.\n     - The remaining numbers to place are 1, 2, and 4.\n   - **Row 2:** _ _ _ _ _\n     - The number 2 is in the first column.\n     - The remaining numbers to place are 1, 3, 4, and 5.\n   - **Row 3:** 2 _ < _ _ _\n     - The number 2 is already placed.\n     - The remaining numbers to place are 1, 3, 4, and 5.\n     - The constraint < indicates that the second number must be less than the third number.\n   - **Row 4:** _ 1 _ 5 4\n     - The numbers 1, 5, and 4 are already placed.\n     - The remaining numbers to place are 2 and 3.\n   - **Row 5:** 1 _ _ _ > _\n     - The number 1 is already placed.\n     - The remaining numbers to place are 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n     - The constraint > indicates that the fourth number must be greater than the fifth number.\n\n3. **Column Analysis:**\n   - **Column 1:** _ ∨ 2 _ _ 1\n     - The numbers 2 and 1 are already placed.\n     - The remaining numbers to place are 3, 4, and 5.\n   - **Column 2:** _ _ 1 _ _\n     - The number 1 is already placed.\n     - The remaining numbers to place are 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n   - **Column 3:** _ _ _ _ _\n     - All numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 need to be placed.\n   - **Column 4:** 3 _ _ 5 _\n     - The numbers 3 and 5 are already placed.\n     - The remaining numbers to place are 1, 2, and 4.\n   - **Column 5:** 5 _ _ 4 _\n     - The numbers 5 and 4 are already placed.\n     - The remaining numbers to place are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - Start with the rows and columns with the most constraints or filled numbers.\n   - **Row 4:** _ 1 _ 5 4\n     - The only numbers left are 2 and 3. Since 1 is already in the second column, 2 must be in the third column and 3 in the first column.\n     - Row 4 becomes: 3 1 2 5 4\n   - **Row 1:** _ _ _ 3 < 5\n     - The numbers left are 1, 2, and 4. Since 3 and 5 are already placed, and 3 < 5 is satisfied, place 1, 2, and 4 in the remaining positions.\n     - Row 1 becomes: 4 2 1 3 5\n   - **Row 5:** 1 _ _ _ > _\n     - The numbers left are 2, 3, 4, and 5. The constraint > indicates that the fourth number must be greater than the fifth number.\n     - Place 2, 3, 5, and 4 in the remaining positions.\n     - Row 5 becomes: 1 5 3 2 4\n   - **Row 3:** 2 _ < _ _ _\n     - The numbers left are 1, 3, 4, and 5. The constraint < indicates that the second number must be less than the third number.\n     - Place 2, 4, 3, 1, and 5 in the remaining positions.\n     - Row 3 becomes: 2 4 3 1 5\n   - **Row 2:** _ _ _ _ _\n     - The numbers left are 1, 3, 4, and 5. Place them in the remaining positions.\n     - Row 2 becomes: 5 3 4 2 1\n\n5. **Final Grid:**\n   - Row 1: 4 2 1 3 5\n   - Row 2: 5 3 4 2 1\n   - Row 3: 2 4 3 1 5\n   - Row 4: 3 1 2 5 4\n   - Row 5: 1 5 3 2 4\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n4   2   1   3 < 5\n                ∨\n5   3   4   2   1\n∨                \n2   4 < 3   1   5\n    ∨            \n3   1   2   5   4\n                 \n1   5   3   2 > 4\n>>>"
