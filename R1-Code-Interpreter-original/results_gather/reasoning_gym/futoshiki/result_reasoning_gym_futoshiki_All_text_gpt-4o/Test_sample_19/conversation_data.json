    "To solve the 5x5 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5 with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The constraints are:\n     - Row 2: _ > _ > _ 4\n     - Column 2: ∧\n     - Column 5: ∧\n     - Row 5: 5 _ 4 > _ _\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - **Row 1:** _ _ _ 5 _\n     - The number 5 is already placed in the fourth column.\n   - **Row 2:** _ > _ > _ 4\n     - The number 4 is in the fifth column.\n   - **Row 3:** 4 _ _ _ _\n     - The number 4 is in the first column.\n   - **Row 4:** _ _ 2 _ _\n     - The number 2 is in the third column.\n   - **Row 5:** 5 _ 4 > _ _\n     - The number 5 is in the first column, and 4 is in the third column.\n\n3. **Applying Constraints:**\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers must decrease from left to right before reaching 4. Possible sequence: 5, 3, 2, 1, 4.\n   - **Row 5:** The number after 4 must be greater than the number before it. Possible sequence: 5, 1, 4, 3, 2.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:** Since 5 is in the fourth column, the remaining numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) must fill the other columns. Considering the constraints, a possible sequence is 3, 1, 2, 5, 4.\n   - **Row 2:** As analyzed, the sequence is 5, 3, 2, 1, 4.\n   - **Row 3:** The number 4 is in the first column. The remaining numbers (1, 2, 3, 5) must fill the other columns. A possible sequence is 4, 2, 5, 3, 1.\n   - **Row 4:** The number 2 is in the third column. The remaining numbers (1, 3, 4, 5) must fill the other columns. A possible sequence is 1, 5, 2, 4, 3.\n   - **Row 5:** As analyzed, the sequence is 5, 1, 4, 3, 2.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure each row and column contains numbers 1 to 5.\n   - Check all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final solution to the puzzle is:\n\n```\n3   1   2   5   4\n                 \n5 > 3 > 2   1   4\n    ∧            \n4   2   5   3   1\n                 \n1   5   2   4   3\n                ∧\n5   1   4 > 3   2\n```\n\nThus, the answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n3   1   2   5   4\n                 \n5 > 3 > 2   1   4\n    ∧            \n4   2   5   3   1\n                 \n1   5   2   4   3\n                ∧\n5   1   4 > 3   2\n>>>"
