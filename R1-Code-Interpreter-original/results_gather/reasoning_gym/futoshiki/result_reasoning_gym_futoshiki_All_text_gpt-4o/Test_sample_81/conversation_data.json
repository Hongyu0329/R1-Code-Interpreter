    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints provided.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 4x4 with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The given numbers are:\n     - Row 1: 4, _, _, _\n     - Row 2: 3, _, _, 2\n     - Row 3: _, _, _, _\n     - Row 4: _, _, 3, _\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - There is a vertical constraint between Row 3 and Row 4, Column 2: Row 3, Column 2 (R3C2) must be less than Row 4, Column 2 (R4C2).\n   - There is a vertical constraint between Row 3 and Row 4, Column 3: Row 3, Column 3 (R3C3) must be greater than Row 4, Column 3 (R4C3).\n\n3. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:** The number 4 is already placed in the first column. The remaining numbers to place are 1, 2, and 3.\n     - Since there are no constraints affecting Row 1, we can place the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in the remaining columns.\n     - Possible configuration: 4, 1, 2, 3.\n\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers 3 and 2 are already placed in the first and last columns, respectively. The remaining numbers to place are 1 and 4.\n     - Since there are no constraints affecting Row 2, we can place the numbers 1 and 4 in the remaining columns.\n     - Possible configuration: 3, 4, 1, 2.\n\n   - **Row 3:** We need to place the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n     - Considering the vertical constraints:\n       - R3C2 < R4C2: This means R3C2 cannot be 4.\n       - R3C3 > R4C3: This means R3C3 cannot be 1.\n     - Possible configuration: 2, 1, 4, 3.\n\n   - **Row 4:** The number 3 is already placed in the third column. The remaining numbers to place are 1, 2, and 4.\n     - Considering the vertical constraints:\n       - R3C2 < R4C2: This means R4C2 must be greater than 2.\n       - R3C3 > R4C3: This means R4C3 must be less than 4.\n     - Possible configuration: 1, 3, 2, 4.\n\n4. **Final Grid:**\n   - Row 1: 4, 1, 2, 3\n   - Row 2: 3, 4, 1, 2\n   - Row 3: 2, 1, 4, 3\n   - Row 4: 1, 3, 2, 4\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n4   1   2   3\n             \n3   4   1   2\n             \n2   1   4   3\n    ∨   ∧    \n1   3   2   4\n>>>"
