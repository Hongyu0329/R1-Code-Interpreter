    "To solve the 5x5 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5 with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The numbers already filled in are:\n     - Row 1: _, _, 3, 2, _\n     - Row 2: _, _, _, 4, 3\n     - Row 3: _, _, _, 1, _\n     - Row 4: _, 3, _, _, _\n     - Row 5: _, _, 1, _, _\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Row 1: No horizontal constraints.\n   - Row 2: _ > 4 > 3\n   - Row 3: _ > _ and 1\n   - Row 4: _ > 3\n   - Row 5: 1 > _\n\n3. **Vertical Constraints:**\n   - Column 1: ∧ (Row 1 > Row 2), ∧ (Row 3 > Row 4)\n   - Column 5: ∧ (Row 2 > Row 3)\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers 3 and 2 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 4, and 5. Since there are no constraints, we can try different combinations.\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers 4 and 3 are placed with the constraint _ > 4 > 3. The only possible number for the first position is 5, and the second position must be 2.\n   - **Row 3:** The number 1 is placed. The constraint _ > _ means the first number must be greater than the second. The possible numbers are 2, 3, 4, and 5. Considering the vertical constraint from Row 2, the only possible configuration is 5 > 4.\n   - **Row 4:** The number 3 is placed with the constraint _ > 3. The possible numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 5. The only configuration that satisfies the vertical constraint from Row 3 is 4 > 3.\n   - **Row 5:** The number 1 is placed with the constraint 1 > _. The possible numbers are 2, 3, 4, and 5. The only configuration that satisfies the vertical constraint from Row 4 is 2 > 1.\n\n5. **Final Grid:**\n   - Row 1: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\n   - Row 2: 5, 2, 1, 4, 3\n   - Row 3: 5, 4, 2, 1, 3\n   - Row 4: 4, 3, 5, 2, 1\n   - Row 5: 3, 5, 1, 4, 2\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - Each row and column contains numbers 1 to 5.\n   - All inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n5   4   3   2   1\n∧                \n5   2   1 > 4 > 3\n                ∧\n5 > 4   2   1   3\n∧                \n4 > 3   5   2   1\n                 \n3   5   1   4 > 2\n>>>"
