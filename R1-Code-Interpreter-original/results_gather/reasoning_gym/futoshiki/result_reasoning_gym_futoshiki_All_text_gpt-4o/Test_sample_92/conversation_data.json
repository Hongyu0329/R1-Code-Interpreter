    "To solve the 6x6 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 6 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints provided.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is partially filled with some numbers, and there is one vertical inequality constraint (∨) between the numbers in the fourth and fifth rows, fifth column.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - The inequality constraint (∨) indicates that the number in the fourth row, fifth column must be less than the number in the fifth row, fifth column.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - Start by filling in the numbers that are already given and use the constraints to deduce the possible numbers for the empty cells.\n\n4. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - **Row 1:** _ _ 6 _ 1 2\n     - The missing numbers are 3, 4, and 5. Place them considering the column constraints.\n   - **Row 2:** 6 _ _ _ 3 _\n     - The missing numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 5. Place them considering the column constraints.\n   - **Row 3:** _ 6 _ _ _ _\n     - The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Place them considering the column constraints.\n   - **Row 4:** _ _ _ _ 2 5\n     - The missing numbers are 1, 3, 4, and 6. Place them considering the column constraints and the vertical constraint (∨).\n   - **Row 5:** 1 2 3 _ _ _\n     - The missing numbers are 4, 5, and 6. Place them considering the column constraints and the vertical constraint (∨).\n   - **Row 6:** _ _ 2 3 5 _\n     - The missing numbers are 1, 4, and 6. Place them considering the column constraints.\n\n5. **Iterative Solving:**\n   - Use a process of elimination and logical deduction to fill in the grid, ensuring that each number from 1 to 6 appears exactly once in each row and column, and that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\n6. **Final Solution:**\n   - After filling in the grid while respecting all constraints, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n3  5  6  4  1  2\n6  4  5  2  3  1\n2  6  1  5  4  3\n5  3  4  1  2  5\n1  2  3  6  5  4\n4  1  2  3  5  6\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n3  5  6  4  1  2\n6  4  5  2  3  1\n2  6  1  5  4  3\n5  3  4  1  2  5\n1  2  3  6  5  4\n4  1  2  3  5  6\n>>>"
