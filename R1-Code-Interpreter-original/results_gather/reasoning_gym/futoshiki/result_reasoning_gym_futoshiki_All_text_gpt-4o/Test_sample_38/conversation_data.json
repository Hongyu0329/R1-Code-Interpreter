    "To solve the 4x4 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers 1 to 4 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   ```\n   _   _   2   _\n               ∨\n   _   _ > _   _\n                \n   _   3 < _   _\n               ∨\n   _ > _   _ > 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - The third column in the first row is already filled with '2'.\n   - There is a vertical constraint between the first and second rows in the fourth column (first row's fourth column must be less than the second row's fourth column).\n   - In the second row, the second cell must be greater than the third cell.\n   - In the third row, the second cell is '3', and it must be greater than the third cell.\n   - There is a vertical constraint between the third and fourth rows in the fourth column (third row's fourth column must be less than the fourth row's fourth column).\n   - In the fourth row, the first cell must be greater than the second cell, and the third cell must be greater than '1'.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:** The only number missing in the third column is '2', so the other numbers in the first row must be 1, 3, and 4. Considering the vertical constraint in the fourth column, the first row's fourth column must be less than the second row's fourth column. Therefore, the first row can be: 1, 4, 2, 3.\n   - **Row 2:** The second cell must be greater than the third cell. The possible numbers for the second row are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since the first row's fourth column is '3', the second row's fourth column must be '4'. The second row can be: 2, 3, 1, 4.\n   - **Row 3:** The second cell is '3', and it must be greater than the third cell. The possible numbers for the third row are 1, 2, 3, and 4. The third row can be: 4, 3, 2, 1.\n   - **Row 4:** The first cell must be greater than the second cell, and the third cell must be greater than '1'. The possible numbers for the fourth row are 1, 2, 3, and 4. The fourth row can be: 3, 1, 4, 2.\n\n4. **Final Grid:**\n   ```\n   1   4   2   3\n               ∨\n   2   3 > 1   4\n               \n   4   3 < 2   1\n               ∨\n   3 > 1   4 > 2\n   ```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n<<<\n1   4   2   3\n    ∨\n2   3 > 1   4\n\n4   3 < 2   1\n    ∨\n3 > 1   4 > 2\n>>>"
