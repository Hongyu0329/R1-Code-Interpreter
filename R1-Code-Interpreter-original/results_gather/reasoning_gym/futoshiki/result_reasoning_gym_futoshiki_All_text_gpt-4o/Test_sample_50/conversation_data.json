    "To solve the 5x5 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 5x5 with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The constraints are:\n     - Row 1: _ < _   1   _   _\n     - Row 2: _   _   _   _ < 3\n     - Row 3: 3 > _   _   1   _\n     - Row 4: _   _ > _   _   _\n     - Row 5: _   _ > _   _   _\n\n2. **Constraints Analysis:**\n   - Row 1 has a constraint between the first two cells: the first cell must be less than the second.\n   - Row 2 has a constraint between the fourth and fifth cells: the fourth cell must be less than 3.\n   - Row 3 has a constraint: the first cell is 3 and it must be greater than the second cell.\n   - Row 4 has a constraint: the third cell must be greater than the fourth.\n   - Row 5 has a constraint: the third cell must be greater than the fourth.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - Start with Row 3: Since the first cell is 3 and it must be greater than the second cell, the second cell can be 1 or 2. However, since the fourth cell is 1, the second cell must be 2.\n   - Row 3 becomes: 3 > 2   _   1   _\n   - Now, fill the remaining cells in Row 3. The numbers 4 and 5 are left. Since there are no constraints, we can place them in any order: 3 > 2   5   1   4\n\n4. **Continue with Row 1:**\n   - The third cell is 1. The first two cells have a constraint: the first cell must be less than the second. Possible pairs are (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5). Since 1 is already in the row, the pair must be (2, 3) or (3, 4) or (4, 5).\n   - Since 2 is already in Row 3, the pair must be (3, 4) or (4, 5). Let's try (3, 4).\n   - Row 1 becomes: 3 < 4   1   _   _\n   - The remaining numbers are 2 and 5. Since there are no constraints, we can place them in any order: 3 < 4   1   5   2\n\n5. **Fill Row 2:**\n   - The fifth cell is 3. The fourth cell must be less than 3, so it can be 1 or 2.\n   - The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 4, 5. Since 1 and 2 are possible for the fourth cell, let's try 2.\n   - Row 2 becomes: _   _   _   2 < 3\n   - The remaining numbers are 1, 4, 5. Since there are no constraints, we can place them in any order: 1   4   5   2 < 3\n\n6. **Fill Row 4:**\n   - The third cell must be greater than the fourth. Possible pairs are (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4).\n   - The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's try (3, 2).\n   - Row 4 becomes: _   _ > 3   2   _\n   - The remaining numbers are 1, 4, 5. Since there are no constraints, we can place them in any order: 1   5 > 3   2   4\n\n7. **Fill Row 5:**\n   - The third cell must be greater than the fourth. Possible pairs are (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4).\n   - The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's try (4, 3).\n   - Row 5 becomes: _   _ > 4   3   _\n   - The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 5. Since there are no constraints, we can place them in any order: 5   1 > 4   3   2\n\n8. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure all numbers from 1 to 5 are present and all constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n```\n3 < 4   1   5   2\n1   4   5   2 < 3\n3 > 2   5   1   4\n1   5 > 3   2   4\n5   1 > 4   3   2\n```\n\nThus, the answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n3 < 4   1   5   2\n1   4   5   2 < 3\n3 > 2   5   1   4\n1   5 > 3   2   4\n5   1 > 4   3   2\n>>>"
