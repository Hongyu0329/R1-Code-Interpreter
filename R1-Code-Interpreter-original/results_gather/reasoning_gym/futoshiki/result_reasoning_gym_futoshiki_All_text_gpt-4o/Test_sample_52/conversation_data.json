    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rules**: Each row and column must contain the numbers 1 to 9 exactly once. Additionally, the inequality signs between some cells must be respected.\n\n2. **Analyze the Given Clues**: Start by filling in the numbers that are already provided in the puzzle. These numbers will serve as anchors for solving the rest of the puzzle.\n\n3. **Apply Inequality Constraints**: Use the inequality signs to determine possible values for the adjacent cells. For example, if a cell has a '>' sign pointing to another cell, the first cell must contain a number greater than the second cell.\n\n4. **Use Logical Deduction**: Use the process of elimination to determine which numbers can fit into each cell. Consider the numbers already placed in the same row and column, as well as the inequality constraints.\n\n5. **Iterate and Refine**: As you fill in more numbers, revisit previous assumptions and constraints to refine your choices. This may involve backtracking if you encounter a contradiction.\n\n6. **Check for Consistency**: Ensure that all rows and columns contain unique numbers from 1 to 9 and that all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\nNow, let's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n- Start with the given numbers and fill in the cells that can be directly deduced from the inequalities and existing numbers.\n- Use the constraints to narrow down possibilities for each cell.\n- Continue filling in numbers, checking each time that the constraints are satisfied.\n- If a contradiction is found, backtrack and try a different possibility.\n\nAfter carefully applying these steps, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n7   2 > 4   8   3   3   5   9   1   6\n                    ∨            \n9 < 3   1   2   7   7   8   5   6 < 4\n                                 \n6   5   9 < 1   2   8   3   4 < 5   7\n        ∧               ∨       ∨\n2   7   6   9   1   4   8   3   5\n    ∧                            \n8   9   5   6   4   1   7   2   4\n                        ∨        \n3   1   7   3   5   6 > 4   8   9\n            ∧               ∨    \n4   6   8   5   9   7   2   1   3\n    ∧               ∧   ∨        \n5   4   2   7   8   9   1   7   8\n        ∧   ∧       ∨       ∨    \n1 < 8   3 > 2   5 > 6   9   7   6\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n7   2 > 4   8   3   3   5   9   1   6\n                    ∨            \n9 < 3   1   2   7   7   8   5   6 < 4\n                                 \n6   5   9 < 1   2   8   3   4 < 5   7\n        ∧               ∨       ∨\n2   7   6   9   1   4   8   3   5\n    ∧                            \n8   9   5   6   4   1   7   2   4\n                        ∨        \n3   1   7   3   5   6 > 4   8   9\n            ∧               ∨    \n4   6   8   5   9   7   2   1   3\n    ∧               ∧   ∨        \n5   4   2   7   8   9   1   7   8\n        ∧   ∧       ∨       ∨    \n1 < 8   3 > 2   5 > 6   9   7   6\n>>>"
