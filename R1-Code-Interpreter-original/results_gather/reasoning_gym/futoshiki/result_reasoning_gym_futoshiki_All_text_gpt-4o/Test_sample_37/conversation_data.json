    "To solve the Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 9 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Given Numbers and Constraints:**\n   - The grid has some numbers already filled in, and we need to use these as starting points.\n   - There are inequality constraints between some cells, which must be respected.\n\n2. **Apply Constraints:**\n   - Use the inequality constraints to limit the possible values for certain cells.\n   - For example, if a cell has a constraint like \"3 > _\", the blank must be filled with a number less than 3.\n\n3. **Use Deductive Reasoning:**\n   - Start filling in the blanks by considering the constraints and the numbers already present in the rows and columns.\n   - Use the process of elimination to determine which numbers can fit in each blank cell.\n\n4. **Check for Consistency:**\n   - After filling in a number, check the entire row and column to ensure no number is repeated.\n   - Ensure all inequality constraints are satisfied.\n\n5. **Iterate and Adjust:**\n   - If a contradiction is found (e.g., a number is repeated in a row or column), backtrack and try a different number.\n   - Continue this process until the entire grid is filled correctly.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n```\n5   9   4   7   8   2   1   3 > 6\n                                 \n3   2   6   4   9   5   8   7   1\n                                 \n2   5   7   8   6   9   3   4   3\n                                 \n4   1   3   6   7   8   5   2 > 9\n        ∨                        \n8   4   9   5   3 < 1   6   2   7\n                                 \n7   7   2   1   5   6   9   8   4\n                                 \n1   3   5 < 2   1   7   9   8   5\n                                 \n6   8   1   9   4   3   4   1   2\n                                 \n9   6   8   7   1   2   8   5   3\n```\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n5   9   4   7   8   2   1   3 > 6\n                                 \n3   2   6   4   9   5   8   7   1\n                                 \n2   5   7   8   6   9   3   4   3\n                                 \n4   1   3   6   7   8   5   2 > 9\n        ∨                        \n8   4   9   5   3 < 1   6   2   7\n                                 \n7   7   2   1   5   6   9   8   4\n                                 \n1   3   5 < 2   1   7   9   8   5\n                                 \n6   8   1   9   4   3   4   1   2\n                                 \n9   6   8   7   1   2   8   5   3\n>>>"
