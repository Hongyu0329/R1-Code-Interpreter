    "To solve the 8x8 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the blanks with numbers from 1 to 8 such that each row and column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, we must respect any inequality constraints given in the puzzle.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have some numbers already filled in the grid.\n   - We have one vertical constraint: a number in the 6th row, 5th column must be less than the number in the 7th row, 5th column.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Each row and column must contain numbers 1 to 8 without repetition.\n   - The given inequality constraint must be satisfied.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Start with rows or columns that have the most numbers filled in, as they provide more constraints.\n   - Use the process of elimination to determine which numbers can fit in the remaining blanks.\n   - Pay attention to the inequality constraint and ensure it is satisfied.\n\n4. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - **Row 1:** Already has numbers 8, 7, 4, 5, and 1. The missing numbers are 2, 3, and 6.\n   - **Row 2:** Already has numbers 1, 2, and 4. The missing numbers are 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n   - **Row 3:** Already has numbers 2, 6, and 3. The missing numbers are 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8.\n   - **Row 4:** Already has numbers 1, 5, 6, and 3. The missing numbers are 2, 4, 7, and 8.\n   - **Row 5:** Already has number 5. The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.\n   - **Row 6:** Already has numbers 1, 8, and 5. The missing numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.\n   - **Row 7:** Already has numbers 8, 5, and 4. The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7.\n   - **Row 8:** Already has numbers 4, 5, 7, 6, and 2. The missing numbers are 1, 3, and 8.\n\n5. **Solving the Puzzle:**\n   - Use logical deduction to fill in the blanks, ensuring that each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 8.\n   - Continuously check the inequality constraint to ensure it is satisfied.\n   - Adjust numbers as necessary to maintain the integrity of the puzzle.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing and filling in the numbers while respecting all constraints, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n8   7   4   5   3   6   1   2\n3   1   2   8   7   4   5   6\n2   4   7   1   5   8   6   3\n1   5   8   6   2   7   3   4\n5   6   3   4   8   2   7   1\n7   2   6   3   1   8   4   5\n6   8   1   2   4   3   5   7\n4   3   5   7   6   1   2   8\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n8   7   4   5   3   6   1   2\n3   1   2   8   7   4   5   6\n2   4   7   1   5   8   6   3\n1   5   8   6   2   7   3   4\n5   6   3   4   8   2   7   1\n7   2   6   3   1   8   4   5\n6   8   1   2   4   3   5   7\n4   3   5   7   6   1   2   8\n>>>"
