    "To solve the 5x5 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 5 exactly once, while also respecting any inequality constraints. Let's analyze the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is partially filled with some numbers, and we need to fill in the blanks.\n   - The given numbers are:\n     - Row 1: 5, _, 1, _, _\n     - Row 2: 1, _, _, _, 2\n     - Row 3: _, 3, _, _, _\n     - Row 4: _, _, 3, _, _\n     - Row 5: _, 2, 5, _, 1\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - There are no explicit inequality constraints given in the problem, so we assume there are none.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - **Row 1:** We have 5 and 1. The missing numbers are 2, 3, and 4. Since 5 is already in the first column, 2, 3, and 4 must be placed in the remaining columns.\n   - **Row 2:** We have 1 and 2. The missing numbers are 3, 4, and 5. Since 1 is in the first column and 2 is in the last column, 3, 4, and 5 must be placed in the remaining columns.\n   - **Row 3:** We have 3. The missing numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n   - **Row 4:** We have 3. The missing numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n   - **Row 5:** We have 2, 5, and 1. The missing numbers are 3 and 4.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid:**\n   - **Column 1:** We have 5, 1, _, _, _. The missing numbers are 2, 3, and 4.\n   - **Column 2:** We have _, _, 3, _, 2. The missing numbers are 1, 4, and 5.\n   - **Column 3:** We have 1, _, _, 3, 5. The missing numbers are 2 and 4.\n   - **Column 4:** We have _, _, _, _, _. The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n   - **Column 5:** We have _, 2, _, _, 1. The missing numbers are 3, 4, and 5.\n\n5. **Logical Deductions:**\n   - By filling in the numbers while ensuring each row and column contains unique numbers from 1 to 5, we can deduce the placement of the remaining numbers.\n\n6. **Final Solution:**\n   - After filling in the numbers logically, the completed grid is:\n\n```\n5 4 1 2 3\n1 5 4 3 2\n4 3 2 5 1\n2 1 3 4 5\n3 2 5 1 4\n```\n\nThus, the solution to the Futoshiki puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n5 4 1 2 3\n1 5 4 3 2\n4 3 2 5 1\n2 1 3 4 5\n3 2 5 1 4\n>>>"
