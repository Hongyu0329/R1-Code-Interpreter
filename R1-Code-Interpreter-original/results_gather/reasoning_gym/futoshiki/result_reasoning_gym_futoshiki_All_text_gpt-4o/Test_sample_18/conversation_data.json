    "To solve the 7x7 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 7, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, we must respect the inequality constraints given by the symbols <, >, ∧, and ∨.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 7x7, and we have some numbers and constraints already provided.\n   - We need to fill in the blanks (_) with numbers from 1 to 7.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Horizontal constraints: < and > indicate that the number on the left is less than or greater than the number on the right, respectively.\n   - Vertical constraints: ∧ and ∨ indicate that the number above is less than or greater than the number below, respectively.\n\n3. **Given Numbers:**\n   - Row 1: _ _ < _ 4 > _ _ 3\n   - Row 2: 6 7 4 _ < _ _ _\n   - Row 3: _ 4 < _ _ 1 3 _\n   - Row 4: _ _ _ 3 < _ 5 _\n   - Row 5: _ _ 2 < _ _ _ < 6\n   - Row 6: 5 _ _ < _ _ _ _\n   - Row 7: 1 6 _ _ _ _ _\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Start with rows or columns with the most numbers or constraints.\n   - Use the constraints to deduce possible numbers for each blank.\n   - Ensure no number repeats in any row or column.\n\n5. **Solving the Puzzle:**\n   - Use logical deduction based on the constraints and the numbers already filled in.\n   - For example, in Row 2, the constraint _ < _ means the number before the constraint must be less than the number after it.\n   - Similarly, use the vertical constraints to deduce numbers in columns.\n\n6. **Iterate and Adjust:**\n   - As you fill in numbers, continuously check against all constraints.\n   - Adjust numbers if a contradiction arises, ensuring all constraints are satisfied.\n\n7. **Final Solution:**\n   - After filling in all numbers while respecting the constraints, verify that each row and column contains numbers 1 to 7 exactly once.\n\nBy following these steps, the completed puzzle is:\n\n```\n2 5 < 1 4 > 7 6 3\n6 7 4 5 < 3 2 1\n3 4 < 5 6 1 3 7\n7 1 6 3 < 2 5 4\n4 3 2 < 7 5 1 < 6\n5 2 7 < 1 6 4 3\n1 6 3 2 5 4 7\n```\n\nThus, the final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n2 5 < 1 4 > 7 6 3\n6 7 4 5 < 3 2 1\n3 4 < 5 6 1 3 7\n7 1 6 3 < 2 5 4\n4 3 2 < 7 5 1 < 6\n5 2 7 < 1 6 4 3\n1 6 3 2 5 4 7\n>>>"
