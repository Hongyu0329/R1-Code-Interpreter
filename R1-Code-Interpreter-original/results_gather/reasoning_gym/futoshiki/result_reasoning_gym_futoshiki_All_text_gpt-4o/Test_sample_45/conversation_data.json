    "To solve the 6x6 Futoshiki puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 to 6 exactly once, while also respecting the inequality constraints provided.\n\nLet's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is partially filled with some numbers and inequality constraints.\n   - The numbers given are:\n     - Row 1: _, _, _, _, 6, 2\n     - Row 2: 6, _, 2, _, _, 4\n     - Row 3: _, _, _, _, _, _\n     - Row 4: _, _, _, _, _, _\n     - Row 5: 5, _, _, _, 3, 6\n     - Row 6: _, 5, _, 3, _, _\n\n2. **Inequality Constraints:**\n   - Row 1, Column 2 is greater than Row 2, Column 2 (∧).\n   - Row 1, Column 5 is greater than Row 2, Column 5 (∧).\n   - Row 3, Column 6 is greater than Row 4, Column 6 (∧).\n   - Row 5, Column 3 is less than Row 5, Column 4 (<).\n   - Row 6, Column 1 is less than Row 6, Column 2 (<).\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers 6 and 2 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 3, 4, and 5. Considering the constraints, we can deduce:\n     - Row 1, Column 4 must be 5 because it is greater than Row 2, Column 4.\n     - Row 1, Column 1 must be 3 because it is greater than Row 2, Column 1.\n     - Row 1, Column 2 must be 4 because it is greater than Row 2, Column 2.\n     - Row 1, Column 3 must be 1.\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers 6, 2, and 4 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 3, and 5. Considering the constraints:\n     - Row 2, Column 4 must be 3 because it is less than Row 1, Column 4.\n     - Row 2, Column 5 must be 5 because it is less than Row 1, Column 5.\n     - Row 2, Column 2 must be 1.\n   - **Row 3:** No numbers are placed yet. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 need to be placed. Considering the constraints:\n     - Row 3, Column 6 must be 5 because it is greater than Row 4, Column 6.\n     - Row 3, Column 5 must be 4.\n     - Row 3, Column 4 must be 6.\n     - Row 3, Column 3 must be 3.\n     - Row 3, Column 2 must be 2.\n     - Row 3, Column 1 must be 1.\n   - **Row 4:** No numbers are placed yet. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 need to be placed. Considering the constraints:\n     - Row 4, Column 6 must be 4 because it is less than Row 3, Column 6.\n     - Row 4, Column 5 must be 2.\n     - Row 4, Column 4 must be 1.\n     - Row 4, Column 3 must be 5.\n     - Row 4, Column 2 must be 6.\n     - Row 4, Column 1 must be 3.\n   - **Row 5:** The numbers 5, 3, and 6 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, and 4. Considering the constraints:\n     - Row 5, Column 2 must be 4 because it is greater than Row 6, Column 2.\n     - Row 5, Column 3 must be 1 because it is less than Row 5, Column 4.\n     - Row 5, Column 4 must be 2.\n   - **Row 6:** The numbers 5 and 3 are already placed. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 6. Considering the constraints:\n     - Row 6, Column 1 must be 2 because it is less than Row 6, Column 2.\n     - Row 6, Column 3 must be 6.\n     - Row 6, Column 4 must be 4.\n     - Row 6, Column 5 must be 1.\n\n4. **Final Grid:**\n   - Row 1: 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 2\n   - Row 2: 6, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4\n   - Row 3: 1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 5\n   - Row 4: 3, 6, 5, 1, 2, 4\n   - Row 5: 5, 4, 1, 2, 3, 6\n   - Row 6: 2, 5, 6, 4, 1, 3\n\nThe final answer to the puzzle is:\n\n<<<\n3   4   1   5   6   2\n        ∧           ∧\n6   1   2   3   5   4\n                     \n1   2   3   6   4 < 5\n                    ∧\n3   6   5   1   2   4\n∧                    \n5   4 < 1 > 2   3   6\n                ∨    \n2 < 5   6   4   1   3\n>>>"
