    "To determine whether the Game of Life will halt at or before 20 steps, we need to analyze the evolution of the given initial board configuration. The Game of Life rules are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).\n\nThe initial board configuration is a 12x12 grid with a small pattern of live cells. Let's analyze the pattern:\n\n- The live cells are located at:\n  - (5, 7)\n  - (6, 5)\n  - (6, 7)\n  - (7, 6)\n  - (7, 8)\n  - (8, 7)\n\nThis pattern resembles a \"glider,\" a well-known pattern in the Game of Life that moves diagonally across the board. Given the wrapping topology, the glider will continue to move indefinitely without disappearing, as it will wrap around the edges of the grid.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Step 1**: The glider moves one step diagonally.\n2. **Step 2**: The glider moves another step diagonally.\n3. **Step 3**: The glider continues moving diagonally.\n4. **Step 4**: The glider keeps moving diagonally.\n5. **Step 5**: The glider moves diagonally.\n6. **Step 6**: The glider continues its diagonal movement.\n7. **Step 7**: The glider moves diagonally.\n8. **Step 8**: The glider continues moving diagonally.\n9. **Step 9**: The glider moves diagonally.\n10. **Step 10**: The glider continues its diagonal movement.\n11. **Step 11**: The glider moves diagonally.\n12. **Step 12**: The glider continues moving diagonally.\n13. **Step 13**: The glider moves diagonally.\n14. **Step 14**: The glider continues its diagonal movement.\n15. **Step 15**: The glider moves diagonally.\n16. **Step 16**: The glider continues moving diagonally.\n17. **Step 17**: The glider moves diagonally.\n18. **Step 18**: The glider continues its diagonal movement.\n19. **Step 19**: The glider moves diagonally.\n20. **Step 20**: The glider continues moving diagonally.\n\nSince the glider is a stable pattern that does not disappear and the wrapping topology allows it to move indefinitely, the game will not halt within 20 steps. The glider will continue to exist and move across the board.\n\nTherefore, the game will not halt at or before 20 steps.\n\n<<<False>>>"
