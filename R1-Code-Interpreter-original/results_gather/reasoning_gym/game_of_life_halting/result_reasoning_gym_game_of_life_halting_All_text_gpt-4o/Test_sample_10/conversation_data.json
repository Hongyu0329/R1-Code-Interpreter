    "To determine whether the Game of Life will halt at or before 20 steps, we need to analyze the evolution of the given initial board configuration. The rules of the Game of Life are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).\n\nThe initial board configuration is a 12x12 grid with a horizontal line of three live cells at row 6, columns 4, 5, and 6. This configuration is known as a \"blinker,\" which is a simple oscillator in the Game of Life.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Configuration (Step 0):**\n   - The blinker is horizontal: cells (6,4), (6,5), and (6,6) are alive.\n\n2. **Step 1:**\n   - The blinker will become vertical due to the rules of the Game of Life:\n     - Cells (5,5), (6,5), and (7,5) will be alive.\n     - Cells (6,4) and (6,6) will die due to underpopulation.\n\n3. **Step 2:**\n   - The blinker will revert to horizontal:\n     - Cells (6,4), (6,5), and (6,6) will be alive again.\n     - Cells (5,5) and (7,5) will die due to underpopulation.\n\n4. **Subsequent Steps:**\n   - The blinker will continue to oscillate between the horizontal and vertical configurations every step.\n\nSince the blinker is a stable oscillator with a period of 2, it will continue to oscillate indefinitely without any change in the number of live cells. Therefore, the game will not halt, as there will always be live cells present.\n\nFinal conclusion: The game will not halt at or before 20 steps.\n\n<<<False>>>"
