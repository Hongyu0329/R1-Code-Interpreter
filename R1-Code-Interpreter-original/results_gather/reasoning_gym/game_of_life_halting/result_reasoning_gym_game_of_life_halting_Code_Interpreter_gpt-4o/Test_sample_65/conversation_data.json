    "\nassistant > To determine if the Game of Life grid will halt at or before 20 steps, we need to simulate the game for up to 20 iterations. The rules of the Game of Life are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n2. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nGiven the wrapping topology, the grid behaves as if it is connected at the edges, forming a torus.
