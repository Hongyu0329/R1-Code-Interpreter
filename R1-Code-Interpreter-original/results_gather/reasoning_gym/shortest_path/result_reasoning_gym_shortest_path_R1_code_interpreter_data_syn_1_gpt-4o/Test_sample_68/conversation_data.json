    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning and approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points**: First, we need to locate the positions of the starting point (*) and the destination point (#) in the grid.\n\n2. **Initialize BFS**: We'll use a queue to perform the BFS. The queue will store tuples containing the current position and the path taken to reach that position.\n\n3. **Explore the Grid**: From each position, we'll explore the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) and add the open cells (O) to the queue if they haven't been visited yet.\n\n4. **Track Visited Cells**: To avoid revisiting cells, we'll maintain a set of visited positions.\n\n5. **Check for Destination**: If we reach the destination point (#), we'll return the path taken to get there.\n\n6. **Handle Infeasibility**: If the queue is exhausted without reaching the destination, the path is infeasible.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_shortest_path(grid):\n    # Directions for moving in the grid\n    directions = {'up': (-1, 0), 'down': (1, 0), 'left': (0, -1), 'right': (0, 1)}\n    \n    # Find the start (*) and destination (#) positions\n    start = None\n    destination = None\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*':\n                start = (i, j)\n            elif cell == '#':\n                destination = (i, j)\n    \n    # Initialize BFS\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])  # (position, path)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        (x, y), path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the destination\n        if (x, y) == destination:\n            return ' '.join(path)\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for direction, (dx, dy) in directions.items():\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] != 'X' and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                queue.append(((nx, ny), path + [direction]))\n    \n    return \"infeasible\"\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X', '#', 'O'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'X', '*', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X']\n]\n\n# Find and print the shortest path\nprint(find_shortest_path(grid))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the shortest path.",
