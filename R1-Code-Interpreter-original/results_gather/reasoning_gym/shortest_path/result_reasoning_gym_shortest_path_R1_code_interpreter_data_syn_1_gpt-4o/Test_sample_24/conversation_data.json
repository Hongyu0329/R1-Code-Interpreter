    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning and approach:\n\n1. **Parse the Grid**: First, we need to parse the grid to identify the positions of the starting point (*) and the destination point (#).\n\n2. **BFS Initialization**: Initialize a queue for BFS that will store the current position and the path taken to reach there. Also, maintain a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n3. **BFS Execution**: \n   - Dequeue the front element from the queue, which contains the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - If the current position is the destination (#), return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each valid move (i.e., within bounds, not a blocked cell, and not visited), enqueue the new position along with the updated path.\n\n4. **Check for Infeasibility**: If the queue is exhausted without finding the destination, the path is infeasible.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_shortest_path(grid):\n    # Directions for moving in the grid\n    directions = {\n        'up': (-1, 0),\n        'down': (1, 0),\n        'left': (0, -1),\n        'right': (0, 1)\n    }\n    \n    # Parse the grid to find start (*) and destination (#)\n    start = None\n    destination = None\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*':\n                start = (i, j)\n            elif cell == '#':\n                destination = (i, j)\n    \n    if not start or not destination:\n        return \"infeasible\"\n    \n    # BFS initialization\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    # BFS loop\n    while queue:\n        (current, path) = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the destination\n        if current == destination:\n            return ' '.join(path)\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for direction, (di, dj) in directions.items():\n            ni, nj = current[0] + di, current[1] + dj\n            if 0 <= ni < len(grid) and 0 <= nj < len(grid[0]) and grid[ni][nj] != 'X' and (ni, nj) not in visited:\n                visited.add((ni, nj))\n                queue.append(((ni, nj), path + [direction]))\n    \n    return \"infeasible\"\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    ['O', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', '#'],\n    ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X', '*', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X']\n]\n\n# Find the shortest path\nresult = find_shortest_path(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination in the grid.
