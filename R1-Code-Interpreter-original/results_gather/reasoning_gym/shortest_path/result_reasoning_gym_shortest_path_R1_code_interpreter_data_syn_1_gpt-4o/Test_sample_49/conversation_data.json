    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points**: First, we need to locate the positions of the starting point (*) and the destination point (#) in the grid.\n\n2. **Initialize BFS**: We'll use a queue to perform the BFS. The queue will store tuples containing the current position and the path taken to reach that position.\n\n3. **Explore the Grid**: From the current position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) to open cells (O) that haven't been visited yet. Add these new positions to the queue along with the updated path.\n\n4. **Check for Destination**: If we reach the destination point (#), we return the path taken to get there.\n\n5. **Handle Infeasibility**: If the queue is exhausted and we haven't reached the destination, the path is infeasible.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_shortest_path(grid):\n    # Directions for moving in the grid\n    directions = {'up': (-1, 0), 'down': (1, 0), 'left': (0, -1), 'right': (0, 1)}\n    \n    # Find the start (*) and destination (#) positions\n    start = None\n    destination = None\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*':\n                start = (i, j)\n            elif cell == '#':\n                destination = (i, j)\n    \n    # Initialize BFS\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        (current, path) = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the destination\n        if current == destination:\n            return ' '.join(path)\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for direction, (di, dj) in directions.items():\n            ni, nj = current[0] + di, current[1] + dj\n            if 0 <= ni < len(grid) and 0 <= nj < len(grid[0]) and grid[ni][nj] in ('O', '#') and (ni, nj) not in visited:\n                visited.add((ni, nj))\n                queue.append(((ni, nj), path + [direction]))\n    \n    # If we exhaust the queue without finding the destination\n    return \"infeasible\"\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    ['O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O', '*', 'O'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'X', '#', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['O', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O']\n]\n\n# Find and print the shortest path\nprint(find_shortest_path(grid))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the grid, if it exists, and print the sequence of directions. If no path exists, it will print \"infeasible\".",
