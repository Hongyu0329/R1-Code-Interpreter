    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. The grid is represented as a matrix, and we can only move through open cells (O) in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\nThe approach to solve this problem is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the destination, it has found the shortest path.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Parse the grid to identify the starting point (*) and the destination point (#).\n2. Implement the BFS algorithm:\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the starting point and explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a move leads to the destination, return the path.\n   - If a move leads to an open cell, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n3. If the queue is exhausted without finding the destination, return \"infeasible\".\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_shortest_path(grid):\n    # Directions for moving in the grid\n    directions = {'up': (-1, 0), 'down': (1, 0), 'left': (0, -1), 'right': (0, 1)}\n    \n    # Find the start (*) and destination (#) positions\n    start = None\n    destination = None\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*':\n                start = (i, j)\n            elif cell == '#':\n                destination = (i, j)\n    \n    if not start or not destination:\n        return \"infeasible\"\n    \n    # BFS initialization\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])  # (current_position, path_taken)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    # BFS loop\n    while queue:\n        (current_x, current_y), path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the destination\n        if (current_x, current_y) == destination:\n            return ' '.join(path)\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for direction, (dx, dy) in directions.items():\n            new_x, new_y = current_x + dx, current_y + dy\n            if (0 <= new_x < len(grid) and 0 <= new_y < len(grid[0]) and\n                grid[new_x][new_y] in ('O', '#') and (new_x, new_y) not in visited):\n                visited.add((new_x, new_y))\n                queue.append(((new_x, new_y), path + [direction]))\n    \n    return \"infeasible\"\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    ['O', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'O', '*'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'X', '#', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O']\n]\n\n# Find and print the shortest path\nprint(find_shortest_path(grid))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the shortest path.",
    "The output \"infeasible\" suggests that the BFS algorithm did not find a path from the start (*) to the destination (#).
