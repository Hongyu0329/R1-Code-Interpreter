    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points**: First, we need to locate the positions of the start (*) and destination (#) in the grid.\n\n2. **Initialize BFS**: We'll use a queue to perform the BFS. The queue will store tuples of the form (current_position, path_taken), where `current_position` is the current cell in the grid, and `path_taken` is the sequence of moves taken to reach that cell.\n\n3. **Explore the Grid**: From the current cell, we can move in four possible directions: up, down, left, and right. For each move, we check if the new position is within the grid bounds, is an open cell (O), and has not been visited yet.\n\n4. **Check for Destination**: If we reach the destination (#), we return the path taken to get there.\n\n5. **Handle Infeasibility**: If the queue is exhausted and we haven't reached the destination, it means there's no feasible path.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_shortest_path(grid):\n    # Directions: up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    direction_names = ['up', 'down', 'left', 'right']\n    \n    # Find start (*) and destination (#) positions\n    start = None\n    destination = None\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*':\n                start = (i, j)\n            elif cell == '#':\n                destination = (i, j)\n    \n    if not start or not destination:\n        return \"infeasible\"\n    \n    # BFS initialization\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (current, path) = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the destination\n        if current == destination:\n            return ' '.join(path)\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for direction, (di, dj) in zip(direction_names, directions):\n            ni, nj = current[0] + di, current[1] + dj\n            if 0 <= ni < len(grid) and 0 <= nj < len(grid[0]) and grid[ni][nj] in ('O', '#') and (ni, nj) not in visited:\n                visited.add((ni, nj))\n                queue.append(((ni, nj), path + [direction]))\n    \n    return \"infeasible\"\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    ['O', 'X', '*', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['O', '#', 'O', 'X', 'O']\n]\n\n# Find the shortest path\nresult = find_shortest_path(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the shortest path.",
