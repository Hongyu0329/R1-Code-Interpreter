    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. The grid is represented as a matrix, and we can only move through open cells (O) in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n```\nO X O O X X O\nX O O O O O O\nO X X O * O X\nX O O O # O X\nO X X O X O X\n```\n\nWe can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the destination, it has found the shortest path.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Parse the grid to find the starting point (*) and the destination point (#).\n2. Implement the BFS algorithm to explore the grid from the starting point.\n3. Keep track of the path taken to reach each cell.\n4. Once the destination is reached, reconstruct the path from the starting point to the destination.\n5. If the destination is unreachable, return \"infeasible\".\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_shortest_path(grid):\n    # Directions for moving in the grid: right, down, left, up\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n    direction_names = [\"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\"]\n    \n    # Find the starting and destination points\n    start = None\n    destination = None\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*':\n                start = (i, j)\n            elif cell == '#':\n                destination = (i, j)\n    \n    if not start or not destination:\n        return \"infeasible\"\n    \n    # BFS initialization\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])  # (current_position, path_taken)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (current_x, current_y), path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the destination\n        if (current_x, current_y) == destination:\n            return \" \".join(path)\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for direction, (dx, dy) in zip(direction_names, directions):\n            new_x, new_y = current_x + dx, current_y + dy\n            if (0 <= new_x < len(grid) and 0 <= new_y < len(grid[0]) and\n                grid[new_x][new_y] != 'X' and (new_x, new_y) not in visited):\n                visited.add((new_x, new_y))\n                queue.append(((new_x, new_y), path + [direction]))\n    \n    return \"infeasible\"\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    ['O', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'X', 'O', '*', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'O', '#', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X']\n]\n\n# Find the shortest path\nresult = find_shortest_path(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) and print the sequence of directions. If no path exists, it will print \"infeasible\".",
