    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning and approach:\n\n1. **Parse the Grid**: First, we need to parse the grid to identify the positions of the starting point (*) and the destination point (#).\n\n2. **BFS Initialization**: Initialize a queue for BFS that will store the current position and the path taken to reach there. Also, maintain a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n\n3. **BFS Execution**: \n   - Dequeue the front element from the queue, which contains the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - If the current position is the destination (#), return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each valid move (i.e., within bounds, not blocked, and not visited), enqueue the new position and the updated path.\n\n4. **Check for Infeasibility**: If the queue is exhausted without finding the destination, the path is infeasible.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_shortest_path(grid):\n    # Directions for moving up, down, left, right\n    directions = {'up': (-1, 0), 'down': (1, 0), 'left': (0, -1), 'right': (0, 1)}\n    \n    # Parse the grid to find the start (*) and destination (#) positions\n    start = None\n    destination = None\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*':\n                start = (i, j)\n            elif cell == '#':\n                destination = (i, j)\n    \n    # Initialize BFS\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])  # (current_position, path)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    # BFS loop\n    while queue:\n        (current_x, current_y), path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the destination\n        if (current_x, current_y) == destination:\n            return ' '.join(path)\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for direction, (dx, dy) in directions.items():\n            new_x, new_y = current_x + dx, current_y + dy\n            if 0 <= new_x < len(grid) and 0 <= new_y < len(grid[0]) and grid[new_x][new_y] != 'X' and (new_x, new_y) not in visited:\n                visited.add((new_x, new_y))\n                queue.append(((new_x, new_y), path + [direction]))\n    \n    return \"infeasible\"\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    ['O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['#', 'O', 'O', 'O', '*'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'X']\n]\n\n# Find the shortest path\nresult = find_shortest_path(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the grid, if it exists, and print the sequence of directions. If no path exists, it will print \"infeasible\".",
