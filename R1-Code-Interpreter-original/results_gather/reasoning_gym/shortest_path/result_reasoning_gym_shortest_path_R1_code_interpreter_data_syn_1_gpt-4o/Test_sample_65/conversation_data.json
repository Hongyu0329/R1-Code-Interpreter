    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning and approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points**: First, we need to locate the positions of the starting point (*) and the destination point (#) in the grid.\n\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Setup**: We'll use a queue to perform BFS. The queue will store tuples containing the current position and the path taken to reach that position.\n\n3. **Direction Vectors**: Define the possible movements (up, down, left, right) using direction vectors.\n\n4. **Visited Set**: Maintain a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n\n5. **BFS Execution**: \n   - Start from the initial position (*), and explore all possible moves.\n   - For each move, check if it leads to the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - If a move leads to an open cell (O) that hasn't been visited, add it to the queue with the updated path.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility**: If the queue is exhausted without finding the destination, the path is infeasible.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_shortest_path(grid):\n    # Locate the start (*) and destination (#) points\n    start = None\n    destination = None\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*':\n                start = (i, j)\n            elif cell == '#':\n                destination = (i, j)\n    \n    if not start or not destination:\n        return \"infeasible\"\n    \n    # Define the possible directions (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = {\n        'up': (-1, 0),\n        'down': (1, 0),\n        'left': (0, -1),\n        'right': (0, 1)\n    }\n    \n    # Initialize the BFS queue\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        (current, path) = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current == destination:\n            return ' '.join(path)\n        \n        for direction, (di, dj) in directions.items():\n            ni, nj = current[0] + di, current[1] + dj\n            if 0 <= ni < len(grid) and 0 <= nj < len(grid[0]) and grid[ni][nj] != 'X' and (ni, nj) not in visited:\n                visited.add((ni, nj))\n                queue.append(((ni, nj), path + [direction]))\n    \n    return \"infeasible\"\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    ['O', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X', '*'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O', '#', 'O']\n]\n\n# Find and print the shortest path\nprint(find_shortest_path(grid))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the grid, if it exists, and print the sequence of directions. If no path exists, it will print \"infeasible\".",
