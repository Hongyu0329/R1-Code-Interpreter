    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points**: First, we need to locate the positions of the starting point (*) and the destination point (#) in the grid.\n\n2. **Initialize BFS**: We'll use a queue to perform the BFS. The queue will store tuples of the form (current_position, path), where `current_position` is the current cell in the grid, and `path` is the sequence of moves taken to reach that cell.\n\n3. **Explore the Grid**: From the current cell, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) to adjacent open cells (O). If a move leads to the destination (#), we have found the shortest path.\n\n4. **Track Visited Cells**: To avoid revisiting cells and getting stuck in loops, maintain a set of visited cells.\n\n5. **Output the Path**: Once the destination is reached, output the path. If the queue is exhausted without finding the destination, output \"infeasible\".\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_shortest_path(grid):\n    # Directions for moving in the grid\n    directions = {'up': (-1, 0), 'down': (1, 0), 'left': (0, -1), 'right': (0, 1)}\n    \n    # Find the start (*) and destination (#) positions\n    start = None\n    destination = None\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*':\n                start = (i, j)\n            elif cell == '#':\n                destination = (i, j)\n    \n    # Initialize BFS\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        (current, path) = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the destination\n        if current == destination:\n            return ' '.join(path)\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for direction, (di, dj) in directions.items():\n            ni, nj = current[0] + di, current[1] + dj\n            if 0 <= ni < len(grid) and 0 <= nj < len(grid[0]) and grid[ni][nj] in ('O', '#') and (ni, nj) not in visited:\n                visited.add((ni, nj))\n                queue.append(((ni, nj), path + [direction]))\n    \n    return \"infeasible\"\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    ['O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O'],\n    ['O', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['X', '#', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'O', 'X', 'O', '*', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']\n]\n\n# Find and print the shortest path\nprint(find_shortest_path(grid))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest path from the start to the destination in the grid and print the sequence of directions.
