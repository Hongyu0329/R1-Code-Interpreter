    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. The grid is represented as a matrix, and we can only move through open cells (O) in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\nThe approach to solve this problem is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the destination, it has found the shortest path.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Parse the grid to identify the starting point (*) and the destination point (#).\n2. Initialize a queue for BFS and add the starting point to it.\n3. Use a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n4. Perform BFS:\n   - Dequeue a cell from the queue.\n   - If it's the destination, reconstruct the path and return it.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited open neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n5. If the queue is exhausted without finding the destination, return \"infeasible\".\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_shortest_path(grid):\n    # Directions for moving in the grid: right, down, left, up\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n    direction_names = [\"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\"]\n    \n    # Find the start (*) and destination (#) positions\n    start = None\n    destination = None\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == '*':\n                start = (i, j)\n            elif cell == '#':\n                destination = (i, j)\n    \n    if not start or not destination:\n        return \"infeasible\"\n    \n    # BFS initialization\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])  # (current_position, path_taken)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        (current, path) = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the destination\n        if current == destination:\n            return \"<<<\" + \" \".join(path) + \">>>\"\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for direction, (di, dj) in zip(direction_names, directions):\n            ni, nj = current[0] + di, current[1] + dj\n            if 0 <= ni < len(grid) and 0 <= nj < len(grid[0]) and grid[ni][nj] != 'X' and (ni, nj) not in visited:\n                visited.add((ni, nj))\n                queue.append(((ni, nj), path + [direction]))\n    \n    return \"infeasible\"\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'O', '*', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'O'],\n    ['#', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'O']\n]\n\n# Find and print the shortest path\nprint(find_shortest_path(grid))\n```\n\nThis code will find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination in the grid and print the sequence of directions. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the grid. The output is the sequence of directions needed to reach the destination, which is:\n\n<<<left down down left>>>"
