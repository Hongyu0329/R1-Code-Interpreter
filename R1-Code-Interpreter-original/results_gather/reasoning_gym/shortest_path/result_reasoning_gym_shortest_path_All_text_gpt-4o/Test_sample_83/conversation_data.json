    "To find the shortest path from the start point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the destination, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - Start point (*) is located at (4, 4).\n   - Destination point (#) is located at (2, 5).\n\n2. **Define the Grid:**\n   ```\n   0: O O X O O X\n   1: O X X X O X\n   2: X O X O O X\n   3: X X X O X #\n   4: O O X X * X\n   5: O O X O X O\n   6: O O X O X O\n   ```\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from the position (4, 4).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each position, explore the four possible directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - Check if the new position is within bounds, not blocked (not 'X'), and not visited.\n   - If the new position is the destination (#), record the path and stop the search.\n\n5. **Path Exploration:**\n   - Start from (4, 4) and explore:\n     - Up to (3, 4) is blocked.\n     - Down to (5, 4) is open.\n     - Left to (4, 3) is blocked.\n     - Right to (4, 5) is blocked.\n   - Move to (5, 4) and continue exploring:\n     - Up to (4, 4) is already visited.\n     - Down to (6, 4) is open.\n     - Left to (5, 3) is open.\n     - Right to (5, 5) is blocked.\n   - Continue this process, exploring each open path and marking visited cells, until reaching the destination.\n\n6. **Find the Shortest Path:**\n   - After exploring all possible paths, the shortest path found is:\n     - From (4, 4) to (5, 4) to (6, 4) to (6, 3) to (5, 3) to (4, 3) to (3, 3) to (2, 3) to (2, 4) to (2, 5).\n\n7. **Output the Path:**\n   - The sequence of directions is: down, down, left, up, up, up, right, right.\n\nThe shortest path from * to # is of length 9.\n\nAnswer: 9"
