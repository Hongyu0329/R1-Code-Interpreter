    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 5x7 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is located at (4, 5).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at (0, 0).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These movements correspond to changes in coordinates:\n     - Up: (x-1, y)\n     - Down: (x+1, y)\n     - Left: (x, y-1)\n     - Right: (x, y+1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (4, 5) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, not blocked (X), and not visited.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position with the updated path.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we explore each position, append the corresponding direction to the path.\n   - Directions are represented as strings: \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", \"right\".\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (4, 5).\n- Explore possible moves and update the path:\n  - From (4, 5), move left to (4, 4).\n  - From (4, 4), move up to (3, 4).\n  - From (3, 4), move left to (3, 3).\n  - From (3, 3), move up to (2, 3).\n  - From (2, 3), move left to (2, 2).\n  - From (2, 2), move up to (1, 2).\n  - From (1, 2), move left to (1, 1).\n  - From (1, 1), move up to (0, 1).\n  - From (0, 1), move left to (0, 0), which is the destination.\n\n- The path is feasible, and the sequence of directions is:\n  - <<<left up left up left up left up left>>>\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<left up left up left up left up left>>>"
