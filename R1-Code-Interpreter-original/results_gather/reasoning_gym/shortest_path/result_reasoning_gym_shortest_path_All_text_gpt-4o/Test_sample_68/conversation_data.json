    "To find the shortest path from the start point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the destination, it does so via the shortest path.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - Start point (*) is located at (4, 5).\n   - Destination point (#) is located at (3, 6).\n\n2. **Define the Grid:**\n   ```\n   0: O O O O O O O X\n   1: O X O O X X O X\n   2: X X X O O X O O\n   3: O O X O X X # O\n   4: O X O O X * O O\n   5: X O O O O O O X\n   ```\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from the position (4, 5).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Mark the start position as visited.\n\n4. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each position, explore the four possible directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - Ensure that the new position is within the grid bounds and is an open cell (O) that hasn't been visited yet.\n   - Add the new position to the queue with the updated path.\n\n5. **Check for Destination:**\n   - If the destination (#) is reached, return the path taken to get there.\n\n6. **Handle Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted without reaching the destination, the path is infeasible.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the grid:\n\n- Start at (4, 5).\n- From (4, 5), explore:\n  - Up to (3, 5): Blocked (X).\n  - Down to (5, 5): Open (O).\n  - Left to (4, 4): Blocked (X).\n  - Right to (4, 6): Open (O).\n\n- Move to (5, 5) and (4, 6) and continue exploring:\n  - From (5, 5), explore:\n    - Up to (4, 5): Already visited.\n    - Down to (6, 5): Open (O).\n    - Left to (5, 4): Open (O).\n    - Right to (5, 6): Open (O).\n\n  - From (4, 6), explore:\n    - Up to (3, 6): Destination (#) reached.\n\nThe path from (4, 5) to (3, 6) is:\n- Start at (4, 5).\n- Move right to (4, 6).\n- Move up to (3, 6).\n\nThe sequence of directions is: right, up.\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path is 2.\n\n**Answer:** 2"
