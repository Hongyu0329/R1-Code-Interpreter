    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 7x5 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is located at position (3, 4).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (5, 3).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (x-1, y)\n     - Down: (x+1, y)\n     - Left: (x, y-1)\n     - Right: (x, y+1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid. Each element in the queue will be a tuple containing the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (3, 4) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - Dequeue the front element from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, is an open cell (O), and has not been visited yet.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position with the updated path and mark it as visited.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we explore, construct the path using direction names (up, down, left, right).\n   - If the destination is reached, the path will be the sequence of directions taken.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (3, 4).\n- Explore possible moves and update the path:\n  - From (3, 4), move up to (2, 4), then left to (2, 3), then left to (2, 2), then up to (1, 2), then right to (1, 3), then right to (1, 4), then down to (2, 4), then down to (3, 4), then down to (4, 4), then left to (4, 3), then down to (5, 3).\n- The path is: down, down, left, left, up, right, right, down, down, left, down.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe shortest path from * to # is <<<down down left left up right right down down left down>>>."
