    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 6x5 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is located at (5, 4).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at (2, 1).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These movements correspond to changes in coordinates:\n     - Up: (x, y) -> (x-1, y)\n     - Down: (x, y) -> (x+1, y)\n     - Left: (x, y) -> (x, y-1)\n     - Right: (x, y) -> (x, y+1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start BFS from the starting point (5, 4).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path.\n   - For each possible move (up, down, left, right), calculate the new position.\n   - Check if the new position is within bounds and is an open cell (O) or the destination (#).\n   - If the new position is the destination (#), return the path with the new direction added.\n   - If the new position is an open cell (O) and not visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it with the updated path.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start from (5, 4) and explore possible moves.\n- Move up to (4, 4), then (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), and finally reach (2, 1) which is the destination (#).\n- The sequence of moves is: up, up, up, left, left, left.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe length of the shortest path from * to # is 6."
