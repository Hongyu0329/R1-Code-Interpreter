    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 7x8 matrix.\n   - Starting point (*) is at position (5, 1).\n   - Destination point (#) is at position (2, 6).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (-1, 0)\n     - Down: (1, 0)\n     - Left: (0, -1)\n     - Right: (0, 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid, starting from the initial position (5, 1).\n   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Store the path taken to reach each cell.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Start from the initial position (5, 1) and mark it as visited.\n   - Explore all possible moves from the current position.\n   - For each valid move (i.e., within bounds, not blocked, and not visited), add the new position to the queue and mark it as visited.\n   - Record the path taken to reach each new position.\n   - Continue this process until the destination (#) is reached or the queue is empty.\n\n5. **Check for Feasibility:**\n   - If the destination is reached, the path recorded is the shortest path.\n   - If the queue is exhausted without reaching the destination, the path is \"infeasible.\"\n\n6. **Output the Path:**\n   - If a path is found, convert the sequence of moves into directions (up, down, left, right).\n   - Format the output as specified.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (5, 1).\n- Explore the grid using BFS, keeping track of the path.\n- The shortest path found is: (5, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6).\n- Convert this path into directions: up, up, up, right, right, right, right, right.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe length of the shortest path is 8, and the sequence of directions is <<<up up up right right right right right>>>."
