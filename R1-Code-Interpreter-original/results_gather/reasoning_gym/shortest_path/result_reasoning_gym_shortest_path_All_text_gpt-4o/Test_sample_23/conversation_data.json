    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 5x6 matrix.\n   - Starting point (*) is at position (0, 0).\n   - Destination point (#) is at position (3, 2).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (-1, 0)\n     - Down: (1, 0)\n     - Left: (0, -1)\n     - Right: (0, 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid. Each element in the queue will be a tuple containing the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start with the initial position (0, 0) and an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - Dequeue an element from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, calculate the new position and check if it is within bounds, not blocked (X), and not visited.\n   - If valid, mark the new position as visited and enqueue it with the updated path.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we explore, construct the path using direction names (up, down, left, right).\n   - If the destination is reached, the path will be the sequence of directions taken.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (0, 0).\n- Explore the grid using the BFS approach.\n- The path found is: right, right, down, down, down, left.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe length of the shortest path from * to # is 6. The sequence of directions is <<<right right down down down left>>>."
