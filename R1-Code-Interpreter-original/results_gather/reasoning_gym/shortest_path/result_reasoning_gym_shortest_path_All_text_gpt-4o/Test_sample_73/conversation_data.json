    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - The starting point (*) is located at the bottom of the grid at position (5, 4).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (6, 3).\n\n2. **Define the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 7x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     O X O X X\n     X O X O X\n     X O X O O\n     O X O O O\n     O O X O *\n     O X O O O\n     O O O # O\n     ```\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right, but only through open cells (O).\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**\n   - Initialize a queue with the starting point and a path list.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue the front element, which contains the current position and the path taken to reach it.\n     - If the current position is the destination (#), return the path.\n     - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n     - For each valid move (within bounds, not visited, and not blocked), enqueue the new position and update the path.\n     - Mark the new position as visited.\n\n5. **Implement the BFS:**\n   - Start from (5, 4) and explore the grid using BFS.\n   - Keep track of the path using a list of directions (e.g., \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", \"right\").\n\n6. **Determine the Shortest Path:**\n   - Follow the BFS process to find the shortest path from * to #.\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is \"infeasible\".\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start at (5, 4) and explore:\n  - Move up to (4, 4)\n  - Move left to (4, 3)\n  - Move up to (3, 3)\n  - Move right to (3, 4)\n  - Move down to (4, 4)\n  - Move down to (5, 4)\n  - Move up to (4, 4)\n  - Move up to (3, 4)\n  - Move right to (3, 5)\n  -
