    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - The starting point (*) is located at (0, 5).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at (2, 4).\n\n2. **Define the Grid and Movement:**\n   - The grid is a 6x6 matrix.\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\n3. **Initialize the BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the position of the starting point (*), which is (0, 5).\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, not blocked (X), and not visited.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position and the updated path.\n\n5. **Path Representation:**\n   - Use a sequence of directions (up, down, left, right) to represent the path.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- Start BFS from (0, 5) with an empty path.\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Move left to (0, 4): Blocked (X).\n  - Move right to (0, 6): Out of bounds.\n  - Move up to (-1, 5): Out of bounds.\n  - Move down to (1, 5): Open (O), enqueue (1, 5) with path \"down\".\n- Continue BFS from (1, 5):\n  - Move left to (1, 4): Open (O), enqueue (1, 4) with path \"down left\".\n  - Move right to (1, 6): Out of bounds.\n  - Move up to (0, 5): Already visited.\n  - Move down to (2, 5): Open (O), enqueue (2, 5) with path \"down down\".\n- Continue BFS from (1, 4):\n  - Move left to (1, 3): Open (O), enqueue (1, 3) with path \"down left left\".\n  - Move right to (1, 5): Already visited.\n  - Move up to (0, 4): Blocked (X).\n  - Move down to (2, 4): Destination (#), path found \"down left down\".\n\nThe shortest path from * to # is \"down left down\".\n\nFinal answer: <<<down left down>>>"
