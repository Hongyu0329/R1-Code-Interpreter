    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 6x5 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is at position (5, 1).\n   - The destination point (#) is at position (5, 4).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (-1, 0)\n     - Down: (1, 0)\n     - Left: (0, -1)\n     - Right: (0, 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (5, 1) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, calculate the new position and check if it is within bounds, not blocked (X), and not visited.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position with the updated path.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we move, construct the path using direction names (up, down, left, right).\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (5, 1).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - From (5, 1), move right to (5, 2).\n  - From (5, 2), move right to (5, 3).\n  - From (5, 3), move right to (5, 4) which is the destination (#).\n\n- The path is: right, right, right.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe shortest path from * to # is of length 3, and the sequence of directions is:\n\n<<<right right right>>>"
