    "To find the shortest path from the start point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the destination, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - Start point (*) is located at (2, 2).\n   - Destination point (#) is located at (4, 0).\n\n2. **Define the Grid:**\n   ```\n   X O O X O X X X\n   O O O X O O X X\n   O O * O O X O O\n   O O X O X X X O\n   # O O O O X O X\n   X X X O O O O X\n   X O O O O O X X\n   O X O X X O O O\n   ```\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from the position (2, 2).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Mark the start position as visited.\n\n4. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each cell, explore the four possible directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - Ensure that the new position is within the grid bounds and is an open cell (O) or the destination (#).\n   - If the destination is reached, record the path and stop the search.\n\n5. **Path Exploration:**\n   - Start from (2, 2) and explore:\n     - Right to (2, 3)\n     - Down to (3, 2)\n     - Left to (2, 1)\n     - Up to (1, 2)\n   - Continue exploring from each new position, marking cells as visited to avoid revisiting.\n\n6. **Find the Shortest Path:**\n   - The BFS will find the shortest path by nature of its level-order exploration.\n   - Once the destination (4, 0) is reached, the path taken is the shortest.\n\n7. **Output the Path:**\n   - Convert the path into a sequence of directions (right, left, up, down).\n\nFollowing these steps, the shortest path from * to # is found as follows:\n\n- Start at (2, 2)\n- Move right to (2, 3)\n- Move down to (3, 3)\n- Move down to (4, 3)\n- Move left to (4, 2)\n- Move left to (4, 1)\n- Move left to (4, 0)\n\nThe sequence of directions is: right, down, down, left, left, left.\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path is 6.\n\n**Answer: 6**"
