    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 5x5 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is at position (3, 1).\n   - The destination point (#) is at position (3, 0).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These movements correspond to changes in coordinates:\n     - Up: (x, y) -> (x-1, y)\n     - Down: (x, y) -> (x+1, y)\n     - Left: (x, y) -> (x, y-1)\n     - Right: (x, y) -> (x, y+1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid. Each element in the queue will be a tuple containing the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start with the initial position of the starting point (*) and an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - Dequeue the front element from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each valid move (within bounds and not blocked), enqueue the new position along with the updated path.\n   - Mark the current position as visited to avoid revisiting.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start at (3, 1) with path `[]`.\n- Possible moves from (3, 1):\n  - Up to (2, 1): Valid, path becomes `[up]`.\n  - Down to (4, 1): Blocked.\n  - Left to (3, 0): Valid, path becomes `[left]`.\n  - Right to (3, 2): Blocked.\n- Enqueue valid moves: (2, 1) with path `[up]` and (3, 0) with path `[left]`.\n- Dequeue (3, 0) with path `[left]`.\n- (3, 0) is the destination (#), so the path `[left]` is the shortest path.\n\nThe shortest path from * to # is `<<<left>>>`."
