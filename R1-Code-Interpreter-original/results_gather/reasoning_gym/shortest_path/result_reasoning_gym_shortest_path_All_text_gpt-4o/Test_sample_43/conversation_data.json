    "To find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - The starting point (*) is located at position (1, 6).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (4, 5).\n\n2. **Define the Grid and Movement:**\n   - The grid is an 8x8 matrix.\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the position of the starting point (*), which is (1, 6).\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, is an open cell (O), and has not been visited yet.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position and the updated path.\n\n5. **Path Representation:**\n   - Use a sequence of directions (up, down, left, right) to represent the path.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given grid:\n\n- Start BFS from (1, 6).\n- Explore possible moves and keep track of the path.\n- The shortest path found is: (1, 6) -> (2, 6) -> (2, 5) -> (3, 5) -> (4, 5).\n\nThe sequence of directions for this path is:\n- Start at (1, 6), move down to (2, 6).\n- Move left to (2, 5).\n- Move down to (3, 5).\n- Move down to (4, 5).\n\nThe path in terms of directions is: down, left, down, down.\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path is 4.\n\nFinal Answer: 4"
