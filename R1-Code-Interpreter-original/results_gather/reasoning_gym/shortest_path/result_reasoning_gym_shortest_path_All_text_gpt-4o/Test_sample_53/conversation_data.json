    "To find the shortest path from the start point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the destination, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - Start point (*) is at position (5, 4).\n   - Destination point (#) is at position (1, 0).\n\n2. **Grid Representation:**\n   ```\n   0: X O X O O\n   1: # X X O O\n   2: O O O O X\n   3: O X O O O\n   4: O X O X O\n   5: X O X O *\n   ```\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from the position (5, 4).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Mark visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **Define Possible Moves:**\n   - Up: (x-1, y)\n   - Down: (x+1, y)\n   - Left: (x, y-1)\n   - Right: (x, y+1)\n\n5. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Start from (5, 4) and explore all possible moves.\n   - Check if the move is within bounds and leads to an open cell (O) or the destination (#).\n   - If the destination is reached, record the path and stop the search.\n   - If a move is valid, add the new position and the updated path to the queue.\n   - Continue until the queue is empty or the destination is found.\n\n6. **Path Exploration:**\n   - From (5, 4), move up to (4, 4).\n   - From (4, 4), move up to (3, 4).\n   - From (3, 4), move left to (3, 3).\n   - From (3, 3), move up to (2, 3).\n   - From (2, 3), move left to (2, 2).\n   - From (2, 2), move left to (2, 1).\n   - From (2, 1), move up to (1, 1).\n   - From (1, 1), move left to (1, 0) which is the destination (#).\n\n7. **Path Directions:**\n   - The sequence of moves is: up, up, left, up, left, left, up, left.\n\n8. **Output the Path:**\n   - The path is represented as <<<up up left up left left up left>>>.\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path from * to # is 8.\n\nAnswer: 8"
