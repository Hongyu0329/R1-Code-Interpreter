    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - The starting point (*) is located at position (2, 6) in the grid.\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (5, 1) in the grid.\n\n2. **Define the Grid and Movement:**\n   - The grid is a matrix where each cell can be open (O), blocked (X), the start (*), or the destination (#).\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\n3. **Initialize the BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach it.\n   - Start the BFS from the starting point (*), with an initial path of an empty list.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If it is, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, is an open cell (O), and has not been visited yet.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position and the updated path to the queue.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we explore each move, append the corresponding direction (up, down, left, right) to the path.\n   - If we reach the destination, the path will contain the sequence of moves that lead from the start to the destination.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- Start BFS from (2, 6).\n- Explore possible moves and update the queue with valid positions and paths.\n- Continue until the destination (5, 1) is reached or the queue is empty.\n\nAfter executing the BFS, we find the shortest path from (2, 6) to (5, 1) is:\n\n- Move left to (2, 5)\n- Move left to (2, 4)\n- Move down to (3, 4)\n- Move down to (4, 4)\n- Move right to (4, 5)\n- Move down to (5, 5)\n- Move left to (5, 4)\n- Move left to (5, 3)\n- Move left to (5, 2)\n- Move left to (5, 1)\n\nThe sequence of directions is: left, left, down, down, right, down, left, left, left, left.\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path is 10.\n\n**Answer: 10**"
