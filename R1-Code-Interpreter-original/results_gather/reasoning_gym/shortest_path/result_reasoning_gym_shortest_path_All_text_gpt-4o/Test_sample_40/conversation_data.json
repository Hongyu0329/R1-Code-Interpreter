    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 5x6 matrix.\n   - Starting point (*) is at position (4, 2).\n   - Destination point (#) is at position (1, 3).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (-1, 0)\n     - Down: (1, 0)\n     - Left: (0, -1)\n     - Right: (0, 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid, starting from the starting point (*).\n   - Each element in the queue will store the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Start from the initial position (4, 2) with an empty path.\n   - Mark the starting position as visited.\n   - Explore all possible moves from the current position.\n   - For each valid move (within bounds, not blocked, and not visited), add the new position and updated path to the queue.\n   - If the destination (#) is reached, return the path.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we explore, keep track of the path using direction names (up, down, left, right).\n   - If the destination is reached, the path will be the sequence of directions taken.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (4, 2).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - From (4, 2), move up to (3, 2).\n  - From (3, 2), move up to (2, 2).\n  - From (2, 2), move right to (2, 3).\n  - From (2, 3), move up to (1, 3) which is the destination (#).\n\n- The path taken is: up, up, right, up.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe length of the shortest path from * to # is 4."
