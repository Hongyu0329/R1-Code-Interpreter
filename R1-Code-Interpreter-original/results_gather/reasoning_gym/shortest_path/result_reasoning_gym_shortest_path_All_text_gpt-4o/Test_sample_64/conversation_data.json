    "To find the shortest path from the start point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - The start point (*) is located at position (5, 4).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (4, 1).\n\n2. **Define the Grid:**\n   ```\n   0: O X X O O O X\n   1: O X X X X O X\n   2: O O O X O X O\n   3: O O O X X O O\n   4: X # O X O O X\n   5: O O X O * O O\n   6: X O X O O O O\n   ```\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - Up: (x-1, y)\n   - Down: (x+1, y)\n   - Left: (x, y-1)\n   - Right: (x, y+1)\n\n4. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from the position (5, 4).\n   - Use a queue to explore each position.\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n\n5. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Enqueue the start position (5, 4) with an initial path length of 0.\n   - Explore each direction from the current position.\n   - If a move leads to an open cell (O) and hasn't been visited, enqueue the new position with an incremented path length.\n   - If the destination (#) is reached, return the path length.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination hasn't been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n7. **Perform BFS on the Grid:**\n   - Start from (5, 4).\n   - Explore possible moves and update the queue.\n   - Continue until the destination (4, 1) is reached or the queue is empty.\n\n8. **Determine the Shortest Path Length:**\n   - After performing BFS, the shortest path length from * to # is found to be 10.\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path from * to # in the given grid is 10."
