    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 6x6 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is located at (0, 2).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at (2, 0).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These movements correspond to changes in coordinates:\n     - Up: (x-1, y)\n     - Down: (x+1, y)\n     - Left: (x, y-1)\n     - Right: (x, y+1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (0, 2) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each valid move (within bounds and not blocked), enqueue the new position and the updated path.\n   - Mark the visited positions to avoid revisiting.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Output the Path:**\n   - If a path is found, format it as a sequence of directions enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start at (0, 2) with path: []\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Right to (0, 3): Path = [right]\n  - Down to (1, 2): Path = [down]\n- Continue exploring from each new position:\n  - From (0, 3): Right to (0, 4), Down to (1, 3)\n  - From (1, 2): Down to (2, 2), Left to (1, 1)\n- Continue this process, ensuring to avoid blocked cells and revisiting cells.\n- Eventually, reach (2, 0) from (2, 1) with the path: [down, down, left, left]\n\n### Final Path:\n\nThe shortest path from * to # is:\n- Start at (0, 2)\n- Move down to (1, 2)\n- Move down to (2, 2)\n- Move left to (2, 1)\n- Move left to (2, 0)\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence of directions: <<<down down left left>>>\n\n**Answer: 4**"
