    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 5x7 matrix.\n   - Starting point (*) is at position (2, 0).\n   - Destination point (#) is at position (3, 6).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (-1, 0)\n     - Down: (1, 0)\n     - Left: (0, -1)\n     - Right: (0, 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid. Each element in the queue will store the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (2, 0) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - Dequeue the front element from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, calculate the new position and check if it is within bounds, not blocked (X), and not visited.\n   - If valid, mark the new position as visited and enqueue it with the updated path.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Output the Path:**\n   - If a path is found, format it as specified.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (2, 0).\n- Explore possible moves and update the queue:\n  - From (2, 0), move to (2, 1) [right].\n  - From (2, 1), move to (3, 1) [down].\n  - From (3, 1), move to (3, 2) [right].\n  - From (3, 2), move to (3, 3) [right].\n  - From (3, 3), move to (3, 4) [right].\n  - From (3, 4), move to (3, 5) [right].\n  - From (3, 5), move to (3, 6) [right], which is the destination.\n\n- The path taken is: right, down, right, right, right, right, right.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe length of the shortest path from * to # is 7, and the path is <<<right down right right right right right>>>."
