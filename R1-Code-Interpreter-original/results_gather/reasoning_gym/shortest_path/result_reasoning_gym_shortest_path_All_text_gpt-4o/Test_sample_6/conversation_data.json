    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - The starting point (*) is located at the last cell of the first row, which is (0, 7).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at the third cell of the first row, which is (0, 2).\n\n2. **Define the Grid and Movement:**\n   - The grid is an 8x8 matrix.\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (0, 7) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the front element from the queue, which contains the current position and the path.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, is an open cell (O), and has not been visited yet.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position with the updated path and mark it as visited.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Output the Path:**\n   - If a path is found, output the sequence of directions enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- Start BFS from (0, 7).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Move left to (0, 6), then to (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), and finally reach (0, 2).\n- The path is: left, left, left, left, left.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from * to # is:\n\n<<<left left left left left>>>"
