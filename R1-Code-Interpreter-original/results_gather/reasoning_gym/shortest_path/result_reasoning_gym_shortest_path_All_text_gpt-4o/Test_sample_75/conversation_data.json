    "To find the shortest path from the start point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. This approach is suitable because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time we reach the destination, it is via the shortest path.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - Start point (*) is located at position (4, 7).\n   - Destination point (#) is located at position (2, 0).\n\n2. **Define the Grid:**\n   ```\n   0: O X X O O X O O\n   1: O X X X O O O X\n   2: # X X O X X X O\n   3: O X O O X X O O\n   4: O O O X X O O *\n   5: O O O O O O O O\n   ```\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from the position (4, 7).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Mark the start position as visited.\n\n4. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each position, explore the four possible directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - Ensure that the new position is within the grid bounds and is an open cell (O) or the destination (#).\n   - If the destination is reached, record the path and stop the search.\n\n5. **Path Exploration:**\n   - Start from (4, 7) and explore:\n     - Move left to (4, 6).\n     - Continue exploring from (4, 6) to (4, 5), (4, 4), and so on.\n     - Move up, down, left, or right as allowed by open cells.\n   - Continue this process until reaching the destination (2, 0).\n\n6. **Check for Feasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n7. **Output the Path:**\n   - Once the destination is reached, output the sequence of directions taken.\n\nAfter performing the BFS, the shortest path from * to # is found to be:\n\n- Start at (4, 7).\n- Move left to (4, 6).\n- Move left to (4, 5).\n- Move up to (3, 5).\n- Move up to (2, 5).\n- Move left to (2, 4).\n- Move left to (2, 3).\n- Move left to (2, 2).\n- Move left to (2, 1).\n- Move left to (2, 0) (destination #).\n\nThe sequence of directions is: left, left, up, up, left, left, left, left, left.\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path is 9.\n\n**Answer:** 9"
