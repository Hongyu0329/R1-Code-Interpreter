    "To find the shortest path from the start point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the destination, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - The start point (*) is located at position (5, 1).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (5, 2).\n\n2. **Define the Grid:**\n   ```\n   0: O O X O X\n   1: X O X X X\n   2: O O O O O\n   3: O X O X O\n   4: X X O O O\n   5: O * # O X\n   6: X X X O X\n   ```\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from the position (5, 1).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each position, explore the four possible directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - Ensure that the new position is within the grid bounds and is an open cell (O) or the destination (#).\n   - If the destination (#) is reached, return the path.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Exploration:**\n   - Start at (5, 1) with path [].\n   - Move right to (5, 2), which is the destination (#).\n\n6. **Path Found:**\n   - The path from (5, 1) to (5, 2) is simply moving right once.\n\n7. **Output the Path:**\n   - The sequence of directions is \"right\".\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path from * to # is 1.\n\nAnswer: 1"
