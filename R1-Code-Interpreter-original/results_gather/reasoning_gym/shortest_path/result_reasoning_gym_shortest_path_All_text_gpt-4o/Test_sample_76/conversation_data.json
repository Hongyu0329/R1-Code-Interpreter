    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 6x5 matrix.\n   - Starting point (*) is at position (0, 0).\n   - Destination point (#) is at position (3, 4).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (-1, 0)\n     - Down: (1, 0)\n     - Left: (0, -1)\n     - Right: (0, 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid. Each element in the queue will store the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start with the initial position (0, 0) and an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - Dequeue the front element from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, is an open cell (O), and has not been visited yet.\n   - If valid, mark the new position as visited, and enqueue it with the updated path.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we explore, construct the path using direction names (up, down, left, right).\n   - If the destination is reached, the path will be the sequence of directions taken.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start at (0, 0) with path `[]`.\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Right to (0, 1) is blocked (X).\n  - Down to (1, 0) is blocked (X).\n- No valid moves from (0, 0), so the queue becomes empty.\n\nSince the queue is empty and we haven't reached the destination, the path is infeasible.\n\n**Final Answer:**\ninfeasible"
