    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is an 8x8 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is at position (0, 2).\n   - The destination point (#) is at position (2, 6).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These movements correspond to changes in grid coordinates:\n     - Up: (x-1, y)\n     - Down: (x+1, y)\n     - Left: (x, y-1)\n     - Right: (x, y+1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (0, 2) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the front element from the queue, which contains the current position and the path.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, is an open cell (O), and has not been visited yet.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position with the updated path and mark it as visited.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we explore each valid move, append the corresponding direction to the path.\n   - Directions are represented as strings: \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", \"right\".\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (0, 2).\n- Explore possible moves and update the path accordingly.\n- Continue until the destination (2, 6) is reached or the queue is empty.\n\n### Result:\n\nAfter executing the BFS, the shortest path from * to # is found to be:\n\n<<<down down right right right down down right>>>\n\nThe length of this path is 8 steps."
