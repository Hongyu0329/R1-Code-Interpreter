    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Key Points:**\n   - The grid is a 6x7 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is located at (1, 3).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at (5, 5).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: up (-1, 0), down (+1, 0), left (0, -1), right (0, +1).\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach it.\n   - Start from the position of the starting point (*), which is (1, 3).\n   - The initial path is empty.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If so, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, calculate the new position and check if it is within bounds, not blocked (X), and not visited.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position and update the path with the corresponding direction.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Output the Result:**\n   - If a path is found, output the sequence of directions.\n   - If no path is found, output \"infeasible\".\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- Start BFS from (1, 3).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Right to (1, 4): Valid, path = [right].\n  - Down to (2, 3): Valid, path = [down].\n- Continue BFS from these positions.\n- Eventually, reach the destination (5, 5) with the path:\n  - [right, down, down, down, right, right, down].\n\nThe sequence of directions is:\n- Right, Down, Down, Down, Right, Right, Down.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from * to # is:\n\n<<<right down down down right right down>>>"
