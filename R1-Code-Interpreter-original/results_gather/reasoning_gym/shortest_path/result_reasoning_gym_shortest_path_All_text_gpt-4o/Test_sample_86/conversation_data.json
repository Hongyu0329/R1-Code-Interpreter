    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 6x7 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is located at position (2, 2).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (1, 0).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These movements correspond to changes in the grid indices:\n     - Up: (row - 1, col)\n     - Down: (row + 1, col)\n     - Left: (row, col - 1)\n     - Right: (row, col + 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach it.\n   - Start from the initial position (2, 2) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each valid move (i.e., within bounds and not blocked), enqueue the new position and the updated path.\n   - Mark the visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we explore the grid, we construct the path using the directions taken (up, down, left, right).\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- Start at (2, 2) with path: []\n- From (2, 2), move right to (2, 3) with path: [right]\n- From (2, 3), move up to (1, 3) with path: [right, up]\n- From (1, 3), move left to (1, 2) with path: [right, up, left]\n- From (1, 2), move left to (1, 1) with path: [right, up, left, left]\n- From (1, 1), move left to (1, 0) with path: [right, up, left, left, left]\n\nThe destination (#) is reached at (1, 0) with the path: [right, up, left, left, left].\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from * to # is:\n\n<<<right up left left left>>>"
