    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 5x6 matrix:\n     ```\n     O X * O O X\n     X O X O X O\n     O O X X O O\n     O O O X X O\n     X O O O # O\n     ```\n   - Starting point (*) is at position (0, 2).\n   - Destination point (#) is at position (4, 4).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (-1, 0)\n     - Down: (1, 0)\n     - Left: (0, -1)\n     - Right: (0, 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (0, 2) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, calculate the new position and check if it is within bounds, not blocked (X), and not visited.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position and update the path with the corresponding direction.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we explore the grid, keep track of the path using direction strings (\"up\", \"down\", \"left\", \"right\").\n   - If we reach the destination, the path will be the sequence of directions taken.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (0, 2).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Right to (0, 3)\n  - Down to (1, 2) is blocked\n  - Left to (0, 1) is blocked\n  - Up is out of bounds\n- Continue exploring from (0, 3):\n  - Right to (0, 4)\n  - Down to (1, 3)\n- Continue exploring from (0, 4):\n  - Right is blocked\n  - Down to (1, 4)\n- Continue exploring from (1, 3):\n  - Right is blocked\n  - Down to (2, 3) is blocked\n  - Left to (1, 2) is blocked\n  - Up to (0, 3) is already visited\n- Continue exploring from (1, 4):\n  - Right is blocked\n  - Down to (2, 4)\n- Continue exploring from (2, 4):\n  - Right to (2, 5)\n  - Down to (3, 4) is blocked\n  - Left to (2, 3) is blocked\n  - Up to (1, 4) is already visited\n- Continue exploring from (2, 5):\n  - Right is out of bounds\n  - Down to (3, 5)\n- Continue exploring from (3, 5):\n  - Right is out of bounds\n  - Down to (4, 5)\n- Continue exploring from (4, 5):\n  - Right is out of bounds\n  - Down is out of bounds\n  - Left to (4, 4) (destination reached)\n\n### Path Found:\n- The path from * to # is: right, right, down, down, down, left, left.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<right right down down down left left>>>"
