    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 7x5 matrix.\n   - Starting point (*) is at position (6, 3).\n   - Destination point (#) is at position (1, 2).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (-1, 0)\n     - Down: (1, 0)\n     - Left: (0, -1)\n     - Right: (0, 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid, starting from the initial position (6, 3).\n   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Store the path taken to reach each cell.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Start from the initial position (6, 3) and mark it as visited.\n   - Explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each valid move (i.e., within bounds, not blocked, and not visited), add the new position to the queue and mark it as visited.\n   - Record the path taken to reach each new position.\n   - If the destination (#) is reached, stop the search and output the path.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - If the destination is reached, construct the path using the recorded directions.\n   - If the queue is exhausted without reaching the destination, the path is \"infeasible.\"\n\n6. **Output the Result:**\n   - If a path is found, output the sequence of directions.\n   - If no path is found, output \"infeasible.\"\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (6, 3).\n- Explore possible moves and update the queue:\n  - From (6, 3), move up to (5, 3).\n  - From (5, 3), move up to (4, 3).\n  - From (4, 3), move left to (4, 2).\n  - From (4, 2), move up to (3, 2).\n  - From (3, 2), move up to (2, 2).\n  - From (2, 2), move up to (1, 2) (destination reached).\n\n- The path is: (6, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2).\n\n- Convert the path to directions:\n  - Up, Up, Left, Up, Up, Up.\n\n- Output the path in the required format.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<up up left up up up>>>"
