    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 7x5 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is at position (0, 2).\n   - The destination point (#) is at position (1, 3).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (-1, 0)\n     - Down: (1, 0)\n     - Left: (0, -1)\n     - Right: (0, 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (0, 2) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, calculate the new position and check if it is within bounds, not blocked (X), and not visited.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position and the updated path.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we explore, keep track of the path using direction names (up, down, left, right).\n   - If we reach the destination, the path will be the sequence of directions taken.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- Start at (0, 2).\n- From (0, 2), the possible moves are:\n  - Down to (1, 2) [open cell]\n  - Right to (0, 3) [blocked]\n  - Left to (0, 1) [blocked]\n  - Up is out of bounds.\n\n- Move to (1, 2) with path \"down\".\n- From (1, 2), the possible moves are:\n  - Down to (2, 2) [blocked]\n  - Right to (1, 3) [destination]\n  - Left to (1, 1) [open cell]\n  - Up to (0, 2) [already visited]\n\n- Move to (1, 3) with path \"down right\". This is the destination.\n\nThe shortest path from * to # is \"down right\", which corresponds to a path length of 2.\n\n**Answer: 2**"
