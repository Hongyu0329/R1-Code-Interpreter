    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - The starting point (*) is located at position (1, 6).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (1, 0).\n\n2. **Grid Representation:**\n   ```\n   0: O X X X O X O O\n   1: # X X X X O * O\n   2: X X O O X X X O\n   3: O X O X O X O X\n   4: O X O O X O O X\n   5: X O X X O O O O\n   ```\n\n3. **BFS Initialization:**\n   - Start from the position (1, 6).\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid, starting with the initial position.\n   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Maintain a path list to record the sequence of moves.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - From each cell, explore the four possible directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - Check if the move is within bounds and leads to an open cell (O) or the destination (#).\n   - If the destination (#) is reached, record the path and stop the search.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we explore, keep track of the path taken to reach each cell.\n   - Once the destination is reached, reconstruct the path from the start to the destination.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the grid:\n\n- Start at (1, 6) and explore the possible moves.\n- The first move is to (1, 5) (left).\n- From (1, 5), move to (1, 4) (left).\n- From (1, 4), move to (0, 4) (up).\n- From (0, 4), move to (0, 3) (left).\n- From (0, 3), move to (0, 2) (left).\n- From (0, 2), move to (0, 1) (left).\n- From (0, 1), move to (0, 0) (left).\n- From (0, 0), move to (1, 0) (down), reaching the destination (#).\n\nThe sequence of moves is: left, left, up, left, left, left, down.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from * to # is:\n<<<left left up left left left down>>>"
