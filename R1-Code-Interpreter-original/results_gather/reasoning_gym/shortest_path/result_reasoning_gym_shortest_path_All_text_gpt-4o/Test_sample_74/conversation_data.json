    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 9x5 matrix.\n   - Starting point (*) is at position (5, 2).\n   - Destination point (#) is at position (2, 4).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (-1, 0)\n     - Down: (1, 0)\n     - Left: (0, -1)\n     - Right: (0, 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid, starting from the starting point (*).\n   - Each element in the queue will store the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - Start from the initial position (5, 2) with an empty path.\n   - Mark the starting position as visited.\n   - For each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a move leads to an open cell (O) and hasn't been visited, add it to the queue with the updated path.\n   - If a move reaches the destination (#), return the path.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination hasn't been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Output the Path:**\n   - If a path is found, convert the sequence of moves into the required format.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (5, 2).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - From (5, 2), move up to (4, 2).\n  - From (4, 2), move up to (3, 2).\n  - From (3, 2), move right to (3, 3).\n  - From (3, 3), move up to (2, 3).\n  - From (2, 3), move right to (2, 4) which is the destination (#).\n\n- The path taken is: up, up, right, up, right.\n\n- Convert the path to the required format: <<<up up right up right>>>\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<up up right up right>>>"
