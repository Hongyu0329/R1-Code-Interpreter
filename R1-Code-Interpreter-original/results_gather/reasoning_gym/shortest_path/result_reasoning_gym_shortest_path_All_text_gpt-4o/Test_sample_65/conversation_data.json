    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - The starting point (*) is located at the coordinates (0, 7).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at the coordinates (5, 6).\n\n2. **Define the Grid and Movement:**\n   - The grid is a 6x8 matrix.\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\n3. **Initialize the BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the position of the starting point (*), which is (0, 7).\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, is an open cell (O), and has not been visited yet.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position and the updated path.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - Keep track of the path using a sequence of directions (up, down, left, right).\n   - If the destination is reached, the path will be the sequence of directions taken to reach there.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- Start BFS from (0, 7).\n- Explore possible moves and update the queue with valid positions and paths.\n- Continue until the destination (5, 6) is reached or the queue is empty.\n\nAfter executing the BFS, the shortest path from * to # is found to be:\n\n- Path: <<<left down down right right down down right right>>>\n\nThe length of this path is 9 steps.\n\n**Answer: 9**"
