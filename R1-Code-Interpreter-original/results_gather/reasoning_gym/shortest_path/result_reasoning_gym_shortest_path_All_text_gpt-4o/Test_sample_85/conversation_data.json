    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 6x6 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is at position (1, 5).\n   - The destination point (#) is at position (1, 2).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: up (-1, 0), down (+1, 0), left (0, -1), right (0, +1).\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid. Each element in the queue will store the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (1, 5) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, calculate the new position and check if it is within bounds, not blocked (X), and not visited.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position and update the path with the corresponding direction.\n\n5. **Mark Visited:**\n   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles and redundant checks.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (1, 5).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - From (1, 5), move left to (1, 4).\n  - From (1, 4), move left to (1, 3).\n  - From (1, 3), move left to (1, 2), which is the destination.\n\n- The path taken is: left, left, left.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe shortest path from * to # is of length 3, and the sequence of directions is:\n\n<<<left left left>>>"
