    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 6x7 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is at position (5, 6).\n   - The destination point (#) is at position (2, 6).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (-1, 0)\n     - Down: (1, 0)\n     - Left: (0, -1)\n     - Right: (0, 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid, starting from the starting point (*).\n   - Each element in the queue should store the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Start from the initial position (5, 6) with an empty path.\n   - Mark the starting position as visited.\n   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n     - Dequeue the front element, which gives the current position and path.\n     - If the current position is the destination (#), return the path.\n     - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n     - For each move, calculate the new position.\n     - Check if the new position is within bounds, not visited, and not blocked (X).\n     - If valid, mark it as visited, and enqueue the new position with the updated path.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Output the Result:**\n   - If a path is found, output the sequence of directions.\n   - If no path is found, output \"infeasible\".\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start from (5, 6) and explore possible moves.\n- The path found using BFS is:\n  - Move up to (4, 6)\n  - Move up to (3, 6)\n  - Move up to (2, 6) which is the destination.\n\n- The sequence of directions is: up, up, up.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe length of the shortest path from * to # is 3."
