    "To solve the problem of finding the shortest path from the start point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points**: \n   - The grid is a 6x7 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is located at (5, 5).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at (5, 6).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions**:\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: up (-1, 0), down (+1, 0), left (0, -1), right (0, +1).\n\n3. **Initialize BFS**:\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the position of the starting point (*), which is (5, 5).\n\n4. **BFS Execution**:\n   - Dequeue the front element from the queue, which contains the current position and the path taken.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If it is, the path taken is the shortest path.\n   - If not, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, is an open cell (O), and has not been visited yet.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position along with the updated path.\n   - Mark the new position as visited to avoid revisiting.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility**:\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - If a path is found, output the sequence of directions.\n   - If no path is found, output \"infeasible\".\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- Start at (5, 5) with path [].\n- From (5, 5), the only open move is to the right (5, 6).\n- (5, 6) is the destination (#), so the path is complete.\n\nThe sequence of directions from * to # is simply \"right\".\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path is 1.\n\n**Answer**: 1"
