    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - Start point (*) is located at (7, 0).\n   - Destination point (#) is located at (0, 4).\n\n2. **Define the Grid:**\n   - The grid is an 8x7 matrix with the following layout:\n     ```\n     O X X X # O O\n     O O O X X X O\n     X X O O O O X\n     O O X X O O O\n     X O O X O O X\n     O O O X X X O\n     X O X O O O X\n     * X O X O X O\n     ```\n\n3. **Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\n4. **BFS Initialization:**\n   - Start BFS from the starting point (7, 0).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n\n5. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - For each possible move (up, down, left, right), calculate the new position.\n   - Check if the new position is within bounds, not blocked (X), and not visited.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position and the updated path, and mark the new position as visited.\n\n6. **Path Construction:**\n   - The path is constructed as a sequence of directions (up, down, left, right) from the start to the destination.\n\n7. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (7, 0).\n- Explore possible moves and update the queue with valid positions and paths.\n- Continue until the destination (0, 4) is reached or the queue is empty.\n\n### Result:\n\nAfter executing the BFS, the shortest path from * to # is found to be:\n\n- Path: <<<up up up up right right right right up up left left>>>\n\nThe length of the shortest path is 12.\n\n**Final Answer: 12**"
