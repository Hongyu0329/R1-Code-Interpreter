    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 7x8 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is located at (6, 2).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at (6, 7).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: up (-1, 0), down (+1, 0), left (0, -1), right (0, +1).\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid, starting from the starting point (*).\n   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Store the path taken to reach each cell.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - Start from the initial position (6, 2).\n   - Explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, not blocked (not 'X'), and not visited.\n   - If the new position is the destination (#), record the path and stop the search.\n   - Otherwise, add the new position to the queue and mark it as visited.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - If the destination is reached, construct the path using the recorded directions.\n   - If the queue is exhausted without reaching the destination, the path is \"infeasible\".\n\n6. **Output the Result:**\n   - If a path is found, output the sequence of directions.\n   - If no path is found, output \"infeasible\".\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- Start BFS from (6, 2).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Right to (6, 3): Open cell, add to queue.\n  - Up to (5, 2): Blocked cell, ignore.\n  - Left to (6, 1): Blocked cell, ignore.\n  - Down to (7, 2): Out of bounds, ignore.\n- Continue BFS from (6, 3).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Right to (6, 4): Blocked cell, ignore.\n  - Up to (5, 3): Open cell, add to queue.\n  - Left to (6, 2): Already visited, ignore.\n  - Down to (7, 3): Out of bounds, ignore.\n- Continue BFS from (5, 3).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Right to (5, 4): Open cell, add to queue.\n  - Up to (4, 3): Open cell, add to queue.\n  - Left to (5, 2): Blocked cell, ignore.\n  - Down to (6, 3): Already visited, ignore.\n- Continue BFS from (5, 4).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Right to (5, 5): Blocked cell, ignore.\n  - Up to (4, 4): Blocked cell, ignore.\n  - Left to (5, 3): Already visited, ignore.\n  - Down to (6, 4): Blocked cell, ignore.\n- Continue BFS from (4, 3).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Right to (4, 4): Blocked cell, ignore.\n  - Up to (3, 3): Blocked cell, ignore.\n  - Left to (4, 2): Blocked cell, ignore.\n  - Down to (5, 3): Already visited, ignore.\n- Continue BFS from (5, 4).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Right to (5, 5): Blocked cell, ignore.\n  - Up to (4, 4): Blocked cell, ignore.\n  - Left to (5, 3): Already visited, ignore.\n  - Down to (6, 4): Blocked cell, ignore.\n- Continue BFS from (6, 3).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Right to (6, 4): Blocked cell, ignore.\n  - Up to (5, 3): Already visited, ignore.\n  - Left to (6, 2): Already visited, ignore.\n  - Down to (7, 3): Out of bounds, ignore.\n\nAfter exploring all possible paths, we find that there is no feasible path from * to #. Therefore, the answer is:\n\ninfeasible"
