    "To find the shortest path from the start point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 6x8 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is located at (1, 3).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at (4, 5).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These movements correspond to changes in the grid indices: \n     - Up: (row - 1, col)\n     - Down: (row + 1, col)\n     - Left: (row, col - 1)\n     - Right: (row, col + 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start BFS from the starting point (*).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - For each possible move (up, down, left, right), calculate the new position.\n   - Check if the new position is within bounds, not blocked (X), and not visited.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position and the updated path.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Output the Path:**\n   - If a path is found, output the sequence of directions enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given grid:\n\n- Start BFS from (1, 3).\n- Explore possible moves and keep track of the path.\n- The shortest path found is: down, down, right, right, up, up, right, right, down, down.\n\nThe sequence of directions is: <<<down down right right up up right right down down>>>\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path from * to # is 10."
