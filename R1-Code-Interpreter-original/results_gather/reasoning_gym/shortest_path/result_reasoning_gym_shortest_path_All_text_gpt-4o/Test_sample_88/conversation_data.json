    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Key Points:**\n   - The grid is a 6x6 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is at position (5, 2).\n   - The destination point (#) is at position (5, 5).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (-1, 0)\n     - Down: (1, 0)\n     - Left: (0, -1)\n     - Right: (0, 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid, starting from the initial position (5, 2).\n   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Store the path taken to reach each cell.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Start from the initial position (5, 2) and mark it as visited.\n   - Explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each valid move (i.e., within bounds, not blocked, and not visited), add the new position to the queue and mark it as visited.\n   - Record the path taken to reach each new position.\n   - If the destination (#) is reached, stop the search and return the path.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Output the Path:**\n   - If a path is found, convert the sequence of moves into the required format.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (5, 2).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - From (5, 2), move right to (5, 3).\n  - From (5, 3), move right to (5, 4).\n  - From (5, 4), move right to (5, 5) (destination reached).\n\n- The path is: right, right, right.\n\n- Convert the path to the required format: <<<right right right>>>\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n<<<right right right>>>"
