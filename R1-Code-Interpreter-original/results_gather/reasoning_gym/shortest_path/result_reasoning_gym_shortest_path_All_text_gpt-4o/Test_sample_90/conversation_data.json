    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 6x7 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is at position (0, 5).\n   - The destination point (#) is at position (1, 4).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (x-1, y)\n     - Down: (x+1, y)\n     - Left: (x, y-1)\n     - Right: (x, y+1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid. Start by enqueuing the starting point with an initial path and distance.\n   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - Dequeue a cell and check if it is the destination (#). If so, return the path and distance.\n   - For each valid move (up, down, left, right), check if the new cell is within bounds, not blocked (X), and not visited.\n   - If valid, mark the cell as visited, enqueue it with the updated path and distance.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted without finding the destination, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Output the Result:**\n   - If a path is found, output the sequence of directions.\n   - If no path is found, output \"infeasible\".\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (0, 5) with path `[]` and distance `0`.\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Right to (0, 6): Valid, enqueue with path `[right]` and distance `1`.\n  - Down to (1, 5): Valid, enqueue with path `[down]` and distance `1`.\n- Continue BFS from (0, 6) and (1, 5):\n  - From (1, 5), move left to (1, 4): Valid, this is the destination.\n  - Path found: `[down, left]` with distance `2`.\n\nThe shortest path from * to # is of length 2, with the sequence of directions being <<<down left>>>.\n\n**Answer:** 2"
