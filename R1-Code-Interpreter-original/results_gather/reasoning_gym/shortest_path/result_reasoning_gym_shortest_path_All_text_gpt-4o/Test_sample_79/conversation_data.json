    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Key Points:**\n   - The grid is a 6x7 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is located at position (5, 4).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (1, 6).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These movements correspond to changes in grid coordinates:\n     - Up: (x-1, y)\n     - Down: (x+1, y)\n     - Left: (x, y-1)\n     - Right: (x, y+1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid. Each element in the queue will store the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (5, 4) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - Dequeue the front element from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each valid move (within bounds, not blocked, and not visited), enqueue the new position along with the updated path.\n   - Mark the current position as visited to avoid revisiting.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Output the Path:**\n   - If a path is found, format it as specified, using directions (up, down, left, right).\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (5, 4).\n- Explore possible moves and update the path:\n  - From (5, 4), move up to (4, 4).\n  - From (4, 4), move up to (3, 4).\n  - From (3, 4), move right to (3, 5).\n  - From (3, 5), move up to (2, 5).\n  - From (2, 5), move up to (1, 5).\n  - From (1, 5), move right to (1, 6) (destination).\n\n- The path is: down, down, up, up, right, right.\n\n- Format the path: <<<up up right up up right>>>\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<up up right up up right>>>"
