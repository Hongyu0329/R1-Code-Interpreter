    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 5x6 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is located at position (2, 5).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (4, 1).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (-1, 0)\n     - Down: (1, 0)\n     - Left: (0, -1)\n     - Right: (0, 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid, starting from the initial position (2, 5).\n   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Store the path taken to reach each cell.\n\n4. **Perform BFS:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path.\n   - For each possible move (up, down, left, right), calculate the new position.\n   - Check if the new position is within bounds, not blocked (not 'X'), and not visited.\n   - If the new position is the destination (#), return the path with the new direction added.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue the new position and path.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (2, 5) with an empty path.\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - From (2, 5), move left to (2, 4).\n  - From (2, 4), move left to (2, 3).\n  - From (2, 3), move up to (1, 3).\n  - From (1, 3), move up to (0, 3).\n  - From (0, 3), move right to (0, 4).\n  - From (0, 4), move down to (1, 4).\n  - From (1, 4), move down to (2, 4).\n  - From (2, 4), move down to (3, 4).\n  - From (3, 4), move left to (3, 3).\n  - From (3, 3), move down to (4, 3).\n  - From (4, 3), move left to (4, 2).\n  - From (4, 2), move left to (4, 1), which is the destination.\n\n- The path taken is: left, left, up, up, right, down, down, down, left, down, left, left.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe length of the shortest path from * to # is 12."
