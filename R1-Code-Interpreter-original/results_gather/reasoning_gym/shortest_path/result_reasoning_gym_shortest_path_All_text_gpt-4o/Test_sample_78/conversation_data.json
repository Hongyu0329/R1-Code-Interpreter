    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is an 8x6 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is located at (4, 3).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at (6, 4).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (x-1, y)\n     - Down: (x+1, y)\n     - Left: (x, y-1)\n     - Right: (x, y+1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid. Start by enqueuing the starting point with an initial path and distance.\n   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - Dequeue a cell and check if it is the destination (#). If it is, return the path and distance.\n   - For each cell, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n   - Check if the move is within bounds, leads to an open cell (O), and hasn't been visited.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new cell with the updated path and distance.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination hasn't been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Output the Result:**\n   - If a path is found, output the sequence of directions.\n   - If no path is found, output \"infeasible\".\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (4, 3).\n- Explore the grid using BFS, keeping track of the path and distance.\n- The shortest path found is: down, down, right, right, up, up, right, down, down.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe length of the shortest path from * to # is 9."
