    "To find the shortest path from the start point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the destination, it does so via the shortest path.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - Start point (*) is located at (6, 4).\n   - Destination point (#) is located at (2, 4).\n\n2. **Define the Grid:**\n   ```\n   0: O X X X X X X X\n   1: O X O X O O X O\n   2: O X O O # X X O\n   3: O X X O X X O O\n   4: O O O O O O X O\n   5: O X O X O O X O\n   6: O X O X * O O X\n   ```\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from the position (6, 4).\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each position, explore the four possible directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - Ensure that the new position is within the grid bounds and is an open cell (O).\n   - If the new position is the destination (#), record the path and stop the search.\n\n5. **Perform BFS:**\n   - Start from (6, 4) and explore:\n     - Move up to (5, 4), then to (4, 4), (3, 4), and finally to (2, 4) which is the destination.\n   - The path taken is: up, up, up, up.\n\n6. **Output the Path:**\n   - The sequence of directions is: <<<up up up up>>>\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path from * to # is 4."
