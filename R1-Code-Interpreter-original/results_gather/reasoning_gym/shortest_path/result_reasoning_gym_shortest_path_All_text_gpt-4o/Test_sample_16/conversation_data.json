    "To find the shortest path from the start (*) to the destination (#) in the given grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - The start point (*) is located at the bottom-left corner of the grid, which is at position (6, 0).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (1, 1).\n\n2. **Define the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 7x6 matrix:\n     ```\n     O O O O O O\n     X # O O X O\n     O O O X O X\n     O O X O O O\n     X X X X O O\n     O X O X O O\n     * X X O O O\n     ```\n\n3. **Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\n4. **BFS Algorithm:**\n   - Initialize a queue and enqueue the start position (6, 0) with an empty path.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue the front element, which contains the current position and the path taken to reach it.\n   - If the current position is the destination (#), return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each valid move (within bounds, not blocked, and not visited), enqueue the new position with the updated path and mark it as visited.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we explore each position, we keep track of the path by appending the direction taken to reach each new position.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\nNow, let's apply the BFS algorithm to the grid:\n\n- Start at (6, 0) with an empty path.\n- From (6, 0), move up to (5, 0).\n- From (5, 0), move up to (4, 0).\n- From (4, 0), move right to (4, 1).\n- From (4, 1), move right to (4, 2).\n- From (4, 2), move up to (3, 2).\n- From (3, 2), move up to (2, 2).\n- From (2, 2), move left to (2, 1).\n- From (2, 1), move up to (1, 1), which is the destination.\n\nThe sequence of directions is: up, up, right, right, up, up, left, up.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from * to # is:\n<<<up up right right up up left up>>>"
