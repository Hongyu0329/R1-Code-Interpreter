    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - The starting point (*) is located at position (0, 1).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (4, 3).\n\n2. **Define the Grid and Movement:**\n   - The grid is a 6x6 matrix.\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (0, 1) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, is an open cell (O), and has not been visited yet.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position and update the path with the corresponding direction.\n\n5. **Track Visited Cells:**\n   - Maintain a set of visited positions to avoid revisiting and looping.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- Start at (0, 1).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Right to (0, 2): Valid, path = [right].\n  - Down to (1, 1): Valid, path = [down].\n- Continue BFS from these positions.\n\nFollowing the BFS process, the shortest path found is:\n- From (0, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (4, 3).\n\nThe corresponding directions are:\n- Down, Right, Down, Down, Right, Down.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from * to # is:\n<<<down right down down right down>>>"
