    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 6x5 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is at position (1, 0).\n   - The destination point (#) is at position (4, 3).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: up (-1, 0), down (+1, 0), left (0, -1), right (0, +1).\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid. Start by enqueuing the starting point with an initial path and distance.\n   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - Dequeue a cell and check if it is the destination (#). If it is, return the path and distance.\n   - For each cell, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is within bounds, not blocked (X), and not visited, enqueue it with the updated path and mark it as visited.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Output the Result:**\n   - If a path is found, output the sequence of directions.\n   - If no path is found, output \"infeasible\".\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (1, 0) with path `[]` and distance `0`.\n- Explore neighbors:\n  - Right to (1, 1): path `['right']`, distance `1`.\n  - Down to (2, 0): path `['down']`, distance `1`.\n- Continue exploring from (1, 1):\n  - Right to (1, 2) is blocked.\n  - Down to (2, 1) is blocked.\n  - Left to (1, 0) is already visited.\n  - Up to (0, 1): path `['right', 'up']`, distance `2`.\n- Continue exploring from (2, 0):\n  - Right to (2, 1) is blocked.\n  - Down to (3, 0) is blocked.\n  - Left is out of bounds.\n  - Up to (1, 0) is already visited.\n- Continue exploring from (0, 1):\n  - Right to (0, 2) is blocked.\n  - Down to (1, 1) is already visited.\n  - Left to (0, 0): path `['right', 'up', 'left']`, distance `3`.\n- Continue exploring from (0, 0):\n  - Right to (0, 1) is already visited.\n  - Down to (1, 0) is already visited.\n  - Left is out of bounds.\n  - Up is out of bounds.\n- Continue exploring from (1, 1):\n  - Right to (1, 2) is blocked.\n  - Down to (2, 1) is blocked.\n  - Left to (1, 0) is already visited.\n  - Up to (0, 1) is already visited.\n- Continue exploring from (2, 0):\n  - Right to (2, 1) is blocked.\n  - Down to (3, 0) is blocked.\n  - Left is out of bounds.\n  - Up to (1, 0) is already visited.\n- Continue exploring from (0, 1):\n  - Right to (0, 2) is blocked.\n  - Down to (1, 1) is already visited.\n  - Left to (0, 0) is already visited.\n  - Up is out of bounds.\n- Continue exploring from (0, 0):\n  - Right to (0, 1) is already visited.\n  - Down to (1, 0) is already visited.\n  - Left is out of bounds.\n  - Up is out of bounds.\n\nAfter exploring all possible paths, we find that there is no feasible path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#).\n\n**Final Answer:**\ninfeasible"
