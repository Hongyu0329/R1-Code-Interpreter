    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 5x7 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is located at position (2, 4).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (3, 4).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: up (-1, 0), down (+1, 0), left (0, -1), right (0, +1).\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the position of the starting point (*) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the front element from the queue, which contains the current position and the path taken.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, calculate the new position and check if it is within bounds, not blocked (X), and not visited.\n   - If valid, mark the new position as visited and enqueue it with the updated path.\n\n5. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Output the Path:**\n   - If a path is found, output the sequence of directions enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n### Execution on the Given Grid:\n\n- Start at (2, 4) with path: []\n- Possible moves from (2, 4):\n  - Up to (1, 4): Valid, path: [up]\n  - Down to (3, 4): Valid, path: [down]\n  - Left to (2, 3): Valid, path: [left]\n  - Right to (2, 5): Valid, path: [right]\n\n- Continue BFS from each valid move:\n  - From (3, 4), we reach the destination (#) immediately with path: [down]\n\nThus, the shortest path from * to # is simply moving down once.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<down>>>"
