    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - The starting point (*) is located at (4, 1).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at (1, 1).\n\n2. **Define the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 7x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     O O O O X\n     O # O X O\n     O O X O O\n     X X X X O\n     X * O X X\n     X O X O X\n     X O O O X\n     ```\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right.\n\n4. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the position (4, 1) with an empty path.\n\n5. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, not a blocked cell (X), and not already visited.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position with the updated path.\n\n6. **Path Representation:**\n   - Use \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", and \"right\" to represent moves.\n\n7. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (4, 1).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - From (4, 1), move up to (3, 1).\n  - From (3, 1), move up to (2, 1).\n  - From (2, 1), move up to (1, 1) which is the destination.\n\n- The path taken is:\n  - Start at (4, 1).\n  - Move up to (3, 1).\n  - Move up to (2, 1).\n  - Move up to (1, 1).\n\n- The sequence of directions is: \"up up up\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n<<<up up up>>>"
