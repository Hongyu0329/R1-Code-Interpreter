    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 7x7 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is located at position (2, 4).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (4, 3).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These movements correspond to changes in the grid indices:\n     - Up: (row - 1, col)\n     - Down: (row + 1, col)\n     - Left: (row, col - 1)\n     - Right: (row, col + 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (2, 4) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the front element from the queue, which contains the current position and the path.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, is an open cell (O), and has not been visited yet.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position along with the updated path.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we move, construct the path using direction names: \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", \"right\".\n   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting and looping.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination has not been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (2, 4).\n- Explore possible moves and update the path accordingly.\n- Continue until the destination (4, 3) is reached or all possibilities are exhausted.\n\n### Result:\n\nAfter executing the BFS, the shortest path from * to # is found to be:\n\n- Move right from (2, 4) to (2, 5).\n- Move down from (2, 5) to (3, 5).\n- Move down from (3, 5) to (4, 5).\n- Move left from (4, 5) to (4, 4).\n- Move left from (4, 4) to (4, 3).\n\nThe sequence of directions is: right, down, down, left, left.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path is:\n\n<<<right down down left left>>>"
