    "To find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is an 8x6 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is located at (2, 0).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at (6, 3).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These movements correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (x-1, y)\n     - Down: (x+1, y)\n     - Left: (x, y-1)\n     - Right: (x, y+1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start from the position of * (2, 0).\n   - Use a queue to explore each cell, starting with the initial position.\n   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n\n4. **Explore the Grid:**\n   - From each cell, attempt to move in all four possible directions.\n   - If a move leads to an open cell (O) that hasn't been visited, add it to the queue.\n   - If a move leads to the destination (#), record the path and stop the search.\n\n5. **Check for Feasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination hasn't been reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n6. **Trace the Path:**\n   - Once the destination is reached, trace back the path using the recorded directions.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- Start at (2, 0).\n- Explore the grid using BFS:\n  - From (2, 0), move to (2, 1).\n  - From (2, 1), move to (1, 1) and (3, 2).\n  - From (1, 1), move to (0, 1).\n  - From (3, 2), move to (4, 2).\n  - From (4, 2), move to (4, 3).\n  - From (4, 3), move to (5, 3).\n  - From (5, 3), move to (6, 3) (destination reached).\n\n- The path traced is: (2, 0) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (6, 3).\n\n- The sequence of directions is: right, down, down, right, down, down.\n\n- The length of the shortest path is 6.\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path from * to # is 6."
