    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 6x6 matrix.\n   - The starting point (*) is at position (0, 2).\n   - The destination point (#) is at position (4, 5).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (x-1, y)\n     - Down: (x+1, y)\n     - Left: (x, y-1)\n     - Right: (x, y+1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid. Each element in the queue will store the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (0, 2) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - Dequeue the front element from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each valid move (within bounds, not blocked, and not visited), enqueue the new position with the updated path.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we explore, construct the path by appending the direction of movement to the path string.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (0, 2).\n- Explore the grid using BFS, keeping track of the path.\n- The shortest path found is: right, down, down, down, right, right, up.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe length of the shortest path from * to # is 7, and the path is <<<right down down down right right up>>>."
