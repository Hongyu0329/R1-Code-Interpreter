    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and Destination Points:**\n   - The starting point (*) is located at the bottom-right corner of the grid, which is at position (7, 5).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (5, 4).\n\n2. **Define the Grid and Movement:**\n   - The grid is an 8x6 matrix.\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (7, 5) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue the current position and path.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, is an open cell (O), and has not been visited yet.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position and update the path with the corresponding direction.\n\n5. **Track Visited Cells:**\n   - Maintain a set of visited cells to avoid revisiting and looping.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- Start BFS from (7, 5).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - Move up to (6, 5).\n  - Move left to (7, 4).\n- Continue exploring from each new position, updating the path and marking cells as visited.\n- Eventually, reach the destination (5, 4) with the shortest path.\n\nAfter executing the BFS, the shortest path from * to # is found to be:\n\n- <<<up up up left left up up left left up up right>>>\n\nThe length of this path is 13 steps.\n\n**Answer: 13**"
