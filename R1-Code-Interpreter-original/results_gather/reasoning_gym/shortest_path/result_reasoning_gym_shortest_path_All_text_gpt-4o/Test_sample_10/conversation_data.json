    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     O X X X O\n     O O X X X\n     O O # O O\n     * X O O X\n     O X X O X\n     ```\n   - Starting point (*) is at position (3, 0).\n   - Destination point (#) is at position (2, 2).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (-1, 0)\n     - Down: (1, 0)\n     - Left: (0, -1)\n     - Right: (0, 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid. Each element in the queue will store the current position and the path taken to reach there.\n   - Start from the initial position (3, 0) with an empty path.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - Dequeue the front element from the queue.\n   - Check if the current position is the destination (#). If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each move, check if the new position is within bounds, not a blocked cell (X), and not already visited.\n   - If valid, enqueue the new position with the updated path and mark it as visited.\n\n5. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we explore, construct the path using direction names (up, down, left, right).\n   - If the destination is reached, the path will be the sequence of directions taken.\n\n6. **Check for Infeasibility:**\n   - If the queue is exhausted and the destination is not reached, the path is infeasible.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (3, 0).\n- Explore possible moves:\n  - From (3, 0), move up to (2, 0).\n  - From (2, 0), move right to (2, 1).\n  - From (2, 1), move right to (2, 2) (destination reached).\n\n- The path taken is: up, right, right.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe length of the shortest path from * to # is 3, and the path is <<<up right right>>>."
