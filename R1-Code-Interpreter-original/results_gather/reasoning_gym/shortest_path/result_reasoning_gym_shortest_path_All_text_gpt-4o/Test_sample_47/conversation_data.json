    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Starting and Destination Points:**\n   - The starting point (*) is located at position (0, 5).\n   - The destination point (#) is located at position (0, 6).\n\n2. **Define the Grid:**\n   ```\n   Row 0: X X X O X * # O\n   Row 1: O X O O X O X X\n   Row 2: O X O X O O X X\n   Row 3: X X X X X O O X\n   Row 4: X O O O X X O X\n   Row 5: O O O O X O O O\n   ```\n\n3. **Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move up, down, left, or right.\n\n4. **BFS Initialization:**\n   - Start BFS from the starting point (0, 5).\n   - Use a queue to explore each cell and keep track of the path taken.\n   - Maintain a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n\n5. **BFS Execution:**\n   - From (0, 5), explore the possible moves:\n     - Right to (0, 6) is possible and is the destination point (#).\n   - Since we reached the destination, the path is complete.\n\n6. **Path and Directions:**\n   - The path from (0, 5) to (0, 6) is a single step to the right.\n   - Therefore, the sequence of directions is \"right\".\n\n7. **Output the Result:**\n   - The shortest path length is 1 step.\n   - The sequence of directions is <<<right>>>.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<right>>>"
