    "To find the shortest path from the start point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the destination, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   ```\n   X X O X O O O O\n   X X X O X O X O\n   O O X O X X X *\n   X O X O O O # X\n   O O O O O O X O\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Key Points:**\n   - Start point (*) is at position (2, 7).\n   - Destination point (#) is at position (3, 6).\n\n3. **Movement Directions:**\n   - Up: (row - 1, col)\n   - Down: (row + 1, col)\n   - Left: (row, col - 1)\n   - Right: (row, col + 1)\n\n4. **BFS Initialization:**\n   - Start from the position of *: (2, 7).\n   - Use a queue to explore each cell.\n   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting.\n   - Store the path taken to reach each cell.\n\n5. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Begin at (2, 7) and mark it as visited.\n   - Explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - If a move leads to an open cell (O) and hasn't been visited, add it to the queue.\n   - Continue this process until reaching the destination (#) or exhausting all possibilities.\n\n6. **Path Exploration:**\n   - From (2, 7), move left to (2, 6).\n   - From (2, 6), move up to (1, 6).\n   - From (1, 6), move up to (0, 6).\n   - From (0, 6), move right to (0, 7).\n   - From (0, 7), move down to (1, 7).\n   - From (1, 7), move down to (2, 7).\n   - From (2, 7), move down to (3, 7).\n   - From (3, 7), move left to (3, 6) (destination).\n\n7. **Path Found:**\n   - The path is: left, up, up, right, down, down, down, left.\n   - This path leads from * to #.\n\n8. **Output the Path:**\n   - The sequence of directions is: <<<left up up right down down down left>>>\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path from * to # is 8 steps.\n\n**Answer: 8**"
