    "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Grid and Points:**\n   - The grid is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     O X X * O\n     O O O O O\n     O O O X O\n     X X X O X\n     # O O O X\n     ```\n   - Starting point (*) is at position (0, 3).\n   - Destination point (#) is at position (4, 0).\n\n2. **Define Movement Directions:**\n   - We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n   - These correspond to changes in coordinates: \n     - Up: (-1, 0)\n     - Down: (1, 0)\n     - Left: (0, -1)\n     - Right: (0, 1)\n\n3. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Use a queue to explore the grid, starting from the initial position (0, 3).\n   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.\n   - Store the path taken to reach each cell.\n\n4. **BFS Exploration:**\n   - Start from the initial position (0, 3) and mark it as visited.\n   - Explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.\n   - For each valid move (i.e., within bounds, not blocked, and not visited), add the new position to the queue and mark it as visited.\n   - Record the path taken to reach each new position.\n\n5. **Check for Destination:**\n   - If the destination point (#) is reached, output the path taken.\n   - If the queue is exhausted without reaching the destination, the path is \"infeasible\".\n\n6. **Path Construction:**\n   - As we explore, we maintain a path string that records the sequence of moves.\n   - When the destination is reached, this path string will represent the shortest path.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start BFS from (0, 3).\n- Explore the grid using BFS, updating the path and checking for the destination at each step.\n- The shortest path found is: right, down, down, down, left, left, left.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe length of the shortest path from * to # is 7, and the path is:\n<<<right down down down left left left>>>"
