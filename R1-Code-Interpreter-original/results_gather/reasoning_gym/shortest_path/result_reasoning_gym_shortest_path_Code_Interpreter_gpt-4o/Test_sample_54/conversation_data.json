    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid. We'll start from the starting point (`*`) and explore all possible paths until we reach the destination point (`#`). If we reach the destination, we'll return the sequence of directions that leads to it. If no path is found, we'll return \"infeasible\".\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'O', '#', '*', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O']\n]\n\n# Define the directions and their corresponding moves\ndirections = {\n    'up': (-1, 0),\n    'down': (1, 0),\n    'left': (0, -1),\n    'right': (0, 1)\n}\n\n# Find the starting and destination points\nstart = None\ndestination = None\nfor i in range(len(grid)):\n    for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n        if grid[i][j] == '*':\n            start = (i, j)\n        elif grid[i][j] == '#':\n            destination = (i, j)\n\n# BFS to find the shortest path\ndef bfs(start, destination, grid):\n    queue = deque([(start, [])])  # (current_position, path)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    \n    while queue:\n        (current, path) = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current == destination:\n            return path\n        \n        for direction, (di, dj) in directions.items():\n            ni, nj = current[0] + di, current[1] + dj\n            if 0 <= ni < len(grid) and 0 <= nj < len(grid[0]) and grid[ni][nj] != 'X' and (ni, nj) not in visited:\n                visited.add((ni, nj))\n                queue.append(((ni, nj), path + [direction]))\n    \n    return \"infeasible\"\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs(start, destination, grid)\nshortest_path\nassistant > The shortest path from the starting point (`*`) to the destination point (`#`) is just one move to the left.
