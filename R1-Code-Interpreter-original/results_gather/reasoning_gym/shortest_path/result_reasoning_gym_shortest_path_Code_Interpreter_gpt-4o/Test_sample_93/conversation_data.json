    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid. BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the destination, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's implement the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid.
