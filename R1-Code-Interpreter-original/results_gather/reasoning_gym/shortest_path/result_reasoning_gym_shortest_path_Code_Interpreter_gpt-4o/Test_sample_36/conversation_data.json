    "\nassistant > To find the shortest path from the start point (*) to the destination point (#) in the given grid, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is well-suited for this task because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the destination, it has found the shortest path.\n\nLet's represent the grid and implement the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path.
