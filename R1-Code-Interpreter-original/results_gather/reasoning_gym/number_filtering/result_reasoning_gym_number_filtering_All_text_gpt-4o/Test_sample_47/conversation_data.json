    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given list of numbers and filter out those that are smaller than 41.193. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-12.4993', '-67.4', '44.744', '-69.00', '-94']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with 41.193, we need to convert them from strings to numbers (specifically, floating-point numbers).\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number in the list to 41.193 and determine if it is smaller.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will keep only those numbers that are smaller than 41.193.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, we need to convert the numbers back to their original string format to match the format of the input list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '-12.4993' becomes -12.4993\n  - '-67.4' becomes -67.4\n  - '44.744' becomes 44.744\n  - '-69.00' becomes -69.0\n  - '-94' becomes -94.0\n\n- Compare each number to 41.193:\n  - -12.4993 < 41.193 (keep)\n  - -67.4 < 41.193 (keep)\n  - 44.744 > 41.193 (discard)\n  - -69.0 < 41.193 (keep)\n  - -94.0 < 41.193 (keep)\n\n- Filtered list of numbers: [-12.4993, -67.4, -69.0, -94.0]\n\n- Convert these numbers back to their original string format:\n  - -12.4993 becomes '-12.4993'\n  - -67.4 becomes '-67.4'\n  - -69.0 becomes '-69.00'\n  - -94.0 becomes '-94'\n\n- The new list in string format is: `['-12.4993', '-67.4', '-69.00', '-94']`\n\nNow, we will return the new list in the specified format:\n\n<<<['-12.4993', '-67.4', '-69.00', '-94']>>>"
