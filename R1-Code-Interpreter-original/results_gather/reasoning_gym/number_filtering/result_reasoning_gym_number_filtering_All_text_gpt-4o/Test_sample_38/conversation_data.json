    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given list of numbers and filter out those that are smaller than -10.831. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to keep only the numbers that are smaller than -10.831 from the given list.\n\n2. **Examine the List**: The list provided is `['-41.184', '-9.99', '99.0', '63.9635']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n3. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with -10.831, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n4. **Comparison**: \n   - Convert `'-41.184'` to `-41.184` and compare it with `-10.831`. Since `-41.184` is smaller than `-10.831`, it should be included in the new list.\n   - Convert `'-9.99'` to `-9.99` and compare it with `-10.831`. Since `-9.99` is not smaller than `-10.831`, it should not be included in the new list.\n   - Convert `'99.0'` to `99.0` and compare it with `-10.831`. Since `99.0` is not smaller than `-10.831`, it should not be included in the new list.\n   - Convert `'63.9635'` to `63.9635` and compare it with `-10.831`. Since `63.9635` is not smaller than `-10.831`, it should not be included in the new list.\n\n5. **Form the New List**: Based on the comparisons, the only number that meets the criteria is `-41.184`.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The new list should be formatted in the same way as the input list, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer, with the new list containing only numbers smaller than -10.831, is:\n\n<<<['-41.184']>>>"
