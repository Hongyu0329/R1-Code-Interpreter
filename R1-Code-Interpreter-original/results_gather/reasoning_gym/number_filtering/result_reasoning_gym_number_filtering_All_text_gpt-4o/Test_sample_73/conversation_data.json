    "To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps to filter out numbers from the given list that are smaller than 64.2251. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: We have a list of strings representing numbers: `['16', '90.32', '4.8074', '-33.1', '70.0', '50.2', '-80.002', '-29.7']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Identify the Threshold**: The threshold given is 64.2251. We need to compare each number in the list against this threshold.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will iterate through the list, and for each number, we will check if it is greater than or equal to 64.2251. If it is, we will keep it in the new list; otherwise, we will discard it.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, we need to convert the numbers back to strings to match the format of the original list.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Finally, we will format the new list of strings within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '16' -> 16.0\n  - '90.32' -> 90.32\n  - '4.8074' -> 4.8074\n  - '-33.1' -> -33.1\n  - '70.0' -> 70.0\n  - '50.2' -> 50.2\n  - '-80.002' -> -80.002\n  - '-29.7' -> -29.7\n\n- Compare each number to 64.2251:\n  - 16.0 < 64.2251 (discard)\n  - 90.32 > 64.2251 (keep)\n  - 4.8074 < 64.2251 (discard)\n  - -33.1 < 64.2251 (discard)\n  - 70.0 > 64.2251 (keep)\n  - 50.2 < 64.2251 (discard)\n  - -80.002 < 64.2251 (discard)\n  - -29.7 < 64.2251 (discard)\n\n- The numbers that are greater than or equal to 64.2251 are 90.32 and 70.0.\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings:\n  - 90.32 -> '90.32'\n  - 70.0 -> '70.0'\n\n- Format the result within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['90.32', '70.0']>>>"
