    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given list of numbers and filter out those that are smaller than 16. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: We have a list of strings representing numbers: `['30.77', '-96.4252', '-30.430']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these numbers with 16, we need to convert them from strings to a numerical format (either integers or floats). In this case, since the numbers have decimal points, we will convert them to floats.\n\n3. **Comparison with 16**: We need to check each number to see if it is smaller than 16.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will create a new list that only includes numbers that are smaller than 16.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the final output needs to be in the same format as the input, we will convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Finally, we will format the output list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '30.77' becomes 30.77\n  - '-96.4252' becomes -96.4252\n  - '-30.430' becomes -30.430\n\n- Compare each number with 16:\n  - 30.77 is not smaller than 16.\n  - -96.4252 is smaller than 16.\n  - -30.430 is smaller than 16.\n\n- Filter the list to include only numbers smaller than 16:\n  - The numbers -96.4252 and -30.430 are smaller than 16.\n\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings:\n  - -96.4252 becomes '-96.4252'\n  - -30.430 becomes '-30.430'\n\n- Format the output list:\n  - The new list is `['-96.4252', '-30.430']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['-96.4252', '-30.430']>>>"
