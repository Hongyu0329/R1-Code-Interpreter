    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are larger than -34.37. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The list provided is `['53.57', '-72', '-70.085', '-33.1']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these numbers with -34.37, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We will compare each number to -34.37 and determine if it is larger.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will keep only those numbers that are larger than -34.37.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to their original string format to match the format of the input list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert '53.57' to a float: 53.57. Compare 53.57 > -34.37: True. Keep '53.57'.\n- Convert '-72' to a float: -72. Compare -72 > -34.37: False. Discard '-72'.\n- Convert '-70.085' to a float: -70.085. Compare -70.085 > -34.37: False. Discard '-70.085'.\n- Convert '-33.1' to a float: -33.1. Compare -33.1 > -34.37: True. Keep '-33.1'.\n\nAfter filtering, the numbers that are larger than -34.37 are '53.57' and '-33.1'.\n\nThe final list, in the same format as the input, is:\n\n<<<['53.57', '-33.1']>>>"
