    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of strings representing numbers and keep only those numbers that are larger than 74. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The list provided is `['-8.703', '87.3963', '-27.859', '46', '82.26', '49.36']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (specifically, floating-point numbers) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Filter the List**: We need to filter out the numbers that are greater than 74. This involves checking each number and determining if it is greater than 74.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: After filtering, we will create a new list that contains only the numbers that meet the criteria.\n\n5. **Convert Numbers Back to Strings**: Since the original list was composed of strings, we should convert the numbers back to strings for the final output.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a floating-point number:\n  - '-8.703' becomes -8.703\n  - '87.3963' becomes 87.3963\n  - '-27.859' becomes -27.859\n  - '46' becomes 46.0\n  - '82.26' becomes 82.26\n  - '49.36' becomes 49.36\n\n- Filter the numbers to keep only those greater than 74:\n  - 87.3963 is greater than 74\n  - 82.26 is greater than 74\n\n- The numbers that are greater than 74 are 87.3963 and 82.26.\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings:\n  - 87.3963 becomes '87.3963'\n  - 82.26 becomes '82.26'\n\n- Create the new list with these strings: `['87.3963', '82.26']`.\n\n- Format the output as specified: <<<['87.3963', '82.26']>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['87.3963', '82.26']>>>"
