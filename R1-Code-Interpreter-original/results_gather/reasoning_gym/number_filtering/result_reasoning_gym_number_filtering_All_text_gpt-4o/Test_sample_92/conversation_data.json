    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of strings representing numbers, keeping only those numbers that are larger than -15.9. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The given list is `['9.7', '89', '-16.76', '-93.7', '-20.51', '63', '8.6111']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (either integers or floats) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison Criterion**: We need to keep numbers that are larger than -15.9. This means any number greater than -15.9 should be included in the new list.\n\n4. **Iterate and Filter**: Go through each element in the list, convert it to a number, and check if it is greater than -15.9. If it is, include it in the new list.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format of the list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Format the resulting list of strings within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert '9.7' to 9.7, which is greater than -15.9, so keep it.\n- Convert '89' to 89, which is greater than -15.9, so keep it.\n- Convert '-16.76' to -16.76, which is not greater than -15.9, so discard it.\n- Convert '-93.7' to -93.7, which is not greater than -15.9, so discard it.\n- Convert '-20.51' to -20.51, which is not greater than -15.9, so discard it.\n- Convert '63' to 63, which is greater than -15.9, so keep it.\n- Convert '8.6111' to 8.6111, which is greater than -15.9, so keep it.\n\nThe numbers that are greater than -15.9 are 9.7, 89, 63, and 8.6111. Convert these back to strings to form the new list: `['9.7', '89', '63', '8.6111']`.\n\nFinally, format the result within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<['9.7', '89', '63', '8.6111']>>>"
