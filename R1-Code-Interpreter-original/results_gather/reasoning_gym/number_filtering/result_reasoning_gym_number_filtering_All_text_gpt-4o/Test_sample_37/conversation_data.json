    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given list of strings representing numbers and remove any numbers that are smaller than -64.994. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Task**: We need to remove numbers smaller than -64.994 from the list.\n\n2. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-80.8', '-86.66', '-34.3928']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n3. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with -64.994, we need to convert the strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n4. **Comparison**: We will compare each number with -64.994:\n   - `-80.8` is less than -64.994.\n   - `-86.66` is less than -64.994.\n   - `-34.3928` is greater than -64.994.\n\n5. **Filter the List**: Based on the comparison, we will remove `-80.8` and `-86.66` from the list because they are smaller than -64.994. We will keep `-34.3928` because it is not smaller than -64.994.\n\n6. **Format the Result**: The result should be formatted as a list of strings enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the new list.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<['-34.3928']>>>"
