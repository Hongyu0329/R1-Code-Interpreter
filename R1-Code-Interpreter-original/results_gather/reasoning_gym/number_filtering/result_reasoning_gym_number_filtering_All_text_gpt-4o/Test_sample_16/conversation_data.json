    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are larger than -71.248. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to keep numbers larger than -71.248. This means any number greater than -71.248 should be included in the new list.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: The numbers in the list are given as strings. We need to convert them to floating-point numbers to perform the comparison.\n\n3. **Comparison**: For each number in the list, compare it to -71.248. If the number is greater than -71.248, it should be included in the new list.\n\n4. **Reformat the List**: After filtering, the new list should be formatted in the same way as the original, with each number as a string.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Original list: ['-73.6217', '-39.5500', '-61.456', '-67', '-1.4', '-56.3901', '11.3127', '-69.0']\n\n- Convert each string to a float and compare with -71.248:\n  - '-73.6217' -> -73.6217 (not greater than -71.248)\n  - '-39.5500' -> -39.55 (greater than -71.248)\n  - '-61.456' -> -61.456 (greater than -71.248)\n  - '-67' -> -67.0 (greater than -71.248)\n  - '-1.4' -> -1.4 (greater than -71.248)\n  - '-56.3901' -> -56.3901 (greater than -71.248)\n  - '11.3127' -> 11.3127 (greater than -71.248)\n  - '-69.0' -> -69.0 (greater than -71.248)\n\n- Filtered list: ['-39.5500', '-61.456', '-67', '-1.4', '-56.3901', '11.3127', '-69.0']\n\n- Enclose the new list within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['-39.5500', '-61.456', '-67', '-1.4', '-56.3901', '11.3127', '-69.0']>>>"
