    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers smaller than -10.61 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list contains string representations of numbers. We need to convert these strings to actual numbers (floats or integers) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n2. **Conversion**: Convert each string in the list to a float. This is necessary because some of the numbers have decimal points, indicating they are floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: For each number in the list, check if it is smaller than -10.61. If it is, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Reconstruction**: After filtering out the numbers smaller than -10.61, convert the remaining numbers back to their original string format.\n\n5. **Output**: Return the new list in the specified format, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Original list: `['84.00', '77', '-28.9', '-21.7', '16.3323', '11', '35.75', '-20', '31.1', '50.391']`\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '84.00' -> 84.0\n  - '77' -> 77.0\n  - '-28.9' -> -28.9\n  - '-21.7' -> -21.7\n  - '16.3323' -> 16.3323\n  - '11' -> 11.0\n  - '35.75' -> 35.75\n  - '-20' -> -20.0\n  - '31.1' -> 31.1\n  - '50.391' -> 50.391\n\n- Filter out numbers smaller than -10.61:\n  - 84.0 (keep)\n  - 77.0 (keep)\n  - -28.9 (remove)\n  - -21.7 (remove)\n  - 16.3323 (keep)\n  - 11.0 (keep)\n  - 35.75 (keep)\n  - -20.0 (remove)\n  - 31.1 (keep)\n  - 50.391 (keep)\n\n- Remaining numbers: [84.0, 77.0, 16.3323, 11.0, 35.75, 31.1, 50.391]\n\n- Convert back to strings:\n  - 84.0 -> '84.00'\n  - 77.0 -> '77'\n  - 16.3323 -> '16.3323'\n  - 11.0 -> '11'\n  - 35.75 -> '35.75'\n  - 31.1 -> '31.1'\n  - 50.391 -> '50.391'\n\n- New list: `['84.00', '77', '16.3323', '11', '35.75', '31.1', '50.391']`\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<['84.00', '77', '16.3323', '11', '35.75', '31.1', '50.391']>>>"
