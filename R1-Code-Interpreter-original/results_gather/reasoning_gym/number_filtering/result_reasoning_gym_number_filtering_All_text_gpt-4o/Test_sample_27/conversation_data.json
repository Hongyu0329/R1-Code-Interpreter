    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those numbers that are larger than 4.68. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to filter the list to retain only numbers greater than 4.68.\n\n2. **Examine the List**: The given list is:\n   ```\n   ['-83.078', '-95.45', '42.8746', '-97.885', '-24.3476', '-40.5']\n   ```\n   These are string representations of numbers.\n\n3. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with 4.68, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will iterate through the list, convert each string to a float, and check if it is greater than 4.68.\n\n5. **Collect the Results**: We will collect all numbers that satisfy the condition (greater than 4.68) into a new list.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Finally, we will format the output list as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string to a float and compare with 4.68:\n  - '-83.078' -> -83.078 (not greater than 4.68)\n  - '-95.45' -> -95.45 (not greater than 4.68)\n  - '42.8746' -> 42.8746 (greater than 4.68)\n  - '-97.885' -> -97.885 (not greater than 4.68)\n  - '-24.3476' -> -24.3476 (not greater than 4.68)\n  - '-40.5' -> -40.5 (not greater than 4.68)\n\n- The only number greater than 4.68 is 42.8746.\n\n- Format the result as specified: <<<['42.8746']>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['42.8746']>>>"
