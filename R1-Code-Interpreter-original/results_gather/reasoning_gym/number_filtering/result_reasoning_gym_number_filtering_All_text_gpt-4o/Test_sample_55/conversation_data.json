    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given list of numbers and filter out those that are smaller than -36. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['47.5830', '-79.56', '28.94', '76', '79']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with -36, we need to convert them from strings to numbers. This can be done by converting each string to a float.\n\n3. **Identify Numbers Smaller than -36**: Once we have the numbers in a comparable format, we need to identify which of these numbers are smaller than -36.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will create a new list that only includes numbers that are smaller than -36.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list was in string format, we need to convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n\n6. **Return the New List**: Finally, we will return the new list in the specified format enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '47.5830' -> 47.5830\n  - '-79.56' -> -79.56\n  - '28.94' -> 28.94\n  - '76' -> 76.0\n  - '79' -> 79.0\n\n- Compare each number with -36:\n  - 47.5830 is not smaller than -36\n  - -79.56 is smaller than -36\n  - 28.94 is not smaller than -36\n  - 76.0 is not smaller than -36\n  - 79.0 is not smaller than -36\n\n- Filter the list to include only numbers smaller than -36:\n  - The only number that meets this criterion is -79.56.\n\n- Convert the filtered number back to a string:\n  - -79.56 -> '-79.56'\n\n- Return the new list in the specified format:\n  - The new list is `['-79.56']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['-79.56']>>>"
