    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of strings, keeping only those numbers that are larger than 19.8962. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['4', '-64.7', '-42.1', '-77', '-79.9640', '37.76', '38.702', '18.20', '-28.34']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: We need to convert these strings to numerical values (either integers or floats) to compare them with 19.8962.\n\n3. **Comparison**: For each number, check if it is greater than 19.8962.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Keep only those numbers that satisfy the condition (greater than 19.8962).\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Convert the filtered numbers back to their original string format.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Format the result as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '4' -> 4.0\n  - '-64.7' -> -64.7\n  - '-42.1' -> -42.1\n  - '-77' -> -77.0\n  - '-79.9640' -> -79.964\n  - '37.76' -> 37.76\n  - '38.702' -> 38.702\n  - '18.20' -> 18.2\n  - '-28.34' -> -28.34\n\n- Compare each number with 19.8962:\n  - 4.0 is not greater than 19.8962\n  - -64.7 is not greater than 19.8962\n  - -42.1 is not greater than 19.8962\n  - -77.0 is not greater than 19.8962\n  - -79.964 is not greater than 19.8962\n  - 37.76 is greater than 19.8962\n  - 38.702 is greater than 19.8962\n  - 18.2 is not greater than 19.8962\n  - -28.34 is not greater than 19.8962\n\n- Filtered numbers: 37.76, 38.702\n\n- Convert back to strings: '37.76', '38.702'\n\n- Format the result: <<<['37.76', '38.702']>>>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['37.76', '38.702']>>>"
