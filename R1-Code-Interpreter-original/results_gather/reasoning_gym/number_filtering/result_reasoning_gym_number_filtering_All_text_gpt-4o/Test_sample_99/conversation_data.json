    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are larger than 85.2175. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to filter the list of numbers and retain only those numbers that are greater than 85.2175.\n\n2. **Identify the List**: The list provided is:\n   ```\n   ['-25.5101', '-82.48', '-97', '-30.3814', '93.1', '-55.5701', '36.583', '95.5']\n   ```\n\n3. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: The elements in the list are strings. To compare them numerically, we need to convert them to floating-point numbers.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will iterate through the list, convert each string to a float, and check if it is greater than 85.2175. If it is, we will keep it in the new list.\n\n5. **Create the New List**: After filtering, we will have a new list containing only the numbers that meet the condition.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string to a float and compare it to 85.2175.\n- The numbers in the list are:\n  - '-25.5101' -> -25.5101 (not greater than 85.2175)\n  - '-82.48' -> -82.48 (not greater than 85.2175)\n  - '-97' -> -97.0 (not greater than 85.2175)\n  - '-30.3814' -> -30.3814 (not greater than 85.2175)\n  - '93.1' -> 93.1 (greater than 85.2175)\n  - '-55.5701' -> -55.5701 (not greater than 85.2175)\n  - '36.583' -> 36.583 (not greater than 85.2175)\n  - '95.5' -> 95.5 (greater than 85.2175)\n\n- The numbers that are greater than 85.2175 are 93.1 and 95.5.\n\n- The new list, after filtering, is:\n  ```\n  ['93.1', '95.5']\n  ```\n\n- Format the output as specified:\n  ```\n  <<<['93.1', '95.5']>>>\n  ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['93.1', '95.5']>>>"
