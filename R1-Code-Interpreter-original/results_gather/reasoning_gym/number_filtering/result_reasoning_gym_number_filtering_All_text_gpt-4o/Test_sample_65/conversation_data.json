    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers larger than 43.398 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of strings representing numbers: `['-14.21', '83', '14.8696', '55', '77.65', '-26']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (either integers or floats) to compare them with 43.398.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number with 43.398 and determine if it is larger. If a number is larger, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: Construct a new list that only includes numbers that are less than or equal to 43.398.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list was in string format, convert the numbers in the new list back to strings.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Format the new list within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float for comparison:\n  - '-14.21' becomes -14.21\n  - '83' becomes 83.0\n  - '14.8696' becomes 14.8696\n  - '55' becomes 55.0\n  - '77.65' becomes 77.65\n  - '-26' becomes -26.0\n\n- Compare each number with 43.398:\n  - -14.21 is less than 43.398\n  - 83.0 is greater than 43.398\n  - 14.8696 is less than 43.398\n  - 55.0 is greater than 43.398\n  - 77.65 is greater than 43.398\n  - -26.0 is less than 43.398\n\n- Construct a new list with numbers less than or equal to 43.398:\n  - The numbers that meet the criteria are: -14.21, 14.8696, and -26.0\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings:\n  - -14.21 becomes '-14.21'\n  - 14.8696 becomes '14.8696'\n  - -26.0 becomes '-26'\n\n- Format the new list within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['-14.21', '14.8696', '-26']>>>"
