    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of strings representing numbers and keep only those numbers that are larger than 77.1. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The given list is `['-87.0', '78.49', '79.55', '-65.8', '-67.69']`.\n\n2. **Conversion to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number to 77.1 and determine if it is larger.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will keep only those numbers that are greater than 77.1.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '-87.0' becomes -87.0\n  - '78.49' becomes 78.49\n  - '79.55' becomes 79.55\n  - '-65.8' becomes -65.8\n  - '-67.69' becomes -67.69\n\n- Compare each number to 77.1:\n  - -87.0 is not greater than 77.1\n  - 78.49 is greater than 77.1\n  - 79.55 is greater than 77.1\n  - -65.8 is not greater than 77.1\n  - -67.69 is not greater than 77.1\n\n- Filter the list to keep only numbers greater than 77.1:\n  - The numbers 78.49 and 79.55 are greater than 77.1.\n\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings:\n  - 78.49 becomes '78.49'\n  - 79.55 becomes '79.55'\n\n- Enclose the final list within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final filtered list is: <<<['78.49', '79.55']>>>"
