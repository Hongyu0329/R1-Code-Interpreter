    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers smaller than -27.451 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Threshold**: The threshold given is -27.451. We need to remove any number that is smaller than this value.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: The list contains numbers in string format. We need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to accurately compare them with the threshold.\n\n3. **Compare Each Number**: For each number in the list, compare it to the threshold (-27.451). If the number is smaller than the threshold, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: Construct a new list that only includes numbers that are greater than or equal to -27.451.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list contains numbers as strings, convert the numbers in the new list back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\n6. **Return the New List**: Finally, return the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Original list: ['-45.336', '29', '-28.3276', '-32.32', '31.6609', '77', '11.7', '64', '-17.17']\n\n- Convert each string to a float and compare with -27.451:\n  - '-45.336' -> -45.336 (remove, as it is smaller than -27.451)\n  - '29' -> 29 (keep, as it is greater than -27.451)\n  - '-28.3276' -> -28.3276 (remove, as it is smaller than -27.451)\n  - '-32.32' -> -32.32 (remove, as it is smaller than -27.451)\n  - '31.6609' -> 31.6609 (keep, as it is greater than -27.451)\n  - '77' -> 77 (keep, as it is greater than -27.451)\n  - '11.7' -> 11.7 (keep, as it is greater than -27.451)\n  - '64' -> 64 (keep, as it is greater than -27.451)\n  - '-17.17' -> -17.17 (keep, as it is greater than -27.451)\n\n- New list after removing numbers smaller than -27.451: ['29', '31.6609', '77', '11.7', '64', '-17.17']\n\n- Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<['29', '31.6609', '77', '11.7', '64', '-17.17']>>>"
