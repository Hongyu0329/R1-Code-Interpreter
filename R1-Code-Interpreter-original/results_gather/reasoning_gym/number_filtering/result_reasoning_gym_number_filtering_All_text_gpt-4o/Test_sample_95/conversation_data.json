    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the list of numbers and remove any numbers that are larger than 71.829. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The given list is `['82.4730', '13', '-95.29']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (either integers or floats) to compare them with 71.829.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number in the list to 71.829 and determine if it is larger. If a number is larger, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: We will create a new list that only includes numbers that are less than or equal to 71.829.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list contains numbers as strings, we need to convert the numbers in the new list back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert each string to a number:\n  - `'82.4730'` becomes `82.4730`\n  - `'13'` becomes `13`\n  - `'-95.29'` becomes `-95.29`\n\n- Compare each number to 71.829:\n  - `82.4730` is greater than 71.829, so it should be removed.\n  - `13` is less than 71.829, so it should be kept.\n  - `-95.29` is less than 71.829, so it should be kept.\n\n- Create a new list with numbers that are less than or equal to 71.829:\n  - The new list is `[13, -95.29]`.\n\n- Convert the numbers back to strings:\n  - `13` becomes `'13'`\n  - `-95.29` becomes `'-95.29'`\n\n- The final list in the original format is `['13', '-95.29']`.\n\nTherefore, the new list is:\n\n<<<['13', '-95.29']>>>"
