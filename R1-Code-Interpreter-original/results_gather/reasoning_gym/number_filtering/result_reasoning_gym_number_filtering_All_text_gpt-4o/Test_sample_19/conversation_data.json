    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers smaller than 12.43 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of strings representing numbers: `['67.6981', '-67.6', '66.52', '85.271', '9.658', '46.2944']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number to 12.43 and determine if it is smaller. If a number is smaller than 12.43, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: Construct a new list that only includes numbers that are 12.43 or larger.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Once we have the filtered list of numbers, convert them back to strings to match the format of the original list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: The final result should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float.\n- Compare each float to 12.43.\n- Keep only those numbers that are 12.43 or larger.\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n- Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert to floats: `[67.6981, -67.6, 66.52, 85.271, 9.658, 46.2944]`\n- Compare to 12.43 and filter: `[67.6981, 66.52, 85.271, 46.2944]` (since -67.6 and 9.658 are less than 12.43)\n- Convert back to strings: `['67.6981', '66.52', '85.271', '46.2944']`\n\nThe final list, with numbers 12.43 or larger, is:\n\n<<<['67.6981', '66.52', '85.271', '46.2944']>>>"
