    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers larger than -32.684 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['81.6756', '84.795', '-90.2958', '-57.1', '83.507', '38.5']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with -32.684, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to check each number to see if it is larger than -32.684. If it is, we will remove it from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: We will create a new list that only includes numbers that are not larger than -32.684.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list was in string format, we will convert the numbers in the new list back to strings.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Finally, we will format the new list within triple angle brackets as requested.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '81.6756' -> 81.6756\n  - '84.795' -> 84.795\n  - '-90.2958' -> -90.2958\n  - '-57.1' -> -57.1\n  - '83.507' -> 83.507\n  - '38.5' -> 38.5\n\n- Compare each number with -32.684:\n  - 81.6756 is larger than -32.684\n  - 84.795 is larger than -32.684\n  - -90.2958 is not larger than -32.684\n  - -57.1 is not larger than -32.684\n  - 83.507 is larger than -32.684\n  - 38.5 is larger than -32.684\n\n- Create a new list with numbers not larger than -32.684:\n  - Only '-90.2958' and '-57.1' are not larger than -32.684.\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings:\n  - -90.2958 -> '-90.2958'\n  - -57.1 -> '-57.1'\n\n- Format the new list within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['-90.2958', '-57.1']>>>"
