    "To solve the problem of removing all numbers larger than 40 from the given list, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of strings representing numbers. The list is: `['17.1', '79.729', '-27', '-15.19', '-31.7732', '2.3', '-80.70', '22.1']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numerical values (floats) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Identify Numbers Larger than 40**: Once converted, we need to identify which numbers are greater than 40.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Remove any numbers that are greater than 40 from the list.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, convert the remaining numbers back to their original string format.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Format the final list of strings within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Step 1**: The list is `['17.1', '79.729', '-27', '-15.19', '-31.7732', '2.3', '-80.70', '22.1']`.\n\n- **Step 2**: Convert each string to a float:\n  - '17.1' -> 17.1\n  - '79.729' -> 79.729\n  - '-27' -> -27.0\n  - '-15.19' -> -15.19\n  - '-31.7732' -> -31.7732\n  - '2.3' -> 2.3\n  - '-80.70' -> -80.7\n  - '22.1' -> 22.1\n\n- **Step 3**: Identify numbers larger than 40:\n  - 79.729 is the only number greater than 40.\n\n- **Step 4**: Remove numbers greater than 40:\n  - The list of numbers after removal is: [17.1, -27.0, -15.19, -31.7732, 2.3, -80.7, 22.1]\n\n- **Step 5**: Convert the remaining numbers back to strings:\n  - 17.1 -> '17.1'\n  - -27.0 -> '-27'\n  - -15.19 -> '-15.19'\n  - -31.7732 -> '-31.7732'\n  - 2.3 -> '2.3'\n  - -80.7 -> '-80.70'\n  - 22.1 -> '22.1'\n\n- **Step 6**: Format the result within triple angle brackets:\n  - The final list is: `['17.1', '-27', '-15.19', '-31.7732', '2.3', '-80.70', '22.1']`\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<['17.1', '-27', '-15.19', '-31.7732', '2.3', '-80.70', '22.1']>>>"
