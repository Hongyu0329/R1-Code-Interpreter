    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are smaller than -65.1. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The list provided is `['-34.8', '-61', '-41.5350', '99.9', '-70.9057', '-99.51', '-94.330']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the numbers are in string format, we need to convert them to a numerical format (float) to perform comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number to -65.1 and keep only those numbers that are smaller than -65.1.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Create a new list that includes only the numbers that meet the condition (i.e., numbers smaller than -65.1).\n\n5. **Format the Output**: Return the new list in the specified format enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float.\n- Compare each float to -65.1.\n- Keep only those numbers that are smaller than -65.1.\n- Format the result as specified.\n\nNow, let's perform the comparison:\n\n- '-34.8' as a float is -34.8, which is not smaller than -65.1.\n- '-61' as a float is -61.0, which is not smaller than -65.1.\n- '-41.5350' as a float is -41.535, which is not smaller than -65.1.\n- '99.9' as a float is 99.9, which is not smaller than -65.1.\n- '-70.9057' as a float is -70.9057, which is smaller than -65.1.\n- '-99.51' as a float is -99.51, which is smaller than -65.1.\n- '-94.330' as a float is -94.33, which is smaller than -65.1.\n\nThe numbers that are smaller than -65.1 are '-70.9057', '-99.51', and '-94.330'.\n\nTherefore, the new list containing only the numbers smaller than -65.1 is:\n\n<<<['-70.9057', '-99.51', '-94.330']>>>"
