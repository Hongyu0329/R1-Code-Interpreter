    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers from the given list that are smaller than -40.2034. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-75.558', '12.830', '-40', '-2.5532', '0.101', '-77.92', '-18']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with -40.2034, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number with -40.2034 and determine if it is smaller. If it is smaller, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: Construct a new list that only includes numbers that are greater than or equal to -40.2034.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list contains strings, the final list should also contain strings.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '-75.558' becomes -75.558\n  - '12.830' becomes 12.830\n  - '-40' becomes -40.0\n  - '-2.5532' becomes -2.5532\n  - '0.101' becomes 0.101\n  - '-77.92' becomes -77.92\n  - '-18' becomes -18.0\n\n- Compare each number with -40.2034:\n  - -75.558 is smaller than -40.2034\n  - 12.830 is greater than -40.2034\n  - -40.0 is greater than -40.2034\n  - -2.5532 is greater than -40.2034\n  - 0.101 is greater than -40.2034\n  - -77.92 is smaller than -40.2034\n  - -18.0 is greater than -40.2034\n\n- Construct a new list with numbers greater than or equal to -40.2034:\n  - '12.830', '-40', '-2.5532', '0.101', '-18'\n\n- Format the output as specified:\n  - The new list is `['12.830', '-40', '-2.5532', '0.101', '-18']`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['12.830', '-40', '-2.5532', '0.101', '-18']>>>"
