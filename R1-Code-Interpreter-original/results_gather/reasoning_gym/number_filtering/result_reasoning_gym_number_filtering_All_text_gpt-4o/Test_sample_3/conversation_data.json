    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are smaller than -25.866. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to identify numbers in the list that are smaller than -25.866.\n\n2. **Identify the List**: The list provided is:\n   ```\n   ['50.11', '73.01', '-13.65', '13.3480', '50.98', '30.5795', '86', '-27.1419']\n   ```\n\n3. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (floats) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will iterate through the list, convert each string to a float, and check if it is smaller than -25.866.\n\n5. **Collect the Results**: We will collect all numbers that satisfy the condition into a new list.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Finally, we will format the output as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert '50.11' to 50.11: 50.11 is not smaller than -25.866.\n- Convert '73.01' to 73.01: 73.01 is not smaller than -25.866.\n- Convert '-13.65' to -13.65: -13.65 is not smaller than -25.866.\n- Convert '13.3480' to 13.3480: 13.3480 is not smaller than -25.866.\n- Convert '50.98' to 50.98: 50.98 is not smaller than -25.866.\n- Convert '30.5795' to 30.5795: 30.5795 is not smaller than -25.866.\n- Convert '86' to 86.0: 86.0 is not smaller than -25.866.\n- Convert '-27.1419' to -27.1419: -27.1419 is smaller than -25.866.\n\nThe only number that meets the condition is -27.1419.\n\n7. **Format the Result**: The result should be formatted as a list of strings, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['-27.1419']>>>"
