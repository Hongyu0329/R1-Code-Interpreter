    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers larger than -11.0457 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['35.26', '-66.0628', '-63.50', '23.4995', '16.2627']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with -11.0457, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number in the list to -11.0457. If a number is larger than -11.0457, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: We will create a new list that only includes numbers that are less than or equal to -11.0457.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Once we have the filtered list of numbers, we need to convert them back to strings to match the format of the original list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '35.26' -> 35.26\n  - '-66.0628' -> -66.0628\n  - '-63.50' -> -63.50\n  - '23.4995' -> 23.4995\n  - '16.2627' -> 16.2627\n\n- Compare each number to -11.0457:\n  - 35.26 is greater than -11.0457, so it should be removed.\n  - -66.0628 is less than -11.0457, so it should be kept.\n  - -63.50 is less than -11.0457, so it should be kept.\n  - 23.4995 is greater than -11.0457, so it should be removed.\n  - 16.2627 is greater than -11.0457, so it should be removed.\n\n- The numbers that remain are -66.0628 and -63.50.\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings:\n  - -66.0628 -> '-66.0628'\n  - -63.50 -> '-63.50'\n\n- The new list is `['-66.0628', '-63.50']`.\n\n- Return the result in the specified format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['-66.0628', '-63.50']>>>"
