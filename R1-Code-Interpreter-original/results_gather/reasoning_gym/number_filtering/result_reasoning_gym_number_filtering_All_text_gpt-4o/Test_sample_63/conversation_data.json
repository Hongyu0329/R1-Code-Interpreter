    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the list of strings and remove any numbers that are smaller than 26. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The given list is `['89', '-72', '20.23', '61', '13.6020']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers to compare them with 26. We will consider both integers and floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison with 26**: We will compare each number with 26 and determine if it should be removed or retained in the list.\n\n4. **Iterate Through the List**:\n   - '89': Convert to number (integer 89). Since 89 is greater than 26, it remains in the list.\n   - '-72': Convert to number (integer -72). Since -72 is less than 26, it is removed from the list.\n   - '20.23': Convert to number (float 20.23). Since 20.23 is less than 26, it is removed from the list.\n   - '61': Convert to number (integer 61). Since 61 is greater than 26, it remains in the list.\n   - '13.6020': Convert to number (float 13.6020). Since 13.6020 is less than 26, it is removed from the list.\n\n5. **Construct the New List**: After filtering, the numbers that remain are '89' and '61'.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final list should be formatted as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer, after removing all numbers smaller than 26, is:\n\n<<<['89', '61']>>>"
