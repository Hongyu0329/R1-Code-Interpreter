    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of strings, keeping only those numbers that are smaller than -10.1. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-8.1', '41.10', '-13', '7', '47.34']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values numerically, we need to convert them from strings to numbers (specifically, floating-point numbers).\n\n3. **Identify the Condition**: We are tasked with keeping numbers smaller than -10.1. This means we need to filter out any number that is greater than or equal to -10.1.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Go through each element in the list, convert it to a number, and check if it is smaller than -10.1. If it is, keep it in the new list.\n\n5. **Create the New List**: After filtering, the new list should only contain the numbers that meet the condition.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, as specified.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert each string to a number:\n  - '-8.1' becomes -8.1\n  - '41.10' becomes 41.10\n  - '-13' becomes -13.0\n  - '7' becomes 7.0\n  - '47.34' becomes 47.34\n\n- Apply the condition (smaller than -10.1):\n  - -8.1 is not smaller than -10.1, so it is not included.\n  - 41.10 is not smaller than -10.1, so it is not included.\n  - -13.0 is smaller than -10.1, so it is included.\n  - 7.0 is not smaller than -10.1, so it is not included.\n  - 47.34 is not smaller than -10.1, so it is not included.\n\n- The new list after filtering is `['-13']`.\n\n- Format the output as specified: <<<['-13']>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['-13']>>>"
