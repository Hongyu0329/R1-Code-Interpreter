    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers larger than 15.735 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of strings representing numbers: `['19.40', '82', '45.9', '-8.3795', '-67.95', '-10.0']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numerical values (floats) to perform the comparison.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number to 15.735. If a number is greater than 15.735, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: Construct a new list that only includes numbers less than or equal to 15.735.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Once we have the filtered list of numbers, convert them back to strings to match the original format.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Finally, format the new list within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '19.40' -> 19.40\n  - '82' -> 82.0\n  - '45.9' -> 45.9\n  - '-8.3795' -> -8.3795\n  - '-67.95' -> -67.95\n  - '-10.0' -> -10.0\n\n- Compare each number to 15.735:\n  - 19.40 > 15.735, so remove it.\n  - 82.0 > 15.735, so remove it.\n  - 45.9 > 15.735, so remove it.\n  - -8.3795 <= 15.735, so keep it.\n  - -67.95 <= 15.735, so keep it.\n  - -10.0 <= 15.735, so keep it.\n\n- The numbers that remain are: -8.3795, -67.95, -10.0.\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings:\n  - -8.3795 -> '-8.3795'\n  - -67.95 -> '-67.95'\n  - -10.0 -> '-10.0'\n\n- Format the result within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['-8.3795', '-67.95', '-10.0']>>>"
