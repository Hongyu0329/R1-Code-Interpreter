    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are smaller than 46.60. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['15', '-30', '94.39', '45.6363', '-87.069', '82.027', '-93.09', '-99']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with 46.60, we need to convert them from strings to numbers (specifically, floating-point numbers).\n\n3. **Comparison**: We will compare each number with 46.60 and keep only those numbers that are less than 46.60.\n\n4. **Reconvert to Strings**: After filtering, we need to convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format of the list.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: Finally, we will format the output list within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nLet's go through the list and apply these steps:\n\n- `'15'` converts to 15.0, which is less than 46.60. Keep it.\n- `'-30'` converts to -30.0, which is less than 46.60. Keep it.\n- `'94.39'` converts to 94.39, which is not less than 46.60. Discard it.\n- `'45.6363'` converts to 45.6363, which is less than 46.60. Keep it.\n- `'-87.069'` converts to -87.069, which is less than 46.60. Keep it.\n- `'82.027'` converts to 82.027, which is not less than 46.60. Discard it.\n- `'-93.09'` converts to -93.09, which is less than 46.60. Keep it.\n- `'-99'` converts to -99.0, which is less than 46.60. Keep it.\n\nAfter filtering, the numbers that are less than 46.60 are: `'15'`, `'-30'`, `'45.6363'`, `'-87.069'`, `'-93.09'`, and `'-99'`.\n\nNow, we format the final list as specified:\n\n<<<['15', '-30', '45.6363', '-87.069', '-93.09', '-99']>>>"
