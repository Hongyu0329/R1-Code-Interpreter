    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of strings representing numbers and keep only those numbers that are smaller than -16. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The list provided is `['-48', '-60.988', '46', '29.16', '35.3', '92']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (either integers or floats) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Filter the Numbers**: We need to filter out the numbers that are smaller than -16. This means we will only keep numbers that are less than -16.\n\n4. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, we need to convert the numbers back to strings to match the format of the original list.\n\n5. **Return the New List**: Finally, we will return the new list in the specified format enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Step 1**: The original list is `['-48', '-60.988', '46', '29.16', '35.3', '92']`.\n\n- **Step 2**: Convert each string to a number:\n  - '-48' becomes -48\n  - '-60.988' becomes -60.988\n  - '46' becomes 46\n  - '29.16' becomes 29.16\n  - '35.3' becomes 35.3\n  - '92' becomes 92\n\n- **Step 3**: Filter the numbers that are smaller than -16:\n  - -48 is smaller than -16\n  - -60.988 is smaller than -16\n  - 46 is not smaller than -16\n  - 29.16 is not smaller than -16\n  - 35.3 is not smaller than -16\n  - 92 is not smaller than -16\n\n  So, the numbers that are smaller than -16 are -48 and -60.988.\n\n- **Step 4**: Convert these numbers back to strings:\n  - -48 becomes '-48'\n  - -60.988 becomes '-60.988'\n\n- **Step 5**: Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nThe new list is `['-48', '-60.988']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['-48', '-60.988']>>>"
