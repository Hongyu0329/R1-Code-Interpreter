    "To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps to ensure we correctly filter the list based on the given condition. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to remove all numbers larger than 68.24 from the given list of strings representing numbers.\n\n2. **Initial List**: The list provided is:\n   ```\n   ['-32.3824', '-23', '-68.118', '34.5673', '-99.71', '-42.26', '-55.7', '20.7', '2.79', '75.0443']\n   ```\n\n3. **Conversion to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (floats) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n4. **Comparison**: For each number in the list, check if it is greater than 68.24. If it is, it should be removed from the list.\n\n5. **Filter the List**: Create a new list that only includes numbers that are less than or equal to 68.24.\n\n6. **Convert Back to Strings**: Once the filtering is done, convert the numbers back to strings to match the original format.\n\n7. **Output Format**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float.\n- Compare each float to 68.24.\n- Keep only those numbers that are less than or equal to 68.24.\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n- Format the result as specified.\n\nApplying these steps to the list:\n\n- Convert to floats: `[-32.3824, -23.0, -68.118, 34.5673, -99.71, -42.26, -55.7, 20.7, 2.79, 75.0443]`\n- Compare each number to 68.24:\n  - `-32.3824` is less than 68.24\n  - `-23.0` is less than 68.24\n  - `-68.118` is less than 68.24\n  - `34.5673` is less than 68.24\n  - `-99.71` is less than 68.24\n  - `-42.26` is less than 68.24\n  - `-55.7` is less than 68.24\n  - `20.7` is less than 68.24\n  - `2.79` is less than 68.24\n  - `75.0443` is greater than 68.24 (remove this one)\n- Filtered list: `[-32.3824, -23.0, -68.118, 34.5673, -99.71, -42.26, -55.7, 20.7, 2.79]`\n- Convert back to strings: `['-32.3824', '-23', '-68.118', '34.5673', '-99.71', '-42.26', '-55.7', '20.7', '2.79']`\n\nThe final list, formatted as required, is:\n\n<<<['-32.3824', '-23', '-68.118', '34.5673', '-99.71', '-42.26', '-55.7', '20.7', '2.79']>>>"
