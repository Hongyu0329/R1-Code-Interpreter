    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of strings, keeping only those numbers that are larger than 34.39. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The list provided is `['2', '-47.0', '64.4', '-47.3', '2.4465', '-61', '62.5076', '-26.866']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (floats) to compare them with 34.39.\n\n3. **Comparison**: For each number, check if it is greater than 34.39.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Keep only those numbers that satisfy the condition (greater than 34.39).\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Convert the filtered numbers back to strings to maintain the original format of the list.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Enclose the new list within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '2' -> 2.0\n  - '-47.0' -> -47.0\n  - '64.4' -> 64.4\n  - '-47.3' -> -47.3\n  - '2.4465' -> 2.4465\n  - '-61' -> -61.0\n  - '62.5076' -> 62.5076\n  - '-26.866' -> -26.866\n\n- Compare each number with 34.39:\n  - 2.0 is not greater than 34.39\n  - -47.0 is not greater than 34.39\n  - 64.4 is greater than 34.39\n  - -47.3 is not greater than 34.39\n  - 2.4465 is not greater than 34.39\n  - -61.0 is not greater than 34.39\n  - 62.5076 is greater than 34.39\n  - -26.866 is not greater than 34.39\n\n- Filter the list to keep only '64.4' and '62.5076'.\n\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings: ['64.4', '62.5076'].\n\n- Format the output: Enclose the new list within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['64.4', '62.5076']>>>"
