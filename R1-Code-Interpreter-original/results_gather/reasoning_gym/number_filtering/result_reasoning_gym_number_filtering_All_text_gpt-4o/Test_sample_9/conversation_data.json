    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are larger than -65.3634. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to filter out numbers from the list that are greater than -65.3634.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: The list contains numbers in string format. We need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform the comparison.\n\n3. **Comparison**: For each number in the list, compare it to -65.3634. If the number is greater than -65.3634, it should be included in the new list.\n\n4. **Create the New List**: Collect all numbers that satisfy the condition into a new list.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, as specified.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Original list: ['-33.6', '80.401', '15.59', '10.612', '70.3927', '-98.1', '32', '-12.1', '97.33']\n\n- Convert each string to a float and compare with -65.3634:\n  - '-33.6' -> -33.6 (greater than -65.3634, include in new list)\n  - '80.401' -> 80.401 (greater than -65.3634, include in new list)\n  - '15.59' -> 15.59 (greater than -65.3634, include in new list)\n  - '10.612' -> 10.612 (greater than -65.3634, include in new list)\n  - '70.3927' -> 70.3927 (greater than -65.3634, include in new list)\n  - '-98.1' -> -98.1 (not greater than -65.3634, do not include)\n  - '32' -> 32.0 (greater than -65.3634, include in new list)\n  - '-12.1' -> -12.1 (greater than -65.3634, include in new list)\n  - '97.33' -> 97.33 (greater than -65.3634, include in new list)\n\n- New list after filtering: [-33.6, 80.401, 15.59, 10.612, 70.3927, 32.0, -12.1, 97.33]\n\n- Convert the numbers back to strings to match the original format: ['-33.6', '80.401', '15.59', '10.612', '70.3927', '32', '-12.1', '97.33']\n\n- Enclose the new list within triple angle brackets.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<['-33.6', '80.401', '15.59', '10.612', '70.3927', '32', '-12.1', '97.33']>>>"
