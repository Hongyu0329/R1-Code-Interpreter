    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are smaller than 76.26. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-87.4950', '-9.27', '-48.514', '-22', '59', '91', '-47.239', '45']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with 76.26, we need to convert them from strings to numbers (specifically, floats).\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number with 76.26 and keep only those numbers that are smaller.\n\n4. **Reconvert to Strings**: After filtering, we need to convert the numbers back to their original string format to match the format of the original list.\n\n5. **Output Format**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the new list>>>.\n\nLet's go through the list and apply these steps:\n\n- `'-87.4950'`: Convert to float, which is -87.4950. Since -87.4950 < 76.26, keep it.\n- `'-9.27'`: Convert to float, which is -9.27. Since -9.27 < 76.26, keep it.\n- `'-48.514'`: Convert to float, which is -48.514. Since -48.514 < 76.26, keep it.\n- `'-22'`: Convert to float, which is -22. Since -22 < 76.26, keep it.\n- `'59'`: Convert to float, which is 59. Since 59 < 76.26, keep it.\n- `'91'`: Convert to float, which is 91. Since 91 > 76.26, discard it.\n- `'-47.239'`: Convert to float, which is -47.239. Since -47.239 < 76.26, keep it.\n- `'45'`: Convert to float, which is 45. Since 45 < 76.26, keep it.\n\nAfter filtering, the numbers that are smaller than 76.26 are: `'-87.4950'`, `'-9.27'`, `'-48.514'`, `'-22'`, `'59'`, `'-47.239'`, and `'45'`.\n\nNow, let's list these numbers in the same format as the original list:\n\n<<<['-87.4950', '-9.27', '-48.514', '-22', '59', '-47.239', '45']>>>"
