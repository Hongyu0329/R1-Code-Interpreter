    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those numbers that are larger than 77.03. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to keep numbers larger than 77.03 from the given list.\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**: The list provided is:\n   - '-75.0298'\n   - '-19'\n   - '-59.30'\n   - '40.8'\n   - '39.7'\n   - '-84.038'\n   - '-12'\n   - '-83'\n   - '85.5'\n   - '-79'\n\n3. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert them to numbers (floats) to compare them with 77.03.\n\n4. **Compare Each Number**: We will compare each number with 77.03 to determine if it should be kept in the new list:\n   - '-75.0298' (converted to -75.0298) is not greater than 77.03.\n   - '-19' (converted to -19.0) is not greater than 77.03.\n   - '-59.30' (converted to -59.3) is not greater than 77.03.\n   - '40.8' (converted to 40.8) is not greater than 77.03.\n   - '39.7' (converted to 39.7) is not greater than 77.03.\n   - '-84.038' (converted to -84.038) is not greater than 77.03.\n   - '-12' (converted to -12.0) is not greater than 77.03.\n   - '-83' (converted to -83.0) is not greater than 77.03.\n   - '85.5' (converted to 85.5) is greater than 77.03.\n   - '-79' (converted to -79.0) is not greater than 77.03.\n\n5. **Create the New List**: Based on the comparisons, the only number that is greater than 77.03 is '85.5'.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The new list should be formatted in the same way as the input list, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer, with the new list containing only numbers greater than 77.03, is:\n\n<<<['85.5']>>>"
