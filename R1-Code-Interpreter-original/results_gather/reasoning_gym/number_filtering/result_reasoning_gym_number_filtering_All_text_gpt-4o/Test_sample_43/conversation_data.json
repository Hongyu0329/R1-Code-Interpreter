    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are larger than 9.691. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to keep numbers that are strictly greater than 9.691. This means any number equal to or less than 9.691 should be excluded.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Number**: We will examine each number in the list to determine if it meets the criteria.\n\n3. **List of Numbers**: The given list is:\n   - '16.960'\n   - '-91.6731'\n   - '34.691'\n   - '81.95'\n   - '-79.99'\n   - '85.38'\n   - '-45.08'\n   - '21.333'\n   - '-46'\n   - '-24.3579'\n\n4. **Filter the List**:\n   - '16.960' is greater than 9.691, so it is included.\n   - '-91.6731' is less than 9.691, so it is excluded.\n   - '34.691' is greater than 9.691, so it is included.\n   - '81.95' is greater than 9.691, so it is included.\n   - '-79.99' is less than 9.691, so it is excluded.\n   - '85.38' is greater than 9.691, so it is included.\n   - '-45.08' is less than 9.691, so it is excluded.\n   - '21.333' is greater than 9.691, so it is included.\n   - '-46' is less than 9.691, so it is excluded.\n   - '-24.3579' is less than 9.691, so it is excluded.\n\n5. **Construct the New List**: After filtering, the numbers that remain are:\n   - '16.960'\n   - '34.691'\n   - '81.95'\n   - '85.38'\n   - '21.333'\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['16.960', '34.691', '81.95', '85.38', '21.333']>>>"
