    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given list of numbers and filter out those that are smaller than -30. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-43.3', '-46.876', '-6.56', '95', '58', '33.2', '-69']`. These are string representations of numbers, and we need to consider them as numerical values to perform comparisons.\n\n2. **Identify the Condition**: We are tasked with keeping only the numbers that are smaller than -30. This means we need to convert each string to a numerical value and check if it is less than -30.\n\n3. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Convert each string in the list to a floating-point number for accurate comparison. This is necessary because the list contains decimal numbers.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: After conversion, check each number to see if it is smaller than -30. If it is, we keep it in the new list.\n\n5. **Create the New List**: Collect all numbers that meet the condition into a new list. Ensure that the numbers are converted back to strings to match the format of the original list.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '-43.3' becomes -43.3\n  - '-46.876' becomes -46.876\n  - '-6.56' becomes -6.56\n  - '95' becomes 95.0\n  - '58' becomes 58.0\n  - '33.2' becomes 33.2\n  - '-69' becomes -69.0\n\n- Check each number against the condition (smaller than -30):\n  - -43.3 is smaller than -30\n  - -46.876 is smaller than -30\n  - -6.56 is not smaller than -30\n  - 95.0 is not smaller than -30\n  - 58.0 is not smaller than -30\n  - 33.2 is not smaller than -30\n  - -69.0 is smaller than -30\n\n- Collect the numbers that meet the condition:\n  - '-43.3', '-46.876', '-69'\n\n- Format the result as specified:\n  - The new list is `['-43.3', '-46.876', '-69']`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['-43.3', '-46.876', '-69']>>>"
