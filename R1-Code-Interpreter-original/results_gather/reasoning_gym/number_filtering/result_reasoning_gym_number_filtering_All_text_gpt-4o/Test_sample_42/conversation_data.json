    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers larger than 50.936 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of strings representing numbers: `['-36.15', '-63.6', '-29.718', '60.3380']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Identify the Threshold**: The threshold given is 50.936. We need to remove any number from the list that is greater than this threshold.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Go through each number in the list and check if it is greater than 50.936. If it is, remove it from the list.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, convert the remaining numbers back to strings to match the original format of the list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Format the final list within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert the list of strings to numbers: `[-36.15, -63.6, -29.718, 60.3380]`.\n- Compare each number to 50.936:\n  - `-36.15` is not greater than 50.936.\n  - `-63.6` is not greater than 50.936.\n  - `-29.718` is not greater than 50.936.\n  - `60.3380` is greater than 50.936, so it should be removed.\n- The numbers that remain after filtering are `[-36.15, -63.6, -29.718]`.\n- Convert these numbers back to strings: `['-36.15', '-63.6', '-29.718']`.\n\nFinally, format the result within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<['-36.15', '-63.6', '-29.718']>>>"
