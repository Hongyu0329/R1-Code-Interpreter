    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are larger than 42.255. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['11.24', '49', '41.54']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with 42.255, we need to convert them from strings to numbers (specifically, floating-point numbers).\n\n3. **Comparison**: We will compare each number with 42.255 and determine if it is larger.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will keep only those numbers that are larger than 42.255.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to their string representations to match the original format.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Finally, we will format the output list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert '11.24' to a number: 11.24\n  - Compare 11.24 with 42.255: 11.24 is not larger than 42.255, so it is not included in the new list.\n\n- Convert '49' to a number: 49.0\n  - Compare 49.0 with 42.255: 49.0 is larger than 42.255, so it is included in the new list.\n\n- Convert '41.54' to a number: 41.54\n  - Compare 41.54 with 42.255: 41.54 is not larger than 42.255, so it is not included in the new list.\n\nAfter filtering, the only number that remains is 49.0. We convert it back to its string representation, '49'.\n\nThe final list, containing only the numbers larger than 42.255, is `['49']`.\n\nTherefore, the new list is:\n\n<<<['49']>>>"
