    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers smaller than 92.4641 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of strings representing numbers: `['26.45', '-4.2066', '81.8', '95.8461', '88.70']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number to 92.4641 and determine if it is smaller. If a number is smaller, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: Construct a new list that only includes numbers that are greater than or equal to 92.4641.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Once we have the filtered list of numbers, we need to convert them back to strings to match the format of the original list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert the list of strings to a list of floats: `[26.45, -4.2066, 81.8, 95.8461, 88.70]`.\n- Compare each number to 92.4641:\n  - 26.45 < 92.4641 (remove)\n  - -4.2066 < 92.4641 (remove)\n  - 81.8 < 92.4641 (remove)\n  - 95.8461 >= 92.4641 (keep)\n  - 88.70 < 92.4641 (remove)\n- The numbers that remain are `[95.8461]`.\n- Convert the remaining numbers back to strings: `['95.8461']`.\n\nThe final list, in the required format, is:\n\n<<<['95.8461']>>>"
