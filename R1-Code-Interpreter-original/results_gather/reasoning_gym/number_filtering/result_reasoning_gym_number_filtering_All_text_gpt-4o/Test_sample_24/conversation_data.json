    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given list of numbers and filter out those that are smaller than 57. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: We have a list of strings representing numbers: `['-5.2656', '-39.7718', '97.721']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these numbers with 57, we need to convert them from strings to a numerical format (either integers or floats). In this case, since the numbers have decimal points, we will convert them to floats.\n\n3. **Comparison with 57**: We need to compare each number with 57 and keep only those numbers that are smaller than 57.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: After identifying the numbers smaller than 57, we will create a new list containing only these numbers.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the final output should be in the same format as the input, we will convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Finally, we will format the new list of strings within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '-5.2656' becomes -5.2656\n  - '-39.7718' becomes -39.7718\n  - '97.721' becomes 97.721\n\n- Compare each number with 57:\n  - -5.2656 is less than 57\n  - -39.7718 is less than 57\n  - 97.721 is not less than 57\n\n- Filter the list to keep only numbers smaller than 57:\n  - The numbers -5.2656 and -39.7718 are smaller than 57.\n\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings:\n  - -5.2656 becomes '-5.2656'\n  - -39.7718 becomes '-39.7718'\n\n- Format the output list:\n  - The new list is `['-5.2656', '-39.7718']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['-5.2656', '-39.7718']>>>"
