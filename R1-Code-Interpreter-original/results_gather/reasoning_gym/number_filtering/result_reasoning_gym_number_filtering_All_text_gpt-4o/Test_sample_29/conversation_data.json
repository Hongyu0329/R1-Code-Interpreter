    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers smaller than -72.485 from the given list of strings representing numbers. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: We have a list of strings that represent numbers. The list is:\n   ```\n   ['-63.7', '61.95', '-41', '-2.77', '-86.975', '-34.0', '-33', '79', '26.96', '-94.7']\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Threshold**: The threshold given is -72.485. We need to remove any number from the list that is smaller than this threshold.\n\n3. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (floats) to compare them with the threshold.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will iterate through the list, convert each string to a float, and check if it is greater than or equal to -72.485. If it is, we keep it in the list; otherwise, we remove it.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, we convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format of the list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the new list in the specified format enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string to a float and compare with -72.485:\n  - '-63.7' -> -63.7 (keep, as -63.7 > -72.485)\n  - '61.95' -> 61.95 (keep, as 61.95 > -72.485)\n  - '-41' -> -41.0 (keep, as -41.0 > -72.485)\n  - '-2.77' -> -2.77 (keep, as -2.77 > -72.485)\n  - '-86.975' -> -86.975 (remove, as -86.975 < -72.485)\n  - '-34.0' -> -34.0 (keep, as -34.0 > -72.485)\n  - '-33' -> -33.0 (keep, as -33.0 > -72.485)\n  - '79' -> 79.0 (keep, as 79.0 > -72.485)\n  - '26.96' -> 26.96 (keep, as 26.96 > -72.485)\n  - '-94.7' -> -94.7 (remove, as -94.7 < -72.485)\n\n- The numbers that remain after filtering are:\n  - '-63.7', '61.95', '-41', '-2.77', '-34.0', '-33', '79', '26.96'\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings (though they are already in string format in the list).\n\n- Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['-63.7', '61.95', '-41', '-2.77', '-34.0', '-33', '79', '26.96']>>>"
