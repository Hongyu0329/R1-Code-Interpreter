    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given list of numbers and filter out those that are smaller than -35.4. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The given list is `['15.613', '-50.5', '-5.631']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: The elements in the list are strings, so we need to convert them to numbers (specifically, floating-point numbers) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Set the Threshold**: We are looking for numbers smaller than -35.4.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will iterate through the list, convert each string to a float, and check if it is smaller than -35.4. If it is, we will include it in the new list.\n\n5. **Create the New List**: The new list will contain only those numbers that meet the condition of being smaller than -35.4.\n\n6. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list contains numbers as strings, we will convert the numbers in the new list back to strings to maintain the same format.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Finally, we will output the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert '15.613' to a float: 15.613. This is not smaller than -35.4, so it is not included in the new list.\n- Convert '-50.5' to a float: -50.5. This is smaller than -35.4, so it is included in the new list.\n- Convert '-5.631' to a float: -5.631. This is not smaller than -35.4, so it is not included in the new list.\n\nThe new list, after filtering, contains only one number: '-50.5'.\n\nFinally, we convert this number back to a string and enclose the list within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['-50.5']>>>"
