    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers larger than -73.8 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-16.46', '-83.62', '-95.681', '-97.79', '61.53', '71', '80']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with -73.8, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number with -73.8 and determine if it is larger. If a number is larger than -73.8, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Create a new list that only includes numbers that are not larger than -73.8.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list contains numbers as strings, the final list should also contain numbers as strings.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float.\n- Compare each float with -73.8.\n- Keep only those numbers that are less than or equal to -73.8.\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n- Enclose the final list within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert to floats: `[-16.46, -83.62, -95.681, -97.79, 61.53, 71, 80]`\n- Compare with -73.8:\n  - `-16.46` is larger than -73.8, so remove it.\n  - `-83.62` is not larger than -73.8, so keep it.\n  - `-95.681` is not larger than -73.8, so keep it.\n  - `-97.79` is not larger than -73.8, so keep it.\n  - `61.53` is larger than -73.8, so remove it.\n  - `71` is larger than -73.8, so remove it.\n  - `80` is larger than -73.8, so remove it.\n\n- The filtered list of floats is `[-83.62, -95.681, -97.79]`.\n- Convert back to strings: `['-83.62', '-95.681', '-97.79']`.\n\nFinally, enclose the result within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<['-83.62', '-95.681', '-97.79']>>>"
