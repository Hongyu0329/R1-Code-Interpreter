    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers larger than -36 from the given list. Let's break down the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-98', '47.525', '93.5', '-45.1788', '-15.2636', '-85', '-36.9657']`. These are string representations of numbers, and we need to convert them to numerical values to perform comparisons.\n\n2. **Conversion to Numerical Values**: Convert each string in the list to a float. This is necessary because the list contains decimal numbers, and we need to handle them accurately.\n\n3. **Comparison**: For each number in the list, check if it is larger than -36. If it is, we will remove it from the list.\n\n4. **Construct the New List**: After filtering out the numbers larger than -36, we will construct a new list with the remaining numbers.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: Finally, we will format the new list in the specified format enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's go through these steps with the given list:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '-98' becomes -98.0\n  - '47.525' becomes 47.525\n  - '93.5' becomes 93.5\n  - '-45.1788' becomes -45.1788\n  - '-15.2636' becomes -15.2636\n  - '-85' becomes -85.0\n  - '-36.9657' becomes -36.9657\n\n- Compare each number to -36:\n  - -98.0 is not larger than -36, so it remains in the list.\n  - 47.525 is larger than -36, so it is removed.\n  - 93.5 is larger than -36, so it is removed.\n  - -45.1788 is not larger than -36, so it remains in the list.\n  - -15.2636 is larger than -36, so it is removed.\n  - -85.0 is not larger than -36, so it remains in the list.\n  - -36.9657 is not larger than -36, so it remains in the list.\n\n- Construct the new list with the remaining numbers: `[-98.0, -45.1788, -85.0, -36.9657]`.\n\n- Convert the numbers back to their original string format for the final output:\n  - -98.0 becomes '-98'\n  - -45.1788 becomes '-45.1788'\n  - -85.0 becomes '-85'\n  - -36.9657 becomes '-36.9657'\n\n- Format the output as specified: <<<['-98', '-45.1788', '-85', '-36.9657']>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['-98', '-45.1788', '-85', '-36.9657']>>>"
