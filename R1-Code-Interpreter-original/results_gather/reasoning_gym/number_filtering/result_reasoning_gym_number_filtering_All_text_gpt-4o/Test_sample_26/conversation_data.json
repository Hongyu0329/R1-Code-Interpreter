    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers larger than -72.395 from the given list of strings representing numbers. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-58.9', '-91.759', '-18.92', '61.08', '93.3462', '-16.1939']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with -72.395, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number with -72.395 and determine if it is larger. If a number is larger, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: We will create a new list that only includes numbers that are not larger than -72.395.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the final list needs to be in the same format as the original (i.e., strings), we will convert the numbers back to strings.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the new list>>>.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Step 1**: Convert each string in the list to a float.\n  - '-58.9' becomes -58.9\n  - '-91.759' becomes -91.759\n  - '-18.92' becomes -18.92\n  - '61.08' becomes 61.08\n  - '93.3462' becomes 93.3462\n  - '-16.1939' becomes -16.1939\n\n- **Step 2**: Compare each number with -72.395.\n  - -58.9 is larger than -72.395\n  - -91.759 is not larger than -72.395\n  - -18.92 is larger than -72.395\n  - 61.08 is larger than -72.395\n  - 93.3462 is larger than -72.395\n  - -16.1939 is larger than -72.395\n\n- **Step 3**: Create a new list with numbers not larger than -72.395.\n  - The only number that is not larger than -72.395 is -91.759.\n\n- **Step 4**: Convert the remaining number back to a string.\n  - -91.759 becomes '-91.759'\n\n- **Step 5**: Format the output.\n  - The new list is `['-91.759']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['-91.759']>>>"
