    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those numbers that are larger than -55.4733. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: We have a list of strings representing numbers: ['-37.6', '57.39', '-48.7824', '-80.962'].\n\n2. **Conversion to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number to -55.4733 and keep only those numbers that are larger than this value.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: After identifying the numbers that meet the condition, we will create a new list containing only these numbers.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: Finally, we will format the new list in the specified format enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '-37.6' becomes -37.6\n  - '57.39' becomes 57.39\n  - '-48.7824' becomes -48.7824\n  - '-80.962' becomes -80.962\n\n- Compare each number to -55.4733:\n  - -37.6 is greater than -55.4733\n  - 57.39 is greater than -55.4733\n  - -48.7824 is greater than -55.4733\n  - -80.962 is not greater than -55.4733\n\n- Filter the list to keep only numbers greater than -55.4733:\n  - The numbers that satisfy the condition are -37.6, 57.39, and -48.7824.\n\n- Format the output list:\n  - Convert the numbers back to strings to match the original format.\n\nThe final list, formatted as specified, is:\n\n<<<['-37.6', '57.39', '-48.7824']>>>"
