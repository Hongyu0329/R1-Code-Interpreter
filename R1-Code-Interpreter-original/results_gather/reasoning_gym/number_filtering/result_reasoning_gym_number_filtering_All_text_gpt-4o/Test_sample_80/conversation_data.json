    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers smaller than 46.2790 from the given list of strings representing numbers. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: \n   - We have a list of strings: `['66.5934', '23.967', '80.5', '-27.5017', '-9.041', '19.1', '45.744', '-47.5', '-54.5255', '34.7']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**:\n   - Convert each string in the list to a floating-point number for accurate comparison.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - Compare each number to 46.2790.\n   - Identify numbers that are greater than or equal to 46.2790.\n\n4. **Filter the List**:\n   - Create a new list containing only the numbers that are greater than or equal to 46.2790.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**:\n   - Convert the filtered numbers back to strings to match the original format.\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - Enclose the new list within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert the list of strings to numbers: `[66.5934, 23.967, 80.5, -27.5017, -9.041, 19.1, 45.744, -47.5, -54.5255, 34.7]`.\n- Compare each number to 46.2790:\n  - 66.5934 >= 46.2790 (keep)\n  - 23.967 < 46.2790 (remove)\n  - 80.5 >= 46.2790 (keep)\n  - -27.5017 < 46.2790 (remove)\n  - -9.041 < 46.2790 (remove)\n  - 19.1 < 46.2790 (remove)\n  - 45.744 < 46.2790 (remove)\n  - -47.5 < 46.2790 (remove)\n  - -54.5255 < 46.2790 (remove)\n  - 34.7 < 46.2790 (remove)\n\n- The numbers that remain are: `[66.5934, 80.5]`.\n- Convert these numbers back to strings: `['66.5934', '80.5']`.\n- Format the output as specified: `<<<['66.5934', '80.5']>>>`.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['66.5934', '80.5']>>>"
