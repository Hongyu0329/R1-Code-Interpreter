    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given list of numbers and filter out those that are smaller than 84. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The given list is `['-75.18', '-40', '37.46', '90.406', '19.02']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with 84, we need to convert them from strings to numbers. In this case, they appear to be floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison with 84**: We need to check each number to see if it is smaller than 84.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will keep only those numbers that are smaller than 84.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, we need to convert the numbers back to their original string format to match the format of the input list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '-75.18' becomes -75.18\n  - '-40' becomes -40.0\n  - '37.46' becomes 37.46\n  - '90.406' becomes 90.406\n  - '19.02' becomes 19.02\n\n- Compare each number with 84:\n  - -75.18 < 84 (keep)\n  - -40.0 < 84 (keep)\n  - 37.46 < 84 (keep)\n  - 90.406 > 84 (discard)\n  - 19.02 < 84 (keep)\n\n- Filtered list of numbers: [-75.18, -40.0, 37.46, 19.02]\n\n- Convert back to strings:\n  - -75.18 becomes '-75.18'\n  - -40.0 becomes '-40'\n  - 37.46 becomes '37.46'\n  - 19.02 becomes '19.02'\n\n- The new list in the original format is: `['-75.18', '-40', '37.46', '19.02']`\n\nNow, we can present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<['-75.18', '-40', '37.46', '19.02']>>>"
