    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers smaller than 67.8 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of strings representing numbers: `['-54.197', '9', '-54.468', '91.2740', '83', '57.986', '1.197']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: We need to convert these string representations into numerical values (either integers or floats) to compare them with 67.8.\n\n3. **Comparison**: For each number in the list, check if it is greater than or equal to 67.8. If it is, keep it in the list; otherwise, remove it.\n\n4. **Reformat the List**: After filtering the list, convert the numbers back to their original string format to maintain consistency with the input format.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float for comparison.\n- Compare each number with 67.8.\n- Keep only those numbers that are greater than or equal to 67.8.\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to their original string format.\n- Enclose the final list within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert the list: `[-54.197, 9, -54.468, 91.2740, 83, 57.986, 1.197]`.\n- Compare each number with 67.8:\n  - `-54.197` is less than 67.8, so remove it.\n  - `9` is less than 67.8, so remove it.\n  - `-54.468` is less than 67.8, so remove it.\n  - `91.2740` is greater than 67.8, so keep it.\n  - `83` is greater than 67.8, so keep it.\n  - `57.986` is less than 67.8, so remove it.\n  - `1.197` is less than 67.8, so remove it.\n\n- The filtered list of numbers is `[91.2740, 83]`.\n- Convert these numbers back to their original string format: `['91.2740', '83']`.\n\nFinally, the new list is:\n\n<<<['91.2740', '83']>>>"
