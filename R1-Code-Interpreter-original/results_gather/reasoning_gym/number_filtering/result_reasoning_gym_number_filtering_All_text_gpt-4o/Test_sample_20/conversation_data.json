    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of strings representing numbers, keeping only those numbers that are larger than -23.4. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The list provided is `['-89.0955', '-3.23', '-18.6', '-68.170', '66.11', '-12', '-93.161']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison Criterion**: We need to keep numbers that are larger than -23.4. This means any number greater than -23.4 should be included in the new list.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Go through each number in the list, convert it to a float, and check if it is greater than -23.4. If it is, include it in the new list.\n\n5. **Format the Result**: The result should be formatted as a list of strings, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string to a float and compare it to -23.4:\n  - '-89.0955' as a float is -89.0955, which is not greater than -23.4.\n  - '-3.23' as a float is -3.23, which is greater than -23.4.\n  - '-18.6' as a float is -18.6, which is greater than -23.4.\n  - '-68.170' as a float is -68.170, which is not greater than -23.4.\n  - '66.11' as a float is 66.11, which is greater than -23.4.\n  - '-12' as a float is -12.0, which is greater than -23.4.\n  - '-93.161' as a float is -93.161, which is not greater than -23.4.\n\n- The numbers that are greater than -23.4 are: '-3.23', '-18.6', '66.11', and '-12'.\n\n- Format the result as a list of strings: `['-3.23', '-18.6', '66.11', '-12']`.\n\n- Enclose the result within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['-3.23', '-18.6', '66.11', '-12']>>>"
