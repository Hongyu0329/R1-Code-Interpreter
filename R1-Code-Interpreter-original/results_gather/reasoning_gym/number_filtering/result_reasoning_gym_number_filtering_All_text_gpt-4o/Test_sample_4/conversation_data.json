    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are smaller than 88.53. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-88', '91.85', '75', '0.5', '-50.471', '-27.10', '8.5550', '-18.430']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with 88.53, we need to convert them from strings to numbers (specifically, floating-point numbers).\n\n3. **Comparison**: We will compare each number to 88.53 and determine if it is smaller.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will create a new list containing only the numbers that are smaller than 88.53.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list contains numbers as strings, we will convert the filtered numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the new list in the specified format enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string to a float and compare it to 88.53:\n  - `-88` (float: -88.0) is smaller than 88.53.\n  - `91.85` (float: 91.85) is not smaller than 88.53.\n  - `75` (float: 75.0) is smaller than 88.53.\n  - `0.5` (float: 0.5) is smaller than 88.53.\n  - `-50.471` (float: -50.471) is smaller than 88.53.\n  - `-27.10` (float: -27.10) is smaller than 88.53.\n  - `8.5550` (float: 8.555) is smaller than 88.53.\n  - `-18.430` (float: -18.43) is smaller than 88.53.\n\n- Filtered list of numbers smaller than 88.53: `['-88', '75', '0.5', '-50.471', '-27.10', '8.5550', '-18.430']`.\n\n- Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['-88', '75', '0.5', '-50.471', '-27.10', '8.5550', '-18.430']>>>"
