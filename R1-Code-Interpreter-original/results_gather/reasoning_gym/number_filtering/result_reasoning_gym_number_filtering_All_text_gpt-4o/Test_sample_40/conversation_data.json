    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers larger than -19.90 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['56.4', '-31.2032', '23.96', '47.9205']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with -19.90, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number with -19.90 and determine if it is larger. If a number is larger than -19.90, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: After filtering out the numbers larger than -19.90, we will create a new list with the remaining numbers.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list contains numbers as strings, the final list should also contain numbers as strings.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the new list>>>.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '56.4' -> 56.4\n  - '-31.2032' -> -31.2032\n  - '23.96' -> 23.96\n  - '47.9205' -> 47.9205\n\n- Compare each number with -19.90:\n  - 56.4 is larger than -19.90, so it should be removed.\n  - -31.2032 is not larger than -19.90, so it should remain.\n  - 23.96 is larger than -19.90, so it should be removed.\n  - 47.9205 is larger than -19.90, so it should be removed.\n\n- The remaining number after filtering is -31.2032.\n\n- Convert the remaining number back to a string: '-31.2032'.\n\n- Format the output list: <<<['-31.2032']>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['-31.2032']>>>"
