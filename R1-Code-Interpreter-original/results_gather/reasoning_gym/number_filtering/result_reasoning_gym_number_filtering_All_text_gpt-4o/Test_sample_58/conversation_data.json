    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those numbers that are larger than -0.9340. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to keep all numbers in the list that are larger than -0.9340.\n\n2. **Identify the List**: The given list is:\n   - ['42.719', '31.8960', '-38.04', '60.9952', '77.67', '-47.05']\n\n3. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform the comparison.\n\n4. **Comparison**: We will compare each number to -0.9340 and keep those that are larger.\n\n5. **Filter the List**: Go through each number in the list:\n   - '42.719' -> 42.719 (larger than -0.9340, keep it)\n   - '31.8960' -> 31.896 (larger than -0.9340, keep it)\n   - '-38.04' -> -38.04 (not larger than -0.9340, discard it)\n   - '60.9952' -> 60.9952 (larger than -0.9340, keep it)\n   - '77.67' -> 77.67 (larger than -0.9340, keep it)\n   - '-47.05' -> -47.05 (not larger than -0.9340, discard it)\n\n6. **Create the New List**: After filtering, the new list of numbers that are larger than -0.9340 is:\n   - ['42.719', '31.8960', '60.9952', '77.67']\n\n7. **Format the Output**: The final step is to format the new list within triple angle brackets as requested.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['42.719', '31.8960', '60.9952', '77.67']>>>"
