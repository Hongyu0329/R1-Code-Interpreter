    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the list and remove any numbers that are larger than 18.236. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The list provided is `['-42.8', '91.88', '34']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with 18.236, we need to convert them from strings to numbers (specifically, floating-point numbers).\n\n3. **Comparison**: We will compare each number to 18.236 and determine if it should be removed or retained in the list.\n\n4. **Remove Numbers Greater than 18.236**:\n   - Convert `'-42.8'` to `-42.8`. Since `-42.8` is less than 18.236, it should be retained.\n   - Convert `'91.88'` to `91.88`. Since `91.88` is greater than 18.236, it should be removed.\n   - Convert `'34'` to `34.0`. Since `34.0` is greater than 18.236, it should be removed.\n\n5. **Construct the New List**: After removing numbers greater than 18.236, the new list will only contain the numbers that are less than or equal to 18.236.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final list should be returned in the same format as the input, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nFollowing these steps, the new list will only contain `'-42.8'`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['-42.8']>>>"
