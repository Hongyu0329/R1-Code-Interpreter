    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are larger than -33.31. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The list provided is `['43', '76.088', '45.655', '-61', '-40.1']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: We need to convert these strings into numerical values to compare them with -33.31. The conversion will be as follows:\n   - '43' becomes 43\n   - '76.088' becomes 76.088\n   - '45.655' becomes 45.655\n   - '-61' becomes -61\n   - '-40.1' becomes -40.1\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number with -33.31 and keep only those numbers that are larger than -33.31.\n   - 43 is greater than -33.31\n   - 76.088 is greater than -33.31\n   - 45.655 is greater than -33.31\n   - -61 is not greater than -33.31\n   - -40.1 is not greater than -33.31\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Based on the comparison, we filter out the numbers that are not greater than -33.31. The numbers that remain are 43, 76.088, and 45.655.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list was in string format, we need to convert the filtered numbers back to strings:\n   - 43 becomes '43'\n   - 76.088 becomes '76.088'\n   - 45.655 becomes '45.655'\n\n6. **Create the New List**: The new list, after filtering and converting back to strings, is `['43', '76.088', '45.655']`.\n\n7. **Format the Output**: Finally, we need to enclose the new list within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['43', '76.088', '45.655']>>>"
