    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given list of numbers and filter out those that are smaller than -47.60. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The given list is `['-63.7', '-20.0', '12', '43.1867', '-33.793', '62']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (specifically, floats) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison Criterion**: We are tasked with keeping only those numbers that are smaller than -47.60.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Go through each number in the list, convert it to a float, and check if it is smaller than -47.60. If it is, include it in the new list.\n\n5. **Reformat the List**: The final list should be in the same format as the original, meaning the numbers should be strings.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert `'-63.7'` to `-63.7` (float). Since `-63.7` is smaller than `-47.60`, include it in the new list.\n- Convert `'-20.0'` to `-20.0` (float). Since `-20.0` is not smaller than `-47.60`, do not include it.\n- Convert `'12'` to `12.0` (float). Since `12.0` is not smaller than `-47.60`, do not include it.\n- Convert `'43.1867'` to `43.1867` (float). Since `43.1867` is not smaller than `-47.60`, do not include it.\n- Convert `'-33.793'` to `-33.793` (float). Since `-33.793` is not smaller than `-47.60`, do not include it.\n- Convert `'62'` to `62.0` (float). Since `62.0` is not smaller than `-47.60`, do not include it.\n\nAfter filtering, the only number that meets the criterion is `-63.7`.\n\n6. **Format the Result**: Convert the number back to a string and enclose the list within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['-63.7']>>>"
