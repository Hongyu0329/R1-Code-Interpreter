    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are smaller than 9.87. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-62.2704', '34.189', '-81.8', '-55.37', '44.58', '48']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with 9.87, we need to convert them from strings to numbers (specifically, floating-point numbers).\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number with 9.87 and keep only those numbers that are smaller than 9.87.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: As we identify numbers smaller than 9.87, we will add them to a new list.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: Finally, we need to return the new list in the specified format, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's go through each element in the list:\n\n- `'-62.2704'`: Convert to float, which is -62.2704. Since -62.2704 is less than 9.87, we keep it.\n- `'34.189'`: Convert to float, which is 34.189. Since 34.189 is greater than 9.87, we do not keep it.\n- `'-81.8'`: Convert to float, which is -81.8. Since -81.8 is less than 9.87, we keep it.\n- `'-55.37'`: Convert to float, which is -55.37. Since -55.37 is less than 9.87, we keep it.\n- `'44.58'`: Convert to float, which is 44.58. Since 44.58 is greater than 9.87, we do not keep it.\n- `'48'`: Convert to float, which is 48. Since 48 is greater than 9.87, we do not keep it.\n\nAfter filtering, the new list of numbers smaller than 9.87 is `['-62.2704', '-81.8', '-55.37']`.\n\nNow, we format the output as specified:\n\n<<<['-62.2704', '-81.8', '-55.37']>>>"
