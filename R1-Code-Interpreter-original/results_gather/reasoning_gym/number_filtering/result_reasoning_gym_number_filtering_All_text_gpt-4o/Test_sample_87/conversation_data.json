    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers larger than -45.7015 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-64.0362', '33.0677', '51', '-84.140', '26.1', '98.11', '88.14']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with -45.7015, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number with -45.7015 and determine if it is larger. If a number is larger, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: Construct a new list that only includes numbers that are not larger than -45.7015.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The final list should be formatted in the same way as the input, with each number as a string, and enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's go through the list and apply these steps:\n\n- Convert `'-64.0362'` to `-64.0362`. Since `-64.0362` is not larger than `-45.7015`, it remains in the list.\n- Convert `'33.0677'` to `33.0677`. Since `33.0677` is larger than `-45.7015`, it is removed from the list.\n- Convert `'51'` to `51.0`. Since `51.0` is larger than `-45.7015`, it is removed from the list.\n- Convert `'-84.140'` to `-84.140`. Since `-84.140` is not larger than `-45.7015`, it remains in the list.\n- Convert `'26.1'` to `26.1`. Since `26.1` is larger than `-45.7015`, it is removed from the list.\n- Convert `'98.11'` to `98.11`. Since `98.11` is larger than `-45.7015`, it is removed from the list.\n- Convert `'88.14'` to `88.14`. Since `88.14` is larger than `-45.7015`, it is removed from the list.\n\nAfter filtering, the new list contains only the numbers `-64.0362` and `-84.140`.\n\n6. **Convert Back to Strings**: Convert the numbers back to their string representations to match the format of the original list.\n\n7. **Format the Final Output**: Enclose the new list within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final list is:\n\n<<<['-64.0362', '-84.140']>>>"
