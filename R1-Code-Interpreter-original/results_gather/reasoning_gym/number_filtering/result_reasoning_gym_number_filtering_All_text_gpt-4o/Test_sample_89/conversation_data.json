    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers from the given list that are larger than -38.932. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: \n   - We have a list of strings representing numbers: `['-56.370', '25.1', '22.8962', '-64.54']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**:\n   - Convert each string in the list to a floating-point number for comparison purposes.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - We need to compare each number to -38.932 and determine if it is larger.\n   - If a number is larger than -38.932, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Filter the List**:\n   - Go through each number in the list:\n     - `-56.370`: Convert to float, which is -56.370. This is not larger than -38.932, so it remains in the list.\n     - `25.1`: Convert to float, which is 25.1. This is larger than -38.932, so it should be removed.\n     - `22.8962`: Convert to float, which is 22.8962. This is larger than -38.932, so it should be removed.\n     - `-64.54`: Convert to float, which is -64.54. This is not larger than -38.932, so it remains in the list.\n\n5. **Create the New List**:\n   - After filtering, the numbers that remain are `-56.370` and `-64.54`.\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the remaining numbers back to strings to match the original format.\n   - Enclose the new list within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final filtered list, in the required format, is:\n\n<<<['-56.370', '-64.54']>>>"
