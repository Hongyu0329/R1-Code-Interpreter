    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those numbers that are smaller than -45.173. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to identify numbers in the list that are smaller than -45.173.\n\n2. **Identify the List**: The given list is:\n   ```\n   ['-96.6473', '64', '90.66', '60.9', '61.943', '-27.213', '48.07', '38.041', '-44.375', '29.7']\n   ```\n\n3. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (floats) to perform the comparison.\n\n4. **Comparison**: For each number in the list, compare it with -45.173 to check if it is smaller.\n\n5. **Filter the List**: Keep only those numbers that are smaller than -45.173.\n\n6. **Reformat the List**: Convert the filtered numbers back to strings to match the original format.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Return the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float.\n- Compare each float with -45.173.\n- The numbers in the list that are smaller than -45.173 are:\n  - '-96.6473' (which is -96.6473 as a float)\n\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\n- The new list, containing only numbers smaller than -45.173, is:\n  ```\n  ['-96.6473']\n  ```\n\nFinally, we present the result in the required format:\n\n<<<['-96.6473']>>>"
