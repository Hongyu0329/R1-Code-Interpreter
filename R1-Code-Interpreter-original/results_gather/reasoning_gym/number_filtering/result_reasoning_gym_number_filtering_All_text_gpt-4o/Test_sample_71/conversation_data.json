    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are smaller than 41.6152. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['86.8', '37.8170', '47.829', '-7.77', '74', '-2.2', '-56', '-91', '38.2912', '4.7']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with 41.6152, we need to convert them from strings to numbers (either integers or floats).\n\n3. **Comparison**: We will compare each number with 41.6152 and keep only those numbers that are smaller.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: We will create a new list containing only the numbers that meet the condition.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list contains numbers as strings, we will convert the filtered numbers back to strings to maintain the same format.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Finally, we will output the new list in the specified format enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string to a float for comparison.\n- Compare each number with 41.6152.\n- Keep numbers that are smaller than 41.6152.\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n\nNow, let's filter the list:\n\n- '86.8' (86.8) is not smaller than 41.6152.\n- '37.8170' (37.817) is smaller than 41.6152.\n- '47.829' (47.829) is not smaller than 41.6152.\n- '-7.77' (-7.77) is smaller than 41.6152.\n- '74' (74) is not smaller than 41.6152.\n- '-2.2' (-2.2) is smaller than 41.6152.\n- '-56' (-56) is smaller than 41.6152.\n- '-91' (-91) is smaller than 41.6152.\n- '38.2912' (38.2912) is smaller than 41.6152.\n- '4.7' (4.7) is smaller than 41.6152.\n\nThe numbers that are smaller than 41.6152 are: '37.8170', '-7.77', '-2.2', '-56', '-91', '38.2912', '4.7'.\n\nTherefore, the new list is:\n\n<<<['37.8170', '-7.77', '-2.2', '-56', '-91', '38.2912', '4.7']>>>"
