    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers smaller than 58.867 from the given list. Let's break down the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Input List**: The list provided is `['-37.067', '85', '64', '40', '-66.72', '-82.61', '-28.6', '1']`. All elements in this list are strings representing numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these string representations of numbers with 58.867, we need to convert them to a numerical format. We can convert them to either integers or floating-point numbers. Since the threshold 58.867 is a floating-point number, it's best to convert all elements to floats for accurate comparison.\n\n3. **Comparison**: Once converted, we compare each number to 58.867. If a number is greater than or equal to 58.867, it should be retained in the list. Otherwise, it should be removed.\n\n4. **Construct the New List**: After filtering, we construct a new list containing only the numbers that meet the criteria.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list consists of strings, we should convert the numbers in the new list back to strings to maintain the same format.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Finally, we output the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '-37.067' -> -37.067\n  - '85' -> 85.0\n  - '64' -> 64.0\n  - '40' -> 40.0\n  - '-66.72' -> -66.72\n  - '-82.61' -> -82.61\n  - '-28.6' -> -28.6\n  - '1' -> 1.0\n\n- Compare each number with 58.867:\n  - -37.067 < 58.867 (remove)\n  - 85.0 >= 58.867 (keep)\n  - 64.0 >= 58.867 (keep)\n  - 40.0 < 58.867 (remove)\n  - -66.72 < 58.867 (remove)\n  - -82.61 < 58.867 (remove)\n  - -28.6 < 58.867 (remove)\n  - 1.0 < 58.867 (remove)\n\n- Construct the new list with numbers that are >= 58.867:\n  - [85.0, 64.0]\n\n- Convert the numbers back to strings:\n  - '85.0', '64.0'\n\n- Output the result in the specified format:\n  - <<<['85', '64']>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['85', '64']>>>"
