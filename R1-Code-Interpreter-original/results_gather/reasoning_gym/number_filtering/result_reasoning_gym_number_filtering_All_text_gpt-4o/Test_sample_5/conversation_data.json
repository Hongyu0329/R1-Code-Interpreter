    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers smaller than 20.86 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of strings representing numbers: `['87.0627', '-92.91', '-12', '96.502']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison with 20.86**: We need to compare each number with 20.86 and determine if it is smaller. If a number is smaller than 20.86, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: Construct a new list that only includes numbers that are greater than or equal to 20.86.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Once we have the filtered list of numbers, convert them back to strings to match the original format.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '87.0627' becomes 87.0627\n  - '-92.91' becomes -92.91\n  - '-12' becomes -12.0\n  - '96.502' becomes 96.502\n\n- Compare each number with 20.86:\n  - 87.0627 is greater than 20.86, so it remains in the list.\n  - -92.91 is less than 20.86, so it is removed.\n  - -12.0 is less than 20.86, so it is removed.\n  - 96.502 is greater than 20.86, so it remains in the list.\n\n- The new list of numbers is [87.0627, 96.502].\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings:\n  - 87.0627 becomes '87.0627'\n  - 96.502 becomes '96.502'\n\n- The final list of strings is ['87.0627', '96.502'].\n\nTherefore, the new list, enclosed within triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<['87.0627', '96.502']>>>"
