    "To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps to ensure that we correctly filter the list according to the given criteria. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: We have a list of strings that represent numbers. The list is:\n   ```\n   ['-23.8495', '-64.2', '-73', '-49.770', '6.1625', '-82.0327', '-2.145', '44.4451', '-56.66']\n   ```\n\n2. **Conversion to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numerical values (floats) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Identify the Condition**: We need to remove all numbers larger than 22.0. This means we will keep numbers that are less than or equal to 22.0.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: After converting the strings to floats, we will iterate through the list and check each number against the condition (less than or equal to 22.0). If a number satisfies the condition, it will be included in the new list.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Once we have filtered the numbers, we need to convert them back to strings to match the format of the original list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the new list in the specified format, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float.\n- Check each float to see if it is less than or equal to 22.0.\n- If it is, convert it back to a string and include it in the new list.\n- Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nApplying these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert to floats: `[-23.8495, -64.2, -73, -49.770, 6.1625, -82.0327, -2.145, 44.4451, -56.66]`\n- Filter based on the condition (<= 22.0): `[-23.8495, -64.2, -73, -49.770, 6.1625, -82.0327, -2.145, -56.66]`\n- Convert back to strings: `['-23.8495', '-64.2', '-73', '-49.770', '6.1625', '-82.0327', '-2.145', '-56.66']`\n\nThe final list, in the required format, is:\n\n<<<['-23.8495', '-64.2', '-73', '-49.770', '6.1625', '-82.0327', '-2.145', '-56.66']>>>"
