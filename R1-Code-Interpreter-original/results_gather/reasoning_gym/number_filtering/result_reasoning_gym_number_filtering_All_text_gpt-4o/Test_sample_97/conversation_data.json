    "To solve the problem of removing all numbers larger than 39.4 from the given list, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of strings representing numbers. The list is: `['-90.765', '26.17', '73.1', '-77.6256', '-69.37', '13.2', '-3.7093']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Identify the Threshold**: The threshold given is 39.4. We need to remove any number from the list that is greater than this threshold.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Iterate through the list, convert each string to a float, and check if it is greater than 39.4. If it is not greater, keep it in the list; otherwise, remove it.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, convert the remaining numbers back to strings to maintain the original format of the list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Format the final list of strings within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - `'-90.765'` -> `-90.765`\n  - `'26.17'` -> `26.17`\n  - `'73.1'` -> `73.1`\n  - `'-77.6256'` -> `-77.6256`\n  - `'-69.37'` -> `-69.37`\n  - `'13.2'` -> `13.2`\n  - `'-3.7093'` -> `-3.7093`\n\n- Compare each number to 39.4 and filter:\n  - `-90.765` is not greater than 39.4, keep it.\n  - `26.17` is not greater than 39.4, keep it.\n  - `73.1` is greater than 39.4, remove it.\n  - `-77.6256` is not greater than 39.4, keep it.\n  - `-69.37` is not greater than 39.4, keep it.\n  - `13.2` is not greater than 39.4, keep it.\n  - `-3.7093` is not greater than 39.4, keep it.\n\n- The filtered list of numbers is: `[-90.765, 26.17, -77.6256, -69.37, 13.2, -3.7093]`.\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings:\n  - `-90.765` -> `'-90.765'`\n  - `26.17` -> `'26.17'`\n  - `-77.6256` -> `'-77.6256'`\n  - `-69.37` -> `'-69.37'`\n  - `13.2` -> `'13.2'`\n  - `-3.7093` -> `'-3.7093'`\n\n- The final list of strings is: `['-90.765', '26.17', '-77.6256', '-69.37', '13.2', '-3.7093']`.\n\nTherefore, the new list is:\n\n<<<['-90.765', '26.17', '-77.6256', '-69.37', '13.2', '-3.7093']>>>"
