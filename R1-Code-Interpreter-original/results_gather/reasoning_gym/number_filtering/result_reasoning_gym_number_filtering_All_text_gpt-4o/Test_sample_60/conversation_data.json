    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers smaller than 9.3 from the given list. Let's break down the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Input List**: The list provided is `['3.2380', '11.6281', '-47', '14.055', '-68', '14.52', '-88', '28.4', '72.5']`. This list contains strings that represent both positive and negative numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (either integers or floats) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Identify the Threshold**: The threshold given is 9.3. We need to remove any number that is less than this threshold.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Iterate through the list, convert each string to a number, and check if it is greater than or equal to 9.3. If it is, keep it in the list; otherwise, remove it.\n\n5. **Maintain Original Format**: After filtering, convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format of the list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string to a number:\n  - '3.2380' -> 3.2380\n  - '11.6281' -> 11.6281\n  - '-47' -> -47\n  - '14.055' -> 14.055\n  - '-68' -> -68\n  - '14.52' -> 14.52\n  - '-88' -> -88\n  - '28.4' -> 28.4\n  - '72.5' -> 72.5\n\n- Compare each number to 9.3 and filter:\n  - 3.2380 < 9.3 (remove)\n  - 11.6281 >= 9.3 (keep)\n  - -47 < 9.3 (remove)\n  - 14.055 >= 9.3 (keep)\n  - -68 < 9.3 (remove)\n  - 14.52 >= 9.3 (keep)\n  - -88 < 9.3 (remove)\n  - 28.4 >= 9.3 (keep)\n  - 72.5 >= 9.3 (keep)\n\n- The filtered list of numbers is: [11.6281, 14.055, 14.52, 28.4, 72.5]\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings to match the original format:\n  - 11.6281 -> '11.6281'\n  - 14.055 -> '14.055'\n  - 14.52 -> '14.52'\n  - 28.4 -> '28.4'\n  - 72.5 -> '72.5'\n\n- The final list in string format is: ['11.6281', '14.055', '14.52', '28.4', '72.5']\n\nNow, we can present the final answer:\n\n<<<['11.6281', '14.055', '14.52', '28.4', '72.5']>>>"
