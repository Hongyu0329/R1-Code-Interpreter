    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers larger than -59.4 from the given list. Let's break down the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list contains string representations of numbers. We need to convert these strings to actual numbers (floats) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n2. **Identify the Threshold**: The threshold given is -59.4. We need to remove any number that is larger than this threshold.\n\n3. **Iterate and Compare**: For each number in the list:\n   - Convert the string to a float.\n   - Compare the float with -59.4.\n   - If the number is larger than -59.4, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Construct the New List**: After filtering out the numbers larger than -59.4, we need to construct a new list with the remaining numbers.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Start with the list: `['88.1608', '-77.8045', '-51.327', '-46.90', '-12.3748', '-27.7493', '30', '-91.643', '-78.79', '-88.9049']`.\n\n- Convert each string to a float and compare with -59.4:\n  - '88.1608' -> 88.1608 (remove, as 88.1608 > -59.4)\n  - '-77.8045' -> -77.8045 (keep, as -77.8045 < -59.4)\n  - '-51.327' -> -51.327 (remove, as -51.327 > -59.4)\n  - '-46.90' -> -46.90 (remove, as -46.90 > -59.4)\n  - '-12.3748' -> -12.3748 (remove, as -12.3748 > -59.4)\n  - '-27.7493' -> -27.7493 (remove, as -27.7493 > -59.4)\n  - '30' -> 30.0 (remove, as 30.0 > -59.4)\n  - '-91.643' -> -91.643 (keep, as -91.643 < -59.4)\n  - '-78.79' -> -78.79 (keep, as -78.79 < -59.4)\n  - '-88.9049' -> -88.9049 (keep, as -88.9049 < -59.4)\n\n- The numbers that remain after filtering are: `-77.8045`, `-91.643`, `-78.79`, `-88.9049`.\n\n- Format the final list with triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['-77.8045', '-91.643', '-78.79', '-88.9049']>>>"
