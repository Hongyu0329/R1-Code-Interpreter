    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given list of numbers and filter out those that are smaller than -75.911. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-26.4496', '-96.1378', '-35.756']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these numbers with -75.911, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number in the list to -75.911 and determine if it is smaller.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Only include numbers that are smaller than -75.911 in the new list.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The final list should be formatted in the same way as the input list, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Step 1**: Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '-26.4496' becomes -26.4496\n  - '-96.1378' becomes -96.1378\n  - '-35.756' becomes -35.756\n\n- **Step 2**: Compare each number to -75.911:\n  - -26.4496 is not smaller than -75.911\n  - -96.1378 is smaller than -75.911\n  - -35.756 is not smaller than -75.911\n\n- **Step 3**: Filter the list to include only numbers smaller than -75.911:\n  - The only number that meets this criterion is -96.1378.\n\n- **Step 4**: Format the output list:\n  - The new list, containing only the number -96.1378, should be formatted as a list of strings, just like the input.\n\nTherefore, the final list is `['-96.1378']`.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<['-96.1378']>>>"
