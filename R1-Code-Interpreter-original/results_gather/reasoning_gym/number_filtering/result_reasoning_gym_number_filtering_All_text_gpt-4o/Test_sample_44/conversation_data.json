    "To solve this problem, we need to identify and list all the numbers from the given list that are smaller than -37.8206. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to filter out numbers that are smaller than -37.8206 from the provided list of strings representing numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: The list contains numbers in string format. We need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison**: For each number in the list, compare it with -37.8206 to check if it is smaller.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: If a number is smaller than -37.8206, it should be included in the new list.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The final list should be formatted in the same way as the input, i.e., as a list of strings enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert each string to a float and compare it with -37.8206:\n  - '-7.348' converts to -7.348, which is not smaller than -37.8206.\n  - '-59.99' converts to -59.99, which is smaller than -37.8206.\n  - '-89.4' converts to -89.4, which is smaller than -37.8206.\n  - '-43.674' converts to -43.674, which is smaller than -37.8206.\n  - '-2' converts to -2, which is not smaller than -37.8206.\n  - '-33.07' converts to -33.07, which is not smaller than -37.8206.\n  - '-54.5153' converts to -54.5153, which is smaller than -37.8206.\n  - '-87.918' converts to -87.918, which is smaller than -37.8206.\n\n- Collect the numbers that are smaller than -37.8206:\n  - '-59.99'\n  - '-89.4'\n  - '-43.674'\n  - '-54.5153'\n  - '-87.918'\n\n- Format the result as a list of strings enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['-59.99', '-89.4', '-43.674', '-54.5153', '-87.918']>>>"
