    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers smaller than -25 from the given list. Let's break down the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of strings representing numbers: `['85.3', '-39.4', '-1', '-79.9529']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Identify the Condition**: We need to remove numbers that are smaller than -25. This means we will keep numbers that are greater than or equal to -25.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Iterate through the list, convert each string to a float, and check if it is greater than or equal to -25. If it is, include it in the new list.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format of the list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Format the resulting list of strings within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '85.3' becomes 85.3\n  - '-39.4' becomes -39.4\n  - '-1' becomes -1.0\n  - '-79.9529' becomes -79.9529\n\n- Apply the condition (keep numbers >= -25):\n  - 85.3 is greater than -25, so keep it.\n  - -39.4 is less than -25, so remove it.\n  - -1.0 is greater than -25, so keep it.\n  - -79.9529 is less than -25, so remove it.\n\n- The filtered list of numbers is: [85.3, -1.0]\n\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings:\n  - 85.3 becomes '85.3'\n  - -1.0 becomes '-1'\n\n- The final list of strings is: ['85.3', '-1']\n\n- Format the result within triple angle brackets: <<<['85.3', '-1']>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['85.3', '-1']>>>"
