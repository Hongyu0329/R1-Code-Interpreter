    "To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps to filter the list based on the given condition. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to remove all numbers smaller than 56.3 from the given list. The list contains string representations of numbers, both positive and negative.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list elements are strings, we need to convert them to numbers (floats) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Filter the List**: After conversion, we will filter out numbers that are smaller than 56.3.\n\n4. **Convert Back to Strings**: Once we have the filtered list of numbers, we need to convert them back to strings to match the original format.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Step 1**: Convert each string in the list to a float.\n  - '58.9297' -> 58.9297\n  - '-50.447' -> -50.447\n  - '42.7027' -> 42.7027\n  - '37.7693' -> 37.7693\n  - '-16.65' -> -16.65\n  - '49' -> 49.0\n  - '63' -> 63.0\n  - '-70' -> -70.0\n  - '5.731' -> 5.731\n\n- **Step 2**: Filter out numbers smaller than 56.3.\n  - 58.9297 (keep, as it is greater than 56.3)\n  - -50.447 (remove, as it is less than 56.3)\n  - 42.7027 (remove, as it is less than 56.3)\n  - 37.7693 (remove, as it is less than 56.3)\n  - -16.65 (remove, as it is less than 56.3)\n  - 49.0 (remove, as it is less than 56.3)\n  - 63.0 (keep, as it is greater than 56.3)\n  - -70.0 (remove, as it is less than 56.3)\n  - 5.731 (remove, as it is less than 56.3)\n\n- **Step 3**: Convert the remaining numbers back to strings.\n  - 58.9297 -> '58.9297'\n  - 63.0 -> '63'\n\n- **Step 4**: Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nThe final filtered list is: ['58.9297', '63']\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<['58.9297', '63']>>>"
