    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are smaller than 66.23. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['84.23', '-1.216', '-16.6', '25.946', '11.8', '34.086']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with 66.23, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We will compare each number with 66.23 and keep only those numbers that are smaller.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: We will create a new list that contains only the numbers that are smaller than 66.23.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list contains numbers as strings, we will convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Finally, we will format the output as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float and compare it with 66.23.\n- The numbers in the list are: 84.23, -1.216, -16.6, 25.946, 11.8, and 34.086.\n- Compare each number:\n  - 84.23 is not less than 66.23.\n  - -1.216 is less than 66.23.\n  - -16.6 is less than 66.23.\n  - 25.946 is less than 66.23.\n  - 11.8 is less than 66.23.\n  - 34.086 is less than 66.23.\n- The numbers that are less than 66.23 are: -1.216, -16.6, 25.946, 11.8, and 34.086.\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings to match the original format.\n\n- The new list of strings is: `['-1.216', '-16.6', '25.946', '11.8', '34.086']`.\n\n- Format the output as specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['-1.216', '-16.6', '25.946', '11.8', '34.086']>>>"
