    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of strings representing numbers and keep only those numbers that are larger than -90. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The list provided is `['-95.00', '-51.0', '47.2942', '-82.612']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (specifically, floating-point numbers) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number to -90 and determine if it is larger than -90.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Based on the comparison, we will filter out the numbers that are larger than -90.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to their original string format to maintain the format of the original list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the new list in the specified format enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '-95.00' becomes -95.0\n  - '-51.0' becomes -51.0\n  - '47.2942' becomes 47.2942\n  - '-82.612' becomes -82.612\n\n- Compare each number to -90:\n  - -95.0 is not larger than -90\n  - -51.0 is larger than -90\n  - 47.2942 is larger than -90\n  - -82.612 is larger than -90\n\n- Filter the list to keep only numbers larger than -90:\n  - Keep '-51.0'\n  - Keep '47.2942'\n  - Keep '-82.612'\n\n- The filtered list of strings is `['-51.0', '47.2942', '-82.612']`.\n\n- Return the result in the specified format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['-51.0', '47.2942', '-82.612']>>>"
