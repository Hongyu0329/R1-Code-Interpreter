    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are larger than 70.1. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The original list of numbers is given as strings: `['23.962', '-3.50', '91.391', '100', '-49.9769', '-93.05']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the numbers are in string format, we need to convert them to a numerical format (float) to perform the comparison.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number to 70.1 and determine if it is larger.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Only keep the numbers that are larger than 70.1.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, convert the numbers back to string format to match the original list format.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Format the resulting list within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '23.962' -> 23.962\n  - '-3.50' -> -3.50\n  - '91.391' -> 91.391\n  - '100' -> 100.0\n  - '-49.9769' -> -49.9769\n  - '-93.05' -> -93.05\n\n- Compare each number to 70.1:\n  - 23.962 is not larger than 70.1\n  - -3.50 is not larger than 70.1\n  - 91.391 is larger than 70.1\n  - 100.0 is larger than 70.1\n  - -49.9769 is not larger than 70.1\n  - -93.05 is not larger than 70.1\n\n- Filter the list to keep only numbers larger than 70.1:\n  - 91.391\n  - 100.0\n\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings:\n  - 91.391 -> '91.391'\n  - 100.0 -> '100'\n\n- Format the result within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final filtered list is: <<<['91.391', '100']>>>"
