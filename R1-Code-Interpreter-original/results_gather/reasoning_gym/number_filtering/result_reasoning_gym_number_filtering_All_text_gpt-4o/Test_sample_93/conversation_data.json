    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are smaller than -34.80. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-55.4935', '-39.8', '-29.7863', '-39', '-84.9', '-6.093']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values numerically, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number to -34.80 and keep only those that are smaller.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: After identifying the numbers that meet the criteria, we will create a new list containing these numbers.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: Finally, we will format the output list in the same way as the input list, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '-55.4935' becomes -55.4935\n  - '-39.8' becomes -39.8\n  - '-29.7863' becomes -29.7863\n  - '-39' becomes -39.0\n  - '-84.9' becomes -84.9\n  - '-6.093' becomes -6.093\n\n- Compare each number to -34.80:\n  - -55.4935 is smaller than -34.80\n  - -39.8 is smaller than -34.80\n  - -29.7863 is not smaller than -34.80\n  - -39.0 is smaller than -34.80\n  - -84.9 is smaller than -34.80\n  - -6.093 is not smaller than -34.80\n\n- Create a new list with numbers smaller than -34.80:\n  - The numbers that are smaller are: -55.4935, -39.8, -39.0, and -84.9\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings to match the format of the input list:\n  - -55.4935 becomes '-55.4935'\n  - -39.8 becomes '-39.8'\n  - -39.0 becomes '-39'\n  - -84.9 becomes '-84.9'\n\n- Format the output list:\n  - The new list is `['-55.4935', '-39.8', '-39', '-84.9']`\n\nNow, we can present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<['-55.4935', '-39.8', '-39', '-84.9']>>>"
