    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of strings representing numbers and keep only those numbers that are larger than -29.2. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: We have a list of strings, each representing a number. The list is: `['-76.781', '94.419', '-46.6300', '-14.1067']`.\n\n2. **Conversion to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number to -29.2 and determine if it is larger.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will create a new list that includes only those numbers that are larger than -29.2.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: The final list should be formatted in the same way as the input, with each number as a string, and enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '-76.781' becomes -76.781\n  - '94.419' becomes 94.419\n  - '-46.6300' becomes -46.63\n  - '-14.1067' becomes -14.1067\n\n- Compare each number to -29.2:\n  - -76.781 is not larger than -29.2\n  - 94.419 is larger than -29.2\n  - -46.63 is not larger than -29.2\n  - -14.1067 is larger than -29.2\n\n- Filter the list to include only numbers larger than -29.2:\n  - The numbers that satisfy this condition are 94.419 and -14.1067.\n\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings to match the original format:\n  - 94.419 becomes '94.419'\n  - -14.1067 becomes '-14.1067'\n\n- Format the final list with triple angle brackets:\n  - The new list is `['94.419', '-14.1067']`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['94.419', '-14.1067']>>>"
