    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are larger than -14.5. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: We have a list of strings representing numbers: `['-42.2311', '68.942', '-8.309', '10.25', '65.178', '80', '77.083', '-47.192', '25']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Filter the List**: We need to keep only those numbers that are greater than -14.5.\n\n4. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, we convert the numbers back to strings to match the format of the original list.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - `-42.2311` becomes -42.2311\n  - `68.942` becomes 68.942\n  - `-8.309` becomes -8.309\n  - `10.25` becomes 10.25\n  - `65.178` becomes 65.178\n  - `80` becomes 80.0\n  - `77.083` becomes 77.083\n  - `-47.192` becomes -47.192\n  - `25` becomes 25.0\n\n- Filter the numbers that are greater than -14.5:\n  - -42.2311 is not greater than -14.5, so it is excluded.\n  - 68.942 is greater than -14.5, so it is included.\n  - -8.309 is greater than -14.5, so it is included.\n  - 10.25 is greater than -14.5, so it is included.\n  - 65.178 is greater than -14.5, so it is included.\n  - 80.0 is greater than -14.5, so it is included.\n  - 77.083 is greater than -14.5, so it is included.\n  - -47.192 is not greater than -14.5, so it is excluded.\n  - 25.0 is greater than -14.5, so it is included.\n\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings:\n  - 68.942 becomes `'68.942'`\n  - -8.309 becomes `'-8.309'`\n  - 10.25 becomes `'10.25'`\n  - 65.178 becomes `'65.178'`\n  - 80.0 becomes `'80'`\n  - 77.083 becomes `'77.083'`\n  - 25.0 becomes `'25'`\n\n- The final list of strings is: `['68.942', '-8.309', '10.25', '65.178', '80', '77.083', '25']`\n\n- Enclose the list within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['68.942', '-8.309', '10.25', '65.178', '80', '77.083', '25']>>>"
