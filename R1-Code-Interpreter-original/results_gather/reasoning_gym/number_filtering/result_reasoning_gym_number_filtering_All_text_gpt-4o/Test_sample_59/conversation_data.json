    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers smaller than 1.9946 from the given list of strings representing numbers. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of strings, each representing a number. The list is: `['18.1', '-19.550', '68.866', '-6.91']`.\n\n2. **Conversion to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (specifically, floating-point numbers) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number to the threshold value of 1.9946. If a number is greater than or equal to 1.9946, it should be retained in the list. Otherwise, it should be removed.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: Based on the comparison, we will create a new list that only includes numbers that are greater than or equal to 1.9946.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Once we have the filtered list of numbers, we need to convert them back to strings to match the format of the original list.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Finally, we will output the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '18.1' becomes 18.1\n  - '-19.550' becomes -19.55\n  - '68.866' becomes 68.866\n  - '-6.91' becomes -6.91\n\n- Compare each number to 1.9946:\n  - 18.1 is greater than 1.9946, so it is retained.\n  - -19.55 is less than 1.9946, so it is removed.\n  - 68.866 is greater than 1.9946, so it is retained.\n  - -6.91 is less than 1.9946, so it is removed.\n\n- The numbers that are retained are 18.1 and 68.866.\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings:\n  - 18.1 becomes '18.1'\n  - 68.866 becomes '68.866'\n\n- The new list of strings is: `['18.1', '68.866']`.\n\n- Enclose the new list within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['18.1', '68.866']>>>"
