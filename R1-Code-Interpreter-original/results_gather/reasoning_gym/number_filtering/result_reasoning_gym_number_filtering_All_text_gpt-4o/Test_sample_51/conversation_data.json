    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers smaller than -89.886 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is:\n   ```\n   ['68.759', '-82.261', '-93.1', '-62.16', '-83', '-17.87', '-39.7', '-4.9', '64.3', '-91']\n   ```\n   These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Floats**: To compare the numbers, we need to convert these string representations to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Identify the Threshold**: The threshold given is -89.886. We need to remove any number smaller than this threshold.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Go through each number in the list, convert it to a float, and check if it is smaller than -89.886. If it is, remove it from the list.\n\n5. **Reconstruct the List**: After filtering, convert the remaining numbers back to their string representations to match the original format.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Format the final list as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float.\n- Compare each float to -89.886.\n- Remove numbers smaller than -89.886.\n- Convert the remaining numbers back to strings.\n- Format the result.\n\nApplying these steps to the list:\n\n- Convert to floats: [68.759, -82.261, -93.1, -62.16, -83, -17.87, -39.7, -4.9, 64.3, -91]\n- Compare each number to -89.886:\n  - 68.759 > -89.886 (keep)\n  - -82.261 > -89.886 (keep)\n  - -93.1 < -89.886 (remove)\n  - -62.16 > -89.886 (keep)\n  - -83 > -89.886 (keep)\n  - -17.87 > -89.886 (keep)\n  - -39.7 > -89.886 (keep)\n  - -4.9 > -89.886 (keep)\n  - 64.3 > -89.886 (keep)\n  - -91 < -89.886 (remove)\n\n- Remaining numbers: [68.759, -82.261, -62.16, -83, -17.87, -39.7, -4.9, 64.3]\n\n- Convert back to strings: ['68.759', '-82.261', '-62.16', '-83', '-17.87', '-39.7', '-4.9', '64.3']\n\n- Format the result: <<<['68.759', '-82.261', '-62.16', '-83', '-17.87', '-39.7', '-4.9', '64.3']>>>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['68.759', '-82.261', '-62.16', '-83', '-17.87', '-39.7', '-4.9', '64.3']>>>"
