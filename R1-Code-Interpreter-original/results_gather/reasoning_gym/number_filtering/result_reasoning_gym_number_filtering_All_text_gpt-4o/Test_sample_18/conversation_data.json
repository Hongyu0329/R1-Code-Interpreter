    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are smaller than 93.8156. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is:\n   ```\n   ['71.14', '27.5', '38.51', '-82.96', '-55.1214', '-83.0', '-31', '95.94', '-56', '94.48']\n   ```\n   These are string representations of numbers, including both positive and negative values.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with 93.8156, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We will compare each number with 93.8156 and keep only those numbers that are less than 93.8156.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will create a new list containing only the numbers that meet the condition.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list contains numbers as strings, we will convert the filtered numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Finally, we will output the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float and compare it with 93.8156.\n- Keep the numbers that are less than 93.8156.\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n\nNow, let's filter the list:\n\n- '71.14' (71.14 < 93.8156) → Keep\n- '27.5' (27.5 < 93.8156) → Keep\n- '38.51' (38.51 < 93.8156) → Keep\n- '-82.96' (-82.96 < 93.8156) → Keep\n- '-55.1214' (-55.1214 < 93.8156) → Keep\n- '-83.0' (-83.0 < 93.8156) → Keep\n- '-31' (-31 < 93.8156) → Keep\n- '95.94' (95.94 > 93.8156) → Discard\n- '-56' (-56 < 93.8156) → Keep\n- '94.48' (94.48 > 93.8156) → Discard\n\nThe numbers that are smaller than 93.8156 are:\n- '71.14'\n- '27.5'\n- '38.51'\n- '-82.96'\n- '-55.1214'\n- '-83.0'\n- '-31'\n- '-56'\n\nThus, the new list is:\n```\n['71.14', '27.5', '38.51', '-82.96', '-55.1214', '-83.0', '-31', '-56']\n```\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n<<<['71.14', '27.5', '38.51', '-82.96', '-55.1214', '-83.0', '-31', '-56']>>>"
