    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers larger than -71.160 from the given list of strings representing numbers. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of strings, each representing a number. The list is:\n   ```\n   ['-14', '-86.754', '-25.0137', '33.0071', '-31.09', '42.0210', '45.319', '98.0809', '-19.8521']\n   ```\n\n2. **Conversion to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison Criterion**: We need to remove numbers that are larger than -71.160. This means we will keep numbers that are less than or equal to -71.160.\n\n4. **Iterate and Filter**: We will iterate through the list, convert each string to a float, and check if it is less than or equal to -71.160. If it is, we will keep it in the new list.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to match the format of the original list.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Finally, we will output the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string to a float and compare it to -71.160.\n- The numbers in the list are:\n  - '-14' -> -14.0\n  - '-86.754' -> -86.754\n  - '-25.0137' -> -25.0137\n  - '33.0071' -> 33.0071\n  - '-31.09' -> -31.09\n  - '42.0210' -> 42.021\n  - '45.319' -> 45.319\n  - '98.0809' -> 98.0809\n  - '-19.8521' -> -19.8521\n\n- Compare each number to -71.160:\n  - -14.0 is greater than -71.160, so remove it.\n  - -86.754 is less than -71.160, so keep it.\n  - -25.0137 is greater than -71.160, so remove it.\n  - 33.0071 is greater than -71.160, so remove it.\n  - -31.09 is greater than -71.160, so remove it.\n  - 42.021 is greater than -71.160, so remove it.\n  - 45.319 is greater than -71.160, so remove it.\n  - 98.0809 is greater than -71.160, so remove it.\n  - -19.8521 is greater than -71.160, so remove it.\n\n- The only number that meets the criterion is -86.754.\n\n- Convert the remaining number back to a string: '-86.754'.\n\n- Enclose the result in triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['-86.754']>>>"
