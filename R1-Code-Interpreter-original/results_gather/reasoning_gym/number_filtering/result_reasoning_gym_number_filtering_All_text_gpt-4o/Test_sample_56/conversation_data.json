    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are larger than -52.89. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['94.74', '80', '5', '70.496', '-73', '37.6622', '-65.336', '-35.264', '-72.1']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with -52.89, we need to convert them from strings to numbers (either integers or floats).\n\n3. **Comparison**: We will compare each number with -52.89 and determine if it is larger.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will keep only those numbers that are larger than -52.89.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to their original string format to match the format of the input list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string to a float for comparison:\n  - '94.74' -> 94.74\n  - '80' -> 80.0\n  - '5' -> 5.0\n  - '70.496' -> 70.496\n  - '-73' -> -73.0\n  - '37.6622' -> 37.6622\n  - '-65.336' -> -65.336\n  - '-35.264' -> -35.264\n  - '-72.1' -> -72.1\n\n- Compare each number with -52.89:\n  - 94.74 > -52.89 (keep)\n  - 80.0 > -52.89 (keep)\n  - 5.0 > -52.89 (keep)\n  - 70.496 > -52.89 (keep)\n  - -73.0 > -52.89 (discard)\n  - 37.6622 > -52.89 (keep)\n  - -65.336 > -52.89 (discard)\n  - -35.264 > -52.89 (keep)\n  - -72.1 > -52.89 (discard)\n\n- Filtered list of numbers: [94.74, 80.0, 5.0, 70.496, 37.6622, -35.264]\n\n- Convert back to strings: ['94.74', '80', '5', '70.496', '37.6622', '-35.264']\n\n- Return the result in the specified format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['94.74', '80', '5', '70.496', '37.6622', '-35.264']>>>"
