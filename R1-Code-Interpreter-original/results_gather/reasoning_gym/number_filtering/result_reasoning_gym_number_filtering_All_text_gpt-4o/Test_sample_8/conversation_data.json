    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those numbers that are smaller than -63.1164. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to identify numbers in the list that are smaller than -63.1164.\n\n2. **Examine Each Number**: We will compare each number in the list to -63.1164 to determine if it should be included in the new list.\n\n3. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: The numbers in the list are given as strings, so we need to convert them to floating-point numbers for comparison.\n\n4. **Comparison**: For each number, check if it is less than -63.1164.\n\n5. **Create the New List**: Include only those numbers that satisfy the condition (i.e., are smaller than -63.1164).\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Return the new list in the specified format enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert '15.8975' to 15.8975: 15.8975 is not less than -63.1164.\n- Convert '-93.63' to -93.63: -93.63 is less than -63.1164.\n- Convert '32.9' to 32.9: 32.9 is not less than -63.1164.\n- Convert '-74.33' to -74.33: -74.33 is less than -63.1164.\n- Convert '-44.576' to -44.576: -44.576 is not less than -63.1164.\n- Convert '63.7749' to 63.7749: 63.7749 is not less than -63.1164.\n- Convert '79.2' to 79.2: 79.2 is not less than -63.1164.\n- Convert '-88.1' to -88.1: -88.1 is less than -63.1164.\n- Convert '23.916' to 23.916: 23.916 is not less than -63.1164.\n- Convert '70' to 70: 70 is not less than -63.1164.\n\nThe numbers that are smaller than -63.1164 are: -93.63, -74.33, and -88.1.\n\nNow, we format the new list as specified:\n\n<<<['-93.63', '-74.33', '-88.1']>>>"
