    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers larger than -22 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-18.87', '-73', '97.04', '27.60', '25.8210', '42.6258']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with -22, we need to convert them from strings to numbers. We can convert them to floats since they include decimal points.\n\n3. **Comparison with -22**: We need to identify which numbers are larger than -22. A number is larger than -22 if it is greater than -22 when compared numerically.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will create a new list that only includes numbers that are not larger than -22.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list contains numbers as strings, the final list should also contain numbers as strings.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: The final list should be returned in the specified format enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '-18.87' becomes -18.87\n  - '-73' becomes -73.0\n  - '97.04' becomes 97.04\n  - '27.60' becomes 27.60\n  - '25.8210' becomes 25.821\n  - '42.6258' becomes 42.6258\n\n- Compare each number with -22:\n  - -18.87 is larger than -22\n  - -73.0 is not larger than -22\n  - 97.04 is larger than -22\n  - 27.60 is larger than -22\n  - 25.821 is larger than -22\n  - 42.6258 is larger than -22\n\n- Filter the list to include only numbers not larger than -22:\n  - The only number not larger than -22 is -73.0\n\n- Convert the remaining number back to a string:\n  - -73.0 becomes '-73'\n\n- Return the result in the specified format:\n  - The new list is `['-73']`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['-73']>>>"
