    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those numbers that are larger than -39. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Input List**: The input list is `['-46.465', '-47', '-24.1751']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these numbers with -39, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number with -39 and determine if it is larger than -39.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will keep only those numbers that are larger than -39.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, we need to convert the numbers back to their original string format to match the format of the input list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the filtered list in the specified format enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert `'-46.465'` to a float: -46.465. Compare it with -39: -46.465 is not larger than -39, so it is not included in the new list.\n- Convert `'-47'` to a float: -47. Compare it with -39: -47 is not larger than -39, so it is not included in the new list.\n- Convert `'-24.1751'` to a float: -24.1751. Compare it with -39: -24.1751 is larger than -39, so it is included in the new list.\n\nAfter filtering, the only number that remains is `'-24.1751'`.\n\nTherefore, the new list, containing only numbers larger than -39, is `['-24.1751']`.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<['-24.1751']>>>"
